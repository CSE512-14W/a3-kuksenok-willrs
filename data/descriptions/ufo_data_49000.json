["Weird and Strange lightsI recently submitted a report this morning for another incident in NJ, but when I was stationed at Hill AFB UT.  One of the shifts that I worked was 5a-5p and during the 2001-2003 time period as if you were to face north at the Wasatch mountains every night there were lights that appeared on the mountain at the top.  I am not aware of any roads in this area but there is a ski resort on the other side of this mountain but about 30-40 minutes from where thee lights were seen.  There would be lights anywhere from 1-7 and thelights would be present for several minutes turn off, come back on. Sometimes they would stay on for 30 minutes or so.  The distance between the base and this location is about 15 miles and these lights are extremely bright.  I went onto google maps and zoomed into the area where these lights came from, a ridge line, there aren&apos;t any roads.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

Making right turns.My sister, a male friend and I were going down a dirt road near interstate 11 in Jefferson, Ohio in August of 1977. I know it was 1977 because my son was a three months old, and was also in the car. I was looking up at the sky and saw an object that was making right turns and I thought that planes cannot do that. After watching it for a minute, I told my sister to stop the car and we got out. The thing pivoted back and flew right over us. It was not very high in the sky and it had flashing red, blue, and white lights on the corners. It was triangle shaped. We could see a slow moving propeller on the bottom. We could hear a slight hum. It kept zigzagging and headed east. There was a moon that night and we saw it clear as day. I never reported it until I ran across this website and saw a picture if it. I still dream about it thirty years later.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

He says to me hurry up check this out, so I ran up to the porch looked to where he was pointing in the sky, and I saw a huge object way up there hovering,the reason I say huge because of the distance aprox. 30,000 feet up. If you can find a big jet airliner in front of his trail of smoke youve got good eyes wouldnt you say? Anyway I had time to run and get my camera but in a panic I couldnt find it, so I ran back outside my uncle went and got binoculars out of his car to get a closer look at this thing. My neighbors noticed us looking up in amasement, they witnessed the object for several minutes then went to get her digital camera, I am looking at this object with my uncles binoculars let me describe what I saw. I saw no lights, heard no sounds, saw a huge v or triangular object hovering and very slowly moving to the south this was right after a storm had passed.. Four of us witnessed this I was wondering how many other people may have reported this today?", "equilateral triangle shape red and white flashing lightsi went to my window waiting for a contact to reply on msn, and i look out of my window into the sky. i see a light south east in the sky, at first im thinking its just a plane because we do get a couple of planes where i am, but there was something about this plane which kept me looking at it. i started to question if it was moving or not then i realised it was but what was weird was it started of south east, it sort of did a curve south west, north closer to my house and then due east. I got a better look at the object in the sky it was a equalatiral triangle had lights on it, one red one at the front and a several white ones that flashed on and off around the outside (not of the red light but the triangle itself). it was traveling faster than what a usual plane would. I also saw a plane going south as the object was going out of view, and i know that the plane was a plane cause it was a leaner normal plane shape and had a red light at the front and 2 white lights that was always on.", "Incredibly fast object moving across the horizon in a fraction of a second.We are a small video production company in the South of the Spanish owned Island of Tenerife, just off the West Coast of Africa.During filming of a property for a client we obviously wanted to capture some of the views of the Atlantic ocean from the properties balcony.  The cameraman at the time didnt notice anything unusual but when it came to editing I noticed a blip that spoiled a rather nice zoom out from the horizon to the shore.  This blip appeared in just one frame, but when i slowed it down I realised that whatever it was, was moving so fast you could barely see it.  In slow motion you can see it progress (or possibly skip) across the horizon in three stages.

The trees are approximatly 50 yards from the back of the house.  I then went outside and observed the light moving slowly back and forth across the tree line.  I&apos;m not sure how long it remained there because after watching it for 15 minutes I realized I needed to get back to bed.

It was night and there were dark fields to the left and right of the highway. I saw a group of lights (3-4 round solid) about 100 yards ahead of me go over the highway from left to right and then down disappearing into the field to the right of me. I guess they were moving 20-30 miles an hour because I saw them for about 4 to 5 seconds. My initial impression was that these lights were car lights that went over the highway on a bridge. That was how low the lights were to the highway. That I was going to pass underneath a bridge very soon. At least this was my driving navigation thought process and I kept waiting and waiting for a bridge. Then I realized there was no bridge to go under. I starting looking to the right, into the field, searching for an airport or landing field of some sort, lights of any kind but there was nothing but dark, unlit area.

Prior to (about 30 seconds away) from arriving at one of our NW stations, I looked into the fairly clear night sky through the windshield of the train that I was driving. There was a thin layer of cirrostratus clouds in some areas of the dark sky. Well, I noticed a bright stationary white light (star or distant planet type light, but more intensely bright) in the sky, about 60 degrees from the horizontal, ahead of me. I thought, that sure is one bright planet, but in that area of the sky over this city, puzzled me. All of a sudden, the extremely bright white light, which was shining through a bit of a haze (possibly from the high clouds), got even brighter before lowering in intensity and disappearing totally. The duration of this whole episode only took about 5 to 10 seconds. On my next trip through the same rail line, about 2 hours later, I looked in the same vicinity of the sky, to see if I could see the bright light that I saw prior, but I did not see it again. I found it quite stunning, as the light was very bright and very noticeable in the dark sky. The light did not move from the location.

It was Sunday. Later that night, a fireworks show was presented. About a minute after the finale we saw a couple of fireballs. We thought they were part of the fireworks, but they lasted for about four minutes. Other witnesses jokingly exclaimed that they were UFO&apos;s, but no one really cared. I only noticed one but three more appeared, one after another. They were orange colored and it seemed to &quot;twinkle&quot; as well. Their shapes were simple ovals. They seemed to move slowly towards us, but they didn&apos;t get any bigger. Near the fourth minute, they turned to the left (west) until they faded. I only noticed 4 of the ovals, but there could have been more due to trees in the way.

Yet I will remember this as long as I live, as though it happened yestreday! Married 8/19/78. arrived in bermuda for honeymoon 8/22/78.  We arrived around noon.  We stayed at a resort called The Reefs Beach Club. The resort is situated on a [u] shaped cove on a small cliffside. Around 7:30 in the evening we went to dinner. The area where dinner is served sits above the cove beach, about 2 stories up, overlooking the ocean and our room; which was off to the left down a long walkway and from our view appears as though it was situated on a jetty. You could fish from our balcony. It is now sunset and we are having dinner with friends and I notice off to the east what appears to be a helicopter with two big searchlights sweeping the water, out on the horizon. I notice the other guests are seeing this also. I also observed a man in a dark suit,sitting just behind me at a table with a camera and long telephoto lense, snapping away pictures like crazy. He was so out of place; in a suit and alone at a resort. After dinner we were headed to the beach for a walk. The break between the building was just outside our room. We were standing in between; about 30 feet from the water,when suddenly we were lighted up like R.Druyfus at the railroad crossing in close encounters of the third kind! An intensly white spotlight from the helicoprter was shinning on us no less than 100 feet in the air and 100 feet close.I am looking at this for a few seconds as the light starts to dim, I can see the element in the spot light glowing red as a flame inside burnes off, also what appears to be a gas line retracts from the rear of the light with a flame burning from that also.They both retract into  the bottom of the copter, So I thought.I look at my wife and exclaim thats no copter; its a flying saucer. I look to my right and the only thing I see is my wife running to our room yelling get away from it. I say come back , its not everyday you see one o! f these, and she yells I do not want them to take me again!Knock me over with a feather,I make note of that but continue to check it out. Its still hovering, about 35 feet in diameter.with a bank of rectanguler windows completly around its upper circumferance, several red lights appeared on its top part but went off when the spotlight did. I now notice all the people upon the balcony where we had dinner.They are screaming and yelling about it and takeing pictures. Flashbulbs going off like at the end off a rock concert. Hey I have one in my hand. A keystone 110 everflash camera ;it does not work ;great, but if I turn it around you use the lense finder as a binoculer.Thats what I did. O my God! I can see two et&apos;s to the right of the saucer waving to the people on the balcony I then realize one is to the left and looking straight down at me I now know what it means to have your hair stand on the back of your neck. That thing looked through me,not just at me.The et&apos;s were definately the grays as described by others.Those big black eyes. I will never forget them.I then notice the gray that was looking at me turn its head to its left. The saucer then starts to move out over the ocean. It is behind my apartment for a few seconds as I run to my left towards the end of the jetty wall . It is now already 200 yards offshore and riseing.

I was on my cell phone at the time and was looking at the sky at an airplane that was flying near by. Around the middle part of the airplane contrail I notice this silver, metallic/chrome/shiny looking object flying around the trail. I couldn&rsquo;t really see it up close, but I did notice that the sun was reflecting off its surface and its movement was sporadic and really quick. It went back and forth. It was further back from the airplane and it looked nothing like the airplane so I definitely dismissed it as -- an airplane. It went through the trail and then flew fast upward and then disappeared. Now, I know what airplanes look like and this wasn&apos;t an airplane! It was round -- at least it looked round maybe more like an oval is more like it. It&apos;s movement really freaked me out. I told my friend who I was talking to at the time that I had just seen something really strange (remember I was on my cell at the time). I watched it for about 5 minutes and then it did its thing as I described above.

It may be a satellite, but it was moving erratically across the sky which I don&apos;t know if satellites do.  It has red and white blinking lights, possibly on opposite sides of the object, so it makes it a little difficult to tell in which direction it&apos;s travelling at ny one point. After watching carefully this evening, however, the object, which appeared to the south and west of Holt, very high in the sky, was moving in such a jerky and erratic fashion that it drew my attention.  It wasn&apos;t moving straight at all, but seemed to be moving from side to side in a zig zag pattern, like someone crossing over stepping stones to cross a creek.  It moved from SE to NW, then veered off E, then N. Like I said, I&apos;ve seen something like this several times before.  I usually sit on my back porch in the evening to smoke a cigarette (have a grandbaby in the house, so I don&apos;t smoke around her).  And NO, I wasn&apos;t smoking anything else:-).  Anyway, this has begun to puzzle me, so I looked up several key words on the internet, and am surprised there don&apos;t seem to be any regular explanations to them.  Couldn&apos;t it be like a satellite or a surveillance vehicle (not that THAT would be a comfort...)?  At one time, I could have sworn I saw one of these blinking red and white light things do a U-turn in the sky, but don&apos;t think that&apos;s possible, going at that velocity!  I see these at least several times a week, so I&apos;m inclined to believe there&apos;s a good explanation--I just don&apos;t have a clue what it might be.  It&apos;s so high in the sky, and must be moving so fast to proceed across as it does--I just can&apos;t explain how something moving that fast could change course so quickly.

I didn&rsquo;t realize there was such a place to report my experience, so I am writing this now after sixteen years.  I have forgotten the exact date and time but will never forget the other details &ndash; the image and brilliance of this strange ball of light and the feeling that it was certainly not normal. I was sitting on a couch chatting with my visiting father.  At the time I was 32 years old and my retired Naval officer father (I mention that because my father is not prone to frivolity) was about 54.  We have a 200 acre farm in rural West Virginia &ndash; very secluded and private. The couch faced a wall of floor to ceiling windows overlooking a small mountain ridge and a pond.  All of a sudden an enormous ball of light appeared &ndash; there was no beam &ndash; the light was consistent for the entire size of the &ldquo;ball.&rdquo;  It looked like the sun but obviously a bit too close!  It was clearly moving but at a very slow and controlled speed.  It was not falling.  &rdquo; My father and I have related the experience to people every now and again and frequently people will ask it might have been a meteor.  We don&rsquo;t think it was because of its slow controlled speed. It passed out of sight after about 15 seconds.   I called the police &ndash; but felt they wouldn&rsquo;t take us seriously.  I told the person who answered that I just felt like I should report it (I didn&rsquo;t call it a UFO) in case they got other calls attesting to the same sighting. Nothing ever came of it.  My father and I, after all these years, both say that we certainly saw something that defies our ability to understand.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

The sky was clear with few clouds and the moon was almost full.  We were sitting in a half circle when I happened to look into the sky.  I saw a green light shaped almost like a teardrop with a green aura coming off of it moving at an incredibly fast speed. I pointed to it as it shot out from behind some trees. Everyone saw it. My first thought was that it might be a falling star but I&rsquo;ve seen a couple of falling stars and this thing seemed different. First off, it was neon green. It didn&rsquo;t just have a greenish tint; it was the color of a lime. As we were watching the green light, it split in two and flew off into the sky leaving behind a line of smoke from where it had came from. The trail stayed in the sky for just a couple of minutes before it vanished.", "3 red-orange lights, in formation, conducting activites; booms heard, flares dropped, terrestrial crafts involved as well.I saw something in the sky, but I assumed I was seeing things until my friend called and exclaimed he and his father were watching what I was watching real-time. His father reported this story to the authorities. I wouldn&apos;t bother if there weren&apos;t multiple witnesses. Here goes...It&apos;s kind of one my of things, to go outside at night and just look at stars for a while. I like to sit and watch Venus, and that&apos;s what I was doing a couple days ago around midnight. I put out my cigarette and turned to go back inside, but a much brighter light caught my eye halfway through a turn. It was something like 4 to 5 times brighter and larger than Venus appears, and it was red-orange. That light was only seen for a couple seconds before it was just gone. I couldn&apos;t tell if I was seeing things or not, so I continued to go inside.Not five minutes later, I got a phone call from my friend, saying that he and his dad were watching three of what I thought I saw. Confirmation made me run outside to see if I was missing the rest of the show, and I was. It gets very interesting here, because it was a little more than just a light show. First off, the three red-orange balls of light were moving very, very fast, AND in classic triangular formations. They &quot;danced,&quot; too. The best I can describe it is that they spiral around each other. As they &quot;danced,&quot; they individually changed in brightness and speed. It was clear there were several terrestiral aircraft in the skies observing them.The next stage of display included what seemed to be flares dropped from the lights straight down. The &quot;flares&quot; were brighter than the crafts themselves, and a distant &quot;boom&quot; or roar could be heard clearly enough. After that, the formation disappeared east. I continued to watch, but what I saw next was just different. This one was much smaller, white, and not so flashy. It flew north several times faster than the terrestrial craft it came upon. I assumed it could also be terrestrial, but then it whipped around in a circle around the airplane, hooked off the right and just disappeared.I&apos;ve seen strange things in the sky before, but it&apos;s extremely rare. The last time I saw something that strange was around the time of the Arizona saucer fiasco. I&apos;m not unsure I didn&apos;t just see the same thing myself. I have my opinions about the UFO phenomena, and then I have my observations. Next time, I would like to have something with which to document my observations on video, but under my excitement, I just didn&apos;t do it. Regardless, it&apos;s clear by the photograph of the object in Mackey, Indiana, that the same crafts or similar ones are being seen in other counties.", "Kent , Wa               white light    triangle      clear skies over hous eclouds to the south fast flying craft at night time zigg zagI get home about 12:00a.m from my job.

I tried to rationalize what it might be right away, but before i could think of anything else it might be it made a staight line of flight west about 5 miles in a split second. I dropped all rational thought and knew what I was seeing. for about 20min the craft zigged around in a 10 mile area and at one point dissapeared south at a alarming speed and came back closer than before.

I noticed the first object looking towards the west-south west at about 2115CDT.  It was about 20 degrees above the horizon when I noticed it. The object did not appear to be moving relative to my position.  It was circular and appeared to be a dull orange color.  The object appeared to be glowing from within.  Shortly thereafter I saw a second object ascending from behind the tree line in the same direction as the first. This object was somewhat closer than the first one and I was able to determine that it was a balloon with a light inside. The sky that night was very clear with little wind. I believe that these balloons are the objects that many people saw on July 4th in the Midwest. They were larger than regular party balloons and possibly as big as a weather balloon.

I ran inside to get a grown-up to come look at it, but by the time we came back outside it had already disappeared. Since it was just before dusk they told me it was probably the sun playing tricks on me.

I assumed it was a shooting star, so I tried to catch it fast. I then realised the light was &quot;fish tailing&quot;.

We tried to get a picture of several of them but for some reason they would not show up on camera, but we did get a picture of 11 of the 20 that came over the house all traveling in the same direction. The objects at first were only coming over about every 2 to 5 minutes then after about 10 of them, they were occurring about every 30 seconds to 1 minute.

After looking at it for a bit longer, I saw that the light seemed to be pulsating much more intently than from a flickering star.  As I continued to look, I was able to perceive that the light was also changing colors&hellip;..going from a yellow-white, to red to green.  And the pulsating effect seemed very strong.  At this time I thought it might be a plane far off in the distance, so I waited to see if I could detect any movement, by seeing if it was coming closer to me, or moving laterally to my position.After viewing it for about 2-3 minutes, it was apparent that it was not moving towards me, away from me, or to either side.  It was in the exact same position relative to me, that I had first seen it in.  The very strong, strange pulsating was continuing, so I decided to get a pair of binoculars that I had in the other room.When I trained the binoculars on the light, I was now able to more clearly see the pulsating and changing colors of light.  With the aid of the binoculars, it now appeared to me that the lights were extended outward in a somewhat circular or oval pattern.  I could not detect an object within the perimeter of these lights.  But the lights seemed to almost be dancing in a strobe like fashion.  It gave off a very strong electrical effect.By now about 6-7 minutes had passed by, and I realized that the object was slowly dropping, much like the sun setting over the horizon.   There was a large hill in my line of sight, so in the next minute or so, the object dropped out of view behind the hill, whose apex was at about 25 degrees.I&rsquo;ve never reported any kind of sighting before this, but felt compelled to do so, as I have never seen anything like this before.   It was clearly not a star, planet or a meteorite.  As I stated, I was able to rule out a conventional airplane.  I was also able to rule out satellites and the International Space Station, after going to several websites and reading what the visual characteristics of such a sighting would be.The only other thing that I could think of would be some kind of helicopter, but the nature and shape of the intense pulsating and changing colored lights, seems to make this likelihood remote, in my opinion.", "could we knowso i seen something like a sphere that moved in away that beets time travel as we know it((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))", "Huge TriangleWhile stargazing with my 8 inch Dobsonian telescope, me, my wife, and a friend noticed what appeared at first to be 2 aircraft flying in formation with one trailing the other.  The objects had a triangular white light pattern with a red strobe between the two objects closer to the front.  The first object was smaller in size than the second object.  I managed to track the formation with my telescope for a couple of seconds and it appeared to be one object shaped like an isosceles triangle.  If it were 2 aircraft then I would have noticed irregularities in the distance between the two, but there was no lateral movement between the two, they kept a very static distance between them.  I believe the shape was distorted because it appeared to be between 2 to 5 miles to my South.The red strobe seemed to be huge and I could faintly see the outline of the back end in the telescope.  The object moved across the entire sky in less than one minute without making a sound.  When I held my fingers up at arm&rsquo;s length the object seemed to take up 3 fingers worth of sky.  If I were to estimate the height I would guess that it was probably between 5,000 and 10,000 feet up.  I have never seen an aircraft of this size in the sky.We live near Tinker AFB and have seen just about every aircraft in the inventory.  This thing was way bigger than a C-5 galaxy and moved much faster without making a sound.The object was moving in an ESE direction.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

On 13 July, 4:18 am, I spotted a satellite in the WSW that was being perfectly accompanied in speed and a constant distance by two bright white lights.  I observed the satellite and the lights for about 25 seconds until all disappeared behind a tree line. Using data from the Heaven&rsquo;s Above website, and comparing to my own recorded observations, I discovered that the satellite I sighted was USA 129 which was at a magnitude of 3.8 and an elevation of 66 degrees. The two bright white lights each appeared to be twice the size of the satellite and at least twice as bright. At arm&rsquo;s length, using my thumb as a guide (2.5 inches in length) the satellite was 2.5 inches above the lower white light.  The upper white light was 3/8ths to &frac12; inch above the lower white light.  The satellite and the two lights were nearly in perfect vertical alignment with the lights leading the satellite by a degree or so.

This &lsquo;illusion&rsquo;, real or not, could be due to the close proximity of the bright white lights masking dimmer stars which should have been visible between them.  My observation lasted for 25 seconds, doing the count in my head during the sighting. I used my cell phone to check the time of day the moment I spotted the satellite. I was standing a few hundred feet east of Hickory Ridge Road between Bone Road and Sackner Road at the time and generally looking to the southwest.  The only light in the area at the time was a single bulb exterior garage light, 100 feet away in a northeasterly direction from my position which did not enter my field of view.", "Unidentified orange light travelling at high speed with sudden changes in direction.A little before one o clock this morning I was laying in my friends room talking with her. My friend called me and told me to go out side and look up into the sky for an orange lighted unidentified flying object. We ran through the house to go out side and at first we did not see it because it was behind a tree but after passing the tree it became clearly visible. It appeared orange travelling at a very high speed thus confirming that it was not a usual aircraft seen in the sky. The craft travelled about five miles with in a minute to a minute and a half moving in sudden different directions. At one point it seemed as if it were moving towards us, soon after the light dissappeared.

As I sat back in a chair I saw some thing glint in the sky. At first I thought it was a child&rsquo;s helium balloon which had been let go, I asked my son if he could pass me his telescope for a better look and to my surprise I saw it wasn&rsquo;t a balloon.They were oval shape with an image in the centre, the images changed periodically I was mesmerised.We live quite near to Heathrow airport and when ever a plane took of the UFO&apos;s image would change to an aeroplane and zoom of vertically in a split second, no sooner had the plane gone the UFO sped back into  view (planes are taking off ever 1-2 mins).They would dart around with images such as aeroplanes, light bulbs, traffic lights and triangles.My family didn&rsquo;t believe me at first saying it was balloons which had escaped until they looked and started to watch with me. We were all stund to witness this phenomenon. We sat for over an hour watching the sightings, we were spellbound, so intriguing and unbelievable.To see the speed which they moved was unbelievable, after an hour or so it started to cloud up and I lost sight of them.Later that evening when my son was visiting some friends up the road he rang me to say the UFO&apos;s were there again at around 10pm.

The light has never been there before in any of my previous night time bike rides, so my attention was captured. Then a tree got in the way and I couldn&apos;t seem to find the light again, I even doubled back to where I had last been able to see it, but it was gone. I then looked to the other side of the road.It was here that I saw the first of the two crafts. It was travelling low and to the South at a very slow speed. It gave off a very low humming noise almost like a ver muted engigine, but unlike any engine I&apos;ve ever heard, especially at such a low altitude. There were seven orange lights placed at distinct locations on the craft. Five were in a row in the central region of the craft and the other two were placed so the seven lights looked like a cross with the short horizontal line at an angle. The lights are represnted by the &quot;o&quot;.-o- -o--o--o------o--o- -o-  The triangular shape seemed to mirror the shape of the lights, however that is hard to illustrate for you as i did for the lights...

In this very short stretch of time, the craft had gone from flying parallel with me towards the south, to flying parallel with me to the west. Then I came to an area with ponds on both sides of the road, permitting a large area of sight on all sides of me. As I glanced to the left to see if there were any more of these ships, I saw another further away but also flying parallel with my cycling to the west. It looked exactly the same, only the two lights out of line were in the opposite position and it had a red light (illustrated by &quot;X&quot;) as well. Looking like this: -o- -o--o--X---o--o--o- -o-  This craft flew from left to right, as you view the diagram. None of the lights flashed or fluttered at any point during the experience.

My family lived in Crooksville, OH, approximately 40  miles,  We visited my family about three, or more, times a week.  Mostly in the evenings, after he got off work.  We were traveling East on State Route 40 when one of us, (I can&apos;t remember who saw it first.) noticed the object in the sky, to the right.  It looked as if it was some distance away.  It was approximately 5:30 or 6:00 PM, and still light outside but there was a lighter oblong shape in the sky.  I&apos;ve always said it looked like an &quot;opening&quot; in the sky.At the bottom end of it small (looked small to us) black frisbee shaped object would come out, and fly around close to the area it seemed to emerge from and fly back in.  When it went back in it would disappear from view. I think there may have been three or four that would be visible at the same time, and they would disappear into the end of the oblong lite and come back.  Maybe the same ones; maybe not. We continued to watch it, and made a turn back into Cambridge,  To be honest I don&apos;t know when we lost view.  I was surprised that no one else said anything about it, as there was a lot of traffic on the highway that night. We decided to drive back into Cambridge hoping to keep the objects in sight.  Upon entering  the city saw to the left of us a large blimp like object, black or dark gray, which seemed rather close to the ground, seemingly not far above tree level. Didn&apos;t look like it was moving.  On the side was a red, white and blue insignia.  Keep thinking it looked like an American flag, but can&apos;t remember for sure. It seemed such an unusual object to see at that time, and I wondered for what reason was it there.

I was about one and a half miles east of the 4,020 ft. elevation summit of Loup Loup Pass.  I was approaching milepost 216 when I noticed a fiery object and two distinct, very bright lights leaving a gaseous trail in the pre-dawn sky through the dark, top of the forest canopy and then into the open, pale blue, dawn  sky.  The 2 distinct lights and the bright, fiery, gaseous trail that followed were headed due north over the Methow Valley as I watched while taking my foot from the accelerator peddle to begin slowing down as I approached a curve in the highway.  I initially thought it must be a meteor or shooting star but I realized it was on an upward arc from Earth and going against gravitational pull. This fact immediately aroused my curiosity and suspicion as to what I was witnessing in the sky above myself.  While trying to maintain visual contact with the lights in the sky, I began applying the brakes to my vehicle and quickly pulled over to the shoulder of the highway and came to a stop.  I shut off the engine before I had come to a full stop and proceeded to exit the vehicle on to the highway while still keeping my attention fixed on the 2 lights to the west.  As I stepped out of my vehicle, the 2 lights I was watching became very bright and shifted their course due east, towards myself.  The bright, gaseous trail disappeared with the sudden, smooth change in direction from due north to due east, but the two lights became much brighter as the direction of travel shifted.  The two lights also went from trailing one another while traveling northward to changing positions with one light being on top of the other while they began tracking to the east.  As the lights began coming eastward, towards myself, I noticed they were contained inside a visible oval shape that revealed itself against the pale blue dawn sky.  The shape was a definitive oval, with the previously mentioned lights wit! hin the circumference of said oval shape.  The area within the oval shape was transparent, yet it appeared liquid like or &quot;aura&quot; like, compared to the actual sky.   This translucent oval shape was approximately one half mile in length and several hundreds of feet in overall height.  The original two lights I mentioned earlier were the brightest part of what I saw. The light that was in the vertical position over the other respective light was at the &quot;bow&quot; of the oval UFO while the second light remained in the &quot;stern&quot; position. There were numerous smaller lights attached to or contained within the large, oval, translucent form that silently passed before and above myself and the tree tops in front of myself.  The UFO passed east bound over the  Loup Loup Ski Area, above myself and the tree tops and then kept traveling towards the towns of Omak and Okanogan, as I watched while standing outside of my vehicle in the center of Highway 20 at milepost 216. I was able to maintain a visual fix on the UFO for a total of 25-30 seconds before it passed out of my sight above the Okanogan forest in the pre-dawn skies on Tuesday, July 1, 2008.  There were no audible sounds coming from the UFO.  There was heavy thunder and lightning activity in the area before the sighting.  The skies were clear at the actual time of the sighting.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and we found him to be exceptionally eloquent.

That was the first thing I found to be extraordinary for what I had just witnessed.It is a bit difficult to estimate its size, because it appeared to look as if it were at a relatively low altitude.

Expirienced &quot;missing time&quot; following the incident.Around the night of August 23, 2001, I was walking my dog with my grandfather in the back yard of my grandparents house.   At approximately 9:03 PM the dog sat down and began barking quite loudly at something behind us. We turned to see a bright light coming up from behind the house.   It was flying just high enough that it didn&rsquo;t touch the top of the old oak tree in the yard.  Soon the object was directly above us and I had a very clear view of the craft.  It was almost shaped like the spade suit in a deck of cards.  The craft was massive and had to be at least forty feet, perhaps fifty feet, wide and perhaps fifteen feet high.  On the belly of it were several different colored lights.   On the exact center of the craft was a mysterious dome shaped light, it glowed a color that seemed eerily familiar, and yet like nothing I had ever seen before.  Also, it seemed as though the light were some form of cross between a solid and a liquid, as if it could hold its shape without need for containment but still allow objects to pass through it.  From this light an arm, with a long needle and a wire coiled around it attached to it, was expelled from the craft.  It was from the tip of this needle that a focused beam of light shot down from the craft.  The light hit the ground still concentrated, then seemed to explode in a flash.  Then the arm was pulled back into the light. The craft then started to move forward slowly, and, being a fascinated child, I foolishly pursued it, however it sped up and blasted away.

When I was growing up I lived with my parents in the countryside in South East Kent, near to woods and with very few neighbours.When I was about 19 -20 years old I was seeing my friend and neighbour (same age) to the door as she was about to go home.  She lived about 200 yards along the road.As we stood in the doorway I saw a classic shaped craft emerging from the woods, low flying, just seeming to skim the tops of an avenue of trees lining a lane about 200 yards from my house. The craft followed the lane towards a big house (a sort of minor stately house) where a Justice of the Peace lived on her own.The craft was about the size of a small normal plane I would guess, completely silent, flying slowly and carefully, and as I said before, a classic saucer shape.I don&rsquo;t  remember the colour of the lights &ndash;  but I later described the lights around the base of the craft as &lsquo;disco&rsquo; light (showing my age now) the lights seemed to pulse on and off in sequence.Just above the stately house (which is hidden by trees) was a very bright light. It immediately made me think of the Star of Bethlehem as it is depicted in children&rsquo;s Bible story pictures.The craft seemed to join up or merge with the light and the light seemed to grow and pulse with a surge of power (as if it was taking a big breath) before it flew off upwards and across the sky. When the craft merged with the light I could no longer see the craft &ndash; just the light.  It moved so fast it was hard to follow it with my eyes. Also it did not fly across the sky as a normal plane would but across and up.I also tried to signal to it, by turning the outside light on and off. (not sure why I did that).Later I found out that the lady who owned the house had also seen it, and I telephoned her, to tell her that I had also seen it. She was a very grand and dismissive lady but I managed to get out of her that she had seen &lsquo;them&rsquo; hovering in front of her house. She told me that she had reported it to the RAF.Recently I was reading about cattle mutilations possibly being involved with UFO activity, and I remembered a boyfriend of mine being stopped by the Police, around the same time I had seen the UFO. He had been stopped and his car searched after leaving my house one evening, because there had been a lot of sheep mutilations in the area, and they had searched his vehicle looking for knives etc. There may be no connection at all, but it is worth mentioning here.Also, as regards the different shapes of UFOs: Go to the Pukka Pies UK website.

I had taken about 15 or 20 shots. when I saw a guy to my right with his back to the parade and pointing his camera up to south west. So I look to see what he was doing. It was partly cloudy all white clouds but one was Rainbow colored it looked brilliant on the blue sky. So I pointed my camera at the cloud and took pictures till it dissipated . Then i took more pictures of the parade .  About 120 shots in all. When the parade had end I went into my apartment and downloaded all the images to my computer. I did not use the zoom on my camera I figured if there were any shots that i liked I could crop and zoom on the computer. just to the bottom right of the cloud I saw a gray and black sphere. This shoot was the best of the cloud pics so i started to look at the Parade pics and found two objects above the houses across the street. they look like the photo you have from Indiana on the same day but my shoot is is a day light  photo. To me they look like crows.  So  I cropped and zoomed in on the object They are small and look like triangles with three blue lights on the back side, the body is black.  After zooming on  in on these objects I do not think they are birds at all. in some of my shoots you can see passenger jets from O&apos;Hare airport to the west of Elmwood Park. All the pictures that I took were of the parade and the cloud. These images look very good on the computer  But I wanted to see them on photo paper so I took them to Wallgrens  to blow them up to 8 by 10 glossy  And they look even better.  I have 4 shoots one not zoomed and  three zoomed.  A  friend saw a photo of a cloud that was similar  to my shoot in the paper and said they were ice crystals in the sky.

I grabbed my binoculars and got a closer look - it was hard to see cuz it was night time but I could see the object was like 2 white orbs on top of each other, and it was hovering stationary over the lake! There was no noise.All of a sudden, a red orb appears directly below the white orb and starts flying around at incredible speed. I watched for several seconds in disbelief and then ran upstairs to grab my camera, which has a crappy video mode also. I was able to capture about 15 seconds (the limit on my camera) of the red orb (the white one wasn&apos;t easily visible against the backdrop of the stars).I could tell the two objects were miles away, but the red orb moved across the lake in a split second - it must have been moving at thousands of miles per hour. Soon afterwards the red orb appeared to go above the white, stationary orb and then disappeared from view. I was shocked.The video attached is very low quality and only the red orb is visible moving around. I have no idea whether this was a camera defect but it was NOT a firefly - that was what I thought originally until it was obviously acting under intelligent control and interacting with the white orb.

Since it was over the ocean at night, it was difficult to judge distance, but I know it was closer than the two boats out at sea.  At first I thought it was a flare and that a boat was in trouble.  Or, possibly a firework - but it never exploded the way fireworks do.  Then, another gold light lit up to the right of the first.  It was the same size and brightness.  Then a third lit up and it was the same brightness and all three were in a perfectly straight line and perfectly evenly spaced.  The first dimmed and went out and a fourth lit up to the right of the third.  Again, evenly spaced, same brightness, and all in a perfectly straight line.

About a minute or two later, to the left of where we saw the first lights, another light appeared.  It seemed slightly less bright than the first group.  Then a second lit up.

We had seen a simlar show, but much closer and much brighter. That night, they reminded me of the rectangle-shape of those bright lights at football games.

They each had red lights that remained constant, around the perimeter of each triangle. They also were sloped backward in position, approx. 10 degrees.

We got out of the tent to observe the lights more closely. It first appeared to be some sort of formation of ships. In between the lights that would flash occasionally there was a shimmer like glitter. The lights hovered above the highway right next to us on the side of a mountain. After watching it for awhile we could see that the lights were actually spinning and it was not a formation but a disk shaped object.

It was estimated to be about the size of a quarter coin when compared against a human hand held up in comparison. The witnesses were quite certain that the object remained motionless for several minutes, as if hovering. During the event, they saw what appeared to be a commercial airliner flying near the object at a much higher altitiude. The object was a third smaller than the aircraft as it transited the area. The object displayed no movement, appeared to be light colored, with a haze around it. The object reportedly changed from round to a tubular or cigar shape.  No noise could be associated with the object.  Witnesses appeared to be credible, lucid and sober. This area is very populated with commercial aircraft.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

At first I did believe it was a plane, but soon after I spotted the light it started dimming.  It continued to dim till the light had completely disappeared.  I have checked NASA and didn&rsquo;t see any launches for today and that doesn&rsquo;t make much sense anyways because of the direction of the light.  Why I&rsquo;m writing this because I am sure someone that reads this probably has more knowledge on the whereabouts of China&rsquo;s and Korea&rsquo;s timing with their launches.

It was perfectly rounded with massive fingers of flames exploding from within its core to the surface, at 16 years of age I thought the heavens were reacting to the turmoil I had just escaped from inside the house with the audience my father had just had with my mother, brother and the rest of the family over the demand he join the military tomorrow because of a conflict of issues... what a psychological experience to behold after such a traumatic set of circumstances! I&apos;ve looked long and hard for others that might have noticed the extremely large fireball in the evening sky, it didn&apos;t crash, it made no sound, it maintained its elevation just above the treeline and it left no cloud or stream of debris in its trail. I assume was from west to east, whatever this flaming ball of fire was it has held my imagination ever since. I recall by brother moments just before I stepped outside as he was shining his shoes with a can of Griffin shoe polish for the big day to come at the recruiter&apos;s office tomorrow morning... he was just 30 days from turning 17 years of age, a special parental sign-off was required for him to enter the Marine Corp, it was a sad day for me, especially now that he&apos;s gone.", "Bright moving circle of light over Pacheco, CaliforniaI was walking down my street and when I turned the corner, There was a bright White light gleaming in the distance, but about the size as if you were to look at the moon from the ground.

So I started to record it with my phone and after ten seconds of recording the bright light dicipated and did not return.I have been living by a small airport for years, and I have never seen something like this and there are no hills in the direction of the bright light.

My Aunt who is now deceaced had kept a journal of numerous sightings she and others had exerienced for many years at the resort during the 70&apos;s. I had a freind that was in the same jr high class that was very interested in ufo&apos;s and when I mentioned an upcomming family event taking place at the resort and the fact that ufo&apos;s were sighted often he asked to be invited along. I only mention these facts at all because this individual happens to now be one of the worlds experts on ufo&apos;s. Since no names are to mentioned here, I think it&apos;s safe to say that if it comes a time for documenting this report his eye witness testimony would be invaluable. Anyway on the day in question he and I spent the day scouting places where the craft had been seen to land.  On one spot the craft had set down and started a wild fire and when fire personel gathered on the ridge across from resort the craft landed back on the western ridge just north of the resort and sat and watched the fire being put out.  We examined both sites and the western ridge had three deep indentations that had apparently melted the soil into an almost glassy looking substance similar to black glass. There was no brush in this area because it was a fire break and a clearing and it why I beleive we were able to spot the landing site and melted soil. We were told that it was about time to go so my freind and I asked my uncle if we could get on the roof of the chalet to get a good vantage point to scan above the tree tops before we left and he showed us how to get up there and told time was almost up and watch the guide wires supporting the antenna. My freind had an old camera ! that you had to look down to view the object you were shooting and he took it out of it&apos;s case and just then I heard a low humming almost a vibration comming from the high western ridge that runs about a mile away rrom the resort.At this point we were about 40-50 feet above ground level and my mother and aunt were just comming out the front door calling for us to come on down to go. As the humming got louder I focused my attention in that direction and saw what appeared to be a structure, like stuts but viewable through its body. I called out to my freind and said &quot;This has got to be it&quot;. Ashe looked were I was pointing he said he wasnt seeing anything, But as it got closer it began to fill in and turn a purplish color and filled out into a long cigar shaped craft. We both watched in awe as this object the size of a football field matterialized and just stopped right at eye level about 30-40 feet away and at about 50-60 feet above the ground. The craft hovered about 45 seconds and my freind attempted to spap a picture but tripped over a wire and as he got back up and tried again the craft zipped away at a speed I cannot desribe. Back on the ground everyone that had seen the craft desribed what they saw and my mothers desription gave it a black stripe right down the middle that was not observed from our vantage point on the roof. After this event I questioned my Aunt for more info on her sightings and experences and she told me it had been visiting for years and she had even reported it to the Air Force and after several meetings with them she was told to keep here mouth shut and she was crazy. Well she was not crazy and 33 years later I can still see it like it was yesterday. My friend as stated earlier was so impressed by the experience he made it his lifes passion and ocupation. There were other strange things that happened to me soon after and later in life. The craft appeared to follow us home {Fremont Cal} and I experienced lost time and knowledge of their propulsion systeem and motivations for their visita! tions. I cant explain this knoledge, but I do know that after discusing the propulsion ststem with my uncle {not related to this incident} that worked at California Berkley about the method of propulsion he asked how I could have such knowledge about such far away and cutting edge information. Anyway thats about it in a nutshell and if I could speak to someone with the right forum or willing to explore this deeper I believe that a lot of things can be unlocked.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

We were sitting around at the house we had rented for the duration of the stay waiting for dinner time, casually talking. We came upon the subject of satellites in the sky.  I asked him whether he had ever seen one, to which he replied, &quot;no.&quot; We then told him what it should look like and we proceeded to look for one.  I immediately looked up in the night sky above me, looking for a satellite for him.  While looking he then asked me it the object he was looking at was one.  I asked him where it was as I could not see anything moving directly above me.  To which he stated that it was not above us but just above the horizon.  Upon looking at the object it moved across the sky to the left, then suddenly to the right again and then upwards.  Then stopped and just hovered.At first I thought this might be a helicopter, but there was no sound.  Secondly the speed the object was moving at was far to fast for a helicopter in the night to move and change directions as this object did.  The object was triangular in shape and seemed to have red, green and yellow lights.We kept looking at the object for a good 30 minutes.  Then just a short distance from the object there was a flash of light every 30 seconds or so.During the whole time we were looking at the object it would proceed moving in all different directions and sometimes hovering for a few seconds.  During all this time we heard no sound.Eventually we retired to the restaurant at the lodge we were staying at.  Upon our return to the house, a good 2 hours later, the object was gone.", "Multiple Barcelona orbs sighted in March 2008.The sightings happened on four seperate occasions, and will be described individually: 1.  My wife and I were laying on a beach just outside Barcelona on a perfectly clear day.  I first noticed (and then her as well) an orb which had a yellowish-red appearance high in the sky.  There was no contrail.  Its movements were erratic and appeared to follow and almost elliptical pattern.  It grew smaller (which I took to be movement away from the observer) and then disappeared.  Approx. 10 min. later, it returned to the same place of initial observation and followed the same pattern.  It again vanished within ten minutes.  Total time of observation approx. 30 min.2.  I was alone and walking to work when I noticed the same object in the sky over the moountains directly west of Barcelona and above the Collserola Communications tower.  I was unable to observe for exceedingly long because it eventually drifted behind the buildings to my west.3.  Approx. two weeks after the sighting just described, I observed the same object, but this time I was able to follow it for almost 45 minutes.  It behaved in much the same pattern as previously.  Initially, it apeard to be roughly half-oragen and half-red.  It drifted back and forth in what appeared to be arranged patterns.  Eventually, its size changed.  It grew smaller and the color changed to golden, and then almost white with a metallig shine.  I again assumed this to be its rising higher from my observational position.  It eventually disappeared high above.4.  Approx 4 weeks after initial sighting on beach I was walking to the supermarket where I observed the object MUCH closer approximately 1/2 mile from my position.  It was a clear day in late March.  The object can only be described as a donut lying on its side, spinning much in the same way a coin would spin when rotating to rest flatly.  The center was lighter colored and the &quot;edges&quot; darker colored; almost brown.  Others around me observed this as well, though most eventually continued on with their business.  I followed the object visually for approx.  ten minutes.  It stayed perfectly still in the sky (save its own motion).  It appeared to hover for quite some time before beginning to move slowly northbound.  It speed progressively increased until it had risen higher in the sky, giving it the &quot;traditional&quot; reddish-orange appearance and then subsequently metallic white before disappearing.During this reported time period, there were other reported sightings in Malaga (a suburb of Barcelona) as well as along a few major highways.  The objects did not exhibit any common aerodynamic characteristics, jut as they did not appear to be affected by air currents.  Their movement patterns ruled out any influences by upper air currents (returning to their initial positions).  These sightings have yet to be explained.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

And he says extra-terrestrials have visited Earth on several occasions - but the alien contact has been repeatedly covered up by governments for six decades. Dr Mitchell, 77, said during a radio interview that sources at the space agency who had had contact with aliens described the beings as &apos;little people who look strange to us.&apos;  He said supposedly real-life ET&apos;s were similar to the traditional image of a small frame, large eyes and head. Chillingly, he claimed our technology is &quot;not nearly as sophisticated&quot; as theirs and &quot;had they been hostile&quot;, he warned &quot;we would be been gone by now&quot;. Dr Mitchell, along with with Apollo 14 commander Alan Shepard, holds the record for the longest ever moon walk, at nine hours and 17 minutes following their 1971 mission. &quot;I happen to have been privileged enough to be in on the fact that we&apos;ve been visited on this planet and the UFO phenomena is real,&quot; Dr Mitchell said. &quot;It&apos;s been well covered up by all our governments for the last 60 years or so, but slowly it&apos;s leaked out and some of us have been privileged to have been briefed on some of it. &quot;I&apos;ve been in military and intelligence circles, who know that beneath the surface of what has been public knowledge, yes - we have been visited. Reading the papers recently, it&apos;s been happening quite a bit.&quot;   Dr Mitchell, who has a Bachelor of Science degree in aeronautical engineering and a Doctor of Science degree in Aeronautics and Astronautics claimed Roswell was real and similar alien visits continue to be investigated. He told the astonished Kerrang! radio host Nick Margerrison: &quot;This is really starting to open up. I think we&apos;re headed for real disclosure and some serious organisations are moving in that direction.&quot;  Mr Margerrison said: &quot;I thought I&apos;d stumbled on some sort of astronaut humour but he was absolutely serious that aliens are definitely out there and there&apos;s no debating it.&quot;  Officials from NASA, however, were quick to play the comments down. In a statement, a spokesman said: &quot;NASA does not track UFOs. NASA is not involved in any sort of cover up about alien life on this planet or anywhere in the universe. &apos;Dr Mitchell is a great American, but we do not share his opinions on this issue.&apos;", "Light sphere seen, exactly the same as the one in the British Police Helicopter footage.I frequently go to my back deck to smoke a cigarette before bed.  On this occaision, I saw a ball of light cross the sky at a high rate of speed.  It took about four seconds to travel from the southern horizon to the northern horizon (and it was very dark out).  There was no noise that I could hear.  Estimated altitude, about 5,000 feet.  I know this because I live near Philadelphia Airport.  It usually takes an aircraft about a full minute to travel from horizon to horizon, and they only go east-west out of PHL.  I was content to go to sleep knowing I had seen an Angel or a UFO, and not bother telling anyone, until I saw the footage of the British Police Helicopter.

That time of year it gets dark quite early, it must of been around 8:00 p.m., &quot;the times are now just an approximation&quot;. My son, who at the time was around 12 came running in the house saying there was a UFO right outside our house. Let me add at this point I was not one that believed in UFOs. I went outside and my son pointed south and upwards and said look! The funny thing was at first I didn&apos;t see anything, but I did notice it was unusually dark, then I noticed a very dim light, I suddenly realized that the reason it was so dark was that there was a huge craft right over our driveway. It blocked all the starlight! It was at tree top level and was moving north at a very slow pace, &quot;approximately a slow walking speed&quot;. There was a very distinct humming, exactly like a large transformers hums, there was a very dull light in the middle and as it traveled down or driveway I made out a row of windows around the craft, the windows looked very large. I remember walking down the driveway with my son, and then the next thing I remember is standing out in the field north of my house still looking at the UFO, when suddenly it went from approximately 90 or 100 ft straight up in the sky to where it was a pinpoint of light. It just looked like another star. This happened in under a second. We continued to watch it for quite awhile when it took off in a northwesterly direction like a meteor and was gone in a second. There are allot of things I can describe if your interested, but this is the basic part. I don&apos;t feel like I was abducted, but I honestly do not remember how I got from my driveway and then in the field. I ask my son about it and he remembers things the way I do, but what I find unusual is that 1. I didn&apos;t really focus on it that much after the initial day it happened until a few years ago. 2. My son doesn&apos;t seem as interested as I am, even though he is a very intelligent guy. I have a lot of knowledge regarding aircraft. This will always go down as the most bizarre day in my life. By the way, it seemed like I was being watched by someone in the window, but it was like you could only make out a shadow. I am now fascinated by UFO&apos;s and I know that there out there. Almont is about 20 SE of Brown City. I have never seen another unusual craft. This was defiantly a UFO, there is no other explanation for it, I am the type of guy that checks his facts, there is nothing on our planet that I am aware of that could do what I saw! The pilots would be dead just from the G forces. It surprises me that there have been so many incidences in that area and I never heard about it. From my house to the field was approximately 1000 feet, &ldquo;you would think that with what was going on, I would remember that sort of distance&quot;. I am not really concerned weather anyone believes me or not, unless it is someone who&rsquo;s job it is to investigate this sort of thing. They really need to have an open mind and check the facts. The last few years I have gotten increasingly interested in this subject and there have only been a few incidences that I have read about where people have been as close as I was. I guess I am just intrigued. It really fascinates me! The missing time, and it does bother me, when I put into perspective. I can remember everything about the sighting in detail except from the time the craft went from the barn behind my house until I remember standing in the field watching it go from an altitude of 90&apos; to just another star in the sky in the blink of an eye. This is the most significant event in my life and I can&apos;t remember just that particular part. I did have dreams afterward about all the neighbors being around looking and me yelling for them all to watch, but its a dream. I have brought it up several times to my son who is really a level headed intelligent guy and he remembers the same way I do, but he for some reason never brings it up himself. I really have to catch myself sometime to really put in perspective the significance about what happened that night. It just amazes the hell out of me. I really do think that somehow my mind was altered to either forget about it, or just not think it was that big a deal. Think about that, how could a person with the knowledge I have about aircraft not act in some way . This was the size of a football field! What it did breaks all laws of physics and for several years I really didn&lsquo;t give it that much thought. It is not like me.I had transformers on appliances that started to burn out. I called Detroit Edison and they had to replace all the electric lines and main transformer on the line that followed the driveway right below where the UFO was following. This was within a month of the sighting. I remember the Detroit Edison crews telling me that all the insulation on the wires were gone. I thought that was a bit strange, but since then I have read quite a few articles about sightings near power lines with the same or similar results. I was so close, 90 ft. The funny thing about it was I didn&apos;t feel threatened, In a weird way I felt like it was something from our future, as bizarre as that sounds. I feel that we need to have confidence in our instincts; I felt like I was on display and was being watched. One thing I didn&apos;t mention and to this day I am not sure why I didn&apos;t act, is that I am a professional photographer. What a dummy! the shot of a life time and I didn&apos;t even think about it. This is another thing I cant explain, I take my cameras everywhere with me. The first ten years, I would occasionally ask my son if he remembered everything about that night and he would say yes, but not really want to talk about it. It seemed like more of a dream. WHY? Neither my son nor I am the type of person not to act on something so significant, an event of a life time .Another factor about that night was the route the craft was traveling, right down my driveway. My power lines go right down the drive and sometime that winter I had to call Edison out, they told me that the wires were completely bare&quot; no insulation at all&quot;, and had to replace them, including the transformer. I am not sure if it relates, but I have read stories about these craft using power lines.It&apos;s funny, you hear people talk about UFOs and some people will tell you that they have seen one, but you never really stop and give it deep thought because it&apos;s a bit hard to fathom the reality about them. I am now a person that can speak the truth about these craft, guess what, you better start polishing your tin foil hat because they are here. Think about all the incidents over the years, especially with all of the NASA sightings, even hovering over the White House. They always have an excuse, a flair, blimp, and the best and most used, a weather balloon. I am sure that a good percentage of reports are something explainable, but I am here to tell you, some aren&rsquo;t. Sometimes I will think about it and realize that my son and I saw something that would be no less significant than telling your friends you met Jesus Christ. Well, you know what your friends would think. That&rsquo;s why there are so many people that don&apos;t believe, it&rsquo;s really too big to grasp.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I saw no wings, tail section or engines but assumed this was due to looking from the side of the plane and maybe some subtle reflection of sunlight was hiding the tail.Also, since it is extremely common to see aircraft approaching nearby Raleigh/Durham International Airport, I had instantly dismissed it as an airliner and looked slightly away from it to maintain my lane position but glanced right back within about 1 second to confirm what type of plane it was.Within that one second it had vanished.

The lights were blinding and eerie looking it gave me chills. Just when we thought we had seen it all another object moved across the night sky. And coming the opposite way was three of the solid white lights moving in a triangular formation, distorting the stars behind the U F O. We watched that for about 2 and half to 3 minutes and all of the sudden the front light of the object disappeared then the back left then the back right.I have never believed in U F O&rsquo;s or extra terrestrials until I saw this. I was stunned and caught speechless. My dad, my uncle, and I always are logical people and try to find a reason or what it could be but we could not explain this.", "green fireball shaped objectI was out stargazing at about 11:30 eastern time with my binoculars  it was a clezar night in a new remote spot I found outside the city. I actually was able to asee the milky way. Anyway I was looking up w my binoculars in a star cluster i saw what I thought to be a satelite. while I took the bioculars away from my face to see the object with my naked eye i lost sight of it it was heading north way in the atmosphere. It was starting to get cold I went in my truck to put on another shirt as i closed the door and walked back to my observing position I saw a huge green fireball like object very luminous object at a low altitude maybe 1000ft or less heading north I do not know what it was but it was not a meteor but it was breathtaking to say the least...", "Witnessed two bright white flashes of light that illuminated the inside of my houseAfter seeing an object in the sky at 11:00pm and determining that it was unidentified I decided to file a report with you which a did right after I witnessed the incident. However later I witnessed something else that might possibly be related.After I finished with the report I returned to the living room to watch some TV before going to sleep. While I was sitting there a extremely bright white flash of light (1-2 secs in duration) illuminated my entire living room. This happened at about 12:40am. At night I always keep the blinds on my windows open, and this flash of light was evenly distributed and completely lit the room during the flash, so much so that I remember squinting because it was so bright. The light did not sweep across the room in beams as a car&apos;s headlights might, but it EVENLY light the room in an intense white light. It was like night became day, literally.Immediately following the flash my two dogs became very agitated, pacing around and whining loudly. So I get up and quickly go out onto my back porch, where I had observed the incident earlier, wondering what the hell that was. However, I could observe nothing either in the sky or any traffic such as cars or other people up that might explain the flash. My dogs seemed to quickly spot something down by the fence, though it was too dark for me to see anything, because they went tearing off downstairs and outside after something barking like crazy. After a few seconds they stopped and came back upstairs and settled down. I also went back inside unable to explain where the flash of light came from, what caused it, or why it was so intense or perfectly dispersed evenly through the room. I went to bed a short time later and at about 1:45 am 7/11/08 as I lay in bed with my eyes lightly closed trying to fall asleep, another bright flash of white light, identical to the first, illuminated my entire bedroom (again I sleep with my blinds open). It was so bright I saw it even with my eyes closed and openned them in time to confirm the flash of light for a second time. Again my dogs, who were sleeping too, became extremely agitated again (more so than I have ever seen them, and more so than the first time) and began pacing around the bedroom whining and I could tell they were nervous/scared. This time they didn&apos;t run downstairs barking after anything. It was almost like they were trying to stay close to me. Their behaviour was really strange and both times coincided with the two flashes. So I get out of bed a little spooked, because I just saw this flash again and my dogs were really agitated again. I looked out through the blinds and again could not see anything that might have caused the light. No cars, no low flying airplanes, no neighbors up, just calm darkness. After the second flash startled me out of bed i wasn&apos;t taking any chances, I made sure my guns were ready to go and I had a very difficult time going bac! k to bed last night to say the least.I really don&apos;t know if this incident is related to the one I had earlier or not, but I thought it was still important to inform you just in case. I can&apos;t explain it, but just tell you what I expeirienced. It was really weird, and it didn&apos;t give me a good feeling at all. I mean the room in both occassions went from being totally dark to COMPLETELY and perfectly illuminated, like the brightest day ever, and then went away and darkness returned. Just two quick bright flashs of white light(1-2 secs) about an hour apart from each other. I have no idea, completely stumped and a little shaken. Never seen anything like it. I just can&apos;t get over how intense and evenly distributed it was, and how it completely bathed the inside of my house in bright white light. It went from being total darkness to intense illumination that let me see the two rooms I was in completely clearly for 1-2 secs and then back to total darkness!", "We saw a burning object flying slowly through the air with no identifiable features.On June 22nd, about 9pm, me, my father, and my girlfriend were outside of my house in Northwestern Tennessee when we saw a strange object in the sky. It was large, moving very slowly, and smoke was pouring from it. It was clearly on fire. I know it was huge because when you see something that size in the sky you can normally hear it. I could hear nothing. A few times I thought I could hear roaring, as in a great fire, but I think that was my imagination. It was probably in the sky for as many as five minutes. My mom also saw the object. We could not tell what the shape of the object was, the smoke and flickering flames obscured the shape. It was clearly on fire on TOP of the object, that is, not the whole object was engulfed in flame, as I would imagine a meteor would be if it were reentering the atmosphere. Also, it was going very, very slowly to my eye. It was moving from left to right, probably Northwest to Northeast, if I know my directions in that area, which is likely that I don&apos;t but my parents can tell me for sure with a compass. There was no discernible arc to the flight path. It disappeared behind the tree line after flying through the air.", "verticle rectangle with several bright lights.From Vancouver, WA, looking south, on July 8,2008, 1:30 am PDT from my dining room window, I saw a vertical rectangle with several bright lights, during a very clear night sky, about 200 times larger than any star I have seen.  I watched for twenty minutes.  During that time there was no movement, other than a slight shimmering.  I then went back to bed.This is no joke.  I was wide awake at the time.((NUFORC Note:  Possible hoax??

Up until about a month ago, I like many people thought that when people say they saw a &ldquo;UFO&rdquo; that they were a little&hellip; weird&hellip;  Even though I saw something strange in the late 90&rsquo;s, I thought it was explained by the news.  After watching a recent episode of Larry King, and seeing something mentioned about the Phoenix Lights (which I had no prior knowledge of because I did not watch TV in those days, yet it reminded me of what I had seen in the 90&rsquo;s) I also thought of something that my best friend (who does his best to explain stories in truth and detail) told me a few years ago that he saw.  I was puzzled by the story about he and several other people at a stop light seeing a an oval metallic disc slightly larger than a car, with lights all around it silently hovering over the intersection only about 40ft up.   He said he stepped out of the car, and it tilted a bit and took off at a VERY high speed, still making no sound.  I figured he and his wife had some sort of temporary insanity.  I found the Phoenix lights DVD on ebay, and purchased it.  I asked my friend about that story again, and told me again.  He said he never told many people because people (including myself) just looked at him like he was crazy.After watching the Phoenix lights DVD, I was amazed.  It looked just like what I had seen in the sky over Rockford at around that time.  The local news also said it was probably military flares, and that was the end of it. I assumed they were telling the truth.I started doing some research and started to scan the sky day and night, lately.My mom barrowed my Phoenix Lights DVD, as she is interested in the subject.  My step dad, who is very skeptical made a joke about her watching the sky since watching the video.  I admitted that I do, but made the joke that my chances of seeing something now that I have this interest are probably much slimmer.  It would be a very strange coincidence.The only reason it wouldn&rsquo;t be less likely to see something would simply be because I am actually watching, now.I left my mom&rsquo;s house on Friday night, about midnight.At about 12:30am, I was looking up at stars in the sky, as I was walking to my garage to get something.  I looked to the north east probably above the nearby cities of Loves Park, or Machesney Park, IL (about 5-10 miles away) and noticed a light that looked like it was about 400-500ft high.  No structures or towers in that area, (that I know of) are nearly that high.  The light was distant, but coming from a fairly large source, because I could tell that the lights were alternating green and red with an orange/yellow in it as well.My first thought was that it was a helicopter.  I couldn&apos;t hear it, but that seemed normal since it was so far away.I watched it for several minutes.  I figured if it was a jet or a helicopter that was flying directly away from my view, it would soon look smaller and vanish from view.  If it were flying toward me, it would do the opposite, and I would soon know for sure.  It did neither.  What it did appear to do is jerk left, then right short distances every minute or so.  I saw a jet fly by a little closer, but higher in the sky, and it looked completely different.  The light started to slowly move upward and further to the east.  I went inside and told my girlfriend to go out with me and check it out.  I got my camcorder.  I wanted to make sure I had at least these 2 witnesses, so if I told anyone, they wouldn&rsquo;t just say that it was just a case of me wanting to see something since I&rsquo;m suddenly interested in it (which I am sure people wll probably think anyway)  My camcorder has 3CCDs, so I knew it would pick up the colors, well, which it did, but it was too dark outside and too distant to see exactly what it was.  She watched it, and said she saw it occasionally see it jerk left and right.  To make sure that both of us didn&apos;t have a case of our eyes playing tricks on us, we put the camcorder on the light(s), and stared at a star to see if just watching a distant light that intently caused our eyes to make that effect appear, because it was so slight.  That was not the case.Over about a half hour, it looked like it had climbed a few hundred more feet in the sky.  This was also after several jets had passed it.  I decided to get into my car and drive toward it.  By the time I had gotten to where I think it was when I first saw it, It had gone several hundred more feet into the sky, and a bit further north.  By this time, it was so far away, at first glance it just blended in with the stars.  No one would notice it.  The colored lights were the same, but washed out by the distance.  This was confirmed when I got home and could see it much further up in the sky.  I had landmarks I could measure it&rsquo;s movement with.  A neighbor&rsquo;s roof, and a tree made good reference points.  It got to the point where I could no longer see it on my camcorder.I do not know how long a helicopter can hover, but by 2:00am, I had to get to bed, and could no longer observe.  I am no expert, but I have not ever seen a Helicopter behave that way, and can&apos;t imagine it would for any reason over loves park/Machesney Park.All I know is that we did not know what it was, and still don&apos;t after looking at the video.  I didn&apos;t know who to call if anyone to see if anyone else saw it. I was not able to watch the news last night to see if anything was reported.  I&rsquo;m not sure how to find out if anything was.I found this website, and figured I would post the info here first. (for option below: I am not requesting to be contacted, but will be happy to answer any questions if someone wishes to contact me, or provide a copy of the video, upon request)", "Possible UFO&acute;s seen over Dresden, Germany, no unusual flight paths or speed. Please suggest explanations.We were sitting in our local pub (about 50 people outside) when one of us pointed up to the sky, drawing our attention. A rather large orange-red, very vibrant pulsating light was visible moving straight across in an airplane-fashion, about the same speed. We had limited visibility through bushes and pub-inventory, when we noticed that there were additional objects with the same appearance that floated farther away from the one we just spotted. At first glance it seemed like a helicopter, however the number of objects and the rather intense light and color would not have justified that conclusion. I went on to a better spot to examine these objects and a friend followed me. Surprisingly no one else of the few people we had made aware of the objects followed, after the incident they explained it was due to disbelief. We&acute;re not sure how many of the guests in the pub had noticed them as well. We gained full sight of the sky, about 2 objects were flying to our left, with the rest in no particular formation to our right, in front of them. They were flying level, apparently with considerable distance between them (the first one we noticed was just glowing so much, seemed much closer), and at normal, aircraft-comparable speed. After watching them for some time and taking a photo via a cellphone, one after another began to disappear. The size of the glowing balls began to shrink, until there was only a very small but shiny star-like glow visible, then they disappeared completely, one after another. It did, to me, not seem like they were speeding away as it is common in ufo reports, but rather that the light got smaller until invisible (it did not dim out).We are examining the possibility of these objects being candle-balloons, however from our observation that does not seem to be a possibility due to a) the extremely bright orange-red color of the objects and b) the straight level flight of all of the objects (horizontal, not upwards).", "Red orange in color pulsing oval  slowly raised up and moved slowly across the sky stopped and slowly raised up out of sight.Red orange in color pulsing oval slowly raised up and moved slowly across the sky stopped and slowly raised out of sight.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I wound down the window to see better, the object was traveling quite fast and was in front of the hills above the motorway, about helicopter size. It resembled a group of geese flying in v formation, except it was faster and it appeared the objects making up the v shape were self illuminated. The individual lights  changed position slightly within the shape.Possibly one l larger object, or individual lights/orbs flying together.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

PD))", "Coincidence with later Sighting in 1982 in Great Falls, Montana that seems to have been totally removed from the publics view.Subject: RE: Html Form Submission... another troubling episode that has been even harder to explain when considering aspects of the Kicksburg, Pennslyvania UFO Reported Sighting.Peter Davenport,   I want you to understand that the date of this FireBall  streaming across the treeline from my position facing toward Hartford in the south and to the existing river coming from the northeastern sector of the state from the other side of the forest just outside Enfield, Connecticut was the exact path this Orb took heading in a northeastern direction. It appeared as I said as if the sun itself had fallen from the sky because of its massive size and the circular diameter of the sphere, it made no sound and nor was there a sound previous to its appearance to indicate a major explosion of some magnitude coming from that region of the countryside, it appeared as though it was approximately 10 miles or so from the street we lived on that ran parallel to the trajectory of the object in question and that of the river on the other side of the forest, it was heading in a north, northeasterly direction after I reviewing my homes position to that of Hartford and the river that passed along side of Enfield and headed directly toward the Hartford vicinity, the Smith Family lived directly behind our house on the next block, the Zimmermans a few more streets over from them, if my bearings are correct. The silence of such a huge sphere ROLLING across the tree tops and emitting whipping flames from upon its surface gave you the feeling that the core of this object was solid while its surface was entirely engulfed in a all encompassing mass of burning gases and surface material, no wind, not a whisper of the massive flight of this globe of fire could be heard, no crash, no explosion, its as if it was headed toward the coastline and gravity had no effect on its elevation as it traveled the distance from which I was could visually detect and remain captivated by its enormous size and silence as it moved through the evening sky to a destination I had no indication wwas close by.I&apos;d like to mention yet another personal experience, that wasn&apos;t so personal when you consider all the news at the time that was generated in the Community of Great Falls, Montana shortly after the attempted assassination of Pope John Paul II. It was months later and I had contacted a local priest from Our Lady of Lourdes Church in Great Falls . This priest has since been removed from active service with the general public, he has suffered a stroke on the left side of his body and his memory isn&apos;t exactly what it use to be. In the early 1980&apos;s, maybe around May of 1982, during that late spring month my wife and I was awakened by a glowing light from the back yard of our home that was hovering over our very large weeping willow tree. The air was still and the sounds in the distance echoed as if you were inside a tunnel. Across the alley, on the next block at 2606-5th Avenue South a police car was parked in the middle of the street looking directly into our backyard, the sound of breaking glass could be heard for a very brief second from that location, the whole area of the neighborhood was as if it were in a vacuum. Above our tree was a cloud that resembled a Maltesse Cross, its four triangular shaped inner arms were of a stewing blackness that could only be understood from the depths outside our planets atmosphere. The other portions of that Maltesse Cross between the cross figure itself was pure white and just as luminous as the light of a full moon on a clear night, even that of a bright florescent blub. It hummed as though discharging a message or extracting a source of matter that had called it forth in the midnight hour.This experience has vanished from most all records in the area after a military investigator came to the area and researched the sighting that many residents of Great Falls had reported to the Great Falls Tribune and to Military officials at Malmstrom AFB the days following its appearances, this phenomenon occurred during a period when I was employed for about a 6 month period as a supervisior at a local Sambo&apos;s Restraurant. The incident was centered at 2605-6th Avenue South in Great Falls , Montana. These kinds of personal experiences for some reason attach themselves to the psychi of those individuals and never let go, who wouldn&apos;t feel a special bond to these events that defy logic according to investigators that remain true to their integrity? This is yet another unexplained event that now appears to be totally erased from the record books because of government involvement. The priest I mentioned earlier is in a housing facility run by the church for aging priests in Great Falls . This priest was contacted by me the morning of that Maltesse Cross had hovered over our tree. I spoke with Father Herinko a number of times about this event and told him that for some reason or another I was certain that Light would remain in the area for three more days and could be spotted above in the evening sky&apos;s canopy in its original shape in a northwest trajectory as a group of distinguished cloud formations resembling that Maltesse Cross or wheel with spokes; you think that during that time satillites would have detected this formation, maybe the military did! I expect the Great Falls Tribune that had front page coverage of this event from so many callers would still have information on this case in question, I think they do, but find it very difficult to locate. That priest after that event was over was removed from his position at Our Lady of Lourdes Church and placed in a small church about 30 miles out of town on Highway 200, I believe the town was Fort Shaw that serves about 150 perishioners. I found that stra! nge seei ng he was only in his earlier fifties and was the priest in charge of not only the church services, but the grade school it operated in the community of Great Falls . Well, that night of the Maltesse Cross incident I told my wife as we stood 30 feet from that tree looking up at the swirling mass of black ink and that extremely white soft halo that divided the two prominent features into very distinct patterns that I should go and venture up to the tree and climb-up and see what if anything would occur... she ruled against it and seemed only interested in going back into the house and finishing her sleep. The police car was still parked in the middle of the street watching the figure with, I suspect, much interest. I imagine the police report was sanitized, as well in this actual case of multiple sightings that week, it shouldn&apos;t have been. Maybe you can further investigate and inform me as to what your findings were! Another aspect of this event which was discussed with the priest was the Montana State License Plate on my Vehicle, &quot; Sacrum&quot;. I had mailed one of these license plates to Pope John Paul II with a note that his life was in immediate mortal danger, that was 7 days from the attempt on his life where he was shot and a bullet struck his sacrum bone, go figure... I had never written a letter like that to anyone before, quite a coincidence, I had never communicated with the church prior to this event, but I did have an undeniable urge to get personalized license plates earlier that year... it was a plate that caused some interest with local officals, I retired that license plate after that incident. I was mostly consumed with getting my wife pregnant, my doctor told me forget it after numerous visits to his office... around 9 months after the Maltesse Cross incident we had a son... in 1983. His eyes were as if oriental, that&apos;s always puzzled me a bit. He&apos;s a good son, he works two jobs, has graduated from college with 3 degrees in business, I feel I&apos;m very blessed to have him. It&apos;s funny how life evolves, it&apos;s amazing the mysteries that sometimes make those blessings seem all the more important in our own particular lives. If you find the information concerning this event in Great Falls during that time frame drop me a line, at the time I failed to document this important event in my life seeing it was all over the news at the get go.((name deleted))", "Wavey  Wings with Strobe Lights !!!!

The object stayed behind (about 1 mile) and to the right or south of the airliner.  The object was so bright, that after the airliner disappeared in the horizon, the object could still be seen.  I have seen this same object in 1960, 1984 and now in 2008.  The previous objects made a low humming sound as they passed overhead.  This object did not pass overhead, it was to the south of my position, and so I don&apos;t know if it made the same sound or not.", "This was January 1, 1997.  I was backpacking in the Mark Twain Forest of Missouri.  It was about 11pm.  I was sitting on a rock in the middle of a clearing watching the sky and saw 4 lights.  If they had been motionless they would not have been detected because they looked exactly like just another group of stars.  They formed a perfect box shape at first. They moved exactly together.  Making squares, diagonals, all sorts of movements in all directions and most of the time staying in this box formation, but varying it a little. I watched this for about ten minutes, same thing over and over. They were very clearly there.  Then all at once they stopped and about a half a second later, they broke formation and all spun out in weird spiraling ways in the opposite direction until they were gone out of sight which only took about another half a second.", "Large green glow no falling starDriving south Rock Port on outer road next I-29 exit, my daughters boyfriend &amp; I saw what we thought was a falling star.

This caused us to wonder what it was since helicopters and planes usually have other lights distinguishing it as such.  It did not make any noise.

It was most likely reflecting light as opposed to being illuminated or a flame.  No wings or propellers in sight, no noise. It seemed to go slowly across the sky then pick up speed.

We just went through a town called Eagle.  In the far distance you could see the bright lights of London, Ontario reflecting off the clouds.  The lit up clouds were darker the further away from the city like it always would until it got pitch black. Well right before it got pitch black, I noticed this very long and straight dark patch.  I just thought it was a cloud, but when we kept driving, I noticed that it was a perfectly straight line coming from this blackness.  We kept driving and we started to go under this black object.  The object was not moving through the air.  It wasn&rsquo;t moving at all.I told the girlfriend to slow down so she could look at it but she didn&rsquo;t want to stop the vehicle and possibly wake the baby. We drove under the object and that is when I knew that it wasn&rsquo;t anything from this world.It was dark with no lights, and the part I could see that was out of the pitch black clouds was at least 2 kilometres long. The bottom of it was flat and perfectly straight. It wasn&rsquo;t very tall. I would guess around 50 meters tall. When we drove under it, I saw that both sides were perfectly straight, narrowing from the base (which was in the clouds) to its square ended tip. It looked a lot like a black airport runway up in the sky.There are a lot of UFO sightings in the rural parts of south western Ontario. You just have to get outside at night or early in the morning.I&rsquo;ve seen another one with my dad in around 5am and another with a friend of mine some night a year or so ago.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

My brother the driver was first to see the object and quickly pointed it out to the passengers.  They all claim that the object moved from a point high above a cloud to a position at the same level as the cloud where the orb then disappeared.  It moved at a speed possibly 2 to 3 times that of a commercial airliner and was slightly smaller than the size of the moon in the sky. They also claim that the orb had a sort of haze around it for the entire five seconds that the orb existed.

I saw a small flashing white light in the sky. It was a white dot and appeared to be quite small &amp;/or far away. At first I just assumed it was an airplane...we live on a US military base and seeing planes is very common. However, after a few minutes I realized the light wasn&rsquo;t moving. It was just hovering in one place, flashing.About 20 minutes from my house there is another military base. That base is a major US Air Force base and has a huge flight line. From my bedroom window I can clearly see the glow of the lights on that flight line. The object I saw appeared to be hovering directly above the flight line. The dot of light mainly stayed white, but occasionally it would change to white at the bottom and red at the top. It flashed the entire time I watched it. About three or four times, it changed shape from a dot into a short straight vertical line. After about 20 or 30 minutes of watching it, it started flashing slower and 3 very tiny white flashing lights came out from it. They came out one at a time and sped off. They each came out of the &ldquo;light&rdquo; in a different place (the first on the left, the next on the right, and the last at the top) and they each went off in a different direction (they shot quickly in a straight line from where they came out).My husband witnessed the object also, but he did not witness the 3 small ones. I kept watching the object for an hour or so, whereas he lost interest and stopped watching after only about ten minutes. My husband and I are both very level-headed, educated people. I am a housewife and mother, a former CNA, and am currently a mortuary student. My husband is an active duty military service member. We do not have a fascination with UFO&rsquo;s and have never claimed to see anything like this before.Apparently other people witnessed it as well though, because I got online today looking for answers about what it was and found a video posted online by someone in a nearby area that was recorded last night.", "Orange object flying near jetliner.While doing yard work somewhere around 8pm I heard an airliner flying over. The plane was flying east along a common route. I noticed just above the craft, maybe a few thousand feet or so an orange oval object. The object did not change color or shape, and was flying slower than the airliner. I quickly looked around to see if it&apos;s a reflection. The sun had already set, and it was still too bright for satellites to be visible. I am an amateur astronomer and astrophotography, I often track satellites. I continued to watch the object till it was too far away to see. The brightness and color remained the same the entire time. The orange color was similar to maybe an afterburner flame from a fighter jet, or from a rocket engine. The size and shape when I first saw it was similar to an oval pill held at arms length. It was moving too slow to be a fireball, and with its consistent speed and shape there is no way it could have been something burning up. My other thought was it being a balloon or a blimp, but again, it was too steady and seemed to be moving faster than I&apos;ve seen any blimp go. The shape was very smooth, nothing coming off the sides or anything else.", "Saw a Bird Shaped UFO flying towards Dallas, no noiseI went outside, July 16, 4am in the morning, to let my dogs out, and happened to look up and saw a somewhat bird shaped ufo flying away from me, southeast towards Dallas.  It was making absolutely no noise and looked like it was about the size of a medium sized aircraft.  The aircraft had white markings on it and was dark looking, or else it was clear and I was seeing through it....It had only two lights on the back of the aircraft, and when it sensed me looking at it, it flew upwards into the clouds and dissappeared.  I hesitated to file this report as I have filed one earlier in the year.....I have also noticed small &quot;V&quot; formations in the sky, at times,  up at around 500 feet,  that have lights on them (3 or 4). Sometimes they move but most of the times they stay still....When I do happen to see them, I always see two and have seen them on two or three occassions, all in the middle of the night.", "Floating silver object over Utah.While driving on my way back from Bryce, Utah, the sky was unusually blue and cloudless and needing to take my eyes off the monotonous road for a few moments, I looked up at about a 30 degree angle so I could still keep an eye on my driving. I spotted a silver object hovering in the sky. Taking it for a plane, I returned my focus to the road. But within a few seconds, I glanced up again to see where the plane had moved to and it was still in the same spot. I watched it with full concentration, thinking perhaps it was a plane flying toward me, so it would soon get bigger as it approached. But it didn&apos;t. It stayed in the same exact spot. As I observed it longer, I noticed it was round in shape, not long and thin like an airplane and bright silver against the sky. I had to return my attention to driving again but when I returned my gaze, thinking the unidentified object was probably gone, it was still there. This charade lasted about five minutes. I literally blinked and it had vanished. I searched around the sky as thoroughly I could but it was nowhere to be seen.", "UFO near nuclear plant.I live in Metropolis, Ill. just about 15 miles east of Grand Chain. Let me give you the geography of were we are. Metropolis is the home of a plant that makes R238 or some kind of chemical for nuclear bombs. I beleive they call it &quot;yellowcake.&quot;  Over the Ohio river (in Kentucky) there is another plant  that takes this &quot;yellowcake,&quot; and refines it into, well, only the government knows.  In other words there is a lot of uranium in this area.One Sunday myself and two of my friends were on the road between Joppa, Ill, and Grandchain, Ill. This road runs a mile or two north of the Ohio River, but there are places that you can see the river. And this spot was one of those places. We just passed over the Cache River bridge and was coming on a little rise and curve.  My male friend was driving, a female friend was in the passenger seat, and I was in the back seat behind the driver. I&apos;ve been down that road hundreds of times so I knew to look to the south to get a view of the river. Something caugh my eye just over the Illinois bank of the river.  I&apos;m no good judging heights, but I would say it was 1000 ft. over the trees.Well, I don&apos;t care if you believe me or not. I don&apos;t want any plubicity.What it was, was an airplane, I don&apos;t know much about planes but I swear to God it looked just like a piper cub, the kind where the wings are on top of the plane. ??  From the very instant I saw the plane I knew somthing was wrong.  The windows weren&apos;t transparent.  The windows looked like it had silver looking tinting, and the plane was not moving at all.  It was just setting there.  I don&apos;t recall ever saying a word to my friends.  As we were moving along the road  I kept watching the plane and all the sudden this huge green fireball came down to earth and exploded on the ground 3 times.  But made no noise at all. (Now keep in mind that that Kentucky nuclear plant is in sight just across the river).The wierdest part of this whole thing was right after the explosions (I&apos;ll never forget this), I was turning my head around to look foreward I watched my two friends heads turn back foreward at the same time mine did.  We never said a word about it just went on down the road like nothing ever happened.  It&apos;s like we forgot about it.Even though this happened back in 1976 we never spoke about this to one another.  EVER!  The female friend of mine died about 4-5 years ago of cancer and we never said a word about it to each other.  Every time we were around each other we just, I guess forgot or was blocked from saying anything to each other about it.  But another strange fact is that I can tell other people about what I had saw.  But after a few rolling eyes, I thought it best just to keep it to myself. I&apos;m getting older now and I had to tell someone that may actually believe me.  I&apos;m just getting my first computer.  And if we were abducted I&apos;m not going to be hypnotized to remember it.  Another funny thing is that I saw a show on ufo&apos;s once and they were talking about having small pieces of metal in thier bodies.  Well, in 1987 I had surgury on my arm for radial tunnel.  The Dr. showed me my x-ray on day and ask what those two pieces of metal were.  Smaller than a BB and lodged just above my elbow on my left arm.  I have never injured my are in that location.If you don&apos;t believe me, thats fine. I have never heard of a ufo looking like an airplane before either. But I swear this on my Grandma&apos;s.I forgot to mention one thing.  There isn&apos;t a time I go by there that I don&apos;t think about that day.  I moved to Texas in 1979 and moved back to Metropolis in 1985.  My wife and I went down that road one day and the state of Illinois has bought the same property that thing exploded on and put a resturant right over the spot.Let me give you my summation of what we went through. [maybe] (1) If it was a UFO they can transform there crafs to look just like earth planes [because there was no dought in my mind that thing I saw looked like a plane]  (2) Some kind of mind control was used on us or we would have been able to speak to each other about what we had saw.  (3) And it scares me to think I&apos;ve got some kind of transmitter lodged in my arm.I&apos;ll probably think of more things later that I wish I had said to you but had forgot.

My friend and I were sitting on our bikes one night. We were sitting on them in the middle of the street in Del Rio, Texas. The streets were 11th and Ave B. We were talking and for some reason we both looked up. I guess we had both heard a subtle air or whisper sound. I couldn&rsquo;t really tell you that we heard much of anything. I just know that some kind of noise or feeling made us both look up right at it at the same time. It&rsquo;s not like we ever sat out there looking at stars. We were facing North east and the craft was heading north west. It was a diamond shape made up of faint lights. There were no lights visible inside the diamond. It looked as if it was going maybe 70 to 80 MPH and was about a mile above us. Maybe as big as a football field. It was as if it was disguised within the starts of the night. But we could see the diamond. There is an airforce base in Del Rio and I am familiar with just about every kind of craft that flies out of that base. My Dad worked there for 30 years and I grew up there. This was big, cloaked and whisper quiet. We ran inside screaming, told my friends mom and that was all we saw. Never saw it again.", "Black small arrow head shaped UFO very highI was sitting in the white plastic rocker on the patio behind the house today. It wasn&apos;t too hot so I decided to sit out there and enjoy the sky, trees, garden, birds etc. I had the rocker reclined a little bit and I had true polarized $20.00 pair of sunglasses on. It was ten minutes after 6:00 pm this evening. The Sun was up where the big tree is behind the storage barn and the tree was almost blocking the Sun which was partially behind the leaves and high clouds which enabled me to be able to look at the sky without the glare of the hot Sun drilling down this time of year. This is when I saw it. The UFO was very high at least 5 miles high,  the same height that the higher passenger jets fly. It was arrow shaped and black and it was slightly larger than this carrot character     `    . It traveled slowly threw the sky and it wasn&apos;t a bird or a jet. It flew steady and slow and was shaped like an arrow head. It traveled from west-southwest to the east-northwest. I ran in the basement up the steps to grab my 12+ zoom Panasonic zoom camera in the dining room. I ran back down to the patio and realized I needed my reading glasses so that I could see the settings on the dial on the camera. I ran back up to the kitchen and grabbed them and then ran back down to the patio. When I looked up I realized that I had left my polarized sunglasses on the kitchen table. Without the polarized sunglasses the glare from the Sun was too great and I could not look up. I ran back up to the kitchen and grab my polarized sunglasses and then ran back down to the patio again. Sat back down in the chair put on my reading glasses so that I could see the icons on the camera dial. Then I took the reading glasses off and placed my sunglasses back on and there it was. As soon as looked back up where I saw the UFO to aim the camera it had vanished. Damn, I saw it and it was there and I was going to zoom in on it and take photos. I think it was a government type of aircraft and not an alien UFO. I think the way the Sun was behind the high thin clouds and the tree leaves partially blocking the Sun and the polarized sunglasses that somehow had enabled me to see it. Think they have discovered a way to bend light waves or absorb them it such a way that the aircraft can be rendered invisible to the human eye for the most part, at least that is the impression I got from the perspective that I was able to see it.", "i saw about 10 objects in sky moving in strange way  i saw about 10 objects in sky moving in strange way((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

But the strange movement caught both of our eyes.  All of a sudden, it turned and moved very slowly in our direction and flew directly over us.  As we looked up, it didn&apos;t appear to resemble the shape of a helicopter, but almost like a giant oblong boat.  Although it was night and we couldn&apos;t see it clearly, there didn&apos;t appear to be any helicopter-like propellers.  I would have to say that the lights were probably consistent with that of a helicopter.  Nonetheless, it scared the be-jesus out of the both of us.

The area is between my grandparents house and my great aunt house. I got out of my truck noticing my headlamp needed batteries. I had gotten out my gun and was proceeding to get my hunting clothes and some spare batteries, when I heard some dry palm fronds cracking about 50 to 60 yards away. The moon was about half full and I believe it was waxing at the time. I noticed a very tall figure that seemed to look ash gray colored and seemed to be looking straight at me. I was having a difficult time  realizing what exactly I was looking at. In just a brief second, the being began moving across in front of me at an amazing stride. I realized this was really happening to me and quickly grabbed  and loaded my gun, not knowing what to expect. the being proceeded across in font f me approximately 35 to 40 yards until it came to the end of the yard. Then, in this amazing stride it stepped over(not jumped) a 6 strand bob wire fence. The fence was about 41/2 to 5 ft tall.For about 5 seconds U thought I was going crazy, and started to doubt my eyes. Then, all of the sudden, about 150 -175 yards away, a flock of sandhill cranes just erupted and went crazy cackling and slapping wings. I started thinking h my god,thi is really happening. then out of no where I saw a flash of light that appeared in the shape of an oval about 20 feet long to my left about 50 ft. the flash was almost that of a camera but only n the ground in a specific place to my left. I very quickly decided to get back in my truck and wait until day light to go hunting. As I calmed down, I realized this being didn&apos;t seem to have any body hair . I never saw the face. It was very slender with long legs and arms. I was VERY uncomfortable in the deer stand that morning and got out of the woods early that day. I reluctantly decided to talk to y grandparent about  what happened in fear for them because they are in their mid eighties. My grandpa told me he had heard something tapping on his window a few days before. they then told me to tell the police, who referred me to the local game warden. He suggested that I go out to the open field where the being had stepped over the fence and look for tracks. At that time only a few feet into the field (which was thick mud mostly). I found the first track. It was about 11 inches long about four inches wide at the toes. their were only three toes. It was about 3 inches wide at the  heal. I found a total of 3 tracks: 1 Full track and 2 partials. The stride was about 6 to 7 feet long. I reported it to the game warden who seemed to be uninterested in believing me. So I unintelligently decided to just leave this issue alone. Hunting early in the morning has been very difficult for me now since the encounter. I thought this happened in late October. after reviewing the star I marked in my journal, I realized the exact date was Nov. 4th. I apologize for letting you and other people down by not moving forward sooner. If ever given the opportunity again (which seem amazingly li! kely) to me, I promise to report the incident immediately.", "Triangle UFO above Corning, NY.My friend and I were driving around late at night. We stopped for a moment on Spencer Hill Road to drink some soda, eat some snacks, and listen to music on his car stereo. He had a Honda Civic with a sunroof and I took a minute to look up at the sky which was clear with only a few clouds. I noticed a set of 3 lights in a triangle pattern hovering about a half mile or so above his car. The lights were plain white lights which did not blink. The object emitted no sound at all. I guessed its size to be no larger than 200 feet but admittedly it is hard to gauge size at night with no reference. I told my friend to look up and he saw the lights too. We thought it was maybe an airplane but it was not moving and was too quiet. It also was too big to be a helicopter and we would have heard it if it was. We even turned the car off and turned the music off to confirm it made no noise. We got creeped out by the situation and decided to drive down the road. As we started driving the object began to follow the direction of the car. I could now clearly see that it was an opaque equilateral triangular object and the stars within the triangle were obscured. We drove faster and faster and the object continued to follow in the direction of the car. We finally got to the outskirts of the city of Corning and the late night fog began to obscure the sky. When we were fully into the city we drove to my apartment. My friend was spooked out as well so he drove home. I was so terrified that I could not sleep and I kept looking up at the sky. Later that night there was a loud thunderstorm. We were scared by the encounter and we told a few friends who believed us. We spent the next week or so driving around late at night seeing if it would come back but it never did. Weeks later my girlfriend at the time(who I am now married to) says that there were military helicopters flying low over the city as if they were looking for something. I never told her about the UFO sighting until after she told me about the helicopters. ----------------- Please do not include this final part of my message if you put this report on your website: I have grown up around aircraft and helicopters since I was young. I am now an Aviation Structural Mechanic for the U.S. Navy. I have seen literally thousands of foreign and domestic military and civilian aircraft at day and during night. I have seen military aircraft at night with just formation lights on. I have seen confidential and secret aircraft operating at night as well. I have also worked at several military installations in the desert. I can say that the object which my friend and I saw late that night was no military or civilian aircraft. I wrote down my experience a long time ago but never reported it until this day. This message I am writing now is basically a transcription of what I wrote a long time ago. After I told a friend about this sighting he said that there were triangle UFOs seen in Belgium. I looked up a photo of one of these UFOs and the one we saw is similar. The only difference is that the UFO we saw did not have a triangle in the middle. It only had triangle lights near the points. I am reporting this UFO sighting for historical purposes. I hold a security clearance with the military and I do not want to have my name connected to anything which could hurt my clearance. I believe in UFOs and I believe that the job you are doing is worthy of merit. I do not have any other UFO sightings to report except this one. I am sorry it is not sensational, but I assure you it is truthful. Thank you.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))", "As many as 6 bright lights darting up and down, and then disappearing.My Son and his Wife sit on their front porch every night, and see these lights which look like stars dance across the sky.....darting up and down....then disappearing. I came to visit them from Oregon and all of us watched these lights dance across the sky. You can almost set your watch to catch them every night at the same time.", "Witnessed UFO stationairy, begin to slowly move, went near vertical and literally climbed out of the atmosphere at incredable speed!I had stepped outside onto my back 2nd story porch for a cigarette and stood and admired the sky and stars as I do everynight. A particularly bright object that appeared to be a star or planet caught my attention and I proceeded to stare at it. The object was stationairy and appeared no different looking than a bright star so I quickly dimissed it. The object was stationairy from the time I came out onto the porch and first noticed it (10-15 seconds).The object was directly East of my location and situated high in the sky, about 25-30 degrees off of being directly vertical over me and at a 70-75 degree angle in the sky off the horizon.I was about to look away and stare at another patch of sky when I noticed that the object started moving to the North. It moved slowly and at a constant speed in a straight line at a constant altitude, which made me think that maybe it was an airplane coming to or from DFW airport which is very close. But the object appeared to be at very high altitude, higher than I&apos;ve ever seen a plane fly, and as I scrutinized it I could not see any blinking lights that distinguish aircraft and are usually visible at any altitude. The object was a solid and constant sphere shaped light that again looked similar to a bright star. It quickly became obvious it was NOT an airplane but I still didn&apos;t think UFO. So then I start thinking I&apos;m seeing a satellite or something go overhead in orbit. I continue observing the object move East to North across the sky expecting to watch it (thinking its a satellite) arch across the sky. But after 8-10 seconds of slow moving predictable flight the object began to move erraticly and looked to be gaining altitude because the object was getting dimmer and dimmer the higher and further away it got from me. The object also began to accellerate, slowly at first while it zigzagged but then it really started picking up speed! I mean at the high altitude the object was at, for it to move that fast across the sky it must&apos;ve been doing incredible speed. I have never seen something accellerate so fast! As the object accellerated it climbed near vertical and, well, &quot;ascended into space&quot; is the best way I could describe it. It did NOT continue travelling across the sky, it accellerated to unbelievable speed and went near vertical and appeared to rapidly climb out of the atmosphere. IT DID NOT just disappear behind some trees or over the horizon, it went near straight UP and disappeared overhead as it accellerated away! When I saw the object start to move like gravity didn&apos;t effect it, and move as unbeilveably fast as it did, an icy ball materialized in my stomach, and I felt genuine fear rush over ! me like a wave, when it became obvious that this could not possibly be a plane or satellite. I saw it, it&apos;s real! Total event time 25-30 seconds from the time I came onto the porch and witnessed the object stationairy (10-15 secs) start to move slowly (8-10 secs) and then zigzag, climb, and accelerate upward near vertical until out of sight overhead (3-5 secs). NOTE: I live within 10 miles of DFW airport and I see dozens of planes fly overhead everyday. I was born and raised here 24 years and have always seen and been used to aircraft going overhead every couple minutes 24/7, 365. The only day in my entire life that I have not seen an airplane in the sky is 9/11/2001.  My father is a 30 year veteran 777 captain for American Airlines, so I&apos;ve been raised on planes, and can identify almost any aircraft (military or civilian) if shown a picture of it. I am personally a Baylor University Student studying International Relations.", "weird round silver sphere like object but not a perfect sphere!On the way to the banl I had seen a large very reflective silver or metal looking ball in the sky. I thought it was a balloon but it had no basket and was not shaped like a balloon. I drove a bit faster through some tree overhang and by the time I got into the clear looking in the same direction it was gone. I don&apos;t believe in UFO&apos;s but I think I had seen something that I&apos;m not use to seeing in broad day light around 6 or 7 pm.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

This was possibly the largest mass sighting of a UFO ever. In May of 1983 I flew out to San Bernadino, CA to attend the US Festival 83. It was a very large 3 day concert featuring some of the biggest names in Rock music. While attending this show on the first day, I heard someone say they saw a UFO, I looked but didn&apos;t see anything at that time...I believe that it was about 2 or 3 PM but it was 25 years ago now and the exact times are a guess at this point. I watched several bands and then it began getting dark. I believe that the Australian band Men At Work were playing when I noticed a Dark metallic disk shaped object hovering about 25 yards from me just below the low cloud cover we had that evening. It just floated there silently for approximately 10 minutes. Many people attending saw this object (one girl even began screaming) and even the singer for the band made some comment about the object between songs. Then the disk silently began to rise at a very slow speed and disappeared into the low cloud cover. I wouldn&apos;t even report it except that there is photographic evidence taken by a photographer from the concert and it is on a website that commemorates the 3 day show.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))", "A perfectly round blue shining sphere rose from a swampy area and flew in a deliberate fashion over the area .I would like to inform you of a sighting that I had in the late 90&rsquo;s and never reported (I did not know your organization existed).  The reason I am contacting you now is that, last night, Wed 07/09/08, I was watching the UFO Files on the tube and was shocked beyond belief at what I saw.  The program was describing a sighting that took place in the 1600&rsquo;s or 1700&rsquo;s by the crew of a sailing vessel.  The object in the animation, that was built from the written accounts of the sighting was exactly what I saw one afternoon in San Juan Puerto Rico.  I was doing a preflight inspection of my aircraft and while walking around the nose of the aircraft I saw an object ascend from a swampy area just off the concrete area of the apron, approx. 150 yards.  The object was a very shiny blue with the color slightly darker toward the top and a little lighter toward the bottom.  What caught my attention at first was it was a perfect sphere.  It rose slowly at first going straight up to a height of about 200 to 300 feet.  It stopped just for a second then slowly started moving in the direction of the city, toward the west.  As it moved it appeared to gain altitude slightly and veer a little then it gained speed until it was over the town.  At that point it went straight up at a very fast pace.  I lost sight of the object at that point.  Except for the slight veering it did while moving from my location to town all changes in direction were at right angles. Also it made now sound that I could hear. Why I thought this was not some natural object was because of it&rsquo;s color, exact shape and right angle movements.  The object itself was exactly like what was described on the UFO Files last night.   What also is fascinating to me is that the object from my sighting and the sighting I reference is 300 years or more apart.", "The object came after me after I tried to take a picture and I think the camera flash caused it all.I was just a few miles outside of San Antonio putting gas in my car and after I left, while at the four way stop I noticed an object in the sky above a field. At first I thought it was a U.S.Border Patrol Helicopter tracking illegals. But then it moves rapidly across the sky. The only way to describe how fast it moved and ca,e to a complete stop, is just like the pointer on the computer when you slide the mouse across the screen. This gained my interest so i tried to use my cell phone video but I couldn&apos;t get anything on the screen. So I just drove towards it and when I got close enough to see what it was, it climbed higher in to the sky where i couldn&apos;t make it out. I parked my car and went and got my camera out of the trunk. When I focused on the object I still could see exactly what it was but I could see it flashing it&apos;s lights. they went from red to green to blue to yellow then all the colors at the same time. I snapped the picture and as soon as the flash on my camera went off the object started coming closer to me. At this point I thought the safer place to be was in my car. As the boject got closer it began flashing just like a camera flash. I drove away as fast as I could and then the object passed over my car and disappeared. It was only about a minute later that I saw the object slong side of my car. I only noticed it when it began to flash again. I text my friend and let her know what was going on. By the way, she is the one that gave me this number. Anyway, I took an exit an headed towards Cambleton. I figured I would try and drive to the only store there and just kinda let whatever it was go away. There was nothing open in Cambleton and then I saw the object again just over me and it flashed again. Then I figured the only thing safer to do was to get back on Interstate Highway 37. As I was driving down the road headed back to IH-37, the object was there. This time I saw it. It was at car level and just to my side. It is the strangest thing I have ever seen in my entire life. It looked like a helicopter and the texture of it was just like looking at the pavement on the road but it had a white glow all around it. The object passe me up on the drivers side of my car and went up about 100 yards in front of me. I stopped my car as fast as I could and the object came closer towards me . I just sat there for a few seconds trying to think of what I was going to do next. I tried to call my friend to tell her what I was facing but my phone would not work at this point. I reversed but the object quickly gained distance between us. So I just put the car in park and said enough is enough. I am a police officer and I always carry my side arm with me so I grabbed it and got out of my car. As I raised my weapon and pointed towards the object, it let out multiple stobes of flash blinding me and I must say the heat was quite intense. So I lowered my weapon since I couldn&apos;t see then the flashing stopped. I yelled at the thing while gaining my vision back but all I could hear was my car and nothing else. After a few moments of nothing happening just looking at the thing in front of me not moving just floating idle . I raised my weapon again and the flashing began again and just the same stopped when I lowered it. After gaining my vision back I got back into my car and tried to reverse again. It came towards me and flew over my car then I put my car in drive and drove towards IH-37. The object was nowhere to be seen . After making it back onto IH-37, I drove for a while and then here was the object again a few minutes later. I stayed with me for about thirty more minutes flashing at me and then going away momentarily back and forth. At this point I made the call to your office and left a message. Then I came up to a thunder storm and the object just gained altitude and I never saw it again.So after getting home and not really sleeping to much when I did wake up in the morning I noticed I was sun burned. That&apos;s my weird story . This isn&apos;t in any way a hoax or a joke.In fact I wish it never would have happened. However I do want to get some sort of answer or expalnation as to what it could have been. Please take this serious and if you can not get me some sort of answer then could you please put me in contact with someone who may have some answers for me. Thank you.", "Bright red light hauling ass through the sky.At about 5:10 am me and my brother went in my backyard for a smoke. at this time the sun was coming up, but the moon and two stars were visible. we saw a bright red-ish light to the south and in less than a minute it had went from west to east and disappeared into the clouds. it made no noise and was moving very fast. we could not see the shape.", "Large jet like sound hovering in the neighborhood for an hourJust after midnight, I heard loud sound like low flying jet approaching.  It got louder, but then it did not pass as jet sounds usually do.  Then it stayed in the area, likely within a mile of my house near Bradford college.  It seemed to stay mostly in the same spot, but occasionally sound got louder or quieter, and sound direction changed about 10 to 20 degrees (on a compass).   It was so loud my wife heard it with all the windows closed and Air conditioner on.  I don&apos;t know why more people did not wake up.   I couldn&apos;t see anything, although it was a little cloudy on the horizon.  When I went outside I thought I could feel the turbulence in the air.  Sometimes the turbine sound was joined by a high pitched whirr.  But the turbine sound was a much lower frequency than that of large passenger jets, which made me think it had to be a very very large turbine.  The sounds lasted for about 30 minutes, then went away, then came back just as loud around 1am for another 10 minutes or so.", "Myself and 4 other people saw 7 yellow lights hovering in the sky each one appearing and disappearing onme by oneI&apos;m not sure exactly what my husband and I saw, but we think it might have been a UFO formation.  I was taking my husband back to work at 10:16pm when we stopped at a red light.  In the east-southeast ww saw 3 yellow lights about 45 degrees up in the sky.  The lights were in a straight horizontal line, and were evenly spaced apart.  They looked like this:  &quot;. . .&quot; I asked my husband what he thought they could be.  I originally thought it was flares that someone had sent up.  As the light turned green and we started to make a left another light appeared above and slightly to the right of the light farthest to the left.  It just appeared out of nowhere.  My husband and I thought this was rather strange, so we continued turning left and then pulled over and parked in a parking lot and got out of the car.  About 10 seconds after the new light appeared, the light on the lower left side faded away.  About 10 seconds after that, another light appeared above the original lights, next to new light, but spaced out more.  ABout 10 seconcds after that the middle light on the bottem faded, 10 seconds later another light appeared next to the new lights, also evenly spaced out.  About 10 seconds after that the last light on the bottom faded away, and 10 seconds after that a firth light appeared next to the others on the top. The were also in a straight horizontal line evenly spaced, but these were more spaced out than the first 3.  They looked more like this:  &quot;.   .   .   .&quot; I&apos;ll try to give you a picture of what happened as best I can on the computer.10:16pm  . 10:18pm  .10:18pm  .10:19pm  .  10:19pm  .   10:19pm  .    10:20pm  . The 4 lights stayed stationary in the sky for about 5 minutes.  My husband called his boss and told him to come look outside, he was maybe 1/2 mile from where we were.  A couple of other people came out also and one of them got a recording onhis cell phone of the 4 lights and them fading away one by one.

It moved slowly toward the northeast, and though I was driving near 70, I didn&rsquo;t seem to get any closer.  It took a slow turn toward the southeast, parallel to 290.  The roof of my car began to obscure it, and I had to lean forward and look to the right to keep it in view, glancing every few seconds at the road to keep from swerving.  During one of these glances, the object either disappeared or darted off.

Anyway we were standing on the porch with a view of about 10-20 miles across the marshland when I noticed a strange light in the distance. I didn&apos;t pay attention to it at first we went inside for a few minutes came out and noticed this object was much larger as it had gotten closer and was spinning brilliantly.  Iam ex military and very familiar with aircraft and thought for a minute it was a blimp because there was a football field not to far from there and I could see the flood lights from the game but then noticed how large this object was.  I knew how far we were from the football field and the distance between us on the barrier island and the mainland which is where this object was, was about 7-10 miles.  It was hovering, spinning horizontaly, the best description is a Faberge Egg, multiple colors, each set of lights was spinning independently, in the opposite direction of each other. This object was over the marshland where there is nothing, no houses just some waterways. This object appeared to be about a mile or so from the mainland and 200 feet in the air. A safe guess would be to say it was slightly larger then a dump truck. This event has been burned into my memory for a very long time and I can still visualy I guess, remember it.  Suddenly it just dissapeared.  My friend observed the same thing as well.

Although I do not believe it was that far. The Neon green light sometimes went to red very briefly but at some points the neon green color would be brighter than other times. Then the light would disappear for a moment. From the movement of it did not seem like a plane or a flare or anything of that sort. It just seemed to &ldquo;dance&rdquo; up and down swaying side to side. That is the only way I know how to describe it.

After several seconds of continued orange-yellow color, the object seems to be moving/float at a steady speed seemingly closer to us.  There was no sound of an airplane or medical helicopter.   We watched as it floated across the sky almost 180 degrees in a arch. IT was NOT a firework- it was slower then that! We watched this until it disappeared into the city lights.  A few moments later, a second object identical or very close to it, appeared at the same place we saw the first one appear.  The same sequence of events took place, same route, same speed, same wierd glow of color.  Again, this object disappeared into the lights above the city.  The sky was clear- the smoke from the fireworks had cleared.

HE SAID WHEN HE GOT THEM TO FOCUS ON THE LIGHT AND LOOKED THE LIGHT FLASHED GREEN AND SHOT OFF TO THE NORTH AT A FASTER SPEED, AND DISAPPEARED.ON OUR THIRD AND FINAL SIGHTING THE LIGHT CAME FROM THE WEST AND WAS HEADED IN AN EASTWARD DIRECTION, AGAIN MOVING ABOUT THE SAME SPEED AND THE SAME DISTANCE UP.

I figured take Jennings because it seems to be a little bit quicker then route 62. I spotted a couple deer on the side of the road so I figured drive a little slower and be a little more observant because all I need to do is hit a deer and total my car on what always seems like no traffic road. Way before the 45mph area I noticed three orange lights in the sky in a horizontal line with the center light being larger and brighter then the other two. At first I thought whoa that&rsquo;s a bright airplane and just ruled it off as just that a bright airplane. I drove for a couple more seconds then looked again out of curiosity and noticed it was moving towards Springville and not the Buffalo airport and that the lights were constant and not flashing. This observation caused me to slow down to almost a stop, now my curiosity was peaked, what could this be I thought. So I figured after another couple seconds of driving to just stop and watch it. I pulled over and put on the emergency flashers and got out of my car and climbed on to the roof to get a better view. This craft seemed to moved very slowly for about 5 minutes and then suddenly it stopped moving over what seemed liked woods from my point of view. By this time I was looking more towards Hamburg rather then Buffalo and was getting rather excited. After what seemed like another 5 minutes I got a little too excited and had to take a puff on my inhaler. About another 10 minutes passed and then suddenly all the lights on this craft simultaneously turned bright metallic blue color and then it suddenly vanished, this whole process took at max a minute and well scared me half to death so I got back in my car called my friend told him I would be a little late and left in a hurry. To clarify things it stayed stationary in the sky for 15 minutes then its lights turned metallic blue and it vanished and by vanished I mean it just basical! ly was t here one second and then gone the next leaving no trail no flash no nothing just gone.

More specifically, between Casa Grande and Chandler, East of Maricopa. While driving northwest in my car on I-10, I noticed off in the direction of my drivers-side sideview mirror, something rise up from the earth.  It was about 300 feet west of the freeway.  It immediately caught my eye because it started flying up from the ground. At first it was moving kind of like a helicopter, but looked nothing like a helicopter.  It was dark but I could make out the shape of the object against the Maricopa lit horizon.  It was diamond shaped, with 1 light(white) on 3 of the corners, pointing down (perpendicular to the craft).  The fourth corner had more of a head light pointing in line (parallel) with the craft.  It was probably the size of an actual baseball infield, just a lot thicker. Then it started moving like nothing I have ever seen from an aircraft.  I started to think it was some sort of irrigation type sprinkler of some sort for a crop field.  The object turned vertical (as if the baseball diamond stood up on one side) and was moving as if it were attached to an arm.   It moved on an arc like path for a few seconds and then returned to a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; orientation and started flying, somewhat weaving back and forth, headed slightly more west than NW, not more than 100 feet above the ground.  It was definitely going faster than me (I was going approx. 80) but probably not more than 120mph as it was only moderately leaving me behind. There was a surprising number of other vehicles out which made it hard to try and follow but should also yield some other reports.  It could not have been a helicopter or a normal US airplane due to shape and movement, and I can only classify it as an unidentified flying object.

At first it seemed to be about 25 feet off the ground and about 50&apos; ahead of me. I kept walking toward it to where my car was... and as I stared at the bubble I wondered &quot;how would a bubble survive out here too long? I walked expecting to see it burst any second. It didn&apos;t. As I watched it... I then saw it wasn&apos;t a bubble at all as it started to get almost above me. I stood next to my car. The attached photo is my Photoshop rendering of what I saw, and its pretty accurate. It had been cloudy and drizzy, and there was a low canopy of clouds. I noticed it had two round looking lights and a lighter third in front. No lights blinking. The lights were very clear, and not like you&apos;d expect headlights on a plane. I listened for sound and heard nothing. Then I suspected I was seeing something unusual. I then checked and nothing blinking, no stobe, no red beacon. The lights were not REAL bright but were very pronounced resolution-wise... without halo or atmospheric glaring quality. The blueish round lights seem to be directional, like laser light travels, defined. The seemed about 2.5 or 3 feet in diameter. Then as it started to get over top and past Walmart I knew it was not a plane or chopper. I suspected it was a Black Triangle and I watched to see SOMETHING that would reveal it. Then... it slowed down very gradually... and before it had a chance to STOP... it ascended straight up. I appeared to travel UP faster than it did since I spotted it traveling a horizotal flight path. As it moved up, the position of the lights stayed fixed... meaning that it didn&apos;t turn nose up to ascend. The bottom stayed facing the earth. It went up what looked like around 700-1000&apos; until it pierced the cloud cover and disappeared.  It made no noise. I detected no outline/SHAPE to it... but the lights suggested a triangle. A plane climbing like that would have made noise!!! This thing moved silent;y and very SMOOTHLY. It matched the Triangle video taped at Wesley Chapel a couple months ago... VERY close... minus the blinking read light and the bottom lights were a wider diameter.", "Four orange/reddish objects seen and video tapedMy family and I were watching the fireworks from my backyard when one of us noticed a strange orange/reddish glowing object from the north coming south, towards us.  It was about one half to a mile in the sky and was moving at a good pace.  The object was approximately 20 X 20 (feet) and appeared to be circular.  We didn&rsquo;t think much of the object until it started getting closer and we began to eliminate the possible answers as to what this object could be.  The object didn&rsquo;t give off any engine noise and didn&rsquo;t have any flashing lights on it.  The object flew very straight.  It made a sharp right turn and headed west at the same rate of speed and altitude.  That&rsquo;s when I ran in the house to get my camera.When I returned to the backyard, the third object has appeared from the north, almost coming from the exact same place as the first one.  This one flew in the exact same path as the first one, and according to my other family members, as the second one as well.  I started video taping the object and was able to get a close up of it with my Sony video camera as it moved towards us and to the west.  This is when I could see the object was disc shaped.  Just as the third object was moving out of sight &ndash; the forth object appeared.  I was able to get some good video of the forth one as well.  All four objects followed the exact same flight pattern, speed, and altitude - traveling from north to west and traveling until we couldn&rsquo;t see them any longer.  There were seven adults and my two children that witnessed this event, including an off duty police officer.  We still can&rsquo;t come up with a logical explanation as to what occurred that night.

As I jumped up out of my seat, (thinking I was going to have a Travis Walton Experience), the beam shut off.  The object was hovering.  When the light/beam retracted, the object changed directions, moved even higher, and started moving northeast at a fast rate, until it was out of sight.  My face right now is tingling&hellip;and I am actually shaking, as it scared the hell out of me.  I know this all sounds hard to believe, but I am willing to show you what I saw, and I am willing to take a polygraph.  The object was bright white, and made not a sound.  My face is not sun burned like Richard Dreyfus in Close Encounters, but it is tingling right now.I want someone to sit with me.  You don&rsquo;t even have to look up all night at all.  I will spot it&hellip;and direct you to where it is in the sky.  For some reason, it seemed to want to make contact with me.

It was surprisingly very close to me and so it appeared to be humongous. It looked like it wanted to land and the entire object looked like it was coming down at an angle of approximately 45 degrees and it then would change its angle of dip until it was horizontal(in a very hi-tech manner). It then would wiz I.e. move fast and makes abrupt stops. I thought it was going to land somewhere near by and I continued to pursue it. I was very scared. I did see a few cars on the road. But I have no idea if they spotted the same thing. I also must mention that I saw an airplane above it and it was quite far away in the sky as opposed to this object I saw.

I was looking up at the stars and was looking for meteors. I scanned the whole sky. I looked to the east at about 22 degrees to the east and about 12 degrees to the south from where I was standing from an over head view I suddenly saw four yellowish lights in formation of two even followed by two even. The third was between the first two and the fourth was equidistant as the first two. The formation looked like this:  xxxxxxxUxxxxxxxU   xxxUxxxxxxxU  The U&apos;s represent the objects.  There was no sound and they had to be at least 6 miles up or more. Since it was night it is difficult to tell, but planes at less than that give sound. They were moving at 1/2 meteor speed across the sky. Nothing moves that fast. Aurora is mach 7 from what is documented to the public(replacement for blackbird). I just called the airport and talked with some personal as I was writing this. They say you can hear planes at 40,000 feet. There was no sound. The covered the sky 12 degrees from the overhead to 55 degrees or more in about 1 second. The airport called me back and said they put it in the log.  I will also be contacting the FAA, not for an admission from them but to let them know of the incident. We either we have something that moves at mach 25 plus or it was not of our earth.  This was not a natural formation of any kind.  I have seen hundreds of meteors of all kinds and some people might classify them as something but I knew they were not. After reporting I went back outside and looked up.  I saw a plane very clearly cover the same space.  I could see the wings and it was not coming in for a landing but was moving across the same area but much lower.  There was no sound so this passenger jet had to be 35,000 to 40,000 feet or more.  It took over 40 seconds to transverse the same space at a lower altitude.  Say the passenger jet moves at the standard speed of 500MPH.  1/2 of 40 is 20 for 1000MPH, 1/2 of 20 is 10 for 2000MPH, 1/2 of 10 is 5 for 4000MPH, 1/2 of 5 is 2.5 for 8000MPH, 1/2 of 2.5 is 1.25 for 16,000MPH.

The object was witnessed aboard a McDonnell Douglass MD-82 twin jet aircraft traveling eastbound at 33,000 feet and 497 knots. At the time of the sighting the aircraft was at latitude 37.87 and longitude -79.79, placing the aircraft between Covington and Lexington, VA. The aircraft was in radio contact with the Washington Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC), and traveling between the waypoints ASBUR and DENNY on jet airway 42 (J42).The object was witnessed off of the left side of the aircraft traveling north (right to left) at an extremely high velocity. The object appeared spherical in shape and bright white and glowing in color. The object appeared to leave some sort of contrail, which may have been a distortion of light due to speed. The object contained no other sources of light typically found on civilian aircraft. The object disappeared from horizontal view within 2-3 seconds, moving at a speed much greater that that of an approaching opposite direction jet aircraft. The object had an apparent size of 1/4 the circumference of a full moon, and looked similar to a shooting star or meteorite. Size relative to the aircraft could not be determined. The object appeared to be between 35,000 and 38,000 feet, 2,000-5,000 feet above the aircraft. The trajectory of the object resembled an ascending arch.According to NASA&rsquo;s website, the International Space Station was not in the area at the time of the sighting. Other aircraft were also in the vicinity at the time. The object was witnessed by a more than one person, including trained observers.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and we deem him to be an exceptionally good witness.

After observing the objects thur binocolus it appeared that the objects were crescent shaped. All together we saw 12 objects all being of the same color and same crescent shaped. When the objects left they went straight up and the majority went toward the west and at least two of them went toward the south. The only way that I know how to describe the objects were like they were dancing in the sky. But when they left they left in a hurry...

As it got closer, the light appeared to glow very red and seemed to hover or slow down for a few seconds. After this few seconds, two similar lights appeared behind it travelling side by side.It was as if the first light was waiting for the other two to catch up with it They just seemed to hover for a few moments, and then moved a short distance, hovering for a while, and then carried on into the distance, remaining in this formation.There was no sound from them.

Viewed at an approximate angle of 30 degrees the objects were approximately 15 inches apart, to our vision. It would place them, I believe, somewhere over Wales, possibly the Brecon Beacons area. They moved slowly and gradually got fainter until they faded away as if leaving orbit or the influence of the Suns reflectivity. The whole sighting time was about 15 minutes.As they disappeared, a faint star (as it appeared to be) flashed brightly, about 3 times, approximately 3 to 4 minutes apart as if it was a distant sun flaring. Following this a bright white light travelled West to East, appearing to have a trail, to the naked eye, passing under the Plough, the approximate sighting time of this was 2 seconds. Shortly afterwards we observed 2 meteor/space junk burn outs in the Western sky (shooting stars). Nothing further was seen after 23:30.

I saw, to the North, a white, but slightly yellowish oval approaching the airport just above the treetops. The oval was horizontal to the horizon. From the size, I judged it to be an approaching airliner a long way off, but one that seemed too far away to have been on it&rsquo;s glide path that early. It wavered laterally and vertically just slightly, as it approached (these changes in position were slow and gradual). I estimate it was about a half mile out from the runway when it appeared to slow down. As it grew darker- to a grayish color &ndash; and very slowly shrunk in size, I realized that it had changed course and was traveling almost due West. I could still see it bob and weave &ndash; but very faintly as it drifted off. I was on the phone with a Dane County Sheriff as the object finally dropped below the treetops and I could see it no more. The object reminded me of a 20 &ndash; 30 foot Mylar balloon mimicking an ultra light aircraft in a moderate wind.The dispatcher said she would notify the Sheriff&rsquo;s Office in DeForest &ndash; the town over which I estimated it was when I lost sight of it.

I&apos;m excited.", "It is interesting to me tht I&apos;ve had three encounters.I am reporting my experiences having noticed the heightened awareness of UFO&rsquo;s, i.e. the History Channel.  Therefore, I am submitting these events purely for the sake of your collection of data. I&apos;m sorry but I prefer to put all reports into this one, I hope you don&apos;t mind.Experience 1 of 3 It was in 1967.  I was 12 years old living on a farm in Kansas.  I was on the second floor in my bed about midnight or after, not sure.  I awoke to see flashing lights, like an ambulance, coming across the corn field hovering just above the corn. It came into the farm yard and hovered making all sorts of loud noises like sirens.  A bright light lit up everywhere and that was the last I remembered till the next morning when I ask everyone at breakfast, &ldquo;What was that big light and all those sirens?&rdquo; Nobody new what I was talking about and it was accounted to a dream.  Of course to me I felt I was not dreaming at all, however, it did stop after the bright light peaked. So I concluded maybe it was a dream, but really didn&rsquo;t buy it.  I let it go nonetheless.The interesting thing about this experience is what happened 25 years later. For some reason it started to bug me that I never resolved that experience I had at 12.  I had insurance and wondered if I could get hypnotherapy  to recall what really happened.  To my surprised I was able to see a license hypno-therapist.  It became legit because the therapist said it was most likely some trauma that caused the experience and I suppressed it to this particular memory.He put me under hypnosis and regressed me back to that night.  I recalled the story as it unfolded while in my regressed state.  The story was very similar to the memory I had except that I was able to see more of what happened in the farm yard.  I was up out of bed and looking out the window.   I saw two lights whirl around in a gyroscope fashion.  They kept doubling until there was nothing but a ball of light and then the white out happened.  When the session was over I ask the doctor what he thought about it. He said, &quot;I have no idea, perhaps a dream (?), but I don&rsquo;t really no for sure.&quot;  He did say there was no sign of trauma, however.One further note, after this session I found I had a very difficult time talking about it. I even wondered if the doctor, while having me under, put a notion in me to not talk about it.  Because every time I tried, I&rsquo;d wind up saying, &quot;forget it, I can&rsquo;t talk about it.&quot;  I would even get like a lump in my throat and words just wouldn&rsquo;t come out.  That was 14 years ago, it&rsquo;s only been in the last 5 years or so I&rsquo;ve been able to discuss it as before.Experience 2 In 1975 I was traveling with a friend in my car returning home from a day trip.  We were just coming to the west end of our town.  We both saw at the same time a green object with a sort of florescent light with a red light on the bottom. It zoomed across the sky going at least several thousand mile per hour.  It went across the eastern sky, about the altitude of a jet, at about 45 degrees in about 2 seconds.  It left a green florescent trail behind it that faded quickly but stretched pretty far.  I stopped immediately in the middle of the highway (two lane road really, HWY 56 in Kansas).  We got out and could see nothing.  Both of saw and described the exact same thing.Experience 3 This was January 1, 1997.  I was backpacking in the Mark Twain Forest of Missouri.  It was about 11pm.  I was sitting on a rock in the middle of a clearing watching the sky and saw 4 lights.  If they had been motionless they would not have been detected because they looked exactly like just another group of stars.  They formed a perfect box shape at first. They moved exactly together.  Making squares, diagonals, all sorts of movements in all directions and most of the time staying in this box formation, but varying it a little. I watched this for about ten minutes, same thing over and over. They were very clearly there.  Then all at once they stopped and about a half a second later, they broke formation and all spun out in weird spiraling ways in the opposite direction until they were gone out of sight which only took about another half a second.", "7/5/2008 Strange Grey Chupacabra Creature Spotted in Holly Michigan:  On Saturday July 5, 2008 at approximately 4:41AM, I witnessed a strange creature as I drove south on N. Holly Road towards Holly Michigan. This event lasted 9-10 seconds. This incident occurred when I was under a mile away from Grange Hall Road.I was coming back from dropping off a volunteer that I work with at an art center in Davison. I didn&apos;t drink anything and wasn&apos;t on any medication or illegal drugs. I was drinking soda and I didn&apos;t feel that tired even though it was late.My speed was slower than the posted limit, about 45 on mph, and my brights on.I do this so I can be prepared when a deer decides to cross my path. No other vehicles were present.As I was driving, I slowed down because there appeared to be a very large creature digging in someone&apos;s trash next to the right sight of the road.It was located 20-25 feet away from my car. I began to slow down to get a better look. This thing was really tall and too huge to be any &apos;average&apos; animal that I normally see in roadside trash bins at night. My first thought that came to mind was, &quot;What is it??&quot; I remember calling out words of animals in my head to determine what this thing could be. I thought, &quot;rat no to big..kangaroo? Its grey! Red eyes..rabbit..no.not a cat..it jumps and leaps kind of like a rabbit...I don&apos;t know what I&apos;m looking at..can&apos;t be a Chupacabra??..Could it..In Michigan??&quot;  This creature was holding a piece of trash..didn&apos;t appear to have paws..more slender hand-like. It had huge, round and red glowing eyes.It reacted and looked kind of surprised to see me as if it thought no one will ever find out that it existed. That was my impression.Its eyes just stared at my vehicle while holding onto a piece of trash for nearly 4 seconds. Its triangular like grey face reminded me of a dog but it was more pointer and triangular towards the end of the nose and mouth. Its presence didn&apos;t seem ordinary and those gigantic glowing red eyes made me feel something was out of place here. Its ears were large and rounded sort of like a mouse. Its arms were bendable and closer to its body then its long flexible legs.The body was heavier in the bottom and kind of reminded me of a kangaroo body but he was completely grey. Maybe, grey short haired fur I am not sure, but the body was definitely grey in color. It had a skinny tail that was similar in appearance to a rat&apos;s tail but it was much longer and slightly wider. I barely noticed the creature&apos;s tail until it maneuvered out of the way from the garbage can. In summary, this is the way the creature reacted when I came upon it.I noticed the creature digging in the garbage and it was holding a piece of trash. It stared at me for 3-4 seconds then dropped the trash forcefully like a human would with both hands. It was standing upright and appeared to be over 3 feet tall in height.The creature bent down to the ground and jumped forward on all fours then got up a bit and turn to the left to aim for the woods. It reached for the ground again with its front arms and jumped forward with its back legs swinging in front of it like a rabbit. The creature didn&apos;t make any sounds that I could hear even with my windows open and it didn&apos;t try to attack me or hiss at me. When the event was over I wanted to turn around and find out what that thing was.I knew that would not be a good idea. My gut tells me that this thing had to be a Chupacabra. I looked up a Chupacabra on the internet the next day discovered a photo that was taken by a rancher in 2004 that shot and killed one. The creature in that photo looked very similar to the one I witnessed, except, the dead animal had less flesh on its bones and I couldn&apos;t see slender hands but it was hard to tell from the photo. I was planning on getting some land so I could let my pet cat out at night but now there is a change of plans.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and we found her to be quite sincere in reporting the sighting.  NUFORC reported this sighting to the Holly, MI, Police Department, and they seemed to us to be totally uninterested in the report.

My attention was drawn by a very bright flash, like a photographic flash, to the southwest. When the flash dissipated, there was a glowing white object in the spot where the flash originated. The object looked like a large satellite, blinking on and off in an irregular pattern glowing brightly for about a second then dimming to complete darkness for one to several seconds. My first impression was that it was some type of satellite which was rotating and reflecting the sun, but I would imagine that the pattern of flashes would be at a more consistent interval. The object continued flashing on and off for about a minute. By connecting the locations where the object was glowing, it made a shallow &lsquo;S&rsquo; shaped path, finally disappearing to the northwest. I checked the Heavens Above site for iridium flares and other objects which would account for this sighting, but I could not find anything for that time frame and location in the sky.", "A light that moved strangely at the same speed and height, then desended downwards and disappearedGood evening,I live in Telford, Shropshire. Tonight (29/7/2008) I was going to close my gate that surrounds my property. Whist doing so I happened to see my next door neighbours outside the gate. Wondering what was wrong I approached them and asked the question, they told me to watch a strange object in the sky and pointed to it.They have previously told me that they have seen strange lights over the past week or so because the spend a lot of evenings sat outside at night time, plus the area we live in, we can see the surrounding area for quite a few miles as we live close to the top of a hill and the area is quite flat around us.They said they had been watching this light from (then pointed north west to south south east) as I arrived the light had slowed down and seemed to drop slowly downwards, as it descended the light faded till it disappeared completely.The light could only be described as brighter than a star, white, constant (not flashing) there was no noise from it, the sky was clear as we could see other star&rsquo;s behind it, it was bright in the dark night sky and it moved in a straight line at a constant speed, then it reduced in brightness at the same speed it fell.This all happened in approx 10mins at 22.10approx, it seemed to disappear over the Cannock/Walsall area.

What was unusual was that instead of the soft white light usually associated with meteorites this exhibited a brilliant white light with a slight golden hue and without the usual long streaking tail seen along with a typical meteor. Instead of a tail there were tongues of red flame flying out from behind. The fireball, to my left from my vantage point as I drove along, disappeared behind Badger Mountain and as it went behind the crest of the hill I could see the glow which then momentarily grew very intense and then collapsed which would indicate that it had exploded", "The UFO had a light on the bottom and accelerated in a curved path out of sight.It was 11:30pm and dark out.

As the lights closed in on us, one appeared to be slightly elongated vertically. Most if it was still a reddish-orange but there was some yellow near the top. One of the lights changed course slightly and headed in a more easterly direction. The other light continued to track NE directly towards us.As it passed overhead, it appeared to be a dark circular object. Its size was that of a half-dollar held at arms-length. Inside this circle were four equally sized small rings of individual red lights. These rings of light were symmetrically arranged around a larger central red light.  My son said the small rings of light changed color from purple to red.There was no sound as the object passed directly overhead.

As a result our electricity went out numerous times for a few minutes each until approximately 7:45 pm when it went out for what turned out to be over two hours.  My family home is located right next to Whiting Field NAS helicopter training school (check my address on Google Earth - we have the y-shaped driveway) and during the ten years we have lived here we  have grown accustomed to seeing and hearing a variety of aircraft on a regular basis.  On one occasion a few years ago we had the unexpected pleasure of watching the famous Blue Angels practicing at Whiting for a show on Pensacola Beach.  During their practice we only had to stand on our front porch or in the yard to see the spectacular show firsthand, and the planes were flying so low we could even make out the yellow lettering on each plane.  We also were privy to the enormous noise of the six jets flying in formation which was VERY loud.  On this particular Sunday evening in June, however, we learned that the noise of the Blue Angels paled in comparison to what we heard that night. At approximately 8:15 that evening my husband and father decided to take a ride toward town to see how extensive the power outage was.  As they were leaving I stepped onto the front porch to smoke a cigarette and as they drove down our driveway an extremely loud roaring began emanating from the direction of Whiting Field.  At first I simply thought that there was some sort of large jet taking off from there (even though they cannot ordinarily accommodate the largest jets), but the noise continued to increase in volume until our windows began vibrating violently and dishes and glassware began to topple over.  This jet-like noise was at least ten times louder than the six Blue Angel jets had been and continued for at least five minutes until it began fading out, but when it ended it did not sound like a regular takeoff. Immediately after the loud noise subsided we began hearing a large number of varying types of aircraft.  My son is a Navy veteran who worked on jets and can easily differentiate between different types of engines and he identified several helicopters, small jets, and even prop planes.  Although some of these aircraft sounded familiar to us we all agreed that they were not all the usual training helicopters and planes, plus there was still enough daylight to view them with binoculars and many did not have the distinctive orange and white coloring or the customary lighting.  My son said that it sounded like every aircraft on the base had been scrambled, and those in the air did not fly in the same direction they usually do, but maintained a large circular formation. During this flurry of activity I was looking northeast (Whiting field is west of us) and was stunned to see a bright yellow-orange glow in a vaguely triangular shape.  We have a water tower adjoining our property and this gave me some perspective regarding the size of the craft and it was larger than the tower.  Due to the power outage it was pitch black outside and we are certain that there could have been no other source of the light, which began to pulse (NOT blink or flicker).  This craft flew in a westerly direction for a short distance and then flew straight up very briefly and simply vanished as if the light had switched off, but it never made any noise at all.  The other aircraft continued to fly over many times until the power came back on around 10:00 pm and shortly thereafter ceased completely. In addition to my son and me, other witnesses included my other son and my mother, and when they returned my husband and father informed us that they had also heard the noise and thought they saw something in the sky that was not typical of the aircraft we usually see.  My older son and I were the only ones outside who witnessed the actual orange colored craft. Due to the extreme volume of the roar that preceded the extraordinary flurry of aircraft taking off from Whiting Field we were all terrified of what was happening.  It is so unusual to see aircraft that late at night, and we simply could not imagine what was causing all the commotion. The timing in relation to the storm and power outage also was very unsettling &ndash; it started right after the power went out and ended right after the power came back on.  Of course the base has its own sources of power, so we were perplexed about why this event would coincide with a neighborhood outage.  The next morning I was unable to find any reference to this event when I checked the regular internet news websites for our area, both newspaper and television.  I even called the local paper and the administration offices of Whiting field.  The Pensacola News Journal had no reports of anything unusual other than storm damage and the gentleman I spoke with on the base said he had no reports of anything out of the ordinary either. This was a little hard to swallow. Due to the fact that some members of our family, especially my husband, had seen unexplained events before in and around Pensacola, my family insisted that I report what happened although we had never felt compelled to do so before.  If your organization is able to find out what may or may not have happened we would greatly appreciate it.  Perhaps I haven&rsquo;t waited long enough to give others time to report it locally, but I suspect there may be no other reports because no one here will take me seriously.  Any help you can give us in this matter will be greatly appreciated.  Thank you.", "Orange lights/fireballsOn Saturday evening at approximately 10.45pm my partner and two friends noticed some strange looking orange lights in sky.  They were round in shape, looked like fireballs and were completely silent.  There were around 20 of these &apos;fireballs&apos; in total.  At first they appeared in the shape of a star constellation, then the fireballs started to separate and move in different directions.  Sometimes the lights would go out and then come back on.  It was hard to focus on the lights, they weren&apos;t sharp, but almost out of focus.  The lights were clearly visible across the sky for over half an hour.  The sky was quite dark, clear, no clouds, the weather mild and still.  We noticed the stars whilst travelling along the London Road in Cheltenham towards the village of Charlton Kings.", "Circulating light in sky followed our direction  for a distance of 30 miles.Saturday evening, my husband and I were travelling back to Columbus from Marietta.  As we were driving through Logan, around 11:15 pm, my husband noticed out of his window some light activity in the clouds.   I looked and saw the same thing.At first we both assumed it was a spotlight of some sort because the light kept going in a circle.  For the entire duration of the activity, not once did we ever see a solid beam from the ground.  Not once.We continued to follow 33 west from Logan all the way into Columbus / Canal winchester and for 30 miles,  the light followed alongside our left.  As we lost sight of it, our clock  read 11:53pm   I am a science major and my husband and I are both very reasonable, logical people, raising 4 children which forces us to pay attention to everything.After reasoning that there is no way a spotlight from Logan could have stayed beside us for 30 miles +,    Our next assumption was that it had to be some type of craft, just above the clouds.The light we were watching went in consistently large circles the entire time, 30 minutes, as if it were running along the outside/underside of a circular craft, very large at that.At times it seemed to go faster and then slower, but always in circles. I was seated in the passenger seat.  The circulating light would lag behind our vehicle a bit and I had to turn my head toward the back windows to see it,  then it would jump ahead where I could look out in front of the vehicle and see it clearly out of the window,  in front and next to my husband.  At these times of speed change of the craft, we were driving a straight course of road, so it was not our direction changing, the craft itself was moving.My husband was frustrated that he couldnt get a lengthy glimpse of it to evaluate more throughly what it could be, and so I even held the wheel for him so he could take a longer look for himself.    Again,  we are both well educated individuals.   His father was a pilot, and I am studying Astronomy, and therefore we both have amatuer knowledge normal aircraft.  This was nothing that could be explained by logical events.Because I like answers to the questions I have, I even did a web search to be sure there werent any grand openings in the area. (Even tho there is seriously no possible way that any light could travel alongside of our vehicle for 30 miles,  and have been from any stationary object,)   I did the search , because I wanted to make sure.  There was nothing of the sort, and therefore eliminated that possibility We mentioned telephoning Rickenbacher airport Base to alert them of an unidentified craft approaching their airspace, but when Ive inquired with them before, I didnt get very far.   They are a military installation and so I understand why some information is not public.If I were to assume the size of the craft, around which the light was running,   I would say it was easily the size of at least 2 football fields.      The light did not fade, or stop, or reverse directions or anything.   It went in cirlces,  and looked as if it were on the underside of a giant circular/disk object that was very very large.It travelling just above the clouds so we could not see the craft itself. It followed route 33 into Canal Winchester, at which point my husband and I had to head north, but the light continued following 33 until we could not see it anymore.Very baffling how a light followed our path, in the sky for a distance of 30 whole miles.   I have never seen anything that lasted that long before.", "We saw a circular shaped object coming closer to us and it was changing colors as it was turning!We were outside in the backyard while visting my gradpa swimming and my friend looked up and said that star is moving and looks like a circle but I said its an airplane. But when airplanes are in the sky they blink but this didn&apos;t. Also it looked like it was coming closer to us.  When it was turning it was changing colors and we seen lights as it was turning.", "Bright yellow light would dim and brighten itself. Hovered quickly across the sky back and forth.Me and my friends were on our way back from Columbus, OH to Portsmouth, OH driving south on 23. When almost to Chillicothe, my friend with me in the back seat mentioned that he had been watching a strange light in the sky for a couple of minutes. Out of curiosity, we all looked. It was a bright, yellowish light, far brighter than any star in the sky. It seemed to be at high altitude, but I can&apos;t be positive as we could easily see it move back and forth ahead of us. During the first 10 minutes of observing, it would be bright and then dim itself until you could not see it anymore. It would then light itself back up in a different area of the sky than it was before. After the &apos;cycles&apos; it stayed brightly lit and hovered around. We seemed to get fairly close to it at times while driving, but not close enough to identify a shape. My friends claimed to see a seperate light protude from it at one point, but I did not witness this as I was sitting on the other side of the backseat during that time. We lost it when we got into town and it was too foggy to see the sky.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

Worth, Texas, a fellow 11:11 &quot;promptee,&quot; sent me an update at 4:55 a.m. Eastern (3:55 Central [Ft.

This is history being made!  ************************************************************  (my nickname),  Okay, I was just out there again. The sky was real clouded up, but not like normal clouds! More like how chemtrails are, a trail that swells up and gets fatter as it spreads out.I could see two of them, and yes, definatly what a dogfight would look like!  What I (we) saw earlier looked like a very large triangular shaped craft with several white lights around it and one red light. But they were blinking or rotating. The other ones were very small in comparison to those.Because it looked like they were flying right at them and then they would turn away sharply then the big craft would sort of chase it and then shoot out the opposite direction really fast.At one time we counted 6 of the large ones. I am so glad my step-dad was there to see it too, I would of thought I was seeing things and not ever told anyone else. But I know what we saw!

If so, this mirrors what a few people have seen using expensive, military-style, night-vision scopes. They actually had a show on Coast-to-Coast about this several months ago, but I&apos;ve never heard of anyone being able to see something like this without night-vision equipment. I know this sounds like something out of Star Trek, but the U.F.O.s must have had their cloaking systems down?  Remember how I told you recently that there are good E.T.s and others? Well, some who are supposed to be in-the-know say they have been fighting around the Earth lately because, believe it or not, and again this sounds like something out of a Sci-Fi movie, our planet supposedly is the site of the last struggle between the Light and the dark. You, (friend&apos;s name), may have witnessed the opening salvos of the open Battle for Planet Earth. Is this real or what?  Wow! You have witnessed history, Jeanne, and I have been able to tell the world about it. This really is something else!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  What else can I say? Thanks for this update, keep watching the sky, and please try to keep track of all details regarding colors, shapes, time of events, etc. Do you have a camcorder? If so, use it!

At the first sight I thought it&apos;s just a lighted kite but after a while I seen that one of the objects disappeared and the other one stopped in the skye in the altitiud under 2KMs. It was compeletly silent and had no identific sound, when it stopped I discovered that IT&apos;S NOT A KITE because there were no wind on that night and if it was a kite and it used the and there were wind on that altitude it should move a slowly and even it was to high to be a kite.

As we watched it travel almost directly overhead toward the East-to-NorthEast direction, we both noticed very clearly that there were no navigation or strobe lights on it as are always on aircraft. Sky conditions: It is a very clear night tonight but with considerable light pollution in our area so very few stars are visible. The moon is only about 10-15 degrees above the horizon in the South-Southeast, and above and to the right of that is a bright star which may be Saturn (we&apos;re not astronomers, but a neighbor had been talking about viewing it with his telescope and it seems to be about in the right direction and time). We would estimate the brightness of the light to be approximately 2-3 times greater than that of Saturn (or whatever that brightest star is in the S-SE) with a great deal of &quot;clarity&quot; and precision to the light, a very bright, pinpoint-like light. While it very well could be a satellite or the ISS or something else, we felt it worth mentioning here because of two primary reasons:  1)  Complete lack of normal NAV lights or beacons per a standard aircraft configuration.  Only a very bright light, and we noted as it traveled away from us that they also couldn&apos;t be landing lights, since it was as bright going away from us as it was overhead. 2)  Apparent speed:  Altitude is almost impossible to guess at here since there was nothing to give away the size...again, it could have been at a normal-high altitude (10K ft. or higher) or in low orbit like a satellite or the ISS.  The only clue to altitude was any sound, and there was none, which gave the impression of a very high altitude (20-30K minimum).  With that altitude, the speed just simply didn&apos;t seem right; it was traveling at least twice, if not three times, as fast as any comparable commercial jet that we normally see at that altitude. Since these two things made it very unusual, we watched it travel the complete distance almost to the low horizon in the distance before it was out of sight.  That took only about 2 to 3 minutes maximum - again, much quicker than the usual commercial or military jet.  It did not change course at any time, altitude did not seem to vary either.

Immediately I noticed a bright round &quot;star&quot; looking object flying above and behind the jet and catching up in speed. The object speed up to the jet and started to turn right, and the same time the round object began to slow down and speed up very quickly.  The object appeared to be &quot;playing&quot; with the jet.  The jet must have been cruising at mach speeds and flying above 60,00 feet. The object itself was much higher and traveling much faster.  This was  an amazing sighting to see in miami , FL.  Both objects were very high and small, however it was very obvious to me that the first craft was indeed a military jet as for commercial airliners DO NOT fly this high. The 2nd object was indeed quite amazing. This easily could have been a ufo breaking into U.S airspace, and jets being scrambled to intercept.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

In seconds it was gone. After five minutes it was back again. This time the light and shape got more vivid but still vauge. We called my mother out and she saw it too. It was like a triangle with one orange light in the front. In seconds it hovered upward and disappeared. My mother said it might be back so I grab my camera. Only this time there were three! One in each section of the valley we live in. In seconds they hovered up and were gone. I caught a glipse of it on my camera but it was too late.

We had been in the car since 9am that day as we had left Panama City, FL after finishing a week&apos;s vacation there. That morning we (me, my wife, 2 sons and a neighbor boy we had brought with us) had all tried to guess what time we would arrive home that night. My oldest son had guessed 11:23pm and as we crossed the bridge around 11pm we were only 15 minutes from our house and it appeared he would &quot;win&quot;. As we passed the sign on the bridge saying &quot;Entering St. Charles County&quot; someone made the comment that the Missouri River looked weird. I looked up ahead and saw three white lights shining in the air just south of the highway up ahead. It appeared to be a large plane that was apparently travelling east on its way to Lambert airfield to land. It seemed to have one light on each end of its wing and one on the nose of the aircraft. Although I couldn&apos;t actually see the aircraft in the dark, the lights seemed unusually bright or powerful. For some reason I tried to get a rise out of the boys sitting in the backseat and I inexplicibly blurted out, &quot;If you think that&apos;s weird, look at those lights up ahead. It&apos;s a UFO!&quot; Immediately everyone yelled, &quot;Where?&quot; Then I told them I was only kidding, it was just a plane on its way to Lambert. As I said this I kept watching the object to see how big of a jet it really was because it seemed to be moving very slowly. The neighbor boy asked if those lights were on a lightstand because they weren&apos;t moving. I told him no, it was too high in the air for that but then I realized he was right: it wasn&apos;t moving.  The only reason the lights appeared to be moving was because we were approaching the object. As we came off the bridge, the object was absolutely motionless and appeared to be triangle shaped because the three lights were now marking the outline of a triangle. I would guess it was at the most about 500ft in the air. As we passed next to it (below it to the right of it), I kept glancing up at it and now! what I saw were a total of 6 white lights (the three marking the outline and three more at the midpoints) and one red light in the middle. The lights were not as powerful as we passed the object and none were blinking and somehow the object didn&apos;t look as big as it did when we were on the bridge. I started shouting, &quot;it IS a UFO!&quot; I wanted to pull over, but I was in the passing lane and couldn&apos;t get over to the exit. Amazingly all the cars were just driving by like everything was normal. Looking back though, it WAS very subtle and could have been easily missed. The object was absolutely still. No lights were blinking. It looked like headlights from a large plane and if I wouldn&apos;t have kept watching it after I made my UFO joke I would have missed it too. Everyone in the car saw the same thing, a black triangle outlined by three white lights and a red light in the middle. I was the only one who saw the three additional lights at the midpoints. The neighbor boy also saw only one of the &quot;midpoint&quot; lights. My youngest son thought there was a slight indentation in the rear of the craft. I didn&apos;t see this. It looked like a perfect equilateral triangle to me. That&apos;s the one thought that kept racing through my mind was how perfect a triangle it seemed to be. As we passed at the closest point, I could actually see some depth or height to the object too but it was essentially very flat. My oldest son tried to take a picture of it with his cellphone out of the rear window, but the headlights from the approaching cars behind us prevented him from finding it in his viewfinder.", "I saw a ufo.I was laying down on my raft in my pool looking up at the sun blocking the direct light with my fist.

It fell slowly downward and faded out. About 5 seconds later same exact light appeared again in the same spot. It faded out also.We both turned to each other trying to figure out what it was. I looked back in the direction the lights were observed and saw 2 dirty orange lights. They were just below Jupiter. I grabbed my telescope to see what they were and looked thru the finder scope.

Clear blue sky above. I saw a white or maybe somewhat reflective object in the sky above. At first it looked like an airplane but I noticed how fast it seemed to move. Almost a strange movement, not quite linear. As l looked, time passed and perspective changed it seemed almost as if it were falling. I couldn&apos;t exactly say it was falling, but it gave the appearance of a falling object because of the speed it was moving at or the path it was traveling, however the perspective distance that my eye could report told me that it was in fact moving away from the ground at least in an overall direction. There were two dogs that were wandering over towards me and their owner was calling for them. I was distracted for a couple of seconds. When I tried to spot the object again I had lost it. I kept looking and sighted it again in a few seconds. The object was further away, heading NE. It almost seemed to float. While I was questioning what it was I thought of a bird, a seagull hovering in the convective wind high above. That is the first thing I could relate it to because of the nature of it&apos;s movement. After gauging it&apos;s path through the sky I realized that did not make sense. I was tracking it and it was too far away to be a bird or a floating cotton seed. My eyes focused more on the object and still could not make out an exact shape. I would say it might have been oblong. I don&apos;t want to describe it more than that because I just can&apos;t say for sure. My eyes are good with contacts in. I can see far with them. I kept tracking this object until it fades away. I know for sure my eyes were focused on this object. I can tell it gained in distance from the ground or my point on the earth. I knew this by watching it&apos;s visible light reflection dim by the volumetric blue atmosphere. That is what tells me how high this was. Volumetric atmosphere. Like judging distance in the fog. I am not saying what this was with any certainty. What I will say with absolute certain! ty, sani ty, focus and highly preceptive judgement is that this was moving fast and seemed to leave the atmosphere.  It&apos;s that simple. I was at work walking through the parking lot to go back inside. It was only about 2 minutes of observation. A co worker asked what I was looking at (after I was distracted by the loose dogs). I pointed but he could not spot it. It would have been hard to spot because of it&apos;s distance and color. For whatever it&apos;s worth I am sure it wasn&apos;t a balloon, bird, cotton seed, or anything ordinary like that. I am confident in my mind and perception. Weather ballon?

Total travel time 3-5 min. read report for details.I was looking at a formation of stars that seemed to be in a perfectly straight line for quite some time.  After looking at the stars for a while (they were in the southern portion of the sky) a bright circular light appeared from absolute darkness.  The light started out (Point A) as bright as the brightest star in my field of vision.  The light traveled for about 10 seconds and decreased in brightness towards (Point B) until it vanished into complete darkness.  I was amazed by the disappearing of this light and assumed it was a meteor traveling horizontally across my field of vision.  I gazed at the exact spot in which the light disappeared for roughly around 3-5 minutes.  After 3-5 minutes the light appeared again and began traveling horizontally across the sky to (Point C) the final destination.  The same intensity and decrease in brightness occurred from (Point B) to (Point C).  The lights were not flickering or flashing as a commercial airline or other jet/helicopter would have been.  I&apos;ve seen commercial  airliners approaching landing and seen a &quot;spotlight&quot; similar to intensity, but this light was not flashing or flickering, nor was it low enough to have its landing spotlight on.  This object appeared to be several thousands of miles in the night sky and did not flicker or scatter, it merely appeared and decreased in brightness until it disappeared and then reappeared again.  From Point A to Point C the lights flight took anywhere from 3-5 minutes.  From Point A to Point B the light only took 10 seconds to travel.  From Point B to Point C was also another 10 seconds.  Now this would make the total flight from Point A to Point C take 20 seconds, but the kicker is that the light disappeared for quite some time and reappeared making the total flight time anywhere from 3-5 minutes.

But as it reached the bottom, it completely changed direction. It started to go east, instead of north. This is when I was convinced that it wasn&apos;t a satellite, as a satellite doesn&apos;t change direction or remain as bright as this light had.

I had been out for probably 30 minutes when I had a sudden feeling that I should look up.  I will never forget what I saw.  It was a single disk shaped craft, directly overhead.  It flew at an altitude that could only be described as miles high.  I would guess 25 or 30 thousand feet minimum.  It was very large.  Approximately the size of a dime held at arm&rsquo;s length.

I am thinking it was more in the 1958-1959 time frame. However, I documented the date to match up with a similar sighting that was entered earlier. The other documented sighting was just too alike not to be related.The Event.Some friends and I were talking in the front of a neighbor&rsquo;s house when a sphere of light caught my attention on the horizon. I glanced up, seen the object, pointed to it and told my friends, &ldquo;Look at that.&rdquo; They in turn looked up and we all watched the object travel the length of the horizon until it went out of sight.  The object entered the horizon from the West and exited to the East.We were starting to discuss what the object was, when an Air Force jet came over the hill exactly where the object came into our view, and proceeded to follow the object across the horizon in a west to east direction. The object and the jet were about a quarter of a mile to half a mile away.The entire event lasted no more than 15 seconds.The Object.What I saw can best be described as a very distinct dull light. The object made no sound that I could make out. The color was a medium gray. (If you take a flash light and shine it across a cinder block wall you could get the same look.)

The lights on the saucers would randomly flash, the saucers don&rsquo;t move much they just hover. We then went inside and looked outside our patio door and noticed one more.  The fourth saucer we noticed has more of a faint glow and the other three seem to have lights that move around the saucer.Around 2:45 the thrid saucer emitted a beam of light under it.Around the same time the lights on the first saucer started flashing multi-colored lights.

As I looked up, I realized the ball was moving at an incredible speed in the direction of about 30 degrees northeast.  The light either simply disappeared after about two seconds or vanished under cloud cover. The light must have been going at least one and a half times the speed of the fastest plane I have witnessed in flight, if not more.  It was late at night, with little stars, so the sky was almost pitch black.  As I looked around more, I could see commercial aircraft flying as they should.

I was in the passenger seat.  My husband suddenly hit the brakes and exclaimed &quot;What the hell is that?&quot;.  He had stopped where a large elm tree blocked my view and he moved forward.  When he did I looked to my left and saw about 100 feet above the houses, a large triangular craft.  it was moving in parallel to us but in the opposite direction.  While I kept the craft in view my husband went the short distance to the end of the block and turned the corner to follow it.  I do not recall any lights, the craft was a medium gray and from what I could perceive the only way we were able to see it at all was that it was so close to the ground the street lights were illumination the bottom.  I looked specifically for any openings for landing gear etc but the bottom was smooth.  It was winter so the windows were rolled up and the heater was on so I dont know that it made any sound.  As we followed it down the block it appeared to be moving at no more than 10 miles and hour.  I looked to see if lights were going on and if people were coming out of their homes but did not see any unusual activity.  We did turn another corner to keep it in sight and that is when I saw what I call an army jeep with a young blond bespectacled male soldier standing outside the jeep with one hand on the steering wheel, the other on the door and one foot just on the inside of the car.  He was also staring at the craft. As we passed him I looked at his face but he did not seem to notice us.  I observed that the craft was accelerating and told my husband to drive faster. With a sudden burst of speed the craft was gone.  I dont know if it moved away from any light source and so became impossible to see but it did seem to me that it simply vanished.  We tried to continue in the direction in which the craft was headed and came to a point where we could see a bridge crossing the Mississippi.  I felt that if any! one on t he bridge was seeing it that traffic would come to a halt but this did not happen.  He is now my ex-husband and about 25 years after this happened I asked him if he remembered what we saw.  He remembers that the craft had lights and that there was more than one military vehicle at the scene.  I know that people use football fields as a measure but I am not familiar with the size of football fields so I can only tell you that it measured the length of three small single family homes driveways included.  I did not report it to the police as my then husband feared ridicule but I have always been curious as to whether others saw the same thing that night.  I have run into many people who did not strike me as mentally stable who are involved in such organizations as MUFON and so when I say you on a news program I thought perhaps you were the person to report this too.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

The show ended and they were just hanging out in the friends&rsquo; backyard. It was my two daughters, the friend and the friends&rsquo; mom that were in the backyard. My oldest daughter was sitting on the grass and noticed something in the sky, she first thought it was maybe a firework but it was moving. No later that she saw it her friend said, &ldquo;is that a UFO or what?&rdquo; They all were freaking out, looking at this object in the sky. My oldest described it as orange in color, a white light in front of it and green lights around the object. My oldest described it as a circular, balloon shaped object, orange in color. She could see inside the object and she described the inside was the colors, green and red, she described it like it was like when a disco ball is on, the different colors. My youngest had her digital camera that she just received on her birthday on July 2. She took it to take pictures of the fireworks but took more than fireworks that night!

And what I saw was a thin white fluffy cloud with if I didn&rsquo;t know better another sun behind it glowing brightly yellow .  It was extremely bright and you couldn&rsquo;t stare at it just like you can not stare at the sun. The cloud  was only covering the center .. I have no idea what this was.

I noticed what looked like a star slowly moving northward in the southern sky approximately 30 degrees above the horizon. The object was the intensity of a moderately bright star and appeared to gain speed as it traversed just west of overhead. When almost directly overhead it dimmed and then briefly lit up more brightly than before, to the point of being the brightest object in the sky. At this point I called for my wife to come out and look and as soon as she stepped out the object dimmed once more, and then briefly intensified before disappearing into the area of the Big Dipper. A commercial jet passed from east to west (slightly north of my vantage point) shortly before the object passed and appeared to be much lower in altitude than the object. The object seemed to zigzag and change speed almost imperceptibly and the entire time gave the impression that it was as far away as a star. It was a white light with no blinking, flashing, or changing colors other than the brief dimming and intensifying described above. While I am a skeptic when it comes to UFO&rsquo;s, there is no question in my mind that the object was not a &ldquo;shooting star&rdquo; or any kind of military or commercial aircraft and I have never seen anything like this before.", "STAR LIGHT TRAVELS FAST AND FAR!ME AND 3 OTHERS SEEN  A LIGHT THAT APPEARED AS A STAR , VERY HIGH IN THE SKY TRAVEL FROM WEST TO THE EAST UNTILL IT DISSAPEARED.

At first, we were confounded as to why such an object was so high and would be flying in daylight. We then took out binoculars and discovered that all 5 of us could see the same thing and to make sure, we each went into seperate rooms and drew what we thought we had seen. In awe we discovered that we all had the same sketch. After we had finished drawing we returned outside and saw the same basic shape dart across the sky extremely high up at speeds unknown for known aircraft. We did not have the binoculars at this time and were unable to see if it was the same ufo as we had seen before. Roughly 30 minutes later we saw a helicopter at pitch black at night coming across in the same pattern the ufo had traveled. We thought this was very suspicious because helicopters rarely, if ever fly into or within 10 miles of where my house is.

The lights &ldquo;turned on&rdquo; in a rhythmic fashion, each coming on in 2 second intervals, from left to right (south to north).  Each light was spaced the same distance from each other.  If I were to hold my fist out in the direction of the lights (palm down), the array of lights would cover a half-fist.I saw something similar to this, in the very same location on the horizon, in January 2005.

It moved across the sky from one side of the trees to the other where I lost sight.

It was a little later than usual, somewhere between 8-8:30 p.m., but I wanted to go for the walk regardless.  I had just made it up the hill from my house when I thought I heard a sudden mass of car horns blasting at the same time in the distance.  I looked around and then got a throbbing sensation in my head.  In a natural motion I just looked up and saw a light.The light did not seem to produce light since it seemed very bright but I did not have to squint to look right at it.  It appeared quite large but still a good distance over my head.  It then abruptly seemed to retract itself, as if being spotted, straight back and then made one or two zigzag motions.As the light quickly got further and further away it seemed to give off something like a vapor trail, but more the consistency of smoke, as it picked up speed.  I watched it until it was the size of a pin-point and then completely gone.This all took place in probably no more than 30 seconds.  I did not feel threatened at all but continued with a slight throbbing in my head and behind my right eye for the duration of my walk.I returned home safely and have had no adverse reactions.

At high altitude was a small round object.It was so high as to be difficult to say if it had any shape other than round, or any distinguishing markings.A high flying airliner was nearby and was below this object which in my estimation had to make the object we saw at least as large as the passenger jet. The object was moving in a strange sort of s-pattern, changing directions a number of times in a short distance. Next it seemed to go straight up, as it became suddenly smaller and then disappeared.We observed the object for less than one minute. Neither of us had ever seen anything in the sky behave in this manner before.

Sky perfectly clear and moonless with Jupiter bright in the southern sky. I was carrying groceries from my car to my apartment and was not watching the sky when suddenly, a flash of white light from above caused me to look skyward. I saw a white hot, incandescent object with blue and red tinges of color at its center and a short tail of sparks directly overhead. The object and the glow surrounding it were about the size of a saucer held at arm&rsquo;s length against the sky. Its speed was a bit faster than meteors I&rsquo;ve observed in the past. The object passed to the west behind the roof of my apartment building where I could no longer see it. When I rounded the corner of the building, it had disappeared altogether. I assumed it burned out while beyond my field of vision. The sighting lasted about 2 seconds. I immediately concluded I had seen a meteor, but the altitude of the object was surprising. It appeared to be much closer to the earth&apos;s surface than meteors I&rsquo;ve observed in the past, including the spectacular meteor shower I saw in August, 1993, that resulted from some vaporization of the Swift-Tuttle comet core. This object seemed so close that I initially thought it might be some type of firework launched from the nearby neighborhood. I was concerned the object was going to touch down somewhere nearby. (I realize that altitude is difficult to judge when there is no other backdrop than the stars at great distances in a black sky.) There was absolutely no sound that preceded my sighting the object and no sound when it flashed and then passed overhead. When directly above me, the object was so bright that it illuminated the wall of my apartment building. I&rsquo;m assigning my sighting to a meteor, but the object had a couple of characteristics that were not meteor-like.

It seemed to not be at a great distance from us - very much nearer than the stars which were visible nearby.Through binoculars, it appeared to be a white globe, with a tail shape at the base.We watched the shape for approx 45 minutes - we had to keep moving to keep it in our sight as it&apos;s journey was taking it behind trees, blocking our view.We saw one airplane flying in the general direction of the light and believe the people on board must have seen it.We then lost sight of it for around 10-15 minutes as we came in the house to make telephone calls to the local airport and UFO society.

This disappeared and quickly re-appeared as 6 small semi-circular individual lights which appeared to be blinking.   This same boomerang shape then re-appeared in a different location in the sky, quickly disappearing and then the 6 small semi-circular lights appeared again.  This process repeated itself one more time in yet another location and then was not seen again.  It should be noted that the sighting was not in a pattern contestant with a modern day air plane since the flight pattern was not a straight line but rather back and forth in motion.   There was cloud cover but the object was flying under the clouds.  My estimate on the altitude would be 10,000 feet and the distance away from Pleasantville would be approximately 6 miles.

All three of us were swinging and listening to our own portable music.  At approximately 1 a.m., I saw an object in the sky that I was and am unable to identify.  What I could see of the object consisted of 5 disks of light which were the color and brightness of the stars in the sky, but much larger than stars, and these lights were arranged in a distinct &quot;V&quot; shape.The quality of the light is much different from any light I know of on an airplane.  Whereas airplane lights consist of small, bright lights, the lights I saw were large, dim, and disk-shaped.  The angle of the disks demonstrated that the lights were on the bottom of &quot;something&quot; and that they were not very far away (horizontally).The object moved at a very low speed, as though it were cruising casually through the sky above the city, heading in a south/south-easterly direction.  However, the object was already almost out of site behind other objects when it caught my attention, leaving me only a very few matter of seconds to view its travel.As soon as I noticed the object, I turned off my music (a matter of a split second) and I heard absolutely no sound attributable to an aircraft.It may be of interest to the record that the city of Warrensburg is extremely near an Air Force base, and thus I have seen plenty of their aircraft, both day and night, including the Stealth Bomber.  In fact, I saw a low-flying Stealth Bomber just the night before, and so I was easily able to distinguish the object I saw from the aircraft typically seen in the area.", "three bright beams of light near highway, swooping and hovering, searching groundAccount 1:It was around 9:15 PM on Wednesday when my mother and I were driving along I-5 towards Pacheco Pass.  We were in the left lane and there were other cars and trucks around us.  I noticed that this object with 3 beams of lights looked like it was coming towards the highway and I thought that it might be a plane in trouble, needed to land on the highway.  Instead it stopped coming closer to the highway and was about 50 yards away, hovering in the middle of nowhere.  After it hovered I thought it might be a truck stopped on an overpass but we couldn&rsquo;t see any hill or anything because it was dark.  Then it started to swoop downwards and closer to the highway again, I realized that it was in fact NOT a truck on an overpass and that there wasn&rsquo;t even a hill there, it had been stopped, hovering for about 10 seconds and it looked like it&rsquo;s light was searching for something.  It appeared to be 20 feet across and had three round, white lights evenly spread about searching only on the ground.  We were traveling in the car around 80-90 mph and witnessed it go into an orchard where it appeared to hover between trees with its lights shining out towards the highway.  When we passed it, it was still in the grove and we didn&rsquo;t see it fly away.  In total we saw it for about 2 minutes before we passed it on the highway.  I could not actually see a body of an aircraft or whatever it was, I could only make out three distinct lights. Account 2:My daughter (age 19) and I (age 54) were driving north on Interstate 5 near the farming district in Ca. last Wednesday evening when we saw 3 bright highlights, ahead of us, but off to the side of the highway.  The lights were bright and blinding and we wondered if a plane was trying to make an emergency landing on the highway.  But that didn&rsquo;t make sense since I&rsquo;ve never seen 3 lights placed so closely together on a plane.  As we continued driving I thought it might be a tractor intending to cross an overpass since the lights were a bit higher than the horizon.  Suddenly the lights stopped moving and just hovered in one place, then it flew towards the highway and then counter clockwise away from the interstate.  It headed north in an open area as if it were going to land on a runway but it didn&rsquo;t.  The lights illuminated a field which I thought had grass on it.  I think I saw a small red light on the right side of the wings, I&rsquo;m not sure if I really saw a wing though, I&rsquo;m assuming it&rsquo;s a wing.  The lights were so bright I never could see what the lights were attached to but there did go across in a fairly straight line horizontal to the ground.  As we drove by the highlights were about 100yds or one football length away from our speeding car and hovered over an orchard of trees.  I couldn&rsquo;t tell if it landed on the ground or just hovered about the tree line next to the highway.

We we on the North Rim looking south.  When we first saw them there were three.  We watched them proceed east in a straight line, very close to the horizon.  After about 30 minutes, they disappeared one at a time.  First each side light, then the middle one.  The middle one also was at a point of the other two.  It was a wonderful, neat experience for us.  We never reported it, but after watching so much on the Phoenix Lights, I just had to tell someone.  They did look exactly like the &quot;Phoenix Lights&quot; appear on television.  They didn&apos;t change brightness, blink, or no strobe light appeared as with an airplane.

This object appeared to be metallic in nature because of the quality of the surface reflections. It reflected shades of salmon/pink and yellow on its surface. This was particularly noticeable, because the prevailing weather conditions this morning at 7 am was thick gray clouds in all directions. The object looked to be in the distant sky approximately 9.8 miles (the distance from Luna @ 635 to 635 @ 75 via Google Maps) but was large to my vantage point. I looked solidly at this object for a mere 2-3 seconds before diverting my attention back to the road I was currently driving down. After a quick 2 seconds glance to the road, I looked back and was perplexed to find the object no longer was visible to me, even though, i had a clear view of all skies around me in my convertible jeep wrangler.I wonder if anyone else saw this object today.", "Two photographs Shot August 19th, 2008 of Saucer Shaped Craft at Beaver Lake in Avon, ColoradoWhile recently on vacation in Vail, Colorado for five days with my girlfriend, we decided to go horseback riding at Beaver Creek, Colorado.  There was a total of six of us horseback riding in the area of Beaver Lake located in Avon, Colorado on August 19th, 2008.There were five guests and one guide who left the Beaver Creek Stables at approximately 09:45 hours and rode up to Beaver Lake.  We arrived around 11:30 hours and I shot some photographs of the horses as they were tied up to a post.  After eating a box lunch and fishing for trout in the Beaver Lake, we mounted up and started headed back down the mountain to the stables around 13:15 hours.  The skies were bright blue and sunny.  The ride was uneventful with nothing out of the ordinary seen or heard.Upon returning home and reviewing the digital photographs, I found two photographs that show a very distinct disk or saucer shaped object just above one of the mountains.  The images were taken with a Nikon D80 high-resolution camera.  The first image that captured the saucer shaped object was at approximately 11:38 hours (7023) and the second photograph to capture the saucer shaped object was at approximately 13:30 hours (7094).", "one evening in the early fall a huge red glowing but soft fireball came down right beside me staying with me  maybe 5 or 10 minutesI was very young when I saw this big red what I called the big red fireball.

Looking in the camera screen I noticed a small white light dancing back and forth beneath the moon. It moved side to side, one moment on the left side of the moon, the next moment it moved across the sky to the other side of the moon. It was moving below the moon forming a U shape around the bottom of the moon. It&apos;s movements were rapid and jerky, kind of like how a fly moves.We couldn&apos;t see this with our naked eyes but 3 of us did see it with the camera lens.It was a very clear night and many stationary stars were visible.The shape of this object was circular, it looked like a star that was moving very fast across the sky. I can&apos;t believe it was an aircraft as I&apos;ve never seen anything of this earth move like that. It was very erratic in it&apos;s movements.It was a bright white color, that of a star in the sky.My Background: A lifelong belief and interest in ufos as my family and neighbors witnessed ufos over Westchester, Calif when I was very young..but old enough to remember the excitement.

I chalked it up at first just to be 2 planes coming this way in some sort of flight pattern creating an optical illusion. However, my husband walked out to smoke a cigarette and said &quot;Come here and look at this&quot;. Just over the tree lines where I had seen the 2, were now 4 bright lights all in a vertical formation. I tried to logically evaluate what I was seeing but logic soon flew out the window. As we watched these very bright lights, which were much larger than what you see on jets, the top one in formation dimmed the bright light and red and blue lights began flashing on it as it began to pull away from the vertical line moving in a Northeast direction. The craft that was moving was very low to the ground, lower than I see any jets in this area fly and the sound was different than jets. It made a noise but there was no &quot;rumble&quot; if that makes sense like a jet makes, it was rather quiet no more noisy than perhaps a car makes. The lights undernderneath and behind it were unfamiliar to us as well. As we kept watching, we then realized that this was a pattern that kept taking place. As the top one would begin to pull away from formation, another would &quot;appear&quot; to come up from beneath and get in this vertical line. We watched this trying to reason what was going on but it just wasn&apos;t making sense to us. If it had been planes in a flight pattern, logic would reason that the lights would be of different size and radiance if they were lined up behind each other. These lights looked like huge bright balls of light. My husband and I when we first saw them giggled and said &quot;Oh no, someone else is playing a hoax with flares and balloons&quot;, however, as the top one moved away, we clearly saw the craft and it&apos;s flight pattern. Whatever they were, whoever they were, they were definitely craft. I lost count after watching 6 of these follow this pattern. &quot;That&apos;s 6&quot; I said to my husband, and then just quit counting at that point. I began getting very nervous as we kept watching this take place as it appeared they began lining up in a perimeter around an area. I could see them on the horizon from the back yard, clearly to the north, clearly to the east and cleary to the west, the trees were blocking my southern view. However, as they followed this flight pattern, they appeared to be randomly stopping out on the horizon, not moving at all. Just hovering. Some we could follow moving following a rather large circle pattern on the perimeter. The red and blue lights flashing on them looked different than jets and some seemed to only have a steady red glow.This has to be one of the most bizarre things I&apos;ve seen. Within a few minutes of watching this, 3 helicopters appeared in the area and there was 1 helicopter that actually kept a distance from the line of lights, but was flying what appeared to be from an &quot;observing distance&quot;. This went on for approximately an hour with these things all over the sky. I kept thinking, someone else surely has to see this. We came in to turn on the news around 9Pm thinking that what might be happening would definitely make the news, we watched all the way through the 10PM news, but no mention. I began checking here last night to see if anyone else had reported anything, but soon realized this isn&apos;t kept in real time, so thought I&apos;d check back this morning and there&apos;d be a plethora of reports, so far nothing. This truly rattled me last night, I had knots in my stomach because what we were seeing was so bizarre. This went on for over an hour. There was not a single jet in the sky during this, just the balls of light and crafts and a few helicopters. If anyone else has seen this, or has an explanation as to what was going on, please post it here.My husband and I walk out front and sit on our porch nearly every evening and have never witnessed anything like this in the past.

She followed  the bright light down the road and then said it followed her, she frantically called me at 10:30pm to tell me about this. I did not believe it, she was just crazy, it was probably an airplane. So when she got home, my brother, his girlfriend, my sister, and I went outside to see this &ldquo;UFO&rdquo;. We all quickly realized that my sister was right, so we decided to take my brothers girlfriend home to Coxsackie. As we drove along I took out my phone and started to record it, that is until it stopped appearing on my phone, but was still in the sky, visible to the eye. We took pictures with my sisters camera and we watched it as we went to Coxsackie.When we got to Coxsackie however, going through the pictures on the camera we realized it was no longer visible when it was clear that it was visible at the time the pictures were taken. After dropping my brothers girlfriend off, we pulled out of her drive way and I noticed a light going down and sideways to the right, after flipping out my sister said she saw it too, we sat there dazed. Suddenly we saw two more, less bright, &ldquo;ball&rdquo; looking like things come from this other thing. Which the light was extremely bright and white and it was going bigger and smaller, when it got small enough and not as bright you could see the shape, more like a cresant. I thought I had recorded this on my phone but it stopped recording before we saw four more of these &ldquo;lights&rdquo; getting dimmer and brighter. It had looked like in &ldquo;War of the Worlds&rdquo; (which was oddly enough filmed in Athens, NY) during the storm the &ldquo;lights&rdquo; were getting shot into the ground, that is what it resembled as these things were coming down.After realizeing there were more than one of them we headed home, my eleven year old sister extremely frantic, watched them the whole ride home. We passed the prison in Coxsackie where it was near/over then suddenly turned a corner and it was all the way on the other side of the road, ahead of us. As we neared Sleepy Hollow, which is in Athens, it started to fade, I snapped a few quick shots and it &ldquo;disappeared&rdquo;. Coxsackie/Athens is a very rural area, with a lot of farms and fields, woods, and water, which can be quiet creepy if you&rsquo;re already freaked out.When we arrived home my sister went online and talked to her friend, who said she and another friend of hers were outside of her house, in Sleepy Hollow, when they heard a very strange sound coming along Farm to Market Road, the very same road my sister had been driving on when she started to follow the UFO. After that her friend got a bad feeling and ran home, my sister hadn&rsquo;t even told her friend about the UFO we saw or where we had seen it, making it odd and collaberating with this story. Although we didn&rsquo;t hear any sound, we also didn&rsquo;t listen for one. The sighting is extremely disturbing and scary for anyone to encounter, but it seemed as though the UFO was watching and following us.", "Pearl like sphere hovering and then covering miles in a few seconds.Our house is on Lake LBJ on the south side. I was sitting on my deck watching the lake activity and sky, looking north. A friend of mine was there as we had played golf that morning.I saw an object moving across the sky from west to east at a distance and speed consistent with conventional aircraft I see regularly. I watched the object for about 15 seconds when it stopped, then began moving again for a couple of seconds, then stopped, dropped in altitude and stopped again.I stepped inside and got my binoculars. My friend had gone inside to get a drink at the same time. I held the binoculars against the porch column to steady the view. The object looked like a pearl in shape and color. The sky was blue with wispy white clouds behind the object. It appeared to be moving closer as it got larger and clearer.I had been watching it for three to four minutes when my friend came back on to the deck. The object had not moved other than to appear closer. I pointed it out and asked him to look through the binoculars and give me his opinion. In the time it took me to step around the porch column and my friend to raise the binoculars, approximately three seconds, the object disappeared. It took us about five seconds to relocate it in the sky about two miles to the east and getting smaller in appearance through the binoculars until it disappeared into the clouds.", "Dear Mr. Davenport, Here is a brief description of my brothers experience.I&apos;m listing my contact information because we do not want it posted on the site.

So I ran inside to get my monocular. I came back and observed it with the monocular. It seemed to be disc shaped, but was still too far away to make it out clearly. But since it looked more disc shaped than jet shaped, I ran back in and got my camera.It is a Sony Cybershot 7.2 megapixal. I keep it set on fine to get the highest resolution I can. I took about five still shots of which two show it pretty clearly. The object definitely appears disc shaped when you zoom in on the image. I then switched to video mode and filmed it for several minutes.The sun was starting to set and my settings must not have been so good. I am not able to see the object on the video because the sky appears too bright. I don&rsquo;t know how to adjust the brightness on a video unless you go in frame by frame. I know I can try to go in and freeze a frame and adjust it, but have not tried that yet.The object was traveling from the NE to the SW so it was traveling somewhat in the direction of the setting sun. As I was filming it a helicopter flew by, much closer in range. I don&rsquo;t know if they noticed this other object in the sky. I also heard the helicopter very well and yet I heard no sound from the object, although it seemed to be flying around the same height that most jets seem to fly.

We were watching shooting stars and watching the sky as many of us find as an enjoyment before going to sleep. Right at 9:49, an bright light appeared in the southern sky (looked like landing lights at first), note the airport is closed to all operations after 8pm local time. All of our group was very surprised by this and thought it to be an aircraft in distress. As the object approached the airfield, it was traveling directly north, at an estimated 2,000 ft (aprox only, we cannot verify this), and crossed just to the west of the airfield, paralleling runway 18/36. As it got closer many of the group members took snap shots and video, which many are blurry etc but it was there. As the object came within viewing distance, the only visible part was a large flame. This flame was twice the size of Jupiter in the southern sky. It was moving fairly slow, less that 100kts as it moved over the airfield, and it resembled the flame of a hot air balloon, but was silent. We had the knowledge that hot air balloons do not fly at night and that they are easily heard from the ground, and also the flame never went out, like many times happens in a hot air balloon. This object moved to the north of the airfield, we aprox. Over top of the north 40 area, and it made a left 45 degree turn, and rapidly departed the area, not only gaining altitude, but it increased its lateral distance from us at a tremendous rate. All of the members of the group fly for a profession; (commercial and private pilots) were all in stun having never seen this before. This object lasted 3-4 minutes of duration as it moved over the area.

It was oval, but more  rounded on top. It hovered very high in the same spot for about 3 or 4 hours. We would go in the house and watch tv and come out hours later and it was still there. It was very high up and after some years passed, I kind of dismissed it. Then, about ten years later I was walking with my three year old son in a park in a neighboring city and saw the exact same thing, only this time the craft was much lower in altitude and there were three of them. These craft were moving slowly across the sky. They were exactly the same  as the original ten years prior. Two of them were close and a third was farther away from the other two. The single one seemed to be leading the other two. They were all the same. Silvery, almost looked like a drop of mercury if you broke open a thermometer. Rounded edges, not like a saucer but more like a mushroom top. Only smooth and sheeny. They reflected alot of light like a mirror or highly polished aluminum or chrome.

I was at a friends house who has wide open fields out back (he lives on the edge of town) when i noticed an object in the sky. i figured not to high up maybe 1,500-2000 feet in the air, so i tried to write it off as a stationary object light a light tower or something. Then i noticed it moved. It was round and had one white,yellow,red,blue light on it which appeared to be rotating around it in the center. (the object itself may have been rotating or just the lights i&apos;m not positive) but anyway i figured oh well and went to sleep. The next day went by normal i was at my friends again but there was no light this time. The next day went by and around 10pm you figure when all lights should be on that are stationary or you&apos;d see a star already there was nothing in the sky at my friends field. I walked home around to notice that this object was now over his field again. (i live about two long blocks away and can see the airspace over his field from a big gap in the treeline) and there the object is. Floating and blinking. i wrote it off and slept again. The next night i was in newburg spending the night at a local hospital with my girlfriend who was ill. Again around 11 at night the same object appeared in the sky and about 500ft higher then i and about 800yards out the object floated (note that i was on a top floor and facing the complete opposite direction of walden. It was a very cloudy night which made me notice it. it was far to cloudy to see stars that night so it had to be below the clouds. An airplane showed in the horizon and the object disappeared only to reappear after the plane was gone. the object reappeared and disappeared in the corner of the horizon floating in and out of the clouds. i fell asleep. The next day i had left my friends house(mentioned before) and we checked the lot behind his house before i left (it was around 10:30pm) we all agreed there was no light no nothing there. But on my walk home just as i was walking d! own my r oad the object had appeared, and alot closer this time just over the line of trees across my road it moved or rather how i would put slicked it&apos;s way through the air virtually silent in all ways. Well i&apos;m not going to lie here. i&apos;ll admidt it. I ran as fast as i could to try and get inside my home it creeped me out. Now i&apos;m not exactly slow and the object was going somewhat slow when it flew over me i ran and by the time i got to my door i looked back to see it in the gapped treeline again.

I had forgot to mention until now that also during the week at one point all my friends were outside my friends house (the field owner) and we witnessed two of the same objects i had describes flying extremely close and not to low and not to high virtually soundless zipping across the sky. my girlfriend had researched what i saw and came to here so that&apos;s why i&apos;m here she pointed out a case in kingston on the 8th of august that sounds very similar to the object i&apos;ve seen so i made my report here.

Then the light came back and traveled down by our house, then vanished. No sounds were heard, no motors, no engines. There was some heavy winds just before we saw these lights. Then we saw 2 more lights, one was above the other. They sat for a while, blinking silvery lights, then one went in the same direction as the first. After a short time the other did the same thing. There are dogs on both sides on the hills. The dogs on the side where the lights were first seen barked and howled constantly. The dogs on the side where the lights went only barked when the lights passed by them. There was a soft glow where we first saw the lights.

It had two sets of orange lights and two sets of yellow lights, it was dark so I couldn&apos;t see the body just the lights. Normally I would have thought that this was a plane but it seemed to come out of nowhere and was traveling extremely fast at high altitude. I am a former U.S. Air Force Senior Airmen and I know planes very well; I&apos;ve been an avid aeronautics fans since I was very young and can tell the difference between an F-15 Eagle and F-14 Tomcat from very far away, (Subtle differences that the uninitiated wouldn&apos;t be able to discern). At any rate this object appeared fairly brightly at first and then within seconds faded away while traveling at a high rate of speed even though it was very high up in the sky. The array of lights was such that it basically to on a sort of rectangle shape but that is solely based on the light configuration as I could not see the body since it was dark. I often work outside my backyard at night and I&apos;m always looking at the sky while lying on my back doing sit ups and resting often for at least 45 minutes a night. I&apos;m very used to seeing satellites and shooting stars as well as all sorts of aircraft. This object was either an extremely large and fast top secret U.S. military aircraft with astonishing flight characteristics or an advanced vehicle from somewhere beyond our planet. Those are the only two possibilities in my mind. I&apos;m curious if anyone else saw it but probably not due to it&apos;s extremely short duration in view, (Around 4 seconds tops).

I was in the passanger seat and noticed 4-5 bright (looked like football stadium) lights in the sky to the Northwest through the drivers window. I brought it to my husbands attention and we, along with a car behind us, pulled off the the side of the road. The 4-5 lights were VERY bright and stayed in one place. Then, a 6-7-8 light lit up and all 8 light lit up across a large area of the sky. The &quot;UFO&quot; stayed in the area and lit for about 4 minutes. Then, one by one the lights slowly went out. My husband called the local sheriff&apos;s office and they stated there had been several reports to them over the last 3-4 nights, but quit a bit tonight. I called the local airport (very small one) and was informed that there were no flights in the area. This happened North of Caney Kansas on highway 75 just south of Havana Lake.

When the show was over we walked back to the truck. As I was throwing bits of ice on him something in the sky caught my eye, and at first I thought it was a shooting star so I glanced away for a second and when I looked back up I noticed that there were 4 dim lit lights on the underneath on what looked like a triangular craft. And the craft, which was completely black, had a fine silver line that looked to be the far edge of the wing.So I thought to myself that this would be some sort of an airplane but I noticed that there was no sound and no flashing blue/red lights. It was completely silent. My dad also asked about the space station or it being a satellite or something. No, it wasn&rsquo;t because I noticed that as it passed by it covered up the stars as it was moving.  It didn&rsquo;t seem to be that high like a plan either, I mean, it wasn&rsquo;t touching the tops of trees or anything.So about a few seconds when I realized what I may be seeing I slapped my boyfriend on the shoulder and pointed to the sky.

As I turned off Main Street, I noticed a bright flash in the sky to the north.  I turned my head to the left and saw the sun glint off of something in the sky.  It had to have been highly polished and metallic.  I live in an area where I see all kinds of crafts: jetliners, blimps, private planes, I even saw fighter jets over my house after &ldquo;9/11&rdquo;.  This looked different, very different.  I didn&rsquo;t turn my head back and proceed on my way.  I actually pulled over to the curb and stared.  What I saw were two objects.  They were close enough that I was to be able to discern certain features but far enough away not to be able to be precise about the features.  They were moving in tandem at about 200 mph (the same speed of an airline on approach that I typically see at Laguardia Airport and were under the low hanging clouds, which I estimate were at 2,000 feet or so.  One was larger and appeared to caplet-shaped.  The other was smaller and followed the first.  It was spherical but not perfectly round.  What was dramatic about this was that they were incredibly close to one another, as closer as fighter jets from a squadron that fly in formation.  At first, I thought the larger was towing the smaller but then I dismissed that thought.  Then I observed that there is no way that air traffic in the NYC metropolitan area would be allowed to fly so close to another craft. They flew in a perfectly straight line but never did the distance or perspective between the two change.  I observed this for a good 30 seconds as they moved off and away.  As I biked off I had to analyze what I saw and decide whether, in fact, they were UFOs or not.  What convinced me that I believe they were is the fact that no noise emanated from them and I don&rsquo;t recall seeing any wings on these crafts.", "Transforming cigar shape with large protrusions that move and interlockThe object was seen from a residential area looking south south west of the Orlando area.

The photos were taken about a minute apart from each other. The object was hardly moving in the sky, maybe an inch at fingers length every hour.

On holiday, with a visit from our friends.  Standing outside I looked up and spotted an object moving faster than an aeroplane or satellite.  It looked like a object which was cloaked - like a large piece of the black sky with stars was moving but was visible because it passed over the real stars.  I pointed up, my two friends both looked up and saw the object.  We could hear a high pitched whirring sound aswell.  I don&apos;t want to sound mad, but the perfect description is like a piece of the sky was moving (from the Chicken Little movie).As this obviously caught our interest, myself, my husband and our two friends sat outside looking at the sky.  It was a clear, starry night.  We then witnessed an orange object come towards us, high in the sky.  It headed out to the coastline where it just vanished.  Not a sight of it - there were no clouds, the object just diminished into thin air.

I was standing facing North West, my friend was facing East, and I happened to glance up at the sky. in the direction of the big dipper when I noticed something that appeared almost shadow like in the sky  moving at a high rate of speed. ( to describe what it was like is when you see a flock of geese flying in the night sky. or like what a comet looks like. It was about that transparent.) The object had no lights and was triangular or swept wing. Similar to the stealth bomber.  But I could see through it as it passed in front of the stars as if it was like a ghost. From my vantage point it completely covered the end two stars of the handle of the big dipper. The object made no sound whatsoever. It was moving from North to South. ( I watch the international space station quite often and this object did not appear to be getting any reflective light from the sun) This object  moved from North to South in two to three seconds. I do not know if it was in orbit or in the high atmosphere, or even ten thousand feet. I had no reference point. I turned my head from right to left as I followed it. And as fast as I could turn my head it was gone.  Could this have been something military?  That made no sound?  My friend did not have time to turn his head to see it.

There was 2 sets of 3 lights in the back with a somewhat larger light in the front.  All the lights were moving together, although I couldn&apos;t tell if it was one large object.  If it was one object, IT WAS HUGE. My coworker said there was a low pitched noise but it wasn&apos;t loud like a jet or something.  I know these were not airplane lights, (I used to work avionics for a local airplane manufacturer).  These lights moved in a steady progression and we watched it until the lights faded to the east.

I was in Manhattan, NYC, but the UFO(Light) flew over NJ and NY.  It was winter and around late February. I don&rsquo;t have the exact date, although I called Newark Airport and also left a message at a UFO Reporting 1-800 number, when it happened, and I don&rsquo;t know if this was NUFORC, but I haven&rsquo;t seen a similar event on your site. I&rsquo;ve decided to send my account just for the record although it&rsquo;s 15.5 years later.I witnessed this from my then 31st story window on West42nd at 10th Ave. Manhattan looking SSW down the Hudson River past what was the World Trade Center.  It was in the early morning hours at about 5AM. I was awake early studying for an exam. The morning light was just beginning to break (pre-sunrise) and the sky was overcast with a very high, thin layer of clouds. Visibility was good as I could see a few planes taking off and landing in the distance (11 miles) at Newark airport as per usual. Although the planes were like dots in the distance I could see their flashing lights and was very used to observing the speed and altitude, at which they flew, which by the way, appears to be very slow and very low from the 42nd St. vantage point.As I was gazing out of the window I noticed a very bright white dash of light moving above the higher thin layer of clouds. It was shining through from above the clouds and came from the West near the area of the NJ/NY Statue of Liberty Harbor. It may have been further south at Newark airport, but was difficult to gauge at that high altitude.  Based on the distance and how quickly it traversed the sky from WEST to EAST (in about 1.5-2 seconds), I estimate it was traveling at the speed of about 10+ miles per second, as it shot EAST across the sky from Jersey, over Staten Island towards the Verrazano Bridge/Atlantic Ocean (an air distance of about 15+ miles) and disappeared out of my range of view. It&rsquo;s also difficult to accurately estimate the length of this light sliver, because I was far away and I only saw a light and not an object. I&rsquo;ve taken into account the possibility of window reflections, but since I saw the slight fluctuations in the shape of the light from behind the clouds, as it traveled above and across the thin cloud cover, I&rsquo;ve eliminated that possibility. I am an artist and do pay close attention to these details. Also there were no light beams or spotlights visible from the ground below either, and as it was still somewhat dark, I think I would have noticed. I saw something out of the ordinary and unidentifiable, at least to my knowledge.  This was definitely not a commercial aircraft above the clouds as it was going way too fast and the light it emitted was so much brighter than anything I&rsquo;ve ever seen from that distance. Anyway this is my report, given in as much detail as I can recall.  Thanks for the opportunity to share my experience.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

A white-blue electrical pulsating on and off in no particular pattern flew directly over my car and towards the helicopter that was on my left hand side. The object then headed towards the helicopter, flew right up to it stopped still in the air, dropped straight down and then began flying along a treeline on the side of the road, at this point both helicopters then began following it. What is the craziest about this is that the object was so low to the ground only about 150 yards high when it passed over my vehicle, the only noise i heard was from the helicopters.

At 11pm on Friday, August 22, 2008 I went out on my balcony to get some air and saw in the distance approximately five blinking orange orbs in close formation hovering about 500 feet above the western side of the River North neighborhood (possibly a bt further west, above River West). Very quickly the objects individually blinked on and off in a seemingly random manner, almost like a strobe light atop an emergency vehicle.  I thought at first they were the lights of an emergency helicopter (sometimes I see medical flights to rooftop helipads at hospitals on the north side), but the lights just hovered and blinked, moved slightly to the south, and faded out/stopped blinking.  While &quot;on&quot;, the light they gave off was an intense orange, the kind you might see at the working end of a blow torch.  Really pure, really bright and intense.I stood there for several minutes wondering what I had seen.  Twice in the past year, I have seen individual unexplained objects above downtown Chicago and the western suburbs (one of which I reported to NUFORC), and I expected what I had just seen was also out of the ordinary.After waiting for the lights to return to no avail, I returned to my apartment.  About half an hour later, through my window I noticed an individual blinking orange orb in a different location but near to where I had seen the original formation.  This orb was low to the ground, about at rooftop level.  It strobed for a few seconds and then disappeared.I went out on the balcony again and waited.  About a minute later, the light reappeared for 10 seconds or so and then faded out.  It occurred to me if the grouping of lights I had originally seen had broken up, I might see other individual orbs above the city.I stayed out on the balcony for about half an hour (by now it was around midnight or maybe a little bit later).  During that time, I witnessed another very intense blinking orange orb above the Lincoln Park neighborhood.  This was not the signal light atop Children&apos;s Memorial Hospital on Lincoln (which was also clearly visible) but was east of it, closer to the park itself.  This light moved slightly east and west while I watched it, and blinked in a rapid, staccato manner in three volleys of about 15 seconds each, with gaps of perhaps 15 or 20 seconds between each volley.  The light was as intense as the others I had seen, and seemed weirdly bright given the distance from which I was viewing it.  I had the feeling something was being surveyed by the light at specific intervals.  After a couple of minutes, this light disappeared and did not return.I also saw what may have been blinking orbs in two other locations, both much further to the northwest and closer to the horizon.  However, due to the distance, although those lights were blinking in the same odd manner, I can&apos;t be sure.  However, the formation of lights and the two individual orbs that I saw were identical in behavior.The funny part of the entire event, each time I saw the lights I thought, &quot;you&apos;re kidding, these can&apos;t be what I think they are,&quot; and then a few minutes later they would reappear doing the same things I doubted I had just seen them do.I&apos;ve lived in this high-rise for years and have seen hundreds of planes and helicopters come and go.  I have never, ever seen anything like what I saw tonight.  I looked through the NUFORC reports and found a similar report of orbs over Lake Michigan exhibiting similar behavior on AUgust 8th.

I am in far NE Mesa, close to the Tonto National forest.  I am fairly high up on the mountain, and these lights were directly south of my view, possibly over Chandler or Gilbert.  I went back inside to get my husband since I wanted his opinion as to what these were.  We were back out on the patio together within less than 30 seconds.  Within about 20 seconds the light to the right faded out, and immediately after, the left faded out.  After about 1 minute, these lights both appeared again in the same exact spot.  They were not as bright as they had been when we first spotted them.  Over the course of the next hour and a half, these lights continually faded in and out.  Sometimes it took 5 to 10 minutes for the appear again.   We noticed that when the faded back on again, they had moved slightly - sometimes higher, sometimes lower, and sometimes spaced apart a little bit.   We also noticed a very smaller (third) light that would sometimes move around these other larger more stationary lights.  I brought my teenage out the patio to witness this, to see what he thought.  All of us were completely at a loss for what this was.  We called two news stations and reported this.

My first thought was that the object was a airliner, however the speed of the object seemed slower than usual and there was no visible vapor trail, even though there were a few light clouds in the upper atmosphere. I ran inside and grabbed a pair of binoculars and continued to observe the object. The binoculars are 10x50 and through them the object appeared to a little over 1/4 of an inch in size. The object was reflecting light from the setting sun, which highlighted certain details. It was cigar shaped and displayed no wings, tail or visible lights. The object appeared to be metallic and was bright white in color along most of its surface with a hint of red towards the rear. There seemed to be three large circular impressions that ran along the length of object. There was no discernible propulsion that could be seen.

It was a spherical or circle of bright white light.  It flew right over my head at a steady slow speed at an altitude of approximately 1,000 feet! There was absolutely NO NOISE! It came from the WNW and disappeared in the ESE direction.  Right before it disappeared over the tree line a reddish brown tube of light either flew right below it or it was shot out of the bottom of the UFO.  The tube shot out at a very high speed but it was lit up like a flourescent tube and it looked like there were 2 sections to the tube.  I could definetly see a black line in the middle of the tube.

She watched it fly around, get small in size, change its shape a few times and then finally fly away.  She then went to her mother&apos;s bedroom door and knocked on the door.  When her mother woke up and asked her what the problem was, the daughter told her mother what she had just seen.  The mother told her to go back to bed, that she must have been dreaming.

It appeared to be spinning across the sky.  The rate of rotation and movement remained constant.There were a few clounds in the sky and the object was below the cloud level.  I watched it pass under a cloud that was close to directly overhead.  I observed the object for a few minutes, until it was too far away to see.The object made no detectable sound.  I don&apos;t know what this was, but it was clearly not a bird or a plane.  For a moment I thought it was a plastic grocery bag being blown very high, but when it got closer I could clearly see that it was rotating at a steady pace.

However, I noticed what I thought was a constellation within it. It was the inverse of Cassiopeia in that it was an upside down triangle but with another object in parallel with it. It then moved very fast across the sky, northwards crossing Cassiopeia and remaining in formation perfectly. This object was moving very fast, and I could hear NO noise. Please note this appeared very high in the sky, and I can only compare it&rsquo;s brightness to the stars. The size appeared huge, as it replicated in size to the 2 pointer stars of Cassiopeia and in relation to the constellation moved across it in seconds.

I noticed one was brighter than normal with much more flashing lights than any plane I have ever seen. I also noticed it was moving much faster than the other planes. As it moved from North to West it stopped in the sky. I did get binoculars out to look at it but all I could see was the bright lights constantly flickering and flashing, mainly red, green, yellow and orange. I did look at the rest of the sky and noticed another object to the North East with the same description. At times they would get very bright and almost look as if they were on fire (with that kind of flickering light). I continued to watch them for 2 hours and there was not change except the object to the West did start to fade out, but the object to the North East was still just as bright. I found it very odd that they did not move from the locations they were at. I&rsquo;m sure there could be some explanation for this, but I do not see what it could be.", "satellite-like in brightness, slow and changing direction, no contrail, heading first WSW then W.I was enjoying my morning coffee on my porch, facing east.  There was a thin, high band of clouds somewhat obscuring the sun, and I noticed a &apos;rainbow effect&apos; by the disc of the sun, presumably due to ice crystals in the clouds.  I then noticed, about 50-55 degrees above the eastern horizon, what looked like a satellite, moving toward WSW in a slow, somewhat halting fashion. After about a minute it seemed to change course to due west. It did not increase or decrease in brightness, as a tumbling satellite reflecting sunlight would. Also, the sun was behind it.  I could not determine altitude using the clouds as a guide, because the object was away from the clouds, but it looked to be much higher than a normal aircraft.  There was no contrail or sound. I wish to emphasize that the object looked very much like a satellite that you see after sundown would.  I watched, craning my neck as far as possible until I had to get up and walk on the gravel driveway (in barefeet-ouch!) I took my eyes of the object for just a second, but could not find it again.  It would have been directly over my house.  I went inside, and it was exactly 0900 hours.  As a sidenote, my Dad was an aeronautical engineer for Boeing,  and I know a plane when I see one.  I am also an amateur astronomer, and this may well have been the ISS space station or a satellite of some sort, but the fact that it changed direction, was slow and halting and so bright makes me scratch my head and wonder what it was.  If I had to guess, I would say the object was round or slightly oblong. Also, I was wearing sunglasses.", "Spotted a UFO with lights floating above treetops!My boyfriend and I were driving on Miller Rd, when we saw something up in the sky to the left. At first I thought it was a tower of some sort, but it was different than anything I have ever seen. It looked like some type of rectangular craft that had two bright lights pointing in what seemed to be the front of the craft. The beams of the lights seemed to go out for many many feet although I couldn&rsquo;t be sure from the ground. Their were two lights on the bottom that were the same, pointing to the ground. The craft didn&rsquo;t seem to be moving at all, and when we stopped at a stop sign, we saw that it was floating just above the treetops, and not moving. When we turned and got a look at what I believe was the back, we saw five to ten lights as bright as the others, but with no beams. We rolled the windows down and heard nothing. A plane or helicopter would have made some type of noise, and this was like nothing we had ever seen before. I am convinced what we saw was a UFO.", "Witnessed, two gray objects flying without lights and sound.At approximately 10:30pm, I witnessed two objects flying overhead. The sky was clear so I was able to see the shapes. There appeared to be no visible lights on the objects. The first one I saw was like the shape of a pointed roof top. It seemed to be smaller than the second one, Although they appeared to be at the same altitude. The second one was in the shape of a very large boomerang and both seemed to glide through the air without sound. They were both gray in color and flew in a straight line.I am a lover of the universe and always venture out at night to view the stars.

Six small solid red lights moved across the sky over Hendersonville, NC, in a North Eastern direction. Three moved in a triangle formation.  Three came to a complete stop for at least 3 minutes.  Two of the three that had stopped, moved back in the direction they came from then, turned back again and moved in the original north eastern direction.  Two simply vanished and the remaining red lights then traveled out of sight. During this event we noticed two airplanes traveling across the sky and they looked nothing like the red lights. The sun reflected off of the airplanes making them shine white.", "Bright lighted craft over Phillipsburg, NJ and Easton, PALast night I observed what appeared to crafts with white and red strobe lights and many other lesser lights.  They had more than an airplane would have.  It looked like two flying side by side.  They came from out of the west (from near Easton, PA) headed east towards Phillipsburg, NJ.  They flew 5 miles or so easterly and then turned over Alpha, NJ.  They flew along route 78 and then made a right turn headed west.  It looked like they were following route 78 between PA and NJ.  They flew over Williams Township, PA.  After talking to my son (who lives in Easton, PA), he also saw them flying, they had lights and looked to be two crafts together.  As he watched, they appeared to make a right turn to head east again.  All through observing the lights, I heard no noises at all.  There were no engine or propulsion noises whatsoever.  Because I was in the Air Force, I am familiar with the noises of aircraft engines.The lights seemed to make a big loop at least four times.  After the fourth time, when they came east over NJ, they turned south and then seemed to leave I watched for a bit but they didn&rsquo;t come back.  I would like to note that all through my observations, the crafts flew slowly, much more slowly than would an airplane or jet or other aircraft.  They were about as high as a pipercub or helicopter would fly, however, the craft were neither of these.

It was far away and traveling West to East rather quickly. It looked to be just slightly smaller than a dime at the distance it was. At first I thought it must be a plane but as I focused on it a few things struck me as odd. 1) it was moving quite fast 2) it was INTENSELY SHINNY 3) it looked flat and round.

She left the bed and went to the window to get a better view of the object. Its shape was sharply defined since it appeared to be quite large, and was brightly lit with a yellowish white light. I asked her to extend her arm in front of her and move her thumb and forefinger apart to the approximate size of the object as it appeared from her viewpoint. She indicated a distance of about two and a half inches between thumb and forefinger. She further stated that the object was uniformly lighted, did not cast any discernible light on the wooded area below, and did not appear to have windows or other surface features..She described the object as a modified egg shape. The small end was pointing toward the direction of travel. The bottom side was less angular in comparison to the top, and the rear was more square than round. The object emitted no audible sound and its direction and speed were uniform.Initially the object appeared over the tree line. It traveled slowly west to east at a downward trajectory of about 20 degrees; almost as if on a landing approach. As its altitude decreased, the tree line began to increasingly interfere with her view until the object was no longer visible. The object was observed for a total of about five minutes.We live in a more rural part of Vestal and there is very little man made ambient light. The sky was clear with no moon at the time of viewing, and sunrise was three hours away.The next day, out of curiosity, I called the Vestal police department and inquired if there had been any reports of UFOs, lights in the sky, etc., and the person I was talking to said he was not aware of any such reports.

We stopped to lay down and look at the stars. Upon looking up a triangular shape caught my eye. It had just become dark and for a split second I thought it was a weird bird. Then I looked at how it flew, from east to west, then back again, then in a circle. I asked my daughter if she saw it and she said, &quot;Yes I do. What is it? Is it a ghost or a demon or a spaceship?&quot; It moved very gracefully, then turned south and began to fly over us. It never increased or decreased in speed. It appeared as a triangle with a hollow center, sort of like a boomerang with stripes. There were no lights but some sort of very small illumination like a glow which gave it the ghostly appearance. It was gray, a light gray and made no sound at all. The thing continued to fly, very smoothly and gracefully, to the south until we could no longer see it. About a minute later what looked like a star, just a simple star, began to zigzag across the sky. It disappeared twice and then flew to the southeast. We went inside and told my boyfriend, who laughed at us. Then one of my other children suggested we draw what we saw (the triangular thing) in opposite rooms. We did and the pictures are identical. This concerns me as I&apos;ve had weird things happen to me all my life - playing with strange objects in my room as a small child (that no one else ever knew about as they visited me at 3 a.m. or so), a triangle cut into my back in the middle of the night (as with a laser) that I never felt happen, a metal rod instered into my heel that I never remember the trauma of receiving (showed up on an x ray).", "Noted a star/spider shaped craft with yellow lights and blinking lights at ends.I observed either 8 to 10 legs and they had yellow lights that blinked on the ends and there was yellow/orange lights spaced evenly.

Friends and family in the A.V.had told me ufo stories,but none were like this, makes me wonder what lockheed and nasa are also doing out here. I&apos;M now a believer of ufo&apos;s!", "I observed an object in the north-easterly skies at approximately 4:30 pm on this Saturday. The object became evident when I was observing a private aircraft moving in a northwesterly direction; at the same time an airliner was above it moving in the same general direction towards San Francisco or Oakland airports. As the two aircraft moved and separated I noticed a third &apos;aircraft&apos; behind and higher then either of the two I had been observing. Under clear blue skies what I thought was another jetliner was in full view and it was not moving and made no noise. It seemed odd that the craft could be so still and yet with the sun in the western skies it was clearly reflecting light as you would see in an aluminum like jet or airplane. I focused on the craft, with the naked eye, and I continued to observe it and clearly saw it was not moving. I deduced it could not possibly be a star because it was too early in the afternoon. I called to my wife to witness this but she declined, but I was able to hail my daughter. Unfortunately, she has a serious eye condition and could not see the object so I told her to bring down my binoculars which she did. With the binoculars I could see the object with more clarity and it appeared oval in shape and the bright aluminum-like reflection seemed to also show a red band? Without the aid of a tripod to steady the binoculars I was pressed to get a clear image. The object remained steady and did not move and I used a reference point to make this observation. I kept watching the object and then told my daughter to get my video cam-corder but she could not find it. After about 5 minutes I had to rest my eyes and had a hard time re-acquiring the object but I did and watched for a few minutes more with the binoculars now resting on the top of a camera tripod - my binoculars have no tripod attach point. Frustrated that no one else was there to witness this I hollered to my wife; as I was waiting for her - having taken my eyes off the object - I turned back to the are! a where the object was and could not locate it. After a few moments I was able to see it for one last time. Now it seemed to have moved away since it seemed much smaller than when I first saw it. By the time my wife came down I lost sight of the object and did not see it again. I will add that in the general direction of the sighting you will find Travis AF base. From my backyard I will often see military aircraft on occasion; however, my military background and understanding of aircraft lead me to believe this was not a typical aircraft. It was too high and was absolutely still - no movement - and no noise.

Our plane initially approached from the south, then turned east to land on a different runway.  After the plane had turned east, I was watching the ground, looking at the cars and houses and farm fields around DIA.  There were clouds beneath us.  I was watching the things on the ground when a white sphere of light coming from underneath a cloud caught my eye.  I dismissed it as the sun&apos;s reflection off of an airplane or a windshield, or possibly a light on top of a communications tower, this area being a loosely populated area with a high amount of air traffic.  I then questioned my initial dismissal when from beneath the cloud I observed two more, and noticed how the ground was moving beneath them, in a formation with the first observed.  This was in the course of a few seconds.  I watched this group, traveling west, but our plane and the formation of lights were traveling in opposite directions and I could no longer see them for the clouds and the window well obstructing my view.  I shrugged my shoulders, and continued to watch the ground.  I saw a white light, moving in a squiggly path, traveling south.  I saw it only momentarily, before it was obscured by another cloud.  We landed and I saw nothing further afterward.The flight was a Frontier flight.  The aircraft was a Bombardier turboprop.  I was seated forward of the propellers.I am a Cavalry Scout.

The sunset illuminated the cloud revealing many strange objects within (or possible one very large single object).  Some shapes appeared to be solid and others appeared transparent.  As the sunrays varied with the sunset so did the shapes of objects within the cloud.   Other clouds surrounding the larger appeared strangely illuminated in bright iridescent colors.  Many other hikers stopped hiking and marveled at the objects within the clouds.  I took many pictures of the event and was in the process of creating a panorama in Adobe CS2.  As the individual photographs were overlay semitransparent on each other to form the panorama, many more objects were then reveled in greater detailed clearly identifying them as possible UFOs.

I then started going outside every nite, with my stepfathers binocoluars and a large lantern flashlite. I would lay down on thegrass my eyes strayning upwards for any sign of movement. when one night it finally paid offwhen 3 crafts that were shaped like the shape of wings of a c-141 sloped wings came together as one east the other south and the last one west they just stopped in mid air. I was so excited that i began to aim the lantern flashlite at them turning it on and off. trying to communicate to them.

I was waving to it when the dome shape opend up like a small window appeared, and a man was waving back to me. after seeing a very bright lite came on I then became very scared. I ran inside the house and I threw the door closed As I was doing this I was screaming Mom there here. Mom was at her sewing machine looked out our big bay window from where she was sitting and said. Hurry lock the door. I started to run back to the door and just before I could reach the door the handle turned, and the door began to open. Iwas crying Mom hide therfe coming inside. but as i turn to run past the living room. I saw my Mom and she was levatating toward the door that had just opend. so I ran faster to my room. thinking that this my safe place. I hurridly looked for a place to hide then I hid in my closet and closed the door.  I was sure that they wouldn&apos;t find me.  It seemed that i was there for hours. I threw alot of clothes on top of me to cover me up. so that! they wo uld not find me.  But just then I felt the door open up and then they found me.  there were two of them a small little guy like me. And a much scarrier guy all dressed in black robe.  I was very frightend just looking at him.  then the small one put his hand to my arm.  And i was walking with him out of my room past the front door to where a lite beamed down from the middle of the dome where earlier i had seen the man in the window of the dome.  we went to the lite and went up ofer my house to the ship.  The room was pitch black I was sitting with this little guy on sompthing like a bench against the wall, he was holding a cylindrical object in his hand and motioning me to use it I didnt understand what to do with it. But i refused. I then turned to the middle of the room and there was there a bed with some guys that looked like doctors, but they wernt doctors.  They had my lying on the bed naked. they were doing things to her and she was incoherent.  I then saw a being come from an opening in the black wall.  After he left through the same place I went over there and I could not find any door so I stepped through the same place.  only that when I looked down,to my left and to my right all I saw were stars in space.  I kept walking,and came through to a room. where it looked like the place that ran the ship. there were about four gray beings I think these were workers and a being dressed in black robe.  He realy frightend me to look at him.  I started to walk around when I noticed these writtings on a couple of places they looked like heiroglyphics of a kind that I have never seen.  Just then i saw my little friend come over to where I was standing he was holding my arm and we began a tour of the ship I told him then that I wasnt afraid of him and I felt at peace with him.  He took me to a room where there was three other beings around a circular table. Where there was a handle and a few other objects that looked like control knobs.  I asked him how does this craft fly?  he showed me and that it was cont! rolled b y electro Magnatism.  I didnt understand what that ment but o&quot;well I guess it was o.k.  Then we walked to three other rooms where there more of the beings.  And then we went to a room where there were three boys and two girls like me butg different. they showed no signs of feelings or talking.  I guess that these kids were about my age.  When another being came to me and said that they brought me there to teach the children how to play.  I said my toys are where we keep our garbage cans earloier in the day I had been playing with my army jeep and a tonka truck and horse trailer.  After a few minuets the being returned,with my toys.  And was angry and asked me if I,was a soldier.  I laughed and replied that I was only a child. then hew gave me my toys and i started to play with them on the floor of that room. Infront of the other children making noises like car motors reving up. then I gave these to othe other children and they smiled at me with pointed jagged teeth that scared me just to look at them.  Then it was my turn. we were in the black room again and it was my turn I was lying on the table naked. they the two doctors were grasping my stomach then the other one grabbed a long stem object and inserted it into my stomach.  I creid out it hurt so bad what they were doing to me. as i was screaming and crying one being came with another long stem object around to my head just abouve my neck and the back of my head he was inserting this object in to the back of my head.  It hurt so bad that I was yelling but like they dont understand what pain is. they just ignored my cries.  after such pain that i was experiencing i passed out.  I was weaking up when my small gray friend was there with me. we were in a room about 6x6 feet my Mom was there too sitting on a bench like I was I then asked my friend if I could go with them. He said that i could.  Then i asked my Mom if I could go and she said it was up to me and that I could go.  I then asked my friend how long it would be before we came back to my house. H! e said a bout 35 years.  And after that I said no. Iwant to go with my Mom.  I also asked him if I could have sompthing so I colud call him, when i wanted.  He gave me somepthing like a button.  And he said that the others would take it from me. if they found it on me when they let us go.  Well when I woke up I remberd everything that had happend to me and my Mom.

I was a small child living with my great grandmother in a small town in Oklahoma, very small town. I guess it had a population then of less than 2,000.Lindsay, Oklahoma is where I was born and raised and where the following events occurred.I stayed with her a lot. My mother lived nearby and had 4 other children younger than me. I was very close with my great grandmother and was her favorite.Because I had no way of describing what happened at the time I recounted the events to my great grandmother the next morning over breakfast as that I had been lifted in the air last night by a white light to what my mind at the time thought was a giant silver tube of toothpaste. (the shape was the only thing I could come up with that my little mind could describe). I tried to describe how scary it was. I don&rsquo;t remember any discussion about it again.It wasn&rsquo;t until I was an adult and something caused me to think of it again that I realized what had happened was an UFO abduction.I will describe exactly what I remember.I was in bed with my great grandmother which is where I always slept. I awoke to find myself floating up in the air inside a white beam of light. I was outside because I looked down to see my great grandmother&rsquo;s house below me. I recall being terrified to the nth degree. I can&rsquo;t even begin to explain how scared I was.I looked up to see that I was being drawn through the air to a very large, cylindrical shiny silver object with a dark opening in it&hellip;to which I was being lifted towards. It seemed that a being was standing near the opening and watching me floating up to it.I have absolutely no recollection of what occurred inside the UFO. I woke up again back inside my great grandmother&rsquo;s house.A disturbing thing to me now which at the time I didn&rsquo;t relate properly and couldn&rsquo;t explain properly is that the day of my return I complained to my mother and great grandmother that my genital area was very sore. I complained enough that they examined the area to see if something was wrong. I was questioned as to what made me so sore and I know this sounds weird but because I was a small child and had no remembrance of being inside the UFO and anything that could have happened all that my mind could come up with was that a blade of grass had been inserted into me. They were perplexed and asked me repeatedly what had happened and I gave the same explanation again. It&rsquo;s all that I knew to say&hellip;.for some reason I believed that something had been inserted and knew that it was something similar to a blade of grass. I had no idea how the blade of grass came to enter me. It&rsquo;s all I knew to say.I am 50 years old now and still remember these events vividly. I believe that it was an UFO abduction. When I became an adult and began to read and learn of other abductions I realized that I had experienced this too. As a child I couldn&rsquo;t explain it because I had never heard of UFOs  and had no vocabulary or knowledge to explain it.I have related the experience a couple of times to family members but they think I must have dreamed it. I can understand that because it sounds so weird that I don&rsquo;t want to believe it either.I just wanted to tell my story to someone and have it documented.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

She looked up and saw a light through the blinds. she asked me what it was. I reached up and opened the blinds and saw 2 red/orange lights attached to a huge object floating very slowly over the tree tops. I immediately got up and ran outside, trying to wake up everyone in the house as I ran. It came over the top of the house as I ran out the front door. It had bracket looking symbols on the bottom *[   ]* with the lights on either side of it. the top and bottom of the brackets were bent at about 45 degrees as opposed to the 90 degree brackets. This craft was about the size of the house and didn&apos;t make a sound I never saw the &quot;top&quot; of it only the bottom. I ran underneath it and it was very close as I got to the street I picked up a stone and threw it at the craft. I never heard the stone hit the craft nor did I hear the stone land. The craft flew North until it went over the hill and outran me. Even when I was viewing it from behind as it flew away I did not see a top on it. I went back inside and no one woke up. No one heard me yelling for them to wake up either. I spoke with my girlfriend and asked her why she didn&apos;t come outside. She said she was scared. I thought about the stone and the fact that no one heard me yelling and thought that the craft had some kind of noise canceling technology on it.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

Directly West of Broward Blvd &amp; Flamingo Road were a total of 7 lights in the sky.  4 lights were in a linear formation ahead of 3 lights in a triangular formation...then the 3 caught up w/ the 4.  One neighbor came out of his house.  He stated that he saw them when they were East of our neighborhood and there was no sound.  We only saw them when they were well West, out over the everglades.We watched the lights for about 12 minutes until they were out of sight.  They were not flashing in any manner...just constant light eminating from each object.  It was very freaky.This is also in the flight pattern of jets landing at FLL.  There is NO WAY at all that these lights were any type of plane.  Nothing blinking, absolutely NOT following what the planes do (they land to the East, these were going straight West).I only have very poor video from my phone as I was not in front of my house when we saw the lights.", "We watched a light for 6 houres drag somthing off Diana Island and ride it out over the hurison.It was september 28th 2005 a buddy (buddy1) had a house on bradys beach its a beach on the end of vancuver island that looks acrose to 3 other islands and toward japan  over the herivon.  The 3 of use were walking down the beach to the rock stacks when we noticed a tug boat was heading for the beach. We new it was a tug boat all three of us were raised in the area and we have studied the boats, lights and signals, this tug had its all around white light on aswell as its tow light so we thought. We were just making a comment on how the tug was heading for the beach when we saw its load start floating backwards. Naturly we all got excited and started sceeming on how to go salvige its load when it shot up in the air. The tug boat stratend out and took off, we dint even watch to see were the tug boat went we were all to captivated by this object sowrring throug the sky heading over the 3 islands ( from rite to left when looking at the islands from the beach Helby, Diana, Edward King). The it focused on diana island moving unaxplainabuly and making a wushing nosie like the sound you here when u put your ere agenst a fan. The object was like an L.D light from christmas trees white with a blueish tinge, at first the object looked huge, then seconds later we were watching move so fast through the island we could see it moving through out the trees an obgect like this had to have been really smalland abile to navagiat on a dime. As we watched we tryd are hardest to convince eachother what this object could be, we playd with the idea that it was a rescue helicopter looking for someone, or drug smoglers with some new technolagy but as we watched it move darting and dashing through out the trees it proved us wrong. It apeard to be looking for somthing or taking pictures of the island.We dint know what to think we even tryd telling are selves we were having a mass halusination, so as it kept circuling the island, moving through the trees we all sat there watching it saying out lowd witch way it was moving. All together at the same time we were sayin &quot;left, right, down, then WOW &quot; , we figure that the object must have re-botted because as it was heading up its tail that it would leave as it moved got thincker and hit the grownd and a ball of light whent exploding from each direction. After that we dint speek for a good 40 mins just watching this light endlessly going through out diana island, then buddy2 says &quot;if anything happends, if it ubducts me im going to bit off my tung&quot;, and that was the first moment i belived that this was an alian a ufo, somthing non human.Just as i was excepting this, the white bluish lite shawn over the water, over the beach acrose the rocks and hit us we sat motionless i observide the shadows that this light left and they wernt really shadows i could see the sand i could see the opisit side of the rocks witch the light hit, they had a shade like a shadow but they werent shadows i dont know how to explain it.Then the light kept focusing on the island, it kept moving through the trees,we had been watching the light for about 3hourse when buddy1 desided to go get the bonculars so we all walk towards his house yet never took are eyes off the light, buddy2 and I sat down at the edge of the water as close to the object we could wile buddy1 came back with the bonuculas we observed the light through the bonuclas trying to keep up with its movmens, i could kind of make out a roundish figure,but the light it was preducing was more intresting it almost seemed like it was doing tight circuls underneath the object going into it, like the light was coming out of thin air going up into it, then it whent back into the trees and was moving even more rapidly then before. By now it was about 5 am and buddy1 had to go to work within houres so he went back to his cabin. But as buddy 2 and i watched the light seemed to have dragged somthing to the tide line and continued to dart through the trees within another houre the tide hade came all the way up and then the light hoverd over the object , witch seemd dark and round  and just a little bit bigger then the light. The light then started moving almost floating from the island on top of the object it had dragged from the forest, first it had to come toward us, and wile it was heading in are direction the faint nosies it made got lowder and it was woshing through my head i dont know if i was just focusing on the nosie and only the nosie but it was like it was the only thing i could hear, not waves crashing on the beach , or the thought going through my head just this woshing sound sounding like it was going ! in circu les lowder and quite lowder then quite as it started turning for the hurisine, and within minuites it seemed we could no longer see the light, as the sun came out it vanished off into the open ocaen with what ever it recoverd from Diana Island.We watched this for 6 houres, I was the only one who wasnt aftaid of what people might think if i told them but no one belived me, i told every one i thought would listen but the boys dint speek of it. We had plans to go over to Diana Island to see if there was any burnings on the trees or plants, or if there was growth abonormiltys to any of the plants, but the next week was stormy, gale force winds and i dont think any of us were ready to find anything that could convince the ones we respect and love. But still to this day we look up to the sky and anything moving we watch it to see what it might be , any time we here a nosie that is simular we listen, just maby we could see somthing again and not be astrange to it.Buddy1 and I were talking the other day and he made a coment &quot;You think after seing somthng like that it would change your life, your belifes, but 3 years latter im just like oh yah iv seen the unxplaind and i liked it&quot;. We still live are day to day life we know theres somthing out there and thats alrite because were never alone, who wants to be?.", "orange light in night skyI was in the garden , having a look up at the stars , when i noticed a small dot in the sky travelling in a straight line , i knew this was a satelite and watched it for about 30 seconds , it was traveling in a what i think is northerly direction maybe nne when all of a sudden i noticed a bright orange light which seemed to be moving at a very fast speed it was travelling on an easterly course and was only in view for about 5 seconds , i know it wasnt a sat i know what they look like and what speed they travel in the night sky , it wasnt a commercial aircraft ( no flashing lights and no visible vapour trail ) i dont think it was any sort of plane but who knows i heard no noise of an aircraft it might be explainabble but i would be suprised i have never seen anything like it b4 except once . cant give you an exact date it was back in 1996 i was on a morning shift that started at 6am i was waiting for my lift at about 5:15 too 5:30 it was dark but starting to get light , i noticed an object in the sky similar to above but this was making funny movements , it would move to the right then back to the left watched this for about a minute when all of a sudden i heard jet planes i looked behind me and two raf planes shot overhead towards this light in the sky all of a sudden the object accelerated away at great speed and out of sight i watched the jets turn round and fly back in the direction they had come from never forget that sight till the day i die , i nearly peed with excitment .", "Solid red light moving slowly across sky, at times had white things coming off of it as if it was falling off.My brother and I were looking at this solid red light moving very slowly across the sky.

There was also a time where a piece fell off and then it turned orange and split into pieces again, then it had disappeared.

No sound.This is one old and &quot;hearsay&quot; report so ditch it if you wish. Anyhow I&apos;ve never told anyone but... Here&apos;s the thing:  My grandfather (now died) told me in early &apos;80&apos;s when I was very young, 10+ years of age, that he saw a green ball of light moving (following a road) towards &quot;south&quot; (see GPS/map I give later). I thougtht he was referring to late 70&apos;s or early 80&apos;s-it doesn&apos;t matter since no local paper gave confirmation. My grandmother did say (at the time granddad told me) &quot;don&apos;t tell him odd things&quot; and still my grandfather (known never to take any alcohol and/being totally sober from drugs also-I just mention this since drugs are common in some countries now-a-days) insisted on the sighting. He said it was nothing spectacular/odd, just a cigar-shaped 30/200cm ball of green light never seen by anything he had seen/read about. (He had nice library I quite liked it) and he was not least ashamed nor quiet about it if anyone asked. He even called local newspaper &quot;Etel&auml;-Suomen Sanomat&quot; about it (next morning), but nobody else had seen it. So he really did not go to any trouble telling about it, just stated me the facts. My first time hearing about it was when I read and told him (in dinner table, later) about advanced flight (I told stuff about &quot;planned aeroplanes 2 mach&quot; I&apos;d read in a book in his bookshelf-there were so many books... At my age I did not think he had had time to read them all-now I&apos;m sure he did not because I can say he never read/understood the german/russian/hungarian books in the shelves). I didn&apos;t make much of it at the time (nor anytime later since now), but you might be able to find out on our local newspaper ? (if You&apos;re interested, I still think it was marsh-gas, plasma, or equivalent natural though unknown phenomena). And poorly described. But it was obviously larger than a &quot;torch&quot; worn by persons/car/bike, nor did it &quot;sparkle&quot;. Location of the sighting was from north to south via road (above road, not touching it). Speed was nothing spectacular, just 50km/h or so. Like a fast moving car but there was nothing below it, and it just took the road(looked like it) since there were pines all around. Viewer lost sight when the road ended (up+south there&apos;s a T-intersection-both sides left&amp;right and up(even steeper hill) had lots of pines and some leafy trees) and not a clue which way the thing took off. If it&apos;d taken up it&apos;d have been seen against Salpausselk&auml;, so obviously it took of right/left or disappeared. Terrain: There is very old granite hills East (spelling?) but some very deep ditches of marsh (North) and there a never-drying lake with no river out. I can draw if google doesn&apos;t provide/if you insist, the landscape is&apos;nt too different today I could take a picture if I thought it made any difference... It should be obvious in google maps ?  All the area around is max 100mx100m private properties, each one with one house. Odd nobody else reported seeing it. He especially stated there was no sound. ---Below here is for personal/documentation usage only, please--- The location will tell my/grandfater/etc personality to people in town so anything below is not for public review: http://www.02.fi/kartta/m%C3%A4yr%C3%A4nkatu+5/lahti  My granddad was watching the item move from north Purokatu (viewed from M&auml;yr&auml;nkatu) to south purokatu, lost the item view close/before purokatu-kiveri&ouml;nkatu intersection. View to the first end (looking right-hand) of the sighting is blocked by lots of birches, so he propably saw it from the intersection of m&auml;yr&auml;nkatu/purokatu towards south (near road). There&apos;s an opening, a small pond, so it is not sure the light followed road, but behind that opening there&apos;s a very tall hill so it was between the hill and the viewer. The hill curves back towards road rising so the thing was seen either back on the road or going all the way the road. Finally it went up the hill&amp;road towards the T-intersection near/where he lost view of it. Sorry I did not proofread this report with any program, but I&apos;m not too interested in spelling mistakes. Also I do repeat things my granddad said with emphasis. This is the only &quot;odd&quot; story I heard from him (or I heard anyone else about him telling). After all I think this is just another swamp-gas/plasma thing-I just thought I&apos;d submit another unverifiable &quot;heard from someone of&quot; sighting... (oh, you can call the &quot;rather big&quot; newspaper about things near m&auml;yr&auml;nkatu/purokatu but you better send the email about the names while in phone-or have someone talking Finnish:). http://www.ess.fi/ &lt;- not even sure anyone recorded... Toni K.Suchros_trashmail at hotmail.com Feel free to ask specific questions though I am not sure I can answer... Or want to. Please do not contact my grandmother she&apos;s very old (oh yes, I do say THIS because otherwise you would bother her:she will confirm anything I say). If you prefer just dismiss this report rather than contact her. Other persons do not know (maybe my 2 uncles but I&apos;ve never asked-and anyhow they don&apos;t have 1st hand experience and one is a drunk). I clicked &quot;aura&quot; around the object since it was floating and he said there was nothing below it-I figured out it&apos;s green glow reflected from the road and nearby objects... But this was only my thoughts, didn&apos;t think to ask about it. ps: I have never seen UFO myself, not even sure where they come from, and my grandfather was in the war and did not tell stories about it at all, just stated it was horrible-&gt;do anything to avoid, even &quot;give some leeway to russians until country&apos;s in danger again&quot;...

Our position was on Missile Road between the north boundary of Wichita Falls and Burkburnett, Texas and 1-2 miles from the airfield at Sheppard Air Force Base which was east of us.  Looking up and to our west, we saw this object that I would estimate west-northwest, possibly 50 plus miles away and possibly near the altitude of 10,000 feet.At 7:00 P.M., the sky was clear and it was getting near sunset so we were guessing the object could be deflecting sunlight but this object was exceptionally illuminated and large for any aircraft.   We went to a nearby Wal-Mart, shopped and came outside and the object was still there and a bit closer.   We went home and the object was still there but more to our immediate west.  As my wife went to get our binoculars, I talked to a neighbor to justify what we were seeing and we all agreed we were seeing something unusual.  At 8:00-8:15, I saw through my binocular what seemed to be a balloon shape object sourcing this amazing golden-white light.  Upon further looks, this object appeared to be diamond shaped with an exception of being elongated and flat on the bottom.  Taking an eye off of it for a few short moments, maybe a minute, it disappeared.There was nothing on the news about it, but I&rsquo;m sure others had to see this fairly well populated town. I felt compelled to write about this was extraordinary sighting.  We&rsquo;re retired Air Force, lived here for over 10 years, and are familiar with night and daytime air traffic in the area.  I do not know of an aircraft that could remain in a nearly static position for more than an one hour with the exception of slightly moving south,  be nearly diamond shaped, generating the intensity of this blinding light and then disappear immediately.", "Unidentified Circle of Light accelerates and disappears at very high altitudeMy Wife noticed a far away light Moving Up above and slightly north.  she asked me immediatly to look and see since the light was moving seemingly fast, and was far away compared to the normal high altitude aircraft we see.  When I looked up I saw light about the size of the stars around but it was more of a solid circle than the fuzzy stars. The Object was moving not too fast in my opinion at first, but moving  Slightly to the Southwest it picked up speed very rapidly and the Mostly white with a blue haze vanished or it almost seamed to give off a sigle Dim flash effect, like that of a old lightbulb going out.  I had looked at the time right before my wife asked me to look and the time it took was definatly not more that 6 seconds, I would say 4 seconds is the correct length of time. I know it hard to judge altitude but after observing other planes and even high flying jet fighters in the area, that the object appeared ither in the sub-atmosphere or farther out into space.

I asked what he was talking about?  He said that up there in the sky pointing to the North.  I could not see what he was talking about from where I was standing on my porch.  I walked over to where he was atanding in the street and looked to the North where he was pointing to. There we stood and observed them,a cluster of sphere like objects all apparantly somehow hooked together.

My mind was trying to rationalize what I was seeing into being a plane but it was very low, possibly only 100 feet up in the air and I could see a vague outline of it. It wasn&apos;t black, more of a gunmetal grey color. There were two very bright white lights in &quot;the front&quot; I&apos;m not sure if it was the front or not. What I thought was weird was that there was a bright red blinking light in the center of the two white lights.I rolled down my window as I drove slowly by and there was no noise. It was very close to the road but was over the cropland. It hovered moving very slowly. My car was moving much faster. I started to veer off the road from looking at it and then straightened my car and continued on. It was still there it seemed as I drove away.

After that I called my sister and told her where are you, there is something trying to land on the other side of the street. My mom was also in the car with my other two sisters as well, and she was the one who picked up the phone,she replayed what are you talking about.So I replayed something is landing, and hanged up. I was looking at it and it was trying to land a yellow bluish light came from the center of it but there was no sound, and they aborted the landing. At that time I tried to run about a block to the gas station,I must have run about 10 feet and there it was again trying to land. So I ran back to the garage again and called my sister again and asked them where are you guys, they replayed we are six blocks a way and we see a light it must be a helicopter or a airplane, and they said it&apos;s moving away. After that they came and picked me up. As soon as we got of the driveway and on the street all of the sudden the round craft was hovering over the building where I work and half of the four lane street, and it was pulsating red and blue lights and no sound.So we drove away as fast as we could from there, and after a few seconds it vanished out of our sight.I will ask at work tomorrow if they have recorded anything on the surveillance cameras at the building.", "My Grandfather was standing outside of our house waiting for me to return from driving to blockbuster when he calls me terrifyed to tell me that he&apos;s seeing a strange object in the sky.

We often see and hear helicopters as we are in an urban area and just a few blocks from a major shock trauma center so there is much activity.  This night however as I sat on my deck I noticed to my left in the eastern sky what appeared to be a low helicopter heading west, the bright light on it however was larger than normal and was of a light green color which I&rsquo;ve never seen in the three years of living here.  As it got closer to being overhead it appeared to be oval shaped and I realized there was absolutely NO NOISE, no engine sound, and no propeller sound.  All at once the light seemed to flash one time and go dark, completely dark, nothing, not a sound.  I mean it just went out as if someone had turned off a switch.  It was incredible.  And in the sky where the light had just been extinguished, there was nothing but clear sky.Can anybody give me any explanation for this?

I was heading East toward the Las Vegas Blvd. the road that I was on is probably 200 yards in length, it is a residential road.As I drove down the road, I was able to see The Stratosphere Hotel and Casino, this is a very tall building. nothing out of the ordinary at first as i turned onto this road that headed East. Maybe halfway down, I noticed a large sphere, golden and radiant, it looked like the light from a lighthouse shining directly at someone, but with a perfect bright sphere shape. This sphere was hovering in place perhaps 2/3s of the height of the Stratosphere building. slightly to left of the building from my perspective, which would make the sphere be on the North side of the building, 2/3s of the way up. I wasnt sure what it was and immediately it peaked my curiosity as soon as I saw it, it didnt really change in brightness from what i could tell, I was in a moving car. As soon as i got to the end of the street, i turned right (South) and the stratosphere was now being blocked by a commercial building across the street that i turned right onto. When i saw the stratosphere again, maybe 20 ft after made the turn, the sphere was gone.I also noticed a black helicopter heading toward the stratosphere from the North, and it looked like it was flying around the same height of where the sphere was. There should be a point made that there is no way that the helicopter could have been the sphere i saw, because the helicopter was MILES North of the Stratosphere, headed TOWARD the Hotel.  I did not see the bright sphere again.this was around 6pm, and in las vegas it is still very bright at 6pm, so it would make no sense for a massive light to just be hovering around buildings, especially that close to one.", "While driving east on New Route 50 leaving Lebanon, IL a very large, triangle shaped craft was flying very low and very slow directly over my vehicle. I could clearly see the bottom of the craft through my moon roof. The object took several seconds to move from the right side of my vehicle to the left and I could see it was black, triangular in shape and had many red lights on the bottom center of the craft. As it moved across the highway I got a clear view of the back. It had a tall, rectangular piece running perpendicular in the middle of the rear of the craft. Along this tall, rectangular object were red and white lights running up and down. The back of the craft was shaped like a long rectangle and had huge circular light on each end. Many lights were coming off the top creating an aura of bright white light. It proceeded to move across the sky very slowly and then turned west to head back towards Lebanon/Fairview Heights area. It was so large, as it moved west and I moved east I could still see its lights in the sky when I reached St. Rose road, approximately 25 miles from where the craft was flying.

The distance I can calculate from my position would put it in the range of 30 nautical miles over the state of Missouri in the boot heel region.The different array of lights the object had were flashing in different modes and alternated but a shape to the craft was never noted. I had no pictures or means to establish or document the event. I was hoping that someone else would report the incident to confirm what I had saw. There were commercial planes in the area and I would have thought that some of the airlines had made visual contact with the object off in the distance.The object could have been over the Kennett Missouri area but could have been much further away than that. This is the first incident I have ever witnessed and the occurrence has me baffled. Visibility Saturday night was 30 nautical miles and stars were out. The object at first appeared to be a star till I noticed that the flicker was different than a star. Upon viewing it through my binoculars, I noticed the object seemed to be rotating and had a light sequence not seen on any commercial air craft.I had no means of confirming with airports in the area nor the local police. Though I think more people than I witnessed the event that night.", "09/04/08  eldridge,al diamond object  0.5 secondsI was traveling east on hwy 78 and i looked up at the clouds because they were moving fast when all  at once i saw a bright white diamond shape object in the opening of the clouds it was fast it did not go parellel to the earth it was going strait up and in just  seconds it was gone it left no fuel trail behind and i know at that speed a jet engine leaves a stream this object had none", "Star-like point of light, flashing periodically, erupts into bright sparkle after 30 minutes.After a hard day, I thought it might be nice to sit and enjoy a small pot of tea in my back yard, which faces north. I first went out at twilight, around 9:30. I have a good view of the eastern and northern sky. Portions of the western sky are blocked by trees. My house blocks the southern sky. Directly overhead was one of the bright stars of the constellation Draco, the first star in my field of view bright enough to be visible. It was still too bright out for other stars to be visible. As I unwound and watched the sky, I thought I saw a flash or twinkle in the northern sky, almost due north, about 35 - 40 degrees up. Perhaps the sun glinting off a satellite, I thought, or maybe the navigation lights of a high-altitude jet aircraft crossing the country. Intrigued, I scanned for signs of an aircraft. About half a minute later, I saw it again, in exactly the same place. That ruled out a plane a satellite or, at least, the same plane or satellite, but what are the chances of two of either reaching that same spot within half a minute? Could be my eyes playing a trick on me, can&apos;t rule that out. Half a minute or so later, another flash or twinkle. A few minutes later, same thing. Always in exactly the same spot, near as I could tell.I got distracted for awhile by some things in the yard and inside the house, but was back watching the sky a little before 10:00. By that time, it was dark enough that I could make out more stars. There was no star visible where I saw the twinkle. There would be a couple of stars in the constellation Camelopardalis that would be visible in that area most nights, but it&apos;s still too light out to see any stars around there at 10:00 at this time of year. Toward the northeast, one of the brighter stars of Cassiopeia was now visible. Further east, I saw a light aircraft with flashing navigation lights flying level, headed due west. I watched the small plane cruise through the sky, noticing that there was another small plane flying a parallel path to the south. I figured one of them, probably the slower and more southerly one, was Saskatoon&apos;s police patrol plane, which is out most nights. It looked like the more northerly plane could have been preparing for an approach to the airport. After a few moments it reached the part of the sky where I saw the strange twinkling earlier, so my eyes were now drawn back to that area. Suddenly there was another flash of light from the same spot as before, but this time it was much brighter. The shape was not like a twinkling star, but more like a line or thin cylinder or dumbbell kind of shape, consisting of two very bright twinkly points, shining momentarily like sparklers on a birthday cake, with a straight, thin bright or shiny line joining them. The two bright points were maybe two degrees apart, about the width of my little finger at arm&apos;s length. The phenomenon lasted only a fraction of a second, maybe an eighth to a quarter of a second at most, but long enough that it was unmistakable. It made me jump. I watched the sky for several minutes, but did not see any other twinkles or flashes. Frankly, I began feeling a little uneasy once the bright flash occurred, and I packed up my tea and lawn chair and came into the house by about 10:15.I suspect that whatever it was, was very high in the sky. I would be curious to know if anyone in a more northerly community had seen this, and how it would have looked from their vantage point.", "Was looking up at the big dipper and watch from the dipper handle towards the right the object move slowly towards the right was a light star shaped and travel very slowly . just past the right edge of the dipper over 2 mins object stoped dead for about 30 second then blinked out was way to slow for shooting star and not fast enought to be a jet ,, about 3 mins later object looking the same was noticed below big dipper handle starting in same location was traveling same speed from bottom or big dipper. and was traveling up wards in a cross direction for about 3 mins to directly about me and stopped and didn,t move then blinked out this object was not jet trust me......", "North Cornwall, UK, circular craft, with pulsating lights surrounding it: blue, yellow, red.Circular craft, with pulsating lights surrounding it: blue, yellow, red.

We were meeting 2 girls in my neighborhood and were going to walk up to the local Circle K convenient store.  Well, we met up with the girls halfway, and started walking up to the store.  The neighborhood was a very large suburban neighborhood outside of Greensboro, N.C. close to the Piedmont International airport.  I can remember the night there so vividly, the cars had frost on them that would glisten under the street lights. It was such a cold night, but we were having fun sneeking out walking up to the store, we were about 14 yrs of age.  On our way to the store we were all cutting up having a good time when my buddy who was a jokster to say the least, all of a sudden said ya&apos;ll theres a U.F.O..  My initial thought was he is such an idiot, until I looked up and couldn&apos;t believe my eyes, their in the dark sky a little above the trees was a huge Bright yellowish oval object slowly careening above the trees.  We all in utter disbelief stood there and gazed at it.  Like I said, it was oval in shape sort of like a football stretched a little.  It Was completely glowing a very illuminated yellowish color, with a little blinking light at the front of the U.F.O. according to the direction of movement. Itwas approximately a quarter mile above the ground about a half of mile from wher we were at.  Without saying a word we all started running toward the object, but all of a sudden it simply vanished leaving puffy pink trails only to be seenin the city and moon lights.  So, with exubilation walked to the store and met w/ a friend who had a driver license and car and he picked us up to go riding.  We began to tell him of what we witnessed, and he sort of just laughed it off until he turned on his radio and radio DJ announced that a bunch of drunks on a Saturday night were calling in reported U.F.O. sightings, but we knew better because we were not drunk and definetaly not crazy. Our friend believed us after he heard the ra! dio DJ.Oh yea, forgot the object was also moving extremely slow and made no noise.  That is what I remember like it was yesterday.

I eventually lost sight of them but I have friends who were in different parts of the town who claim two of the lights moved in very close as if they were being sucked up into the sky, and the third followed. I originally thought there was only one craft due to the steady formation but now that I have seen many photos and talked to a lot of different eye-witnesses I believe we saw three seperate crafts.

It was a clear night outside, millions of stars in the sky. Not a cloud in sight. It was warm (about 800 outside) at 11:30pm.We had pulled over to look at all the stars and see if we could see a UFO or anything else in the sky. While there, we had seen approximately 3 objects that were very unusual. When someone would spot something in the sky (way up there) that was moving, I would shine my flashlight on it so everyone could see the object and follow it with there eyes. The 3 objects in question would be flying along (as one solid white light) then just disappear as we were tracking it with our eyes. There was no explanation for this. Where did it go? One minute it was there and the next it was gone.This went on for about 30-45 minutes. In that time frame we saw the flight path of the airplanes to our immediate north and to our immediate south. Very few planes (3) flew by us. The planes to our North were so far north that we could barely make them out. The planes to our South we could clearly tell that they were planes because they had lights on the crafts and we could hear the noise as they flew by us. No mistaking them for anything else.After about 45minutes we were talking about leaving when I spotted this solid bright white light (way up there) in the Southern sky. I told everyone to look (shining my flashlight up at the object) when all of a sudden the object turned toward us and shot a beam of light at us (as if acknowledging that it saw our light) then it simply turned and shot West into the night sky and simply disappeared right before our eyes just like the previous 3 objects we had seen earlier. The beam of light was as wide as the object itself. It was no search light from a helicopter or any other aircraft that I know of. Besides, it simply disappeared right in front of our eyes.When it turned and shot the beam of light at us, I screamed and stared to dart back into the vehicle because I was afraid that it would come down out of the sky and do something to us.

It started moving in circles and flashing strobe with colors that can be compared to a rave. It also seemed to be shining light from its belly towards the ground..maybe a beam? It was that moment that we noticed there was another one of these things in the sky a short distance away in width, but this one was a farther distance away.  They continued zig-zagging and moving in a circular formation for around an hour and disappeared. It looked as though one may have landed. What we saw cannot be explained.

It was clear night with many stars visible.", "Two separate light events at same time off of Sullivan&apos;s Island, SCTwo friends and myself witnessed an amazing sequence of mysterious lights in the Charleston harbor in South Carolina. We were at the beach on Sullivan&apos;s Island on the evening of May 24th, 2005, to watch the sunset. It was the day after a full moon, and we sat up in the dunes because the tide was coming in. After the sun set, and it finally became dark, the tide was so high that we were forced to stay in our position on the dunes. It was while sitting, waiting for the tide to go out just enough for us to be able to walk back to the beach access, that we began to see lights in the outer harbor, between Sullivan&apos;s Island and James Island.At first we saw only one orange light. It was located at the inside end of the jetties of the Charleston Harbor. From where we were sitting, we were pretty much staring out towards James Island. My first assumption was that the light was a flare, that maybe a boat was having problems in the harbor. Then a second light appeared to the left, seemingly the exact same light just in another place. I thought that perhaps the would-be boat launched another flare. While staring out at the lights, we slowly began to realize that if it were a flare, it would have at least moved in the wind or began to fall out of the sky. These lights remained at a constant position. Then it seemed that on of the lights -- the one on the right -- began to split, first in to another orange light.. then, each orange light split off to include a red light connected with a beam. Two immensely bright orange and red lights connected by a beam. They continued to dazzle us with a series of brightening and dimming, growing and shrinking, disappearing and reappearing, but never in a different spot. The one on the right seemed to be more active than the one on the left.We were frightened, but after coming to terms with what I was looking at, I thought enough of the event to try to capture a photo. I actually captured 4, but with a Nokia cell phone camera which probably would have been only 1 mega pixel at that time. I still have the phone somewhere in a drawer, with a picture I took of the sunset that same day, but its retired and no longer has service hooked up. I transferred the four pictures of the lights a few days later, but I think you would have to have been there to recognize what they represent. I tried to capture a video, but it refused to show up the same as it would for a picture.In the meantime, we had been drawn to another series of lights in a slightly different area of the sky. After the experience I mentioned above began, at least a few minutes passed before a bright white light began to appear in the sky out towards the open ocean.  Since we were staring out towards James Island, we had to look to our left and up in the sky to see this one.  A white light would appear and disappear.  We were never sure if it was going to come back, but each time it did. At first I thought this was lightning, but there was no flash of light associated with it.  It was a steady light that was there and then it wasn&apos;t.  We were so amazed and occupied by the orange/red lights that were giving us a show in the harbor, that I don&apos;t recall exactly how many times it happened.  But, after several times of appearing and disappearing, as kind of a grand finale the light appeared as five or six separate lights that all streaked across a small section of sky together at the same speed, then disappeared for good. In the end, five or six bright rectangular-ish objects that are equally sized and evenly spaced between each other, moving the same speed and same trajectory.Both instances of lights occurred simultaneously, however seemingly independent of each other. The styling of the two sets of lights were completely different.  The harbor lights were bright orange/red, fairly constant acting, and the ocean light(s) were white and more seldom.  None of the lights made sounds.

It was a very faint, distant white light, traveling south to west (I think) very high up in the sky &mdash; like a dim moving star.  At first, the light traveled at a steady straight pace, acting like a normal satellite.  Then suddenly, after about ten seconds, it veered north, traveling VERY fast (It just took off).  It traveled north for about five seconds, then veered west again and proceeded at its normal steady pace for about another ten seconds.  Afterwards, once again, it suddenly veered north, moving very fast, repeating the same pattern.  After about five seconds it veered west and then disappeared after a few seconds (or I lost track of it).While moving west, the light seemed to move like a typical satellite.

We pulled over and watched it, as we were watching it, it started to slowly turn revealing the underneath of the object.  The sky was a dark blue which allowed us to see that it was black and triangular shaped.  We turned down a side street to try and follow it, as we followed the object the six lights were still visible.  About 15 seconds later the lights began to shut off one by one.  As the lights began dimming, the object also seemed to fly away at a rapid speed.  We tried to watch it for as long as possible but it completely disappeared within the next 5 seconds. I AM CONVINCED THAT THIS IS A UFO.", "I saw what appeared to be a satellite, but then it stopped moving, then moved in several directions.On August 24, 2008 at approximately 9 pm, I was on a dinner cruise on Lake Coeur D Alene, Idaho with my wife and another couple.I was looking up at the stars and noticed what I thought was a satellite.  This star light then stopped directly over head in the vicinity east - southeast of the big dipper.It then moved in several directions, always returning to what appeared the original stopping point.On two occasions, it grew very dim, then grew back to the original size.  I am not sure if this was because it was moving farther away or lower below the horizon of the sunlight or earth shadow.  I was telling my friend what I was seeing and he finally saw light move as well.", "Light orb traveling westwardWe were driving into our driveway and spotted a orange glowing orb flying west. We went outside to get a clearer look and tried to take pictures but it was too far.", "object with bright lights, which caught fire,broke into three pieces and fell into heavy jungleHaving just found your web site, I would like to report what was seen in 1996. I have tried to find a means of reporting, but always came up blank.I am a ranch supervisor and between Christmas and the New Year I was on a ranch in the state of , Cojedes. This afternoon in particular, I with two brothers in law plus two people from the ranch drove to the main entrance to the ranch to lock the main gate. The light was changing, going to dusk, driving back to the ranch centre, coming up alongside the air strip, we suddenly saw what first looked like a small plane coming out from behind hills to the left of the strip, with brilliant lights on.It was about 100 feet up in the air, at first I thought it was one of the owners coming to spend a few days on the ranch.I very clearly remember seeing what appeared to be round windows within blazing lights. It was about the size of a Cessna two engine plane. I braked to a halt and we leaped out of the truck. As it passed within about 150-200 feet in front of us, I realized that there was no sound coming from it, not even the sound that one would assume that moving through the air would produce.As it passed in front of us, the light around it was intense, and I also noticed that it was moving on a steady path, keeping level.Coming through the hills it had managed to pass between two small hills that were definitely taller that the object in the air.Passing in front of us, it seemed to explode in flames, again there was no sound. As it moved through the air, still keeping on a level plane, the flames were being pushed back around it by the force of air. It looked very similar to when one see&rsquo;s a shuttle taking off to space.It continued at its level as it drew away from us into the darkening night sky. We continued watching it and as it was approaching the far hills, it seperated into three pieces which were clearly on fire. At this stage the three separate pieces fell into heavy jungle that is in that area.This area at this time of the year is exceptionally full and very green; also because we are then coming out of the rainy season, the ground still had water and would have been quite soft.To confirm what we actually saw, the following day, on the news, appeared a report of a pilot with a small plane that was passed by an object full of light, to which this pilot did an emergency landing as it frightened him. The object was travelling roughly north where it was spotted by several people at a village where the object then changed course to fly east, and then manoeuvred between the two hills to pass in front of us.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

It was around 9PM (not sure of the exact time), the weather was cool and clear.It hovered about 40 feet in the air, as I walked closer to it, it moved away in a slightly arched line and disappeared behind the trees .I stared directly at it for at least 20 seconds; I could not make out any solid shapes or apparent structure. It appeared, to me, to be a hovering ball of light.The silence was strange, even as it moved up and away, it made no noise whatsoever.It also traveled very quickly, covering 200+ yards and gaining enough altitude to easily clear the tree line in a matter of 2 or 3 seconds.I am small business owner- 37, my wife is a nurse- 38, our son is a junior in high school-15 and our niece is an adult student- 21&hellip;we are normal, functioning members in our community.All of us saw this object quite clearly and were a bit shaken by the whole experience.", "i saw a big light just fade off into the sky.i was in my drive way getting out of my my car and happened to look at all the stars in the sky, while i was looking i saw a bright light in the sky and it was bigger than any other star i had seen before but while i was looking at this &quot;star&quot; it took off really fast and left a trail of a bluish streak behind it and i know it was definitly not a plane or a satilite it was way too big for either and moved far too quick to be either a satilite or a plane.", "Weird Lights on the North side of Chicago 8/14/08So weird!!!

I was 11 years old. My father was stationed in Baton Rouge for one year working with the National Guard. He was in Engineering. I had the luxury of flying all over Europe with him since the age of 5. I had been exposed to aircraft of all types. Years later, I joined the Air Force and compared all of the aircraft that I saw daily with what I saw back in 1978. I know that I saw a UFO.My mother, father and I had gone to a carnival. We were on our way back home. The entrance to our neighborhood was a long wide tree lined street. There were no tall buildings. We lived in a quiet suburban middle class neighborhood. My father drove a golden 1978 Cutlass Supreme. I sat on the back right passenger side behind my mother. There was absolutely no noise. No radio on. No one was talking. I was an only child.To this day I do not know why I looked out of the rectangular window. The one thing that I clearly remember was that,although it was dark,there was a large moon and the sky was absolutely clear with no clouds. I looked out and up. I watched the biggest craft I have ever seen in my life hovering just above the tree tops. The craft was following our car! I remember bein astounded by the fact that there was NO SOUND! I had ridden on airplanes. I had watched hot air balloons take off. I had been on the ground when airplanes fly low over a parade. The sound should have been deafening. All I could hear was myself breathing.The craft was oval. The top was rounded. For approximately 4 minutes there were no lights. Just before the craft flew away a row of lights came on along the outermost edge of the widest part of the oval. I remember red and cream colored lights. They were not blinking like a turn signal. They slowly faded in an out. And they did not all come on at the same time. It seemed systematic from front to back.I watched the craft follow our car for about 1 minute. It took me that long to find my voice. I said &quot;Look!&quot; My dad was driving and could not look. I said &quot;Somebody! Look!&quot; Instead of looking out the side window my mom said &quot;What do you want us to look at?&quot; I was so frustrated because I could not formulate the descriptive words necesary. My mother was being stubborn and did not look in any direction on purpose. I said &quot;Dad! Please look!&quot; He tried to look. To this day, this memory brings tears to my eyes because he tried to look. He could not see from where he sat. During the entire conversation I never took my eyes off of the UFO.What happened next confirmed my belief that this was a UFO. By now, we have travelled at least a mile down the road. The craft had followed our car the entire time. Once the lights came on, the craft simply did a right angle and flew away in an straight line so fast it was unbelievable. The craft did NOT BANK right. I followed it with my eyes as long as I could.This whole event took between 5-7 minutes. I remember thinking that the craft had to be as tall as a 6 story building. Maybe taller. I think that it was as long as a couple of football stadiums. The bottom of the craft was flat. I did not see any windows. I felt that the color of the object was greyish. It was definitely a matte finish. Not metallic.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I&rsquo;m guessing it was about 8-10 miles north of me and 3 or 4 miles up in the air.  The object didn&rsquo;t move at all in any direction.  The light never strengthened or weakened, until it vanished out of nowhere.  It was a sunny day but it sure didn&rsquo;t look like a reflection of any sort.

We were visiting in a loft of their garage and my friends boyfriend left to go use the restroom. When he came back he quietly and calmly said to come over and look out the window. Stating &quot;look who&apos;s crazy now&quot;, being he had told me about seeing these things constantly since he was young. Nearly every day from how he made it out. When I came to the window I saw a light pattern that was strange moving in the sky. At this point I must admit I was a skeptic at best, but I do have an open mind and find his stories interesting.What I saw was a light pattern just above the tree line, moving a lot like a plane. But then it stopped, and started sinking behind the trees. Most strange thing was, when my friends significant other said something like &quot;see, just above the tree line&quot;, it stopped and sank as if it were reacting to his voice. I walked around and kept watching for about 15 minutes to see if it were still there, which a little light was still visible, but it was just behind the trees.What I find most interesting about this is that on this day, Indiana had several earthquakes, which is very uncommon. On top of that, I&apos;ve heard that Indianapolis airport shut down due to a &quot;unidentified flying object&quot; sighted by the tower. I just tonight tried to find an article related to this but didn&apos;t have much success. Granted it was a mediocre search in the grand view of real research.But that is getting me away from my story. We return to the loft to go about our conversation and he is telling me that its a totally common event for him. And goes into story after story about his encounters. Most disturbing was when he was telling me that a lot of times people missed these things because as he put it &quot;they tend to make false noises, like helicopter, planes or jets to throw you off&quot;. That is when I felt like I was in a movie. Not 3 seconds after he got done with the word &quot;jet&quot; I hear just that. Like clockwork. He, not being phased by this at all mentioned that &quot;they&quot; very well might be out there again.We pop our heads out the window and we see just that. Two this time. I go running outside to see the show and there it is again. He the mentions that the one we saw earlier was right on top of the building we were in when he saw it, at this time comparing notes with each other, and finding out that it moved when I came up. And there they sat, above the tree line, maybe 125 feet high, and they just sink right below it, like a cat trying to catch a rodent.The last thing that I recall seeing was right before they left all together the second one that appeared made an amazingly bright flash, a lot like the one on a camera and off of it shot a little orb that went into a crazy free spin through the sky that didn&apos;t seem to have any real pattern to it. And then they were all gone. That was the last thing I sighted this night.I do have one new recent sighting which is to follow in my next report.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))", "Fire in the sky*Aware of the meteor shower, I was outside in my friends front yard facing east and noticed what appeared to be a very large meteorite.  It was inclining at a very slow speed.  After about 30 seconds of it&apos;s presence, I ran into the house and got everyone outside to view what I was seeing.  Moments later it started declining, and resembled a plane on fire going down.  It split into 4 pieces which appeared the same size, and the fire disappeared.  You could see dim red lights which led us to believe that an airplane had exploded.  A few seconds later, the remaining pieces flared back up and started weaving in and out of each other in a horizontal fashion.  They slowly dropped towards the skyline, but the whole sighting lasted about 3.5 - 4 minutes.  We all came to the conclusion that it was not an airplane, and from my experience in astronomy, definitely not a meteorite.", "Flashing lights that approached each other and flew in a circle in Maine.At approximately 1:00 AM on August the 31st, 2008, a friend and I were watching the night sky and the shooting stars on Rocky Lake, which is in far eastern Maine.  I noticed a flashing light up about 20 degrees in the sky to the left of the big dipper.  Then to the right we noticed another flashing light coming towards and under the big dipper.  The two flashing lights that were approaching each other became brighter as they got closer to each other.  When they got to about 4 inches apart, as I saw them in the sky, they stopped (or dramatically slowed), became really bright, and began to do flash about randomly in a circle for about 5 seconds, in the space between where they stopped at and became bright at and each other.  After that, two lights traveled from that point roughly back the same way as they came.As I saw the lights they were similar to the newer flashing lights of police cars that appear to randomly flash different colors yet there is a pattern if you look closer.  I saw the lights as being connected, but flashing at separate places on the object. I did not have my camera on me and did not want to go back to my tent to get it at this point.  After a few seconds we talked about what we had just seen.  I was cold and went to the tent for my camera, binoculars and more clothing.  When I got back I sat and watched the stars with my friend who was still there until it got too cold so I went back to my tent to sleep.", "my wife and i observed what appeared to be a orange light that was moving across the eastern sky from Williamsburg, OH. on the 18th of September 2008. the orange light appeared to be moving at a rather slow pace. i can assure you it was not a plane. it looked as if were flying as low as maybe a helicopter and half as slow as one. it was moving from south to north and was in my sight for atleast 20 min. unfortunately, i dont own a camcorder. i did notice that 3 different times the orange light seemed to completely disappear for about 3-5 seconds and it was in open skies so there was no interference with me and the object.", "An unknown bright stationary object in the sky over Stamford, CTOn Sunday August 25th around 8:30-8:45 p.m. EST in Stamford, CT we noticed an unknown bright object in the sky.

Judging by the location of the object in relation to our house, it looked like it may have been situated above Cove Island in Stamford or in that general direction. It was difficult to decipher the actual shape, but all of us saw holes in this object through which the light was coming. There were 4 of us at home (our family) and every one of us saw it.

I have never seen something so interesting in my life. When it gets closer to daylight it almost just disappears intop thin air. It goes from just hovering to disappearing. I am now a believer.", "Boomerang UFO over Kelsterbach GermanyBoomerang shaped object  I&apos;m posting this over a year later now; since I wasn&apos;t too eager to talk about it in the public. I&apos;ve seen formations of big orange lights before, flying stars and recently 3 orbs flying in triangle formation; but this one last year was special to me. Sighting occurred on May 14 2007 between 01:00 AM and 01:50 AM local time  Me and a buddy saw a boomerang shaped flying object in the clear night sky; which was flying very low over my yard. My buddy saw it first. It first appeared to be a very fast moving cloud. It kinda uncloaked itself and first appeared to be transparent. Then he was able to see the small lights on the bottom (which by that time were turned on) and then was able to see whole ship, it appeared to be of a silverish color with a strong reflecting effect...like a mirror...like it was heavily polished. For a blink of an eye it recloaked and turned into a &quot;cloud&quot; again, but then instantly reappeared. By that time my buddy informed me what was going on; since I was looking in a different direction. The ship then reappeared near the Great Dipper. There was not a single cloud that night; so this thing caught our attention. There was a church tower near by so we figured that the object flew quite low (approx. 82 feet/25 meters). The boomerang kinda uncloaked in front of our eyes, and as soon as it had passed the Great Dipper it cloaked again and disappeared. It had a orange glow at the front, some sort of dome at the rear and some sort of lights (which were turned off) and the bottom. We were able to see it in full detail. The ship&apos;s color was silverish and the dome as well as the big lights at the bottom were appeared to be tinted (the small lights described above, where not visible any longer [turned off] ). I&apos;d estimate the craft&apos;s wingspan was the size of at least 3 or 4 Airbus A380 Airplanes put together. The sighting didn&apos;t last long, maybe 2 minutes and a few seconds. I&apos;d like to stay completely anonym for now; but if there are any questions or the like, please let me know by sending me an e-mail.", "I was  driving on Hwy 84 with my daughter and saw a triangle shaped object it all happened so quickly but I know it had lights on it and it also looked like blue flames comming out the back it was heading toward the Columbia River and then disappeared.There was another car on the highway who I tracked down in town and asked him if he saw what we saw and he said yes it was a firework but fireworks dont come down from the sky they shoot up((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I looked in the sky to see four circular lights flying in a square :: formation.  At first I figured it was an airplane until it registered how fast they were going and that there was no noise whatesoever.  I then saw them change formation into what appeared was going to be a V shape formation, but then changed into a diagonal line (from my perspective at least) like so .... but diagonally from left to right.The color of the lights were white/yellowish with a hint of light blue, but were behind a thin layer of clouding so I can&apos;t be sure the exact color.  I&apos;m sure it wasn&apos;t a commercial aircraft because of how fast it was moving and the fact that the lights moved from their original formation.  I can&apos;t rule out that they could have been military craft, however the following is what leads me to believe they are not.  (or at least what military craft are available knowledge to the public.) 1. They made no noise whatsoever.  Not even after they were gone.  There was no trailing engine noise.2. The speed and seemingly effortless way they manuevered into another formation.  They changed direction faster and more fluently then military aircraft would be able to handle.  As I said earlier, they went from :: to V to a diaganol line .... in a matter of about 5 seconds.3. The fact that they were just lights... just a circular light.  No flashing, no additional lights, just a solid circle of light.4. Under a minute later some helicoptors could be heard in the vacinity..  Tho as to whether or not they were there for the spectacle is beside me.  If they were, there would be no way they could have matched the UFOs speed.So that is my sighting.  I personally am convinced they were not commecial or military aircraft.

This happened for about an hour, untill it began moving towards the center of the city; near the capitol.I&apos;ve been a star gazer for most of my existance, and have never seen an object move in the matter this one did.The colors seemed to circle around the craft/object.Every once in a while it would disappear then emerge in another spot, stationary.In more than one instance, it looked as though there was a light that would almost pop out of it then circle the craft and return back inside.Then out of nowhere; two more showed up and the three of them made a line almost like orions belt, and began to move in slow pace towards the outskirts once again.I watched this for another hour or so; then the crafts simply pulled up and then moved in a very quick manner away and out of sight.The craft has been seen for the past 2 days, and i&apos;ve turned alot of people into the idea of simply watching it and observing the movements to validate my own sanity.In all the descriptions by other people i know, its something they&apos;ve never seen in the night sky before; and in some cases it terrifies them.", "2 UFOs - both caught on tape.2 objects, both moving incredibly fast for about a half hour at around midnight.

The front was triangle or pointed in shape with the rear blocked or square in sharp and the center was rectangle with a ark like shape. It was tilted in a 35-45 degree angle with no movement. The color was a metallic dark gray. The object remained stationary in the air for several minutes. It had no vapor trail. It just remained in the air suspended. I know I was not the only person who saw it due to it not being dark and there was a fair amount of cars heading in the same direction on Hwy 41 plus it was so obvious. At first you would think it was a blimp and I was hoping it was but it wasn&apos;t. I never seen a blimp shape like a block shape battle ship. Whatever it was it was large, heavy, and solid. It was just hanging there like it was docking calm and peaceful. No movement at all. I just watched it as I was alert enough to avoid not hitting another cars at the light. wondering when or if it was going to move. After I stopped and got my lunch for the evening and at local restaurant when I can out it was gone with no vapor trail that hinted in its direction of travel.

It was after midnight and I went out onto the front step of the house for a cigarette before I went to bed. (The front step faces almost directly west with a clear line of sight due to base ball diamonds adjacent to my parents acreage.) While I smoked, I looked up into the clear, cloudless sky and I was amazed at how I could see so many stars. As I was scanning the South western part of the sky I saw a small object quite low, slightly above the horizon (it looked like a star) begin to move toward the west on a roughly 45 degree angle and it continued to move until it was almost directly west of my location on the stoop (this took just seconds)but high enough in the sky that I had to slightly tilt my head back. At this point the movement stopped and many bright colored lights, red, blue, green, yellow, purple, started to flash, as if the object was rotating. The colored flashes were intense and each color was distinguishable. I took out a small set of binoculars and I was able to get a slightly better view of the colored lights, I still could not exactly determine what it was, but it was definitely spinning at a crazy speed. There is a large radio antenna about a mile west of my parents home, and from my vantage point on the step this object was at least 4-5 times higher than the height of the tower, so this gave me some perspective, It must have been quite far away. I went inside and found my sixteen year old niece and asked her to come take a look, she came outside and ran back in the house after seeing the lights. I then I went inside and asked  my mother to get out of bed to take a look at this strange flashing object. She and I stood and watched it hover at the same location for several minutes. She went back to bed and I stayed outside for 15 to 20 more minutes and watched the amazing light show.", "Black Flat Object with a Luminous Light hovering in the sky...We were exiting a resturant in a plaza. We saw this retangular flat object that was levitating in the sky. It was not that high up. At first we thought it was a balloon or a bird. As we looked closer we all saw that the object was in deed a flat retangular shape with a luminous circle around it.  It kept swaying back and forth in an upward motion.  At first it was hovering over the same spot but then it continued to get higher. This went on for about two to three minutes and it disappeared. We actually could not believe what we were seeing. I typically do not believe in this type of stuff but there is NO other explanantion for this object. The fact that it was dark outside and we could see this black object floating in the air, leeds me to believe that this was something of a different nature. I do not know if this was indeed a UFO, but it was not normal whatever it was.  Please, I am not crazy. There were 3 of us, completely sober, who all witness the same exact object and motions. I did try to take a picture of the object. Only if you hold the carmera a certain way can you see the &quot;glow&quot; of the object.  It was a white circle around it. My flash on the camera would not work so I guess the black object did not come through. I just really want some type of explaination as to what this was? Have others reported this type of object before? I am freaked out right now.", "Glowing orb/sphere over Bellevue WashingtonI am not inclined to believe in alien aircraft and have a great amount of skepticism as to their existence. HOWEVER, after watching the ABC special last night about UFO&apos;s, I decided to find a website where I could report something that has always mystified me so that I could at least get it on record. I&apos;ll be perfectly honest and say that I&apos;m not sure if it was in the summer of 1992 or 1993, it&apos;s been so long ago, but I&apos;m pretty sure it was 1993. What I do remember was that it was an August night in the middle of the week, perfectly clear skies, about 8:30-9:00pm, and I was driving home to my in-laws house in Bellevue. I had just turned off the 405 freeway and turned west (right) on SE 8th street. As you drive west on SE 8th, there is a large hill--perhaps 500 feet in elevation--that is about one square mile in diameter with many homes, etc, and on the top of the hill, which you cannot see from the road, is a high school. As I was driving, I noticed a huge, luminescent orb--a glowing sphere--that seemed to be floating just above the crest of the hill. I would venture a guess that it was the easily the size of two football fields, and its glow wasn&apos;t like the glow of the moon but seemed, rather, to be illuminated from within. It was perfectly symmetrical, perfectly silent, with a smooth surface. It was so large, in fact, that I am almost certain it must have been seen by others. But again, there is a track and, I think, high school football stadium on top of the hill, so perhaps many people dismissed it as the lights from that. All I can tell you is, as a verified skeptic of these sorts of things, I was truly amazed at the sight: a completely silent (at least I didn&apos;t hear anything from my car with the windows down), glowing sphere that just appeared to be floating just above the horizon of the hill. I was so mystified by the sighting that I drove up the hill (I can&apos;t recall the name of that particular neighborhood in Bellevue) to see if I could get a better look. As I neared the base of the hill, of course, it fell out of my line of vision, and I had to drive around the base of the hill in order to go up it--there is no access to the hill from SE 8th. It probably took me 3-4 minutes to get to where I determined the sphere/orb was, and it was gone (naturally).  I must have driven around for ten minutes, to no avail. I told my wife about it as soon as I arrived home, and we both agreed that it sounded very strange. But, like many of these sorts of things (and perhaps like many of the reports on here), eventually the incredulity of it all made me simply let it go, and I&apos;ve just always chalked it up to an inexplicable phenomenon. But, in all fairness, I thought it only right to report it.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

The object appeared in only one frame (with said frame,the preceding and following frames being shot on a period of a maximum of approximately 4 seconds). The single object was similar in shape to the space shuttle albeit much more streamlined like a nose cone of a rocket and appeared to have no defined detail other than what appeared to be a wing and curved elements at the rear of the object.

I believe that my sighting is related with this UFO crash in Columbus, GA.  The night before, I heard on the radio from a CNN news update that a plane crashed near Macon Rd. earlier that day.  At the time, I did not link the two because they had reported it as a &quot;plane&quot;.

Then we thought possibly a meteor, but did not see any explosion or fire from the landing.As we continued to drive, we did a relative size comparison such as: bigger than my Honda CR-V  car tire, bigger than a merge sign, bigger than the small bushes lining the highway. From the distance that we saw the object, we agreed that it was approximately as big as a small car such as a Metro or similar. The shape was hard to determine due to the trail of fire.The flames were coming up from the head and there was a short flame tail behind it.

Hovered over head approximately 100 feet up for approximately 3 minutes accompanied by a light humming sound with a vibrating sensation.  A bright and warm beam of light then moved up and down my body as if examining me for approximately 30 seconds. One craft then left at a slow rate of climb and stopped at a point higher in the sky. At this pouint a large gush of hot wind/air poured down on me and another craft left the area flying out of sight. The final craft came lower to my area within about 35-50 feet of my head, sat there for about a minute or two then slowly rose to the position of the first craft - they both then departed the sky at a high rate of climb, so fast it created a blur in my vision. Upon my return home, I began suffereing from intense heade aches and joint sorness. After trip to the urgent care center, they discovered multiple small burn type injurins to the top of my head and shoulders. After telling them of my experience, they referred me to my primary care physician and did not take me serious.

There were many stars that night and then I noticed an object with red and green flashing lights. The lights were all flashing at the same time and the object was moving across the sky fast. At first I thought it was a plan but it was moving too fast and in a different motion than a plane. As I was watching another object looking the same shot up and circled around the other one. The objects were high in the sky because a plane did fly below both the objects at a regular speed and was going straight. The objects looked like they were playing with each other and appeared to be triagular in shape although it was hard to tell. I watched the objects for a long time because it was nothing I had ever seen before. It was very strange.", "Don&apos;t care if anyone believes, but I know what I saw and I know what I heard.  I was about 13 years of age, about l956, sitting on my back porch, grooming my cat when I heard what sounded like electice egg beaters.  I looked up, everything being very quiet, and saw three saucer-like objects flying from north to south.  They were in a &quot;V&quot; formation, flying low enough to identify windows, formation, etc.  There were round windows on plate-like discs.  I screamed for my mother to come and see this, but when she finally arrived it was too late.

I could see no stars visible in the sky.  I wondered if it was an aircraft, as it appeared to be moving, somewhat like a helicopter.  The color of the light was very bright, like a star.  However, the movements were quite abrupt, quick, backward, forward, up and down. Then, its shape changed and it appeared to be elongated.  It seemed to turn like this several times and continued to move.  Bright lights seemed to occasionally shoot from it, very rapidly, and the lights were colorful, reddish.I watched it for about half an hour.  After I had watched it for awhile, I thought I should check the time and it was about 5:40 am.  I&rsquo;m not sure of the time I initially witnessed it.  It gradually moved up, down, back and forth, but was progressing in a southward direction until it became blocked by a tree.  I am not sure how long I watched it, probably about 45 minutes or a bit longer.I have thought I&rsquo;d like to know if anyone else saw it and would like to compare notes.((NUFORC Note:  Probable star.

I saw last night a sandy colored sphere or saucer like object that went from the south west toward north east in a straight line, here in Berlin. The object was not shiny and had no light. it made no sound at all. it was about 3-4 centimeters in size relative to the stars and i could not tell if it was close (500 meters, etc) or if it was in outerspace and was very large. i was alone unfortunately and no one else saw this.I have never seen anything like this. It actually looked like a special effect in a movie.I am in shock a little and have problems that no one believes me. It may be that it was some type of space junk. I know what satelites look like and this was a sphere or a saucer. there were no windows and nothing to say about it but the shape and the sandy brown color it was &quot;flat matt&quot; not shiny.

The rest are on 16x zoom. Interesting the rest are all dark and you can just about make out the object.  Fading daylight but skies still blue at this time.My partner heard me shout out and came rushing down the stairs asking what was up, I told him and he took a while to locate the object and then ran in and got my binoculars that are in the kitchen drawer, he had trouble locating it through the binoculars but when he did he said that it was coloured green and red. He suspects they were heliem balloons.I thought i&apos;d report it anyway as you never know. I think id go with helium balloons too as an alternative to a UFO.As an aside the aircraft in the vicinity was a plane on the landing path of Gatwick Airport.", "A cigar shaped craft with three bright lights that stood still and vanished without making any noise.I was heading home.

When I steped outside I was stunned. I saw a triangle shaped craft with three lights(two red one blue). It made no sound, except for a humming. And it was going so slow that I waited for it to fall out of the sky. Nothing I had ever seen before could stay in the air going so slow, except for a air balloon. And I know for a fact that this was not an air balloon. It slowly moved over the trees and when I came to my head again I tried to chase it but it was no where to be found.  Almost one month later we saw the same thing at the same time as before. I am not sure what is going on but it has us freaked out.  Now this is not connected to the story above but it happened and I swear on my life that it is true!  When  I was around 12 years old myself and some friends were on a camping trip with our boyscout troop. Late  that night after every one went to bed four of the other guys came and woke me and my tent mate up. They were going crazy and yelling saying that we needed to hurry up and get out there. When we got out of our tentthere was a wall of light, bright light. The next thing I remember it was morning and none of the other guys would talk about it. To this day if I bring it up they walk away. Something happened and it has been almost 12 years and they still will not talk about it. When I was about 15 I saw the same thing that I saw here recently. It was a trianlge shaped craft moving very slowly over the road that me and two friends of mine were going down. We stoped the car and watched as the craft went over the trees. We sat there for a few minuets and then we saw five jets going the same path that the craft had taken.  I know that I am starting to sound crazy by putting all this up at once, but this is the first time I have gottn up the courage to tell anyone else. Around five years ago I was asleep with my wife and for some reasone I woke up. All I remember is that there was a bright white light and I felt like a car slammed into me, knocking me down on the bed. Then it was morning, and I do not remember anything else. I swear that everything I have stated in this is TRUE! I am not just some crazy guy, but I am very confussed about what is going on.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

So as I went down the road out of the corner of my eyes I thought I kept seeing flashes of light much like a shooting star. so I just do what I always do and walked forward while looking up for something to happen. I got to the school and it was weird that there was like a bunch of kids playing tackling each other? But I kept walking with a stern face because I felt the presence of extraterrestrials. I felt weird.I walked past them and got to the high school track around the football field. And as I have done in the past I decided to lay down and watch the skies for  any kind of shooting stars or UFOS. Sure enough I saw a shooting star it was green and had a tail. It was awesome and only lasted a second or less in a small part of the sky but I was satisfied to continue watching convinced to make some kind of contact. Observing it was an experience that cant be put into words.Then a few moments later I saw a big streak of white light. It was another shooting star. A few times I saw  lights out of the corner of my eye yet because I had not had a clear visual I dismissed them as irrelevant. They could have been a car a street light even those kids or the school.Eventually I had seen several shooting stars and thought to myself had I accomplished what I came here for? So still lying there I grew cold even though I was hot from previously walking as I had mentioned that 45minute walk or so kind of pissed me off. Once I got to the track I laid down for about 30 minutes then I said something to myself.I wanted to leave within 5 minutes. I wanted to see a UFO go over my head, directly above me. I wanted it to come from my direct right and move towards my left. Imagine how I felt when this happened exactly like I wanted it to.Directly above my eyes as if you shot a laser from the center of the earth up through the ground through my head on the ground looking up through my eyes if that laser beam kept going perfectly straight  it would hit the thing I saw. It was straight above me as I glanced into the heavens.It was only visible for 1 second but it was enough. It started of white with a tail like a shooting star then faded away then reappeared on the same path and was white with a tail again but it rotated half way this time. It rotated and I saw a disk. Yes a disk like a saucer lice a Frisbee like a plate. I am convinced it was an intelligent being and after that I have had a different life I just want to talk to someone about this. I went to this exact web site after I witnessed it to try to find if anyone else saw it and all up and down the east coast there was reports of much similar activity if not identical. I experienced lost time loss of hearing and a surge of power. Like I could control the universe. I even had a dream about the exact event years before it happened can I please get some feed back fellow earthlings.When something like this happens you never forget it, and so I will never let this paranormal event escape. I BELIVE.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

As I came out of the main terminal lobby about 12:40 am I was with another gentleman to have a smoke. We looked north and saw about a dozen moving objects that looked liked stars in size, but were a distance off toward the north over what we knew was a military base, but as we watched these objects simply did what no flying object we have could do. They would fly at great speeds; stop on a dime and at great speeds would make right angle turns that should smash any inhabitants like a bug from the inertia of such a turn. The man I was with was some flight specialist and was able to determine speeds roughly and distance etc, because he was simply trained in such things - I thought maybe he was a pilot himself. But he told me quite frankly that the objects have to be traveling several thousand miles per hour in the &ldquo;bursts&rdquo; of speed. They would all suddenly fly into one place as to meet, then fly apart in different direction and stop on a dime - staying there for a short time. Some would fly then other directions and take those right turns without slowing or stopping. You just can&rsquo;t watch that kind of thing and think that we have any aircraft whatsoever that has that kind of ability. They did seem to glimmer from a bright whitish to other colors, but our distance from them it was hard to distinguish it and then - after near 10 - 12 minutes of watching this &ldquo;dance in the sky&rdquo; - they all flew off it different directions like a 4th of July exploding flare shot. And, no - it was no firework show either. Even if it were fireworks - even that is NOT allowed over the military base that we were watching this happen over. I had never known anyone to have ever reported this before now. The thing is - that the very next night on another grave yard shift at about closer to 2 am I saw the very same thing. This time about 5 people were standing outside watching it and I had told them I had seen it the night before as well - just didn&rsquo;t know what it was, but said - nothing can fly like those things that we have - so it&rsquo;s something else. Having had a friend who used to work with NASA I had discussed with him my theory that these are not inter planetary, but rather inter-dimensional and the discussion turned into the color changing issue as they change and right when they disappear from site is at the ultra-violet or infra-red spectrum so the idea of inter-dimensional seemed to fit with that scenario and the idea of the speeds and right turns they could make without getting hurt would indicate this same idea - that, inter dimensionally they could pull this off. So, that&rsquo;s my story.", "My wife and I saw a light very high in the sky that was not a plane.On August 4th 2008 at 7pm, my wife and I observed at very high altitude what appeared to me a blinking light that appeared to go around in a circle.  It was clear, the sun was still out.  I have very good vision and was unable to distiguish it as any type of airplane.  At that same time there where a few planes I could see, also at high altitude and clearly could make them out as airplanes.  It moved from East to West across the sky at about the same rate I would see a satilight at night. Is it possible that I could have seen a satilight during the day?  But that would not explain the light that appeared to rotate. I could make nothing out but the light. It was very very high in the sky.((NUFORC Note:  The ISS was visible over Hudson at 21:37 hrs. in the southwest sky.

We were camping on an island just a few hundred yards from the Canadian border and were enjoying a campfire on Thursday night the 31st.  It was so clear out and the stars were so bright we decided to walk out to the point and star gaze for awhile.  As we&apos;re standing there just looking at the stars one of my frineds points out a satellite moving across the sky.  We all look at it and confirm to each other that, yes, it&apos;s a satellite.  No blinking lights, just a solid white light in the sky that looked like a moving star, like most satellites look from earth.  Within a couple seconds the &quot;satellite&quot; zooms incredibly close and an incredibly bright light shines down.  I wouldn&apos;t necessarily call it a &quot;beam&quot; of light, just this intense bright white light.  It shown on us for maybe two-three seconds and then turned off and as soon as it turned off it looked like the tiny little light of a satellite again, but moving much faster and within a few seconds was out of sight.  There was not a sound at all and never saw it&apos;s shape or anything, just the light.  My friend said he didn&apos;t think it zoomed down to us, but rather just became this intense light.  I, on the other hand, felt that it came down close because it wasn&apos;t a super intense little spec of light, it was close enough that the light appeared to be a foot or two across.  So distance is still a little hard to describe and me and my friends all have different thoughts on how close it was.  Whatever this was it moved across the sky from the US into Canada.  As soon as this all happened we looked at each other and started laughing because these things don&apos;t happen to us.  This only happens in the movies kind of thing.  One of my friends immediately says, &quot;there&apos;s many explanations for what we just saw.&quot;  But he couldn&apos;t come up with one single explanation and agreed that what we saw was very strange and defini! tely uni dentified. I am a 31 year old College Grad., and work as a Purchasing manager for a lumber company.  I have never seen anything like this before in my life, nor either of my friends.  We all agreed to not tell anyone about this because who&apos;s going to believe us, right?  Off course we had to tell somebody, so we ended up telling our frineds and family and off course almost every one of them asked what we were smoking that night.

I looked and then realized that shouldn&apos;t be in that spot of the night sky (facing N/NW at a very low altitude). I went inside and grabbed my husband, and we watched it for about 5 minutes.  At first he thought it was a planet until it started flashing. It never moved, but kept getting brighter and putting off red and blue flashes, though it seemed like it was just one light or object that the flashes were coming from.We went inside and grabbed the binoculars and realized it was actually a cluster of 3 lights, white, red, and blue. My husband and I took turns on and off with the binoculars, while the other watched with the naked eye.  You couldn&rsquo;t see it with the naked eye, but in the binoculars you could see that at first the lights were horizontally aligned, then would instantly change, though you couldn&rsquo;t see the transition (even in the binoculars), to a pyramid shape, then to one on top of the other, with the third next to it. The lights pulsed one at a time, going around the formation. They were very rhythmic in their movement.About 15 or 20 minutes later, it still hadn&apos;t moved, when a plane came close to it. The plane had to suddenly adjust its course and go up and over it very quickly. As it did this, the lights jerked sideways, like they were moving out of the way. All in all, the lights stayed for almost 45 minutes in the same spot, and were relatively low, lower than normal air traffic. The plane was a small plane, headed right towards centennial airport.  There wasn&apos;t a sound associated with the lights, though you could hear the small plane as it flew past.The light then moved down and our vantage point was blocked by a tree across the parking lot from our apartment building, then reappeared at the top of the tree line.   The light then faded, almost like it was receding and heading N, NW, but staying at the same elevation, and then disappeared.All in all, the &ldquo;event&rdquo; lasted close to an hour.

The last one was about four years ago, and I never reported it. I will report it here soon. I have to recall the details. This one is the most recent. I have been camping and hiking for decades.

We were sitting in the forest, facing east, next to the fire ring (with fire in it), just chatting. As usual, I was looking up at the stars. It was a clear, black night and there were many bright stars in the sky. I saw what appeared to be a star moving slowly, seemingly between the stars.

By that time it &ldquo;curled&rdquo; slightly to the &ldquo;right&rdquo;, and then disappeared. During the time I knew she was watching it, I asked her &ldquo;Can you see it? Are you watching it? She said &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. Then I said &ldquo;look, it disappeared!&rdquo;  I was surprised that it caught my eye because it was very subtle, and my eyesight is bad. I looked like a star&mdash;i.e., a white dot. Instead of being in, what I would call the atmosphere of Earth, this object was in the heavens; it was among the stars. I kept looking for its continuation, but nothing more was observed. Incidentally, what also surprises me is that my Girlfriend was very unimpressed by this sighting, telling no one else.

The background in the distance was the mountain range on Camp Pendleton.  During the firing practice everyone who was firing using a Starlight Scope became exited by a bright light they could see through the scope.  The light was flying/hovering fairly low to the ground in the distance.  The weird part was that you could only see this light using the Starlight Scope.  With the naked eye you saw nothing; no light whatsoever.  Through the scope the light was obvious and moving over the horizon.  My recollection of this event would have been over a 30-90 second time period.  I looked at least 3 times through the scope to observe the UFO then with my naked eye and could see nothing.

BUT it&apos;s size was much bigger than the regular basketball-sized party balloon. If you hold out your arm and look at your pinky fingernail. It was about that size in the sky. And we would guess a few thousand feet away at least. So I would estimate it to be at least the size of a van. Maybe 1/3 to 1/2 the size of a hot air balloon (but it was completely round and not pointed at the bottom like a hot air balloon). But a party balloon that size in the sky would only be a few houses away, maybe 200 feet. This thing was UP in the sky and getting higher and &quot;drifting&quot; away at a pretty good speed. It HAD to be bigger. It glowed a strange color. Not intense green color like a street light. More of a diffused turquoise color. I say it was more green and my wife says it was more blue. But we both agree it was turquoise. It was completely silent. Straight above us was a clear patch of sky with no clouds and bright white stars. It was not &quot;bright&quot; like Venus was that night. It was dimmer but still clearly defined against the sky. Possibly it was brighter at the center than the edges of the object but I can&apos;t say for certa! in. I&apos;ve never seen an object/light that color, especially in the sky before. It got so distant after a minute you could not see it anymore. There was a few neighbors (2 adult men) also looking in the object&apos;s direction standing in the street a few houses down (probably looking at the constant lightning which was beautiful) and I was gonna ask them if they saw the object but before I reached them they went inside. I don&apos;t know them so I did not ring their doorbell. The next day I asked a few neighbors I do know and they of course laughed and said no they didn&apos;t see anything the night before. Then I googled to see if anyone else saw the object and might be chatting about it, and found a wikipedia description of the same or similar turquoise object (the one I saw never grew a white comet-like tail) being spotted in nearby Charlotte a year or so before. So after telling my wife THAT, she said I should report it. I called the local police and they said ANYTHING having to do with the sky is the FAAs domain. So I called them and got an answering machine. I left a message. Then I left a message at my local newspaper. THEN I reported it on MUFON. Then I called 2 local tv stations and they said they had not had any reports about it. It&apos;s really bugging me. I really want to know what it was - and stangely AS I WAS WATCHING IT, I was already bummed out that I&apos;ll probably NEVER KNOW what I&apos;m looking even is. And although, I did not have a camera I&apos;m a graphic artist so I immediately made a composite (re-creation) photograph or what it looked like (using imagery from the web). I hope you can understand the experience we had and help discern what it might&apos;ve been. About 45 minutes later my wife saw a &quot;shooting star&quot; in the areaof sky as the round object. We stayed outside for about an hour after talking about it and hoping to see it again. But we never did.

Maybe someone has a rational answer for what it was.Clear as can be but very high in the sky above the highway I saw a formation of white dots.  There were eight dots with a line down the center, four on each side, exactly the way a domino with 8 dots would be set up.  Never losing form it slowly moved through the sky leaving a chemtrail looking trail of white dots behind it.  Round white dots evenly spaced making four perfect lines of dots behind it.  The older dots had dissapated leaving just a cloudy white ribbon for miles and the newer made ones stayed as dots for quite some time.  The formation didn&apos;t move in a straight line, it slowly turned and twisted a bit and went in and out from a cloud all the while the trail of dots were evenly spit from it.I don&apos;t know how long it lasted.  I watched it for a few minutes until I had finally driven past it.  I don&apos;t know how many other drivers saw it, it was very visable.  I tried to take a picture with my phone while driving but it didn&apos;t come out.

We were approaching the state road 276.  My wife noted a very bright yellow light to the southeast high in the sky at about a 45% angle from the horizon.  It appeared very high in the sky.  It appeared as one light even though we were seeing it thru trees beside the road.  It was very very bright.  It seemed to go on and off at first like warning beacon.  It was maybe on for 2 seconds but then off more than 10 seconds.  I told her that was too long off for a safety beacon.  We were looking for a break in the trees so we could see better.  We were traveling about 45 mph.  Then a whole large cloud became the same bright yellow like the object had gone behind.  This was brighter than how a lighting bolt would light up a cloud.  We then came to a clearing just before the junction of  County Road 276.  We pulled off the road and looked toward the bright yellow object that was at the moment behind a cloud.  It then seemed to quickly move from behind the cloud and appear as several large bright yellow lights moving in a curved line toward the ground.  This lasted only 2-3 seconds and then the lights turned off but we could still see a much smaller orange-red light moving very rapidly across the sky.  We are accustomed to seeing military helicopters near our home town about 45 miles to the north.  This was moving much more rapidly than they move and seemed higher.  It also changed direction more rapidly.  It seemed to move like a fast jet but could do a 180 degree direction change instantly.  We watched this for maybe 5 min then it disappeared.  We watch for maybe another 10 min and it came back for maybe a min as the small orange-red light and then disappeared again to the southeast.  Tyndall air force base is in that direction east of Panama City. I wrote this about 11:30 once we reach Panama City and unloaded our car.  After I wrote this my wife proofed it and only added that it seemed much higher than a helicopter.  Otherwise she saw it as I did.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

Once we got on the bridge, my passenger and I had a clear view of the object.   It appeared to be a few thousand feet in the air, located in the bay between Bayonne and Elizabeth, NJ.  The triangular pattern of its three blinking red lights made me suspicious that it may be a jet liner heading for Newark Airport, but it looked nothing like the many other planes in the sky and was not on the normal approach pattern to the airport.  The object, when first viewed, appeared to be saucer shaped, with a raised flat top.  As we moved further along the bridge, the craft appeared to elongate into a cylindrical shape, however it seemed that the orientation of the craft to my car changed so I assume I was just getting a different view of the craft.  The craft, in addition to the lights, had a strange whitish blue hue to it that illuminated its body and made it stand out against the night sky.  It appeared to be moving slowly eastbound, but it is hard to say if it was really moving at all.  We lost sight of the craft soon after we exited the bridge.", "Diamond, Spherical UFOS over RenoSitting on a lawn chair looking north towards Sun Valley I noticed a single circular sphere of light during the afternoon. There were some chemtrail clouds drifting south. The sphere moved very slowly towards me in over the downtown Reno metropolitan area. It took up a position over McCarren Blvd. and remained motionless for approx. 5 mins. It then moved closer to my position on a straight course but ever so slowly. At first I thought it was a balloon but it maintained its course on a straight trajectory. It stopped over the northern Sparks area and held position. It seemed to emminate its own white luminious light source. It appeared under intelligent control.Suddenly off to my left appeared a diamond [mother-of-pearl] shaped craft. It seemed to have dimensional structure to its outer shape. I glissened and gleamed various beautiful colors in the late afternoon sunlight.  One moment it seemed to look like a triangle then would alter its dimensional features appearing more diamond shaped.It moved with the same slow movemnt as the first sphere which was also visible at the same time the diamond was overhead. The diamond moved forward ever so slowly then took up position over the University of Reno. It remained stationary for 6-7 mins then began a very slow path floating back and forth slightly. It then began it final course 90 degs to it previous path heading west. It was the same altitude as the clouds [chemtrail clouds] which were blowing east in the wind. But the diamond was moving AGAINST the wind as it advance head-on past the clouds. I watched it till it was out of sight.This all took approx 25-30 mins.  The first sphere also was now undetectable by vision. It was also gone.", "15 small white orbs drifting high in formation west Over SF, CA City Hall 9-20-08Against a blight blue sky, my wife and I saw a relatively static but drifting formation of 15 roundish white orbs that stayed relatively the same distance from each other while the entire formation moved slowly to the west.   These object were more visible with polarized glasses but not so with the naked eye. We had no binoculars to assist.We took one digital picture (Canon 10 MP camera) which caught it but only shows rounded orbs at extreme magnification.This was over the SF City Hall. These did not look like planes or circling birds. The formation was not a regularly spaced formation.These objects were higher than clouds which drifted beneath them.", "craft observed crossing Baltimore in Canton area observed from Fleet St traveling east/westThe object came from an east west direction straight over Patterson Park towards the inner harbor. There were no sounds coming from the craft. A half moon neon bluish green shape was on the front of the craft. As it passed overhead you could see two brights lights on either side which could have been some sort of engine. It cleared the entire viewing span of the sky in less then 1 minute and appeared to be only a few hundred yards above the earth. I was not going to tell anyone this until I saw the same type of reports on this website. I can say for sure it was not a helicopter nor was it a plane.

This particular Saturday night I was standing on my porch which faces south. I was just about to go inside when I observed some sort of oval craft travelling North to South. The craft had no lights, but was a light color which made it just visible in the star light. It was pretty low, maybe 500 feet or so. It made no audible sound, was moving very fast and in a perfectly straight line with no visible variation in speed. It was about the size of a thumbnail held at arms length. As it was passing over my neighbors house I ran down to the street in hopes of visually re acquiring it, but it was already out of sight. At first I thought it may be a bird flying at night, but I don&apos;t know of any birds which fly  500 feet high at that speed, in a straight line at 10:40pm at such a size. Most birds are not oval either.As this thing was passing over, the dogs in the general area began barking which lasted for about 2 minutes. After observing the sky for another 10 minutes or so, I went inside. We are currently dog sitting my Mother In Laws little dog which I found cowering in the corner of the living room. I have never seen her do that. It took several minutes to get her calmed and to stop shaking.One other thing worth mentioning is that this craft, or whatever it was, took the exact trajectory as the first craft I witnessed back in March 08&apos;. My March 08 sightings (there was one and then 3 in a row a few nights later)were the first sightings I have had in my 45 years.

It was so low to the overpass we were approaching that it looked like it was going to land there.  I could not make out any distinct shape of the craft.  I thought it was a plane at first because of blinking white and red lights like those normally seen on a plane, but the way it was moving seemed inconsistent the capabilities of a normal airplane.  It seemed to disappear for a moment then we saw it over the fields to our right.  The fields were full of trees (what I assume were nut trees) of similar shape and size.  Suddenly the field lit up and it seemed that the craft was down amongst the trees.  It got dark again and we then saw the craft behind us.  It circled around again to the overpass, and although most of the time the craft was dark, there were three lights that turned on for a few moments and then were extinguished.  I continued to watch for the craft out the rear car window....saw the blinking lights for about 30 seconds then got out of range.  In hindsight, we should have stopped the car for a better look, but we were on a long drive from Phoenix and anxious to get home.

These lights were traveling in sync with each other and I could not figure out what it was. The lights didn&apos;t flash so I don&apos;t think it was a plane, and it was completely silent, but seemed much closer than any planes should be flying. It went across the sky faster than any &apos;normal&apos; plane would have. This is the first time I have ever seen anything like it.

We where looking torwards Middletown while TMI was having the Nuclear Accident. We watch this Supper bright light that was as bright as a star for about 20 minutes, but it was to close. The sun started to rise and the object was visible and it tilled a bit an took off so fast that it had shot straight out towards the moon and seemed like it went behind the moon. The object was in full view for both of us to get a really good look at it and was a silver-gray color. It was round and we could see a few rectangular windows, the very top looked to have a black round section on the craft with a lot of fins going to the center on the top. The next day the TMI accident was finally fiqured out to be over. It took TMI years to see the damage and it did melt down into the concrete.", "My husband called me out of the house on saturday night (10/20/08 at 8:30P.M.) sounding panicked.  Hurry come here.  I ran out and saw a big orange object coming toward the house rather slow coming west to east and I did not hear an engine.

Bright orange object.", "Black triangle with dim white lights in its corners flying overheadWhile star gazing I saw something moving in my peripheral vision, I initially thought it to be another passing satellite as I often see at night, however I soon realised this was not. Three dull white lights moving together made the shape of a right angled triangle. Other than the three lights the object blended in to the night sky, but I could not see through it. It was a still and quiet night and the triangle moved silently, not very quickly but faster than a passing satellite would. The sighting lasted perhaps 5 seconds before I lost sight of it. I have never seen anything like it.", "Ball of light hovering near Midway airport...I was in my car in a parking lot waiting for my dad to come out from work,near midway airport. I was looking out the window when one white light moving fast from south to north caught my attention. From where I was it looked like the size of a street light,just a round white ball of light. Now I mentioned I was by Midway airport so there are planes landing often but they usually are moving slower and flying lower as they are about to land. The object i saw had no lights on its side like planes and made no sound,but was moving faster then a plane would at high altidude.

I was primarily looking at deep sky objects. I was focused on the Andromeda galaxy and wanted to look for the double cluster galaxy since know its location. I was looking towards the North-Eastern sky when suddenly I noticed two objects that I was never familiar with.  There were two objects which were orange-ish in color. They appeared to be shaped as spheres. Both of the objects appeared within the eyepiece I was looking in. They appeared to be somewhat of a faint orange color. I can almost say that they were faint because they were in space around the Earth&rsquo;s orbit and not in our atmosphere because I stopped looking in the telescope and tried to see them with my naked eye but could not. As I looked again in the eyepiece they were going in a south-eastern direction and suddenly made a quick turn going towards an easterly direction. One was below the other towards the lower right. The one below was sort of bouncing around or more like dancing around in no particular pattern. This stuck me as odd behavior.  They kept their same formation and distance as they moved down the sky. I followed them for about 30 seconds and quickly called my 14 year old son outside. I asked him to take a look through the telescope and he saw the same objects I did. I tried to view the objects again, but they were probably below my fence and out of sight. I have seen helicopters, falling stars, satellites, &amp; airplanes through my telescope and there were not any of those. I&rsquo;m not saying they were UFO&rsquo;s, but I certainly don&rsquo;t know what they were. This was definitely a strange first moment for me.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I stood there for about 1 minute, turned around to look down the other end of the street for a few seconds, and turned back. THAT IS WHEN out of the corner of my eye I noticed a very large glowing orange sphere southwest of the north star! I was able to focus in on it, but only with my eyes because I was afraid if I ran inside to grab a camera, that it would leave as quickly as it came.It was stationary for about 5 seconds or so, and then seemed to &quot;dance&quot; or bobble in the air, up and down, for about 10 seconds before making about a 45 degree northwestern - western departure trail down the street. [I say this because I lost visibility due to the tall oak trees in the neighborhood, and wasn&apos;t able to run fast enough to follow exactly how it left and where it left to]. It was silent the entire time! I ran inside to tell my parter to come outside and help me look around for it, but it was too late. I feel so lucky to have seen what I did, but at the same time it almost seems too surreal. But I know what I saw... I hope someone else out there saw it too!

Our house is up on a hill so we can see well over the few rooftops below us that look to the South West sky towards Needham and Route 128/95 - it&apos;s all tree tops from the park looking towards the horizon. As we were eating I looked up to speak to my BF and a very bright light in the sky behind him caught my eye - it wasn&apos;t there a minute before.

I pointed out the light and the two people saw it and agreed it was really bright  - and stationary in the sky. They were puzzled by it as was I. I said it&apos;s probably a planet but I&apos;ll watch it and see if it moves across the sky. I would estimate it was 20-30 degrees above the horizon. I observed it for about eight minutes without it moving in the slightest. I then went inside to grab something from the kitchen (maybe 15 seconds) and when I returned it was nowhere in sight... and it couldn&apos;t have possibly moved behind something since we were so high up and could see for miles around it - nothing would have obstructed the view.

The usual west to east parade of passenger jet aircraft was also easily visible during this time.

At the time I was taking a physics class and I knew which were stars and what was not. Any way I saw a swirling blue and yellow light between 2 stars in the sky. I was able to study the movement because the marching band was receiving a lecture and we were not permitted to move.I gazed at the blue-yellow light and recognized the pattern, it had seemed to be forming the same shapes as the marching band below it. At that time I grabbed the closest person and pointed in the direction of the light. Without describing what I saw, I had asked them if they see anything. The person had responded, &quot;Is that star moving?&quot; another person noticed and looked up as well.I was able to get the whole band to look without saying a word and they all saw what I saw. The band is multi-racial, and they all noticed. Apparently it spooked the directors, because I heard the tremble in their voices.Of course some of them were in denial and said it was a satellite, but those move in straight lines, and there much more distant and dim.

It was much brighter and closer than any star in the sky that night. It was close enough to see that it was moving. It didn&apos;t leave until the band practice was over. It appeared as though it was seeking entertainment from the marching band.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I was so excited so i called my sister 30 miles away. and before I could say anything,she interupted me about a big white light in the sky.

This object had to have landed either somewhere on the Gulf Coast of Mississippi or in the Gulf of Mexico near the beach. The object was definitely in our atmosphere and was moving quickly with no tail or trail of light behind it.

My only belief that it is a UFO, is that is was traveling rather slowly, yet still fast, but I could notice a lack in speed. A week later, I had found out that a friend of mine was staying at his grandparents, and while on the couch sleeping, he suddenly woke up due to a bright green light in the sky.

My wife asked me if I could see &lsquo;that&rsquo;. I looked out, towards the direction of the Columbia Mall and the Interstate, and I noticed a gray, circular object, going in and out of view.It stayed stationary, but appeared to be rotating, appearing as a disc, and then rotating out of view. At first we thought it was a dark cloud behind another cloud, but as we watched it, we noticed it had a definite form. It appeared to be gray to dark gray and non- reflective. The best way to describe the shape would be to imagine a coin shaped object, rotating in and out of view.We lost sight of it when we passed the school building, hoping to get a better look at it from the parking lot, but when we got to a spot where we could view that area of the sky again, it was gone.", "Pulsating light making circles shooting out different colored balls leads to what looked like an explosion with a flume of smoke risingI was driving south on highway 912 in Indiana when I saw what looked like a shooting star.  It was a white color with a long tail that was following it then  smaller different colored balls shooting off of it.  So I initially thought it may have been a firework, then suddenly it began making vertical circles and followed into a zigzag motion.  Seeing this I decided to pullover and take a better look because I was on my motorcycle.  The portion of highway I was on is raised so I had a good view over looking the buildings below easily.  When I pulled over the tail stopped and know it was a pulsating red object that was also turning white and was still shooting off balls that were colored green, purple and red they were shooting off in three&apos;s and from those balls a couple other even smaller balls were shooting off.  Then a guy in my class pulled over wondering in front of me so I pulled up to him and asked him if he saw what was looking at?  He actually pulled over to see if I needed help.  So I pointed out the light to him which was only pulsating bye now which at first he had trouble identifying at first because of airplanes in the sky. Then we  watched the light move west in a zig zagging motion along with an up and down movement with figure eights and swoops.  After about five minutes we were going to leave and it pulsated real bright and I pointed it just in time to see it drop to the ground and the sky lit up like a bomb was dropped and where it lit up a smoke flume rose into the air.

It was higher than some black birds that were flying around, so we thought that it might&apos;ve been a black balloon that flew up really high.  Ignoring it, we turned away, but felt that it was still very odd so I kept looking back.  After a few seconds, I looked back up and saw the black object turn to bright white, like a flashing light (not like fire).  I told the other guy to look at it again and he said that he saw it as well.  It then proceeded to move very quickly and speed off and up.  Eventually, it was no longer visible.  Both of us agreed it was very odd.  I have never been a witness to a UFO or thought that I was before, but I can fathom no other explanation.  This is because of the odd shape and color change (and the fact that it went from pitch black to bright white flash of light) and change of speed (from stagnant to very fast) and its disappearance.", "Softball  shaped white lights in the skyMy husband and I were camping in Whitefield NH.Sept17th-23rd 2008.

One would appear and as it was fading out another light would appear a few feet over so we were seeing two at a time a total of six. It did this into a U-shaped pattern.Maybe a hundred feet side ways they went. The lights were a bit above tree top high, about softball shaped size, and no sounds were heard.Moving slow.The second night i was star watching with my husband, he didn&apos;t see it this time. It was in the sky above my head. Three white lights all in a row, and it looked like there was a rod connecting them.

An airplane approached from the Southwest and when it came into binocular view with the flashing lights, the flashing lights went away.The shape of the object as a whole seemed to change from circular to elongated oval shaped and then a triangle before it disappeared, lights flashing randomly the entire time.There was no sound except the airplane.", "Night sky orb craft seen over Florida RiverIt looked like an orb of light moving VERY QICKLY over the night sky over the St. Johns River. Originally we thought there was one light, then when it got close to he middle of it&apos;s track (nearly directly over the bridge) it became two distinct orbs. It may have been two crafts, but we (me and my boyfriend) think it was just one. It moved from South to North (I think, it may be the opposite), then hovered.

I was pulling into my driveway and noticed a light in the sky out my window. I originally thought it was a glare off my window. I rolled down the window and it was still there. The silo of the barn came between myself and the light. I parked, got out, and moved to get a better look. A cloud had come in front of the object and because there was no wind it stayed there. The light faded behind the cloud and eventually disappeared.  The object never appeared to move except when it faded.That was one of very few clouds in the sky. The light was white and fairly bright. It was round in shape. It was not a plane; it was too big. I would guess around a sixth of the size of the moon.  I do not believe in aliens but I have never seen anything like it.

There were two parallel rows of light at an 11 to 5 o&apos;clock angle to my position. These lights, apparently, were on the same flying vehicle.  The lights could have been on a vehicle as large as a blimp, but the two parallel lines of light were straight and perfectly parallel to each other. As it flew, there were small individual lights comprising each row of lights. These individual lights would rapidly flash off and on for about a second, then refrain from flashing at all for another second.  This pattern continually occurred. It was about as high as one would see a Sesna small plane fly. I first saw it from my kitchen window, then I quickly ran outside and heard no sound from it.

Strange morphing UFO with brilliant translucent colorsAt around 4:45am on Aug 22, 2008 I walked outside to check on my animals. As I was looking for my cats, I noticed a flashing object in the sky. It was a round looking object, which I initially assumed a star or planet. But as I continued to watch it, I was fascinated by the flashy colors it was emitting. It seems every color in the rainbow was flashing, right before my eyes. I quickly ran inside my home, and grabbed my camera. Unfortunately, I do not really know how to use this fancy pro camera, and recorded it with the setting to &quot;auto&quot;. This caused the object to focus in and out. Altogether there is about 25 minutes of footage. my 19 year old son also witnessed this object while walking home from work (we live on base housing). The very last section was a video I shot of the moon (I was trying to compare the moon to what I had just seen).  The degree angle can be pretty easy to identify because I used a reference point of a house with the object I was filming. I know that there are strange happenings at Fort Huachuca, AZ (Blue Beam Project...etc) and their base is but a few hours to the east of me, which coincidentally points in the same direction of where the object was hovering.

The movement was not unlike an aircraft, straightline and not apparently faster than a conventional plane.  No sound.  What made this unlike anything I have seen before was the color (pink grapefruit flesh colored).  The conditions were very clear, star-filled sky with no lunar illumination (very dark sky and brilliant starlight--no haze or humidity).  The object was moving almost directly in an Easterly path, at a height that appeared to be 800 ft or less. I tried to go in the house, upstairs, and locate the object as it passed over a tree that was about to block my view from the backyard, but I never saw it again, even after returning to the yard. It was a bit fuzzy around the edges, as if it were a fire (almost reminded me of what a flare should look like).  No smoke visible.

It was traveling pretty low, and there was no sound. Suddenly, it just &ldquo;blinked out,&rdquo; for lack of a better term. It just seemed to disappear. Then, about a minute or so later, another light appeared, quite a bit higher up, and farther toward the southeast, it started moving toward the north east, and it also just disappeared as quickly as it appeared.

For a number of years now I have seen either a single star like object in the daytime very high up hovering in the sky or I have seen a formation of these same objects.  On one occasion I was with two other individuals and pointed them out and they saw them and we watched them move and hover in ways that no traditional aircraft operate.I am writing this now because this past weekend on two consecutive days (August 9th and 10th) I saw a single silver star like object motionless in the daytime sky. Both days were perfect weather wise with very clear visibility.On August the 9th in the afternoon at about 4 PM PST I noticed a silver colored point of light hovering in Eastern Sky perhaps 50 to 55 degrees from the horizon. I thought it might be a plane moving away from me and the sun was reflecting on it at an odd angle. But it just hung there with what I thought was perhaps a vibrating like movement. My wife was standing with me holding our 3 month old as we were preparing to go on a walk and she saw it as well. After about 3 to 5 minutes we couldn&rsquo;t see it anymore. It appeared to just fade away but not like an object moving off &ndash; it either faded out or turned in such a way that the sun wasn&rsquo;t hitting it. I think it important to note that the light may have been the sun reflecting off the object but while the object appeared very small and far away it was star like and obviously bright enough to been seen by the naked eye.The following day on the 10th at approximately 5:30 in the afternoon I again took the baby outside to sit on our front porch swing which faces east. I had this odd feeling that I would see the object again and when I looked up between two nearby trees there it was again in the sky. The object was higher this time but brighter and closer to my position. It began to slowly drift a bit from North to South and I knew in a moment it would be obscured by the leaves of one of the trees.Now I don&rsquo;t know why but I tried, perhaps foolishly, to meditate on the object and make a &quot;connection,&quot; but it just kept drifting very, very slowly south. It was not a balloon, plane or helicopter and again the sky was perfectly clear and visibility was excellent. It would soon be out of my view so I slowly got up and went to see it from the front yard but when I looked up again it was gone. I searched the sky but to no avail. The entire encounter again lasted maybe five minutes but certainly less than ten.I am writing to you because I have seen these objects in the sky in LA before. They are not traditional aircraft. In the past I have seen them in formation and have seen them do patterns and maneuvers that, in my opinion, can not be easily explained. I have seen them with others present so I know I&rsquo;m not just imagining things.Could these be the US military aerial Predator drones? I was thinking perhaps they are tested out from a nearby base. Wouldn&rsquo;t they hover at high altitude? Could I just be seeing a satellite in geosynchronous orbit?((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I was watching plans that were off in the distance, the airport is about 30 miles from the house.. Most of the planes  were coming from the North then heading East.Then from behind a large tree to the North I saw what looked like 3 balloons tied together forming a triangle shape. They were not lit up , more like illuminating from the lights below and the moon. The object looked silver and moved very slow with no sound. Then it moved very fast covering a large distance, then slowed down again and then went backwards a ways. At this point I called for my dad and aunt to come see. I realized it was not balloons. This was far to big to be. The object kind of hovered in the same spot for a few seconds, looking  like a ball would look floating on water. Then it made a fast movement to the South West, then turned West and what looked like straight up, then it was gone. About 2 minuets later two military jets flew by. They both went to the East.Finally my family came out and watched the sky with me for a while. All we saw after that were  commercial airplanes. I have had several sightings all in Arizona.

Object appears to be cigar shaped with a cone on the top.The object in question appeared in one of the photos that were taken on July 19th at Dutch Wonderland Amusement Park in Lancaster PA.  The approximate time was 6:18pm and the sky was clear without cloud cover.  The camera was in the process of taking a series of photos in the sports mode (six pictures in three seconds) and the object being photographed was the top of the log flume ride. As you look at the photos, you can see that the log car is just approaching the top of the ride and makes very little progress through the duration of the six photos.  The first two photos appear normal, but in the third photo the object appears in the top left hand corner.  I am not making any claims about what it is; I just found the object to be unusual. As I tried to blow the picture up, the object appeared to be cigar shaped with a cone on the top.  The cone appears to be centered on the cigar and reflecting light, as if it was metallic.

The triangle consisted of 5 lights with a blinking red light in the center. It went behind a tree and we backed up to see and it was still continuing in a strait line.

He was about 20 miles south of US Route 30.  An immense craft was visible in front of his vehicle.  He was unable to determine at what height the craft was flying, but he thought it might be somewhere near 150 feet.The craft was emitting strong strobe-like flashes which gave him the ability to determine that its shape was similar to a wedge of cheese.  It was, according to him, certainly triangular.When the craft came into view, he immediately slowed down from about 70 MPH to below 55 MPH, as did other cars on the interstate.  When the craft either flew over his car, or he drove under it, his radio went out for about three to four seconds, as did his GPU.He slowed further and tried to site the craft again in his rear view mirrors, as well as over his shoulder, and was unable to see any strobe lights or craft.  According to my son, he said that people in other cars had clearly seen the same thing and were distraught.Please understand that my son is not usually accurate with regards to distances, so it is possible that he had traveled further (or shorter) than he told me he had.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

They seemed to be hovering and moving over a farm field area from what it looked like.My friend witnessed these too, he lives a half mile away from me.I don&apos;t know what these things are and I don&apos;t know whats going on around here in this greenwood area.This is the fifth strange sighting I have had since 2005.", "orange light over Onartio Canada.we noticed a light in the southern sky just to the west of Jupitor. it was an orange light moving slowly north. i sent my son for my Binoculars. 3 of us saw an orange ball through the Binoculars, with what looked like light rays or an Aura around it. after about 2 mintes it just vanished. i was looking at it through the Binoculars when it dissappeared and it flickered and dissappeared. there were no clouds in the sky at the time of this sighting.", "light sitting in one place high in the sky for thirty minuts that i saw but others said all day, i watched light slowly leave.9-27-08I went with my girlfriend to her hometown in post, Texas to visit her family. While at her uncles house about 7:00 we decided to go outside to watch the sunset, not two minutes after walking out of the house I noticed a large circle shaped light in the sky just sitting in one place not moving.In amazement of what we were seeing I didn&rsquo;t move I was scared if I left to get my camera it would be gone. About twenty minutes of watching this light a car pulled up beside us, a woman and young man get out asking if we were from Texas and if that light was always there I replied telling her that we are from the area but the light was very unusual and started to joke that it was a UFO, the woman commented to me that the light has been there all day but the people they have talked to blew it off saying it was a light over the prison, weather balloon or a plane on its way to Lubbock (nearby city). The problem with these excuses is that it was not moving so it was no plane, there was nothing to hold the light that high above the prison, and of my knowledge we don&rsquo;t even use weather balloons any more.  At that same moment I noticed that the light was getting smaller turning a red orange color, ten minutes of this and the light that was so big about thirty minutes earlier was just the size of a small star.  It makes since to me that if it was a space craft the reason for it turning red and getting was that the ship was leaving the atmosphere.I am very serious about what I saw this sighting needs to be documented.", "2 strange lights in the skyI work in Monroe Washington and commute from the dalles, Oregon. I stay there during the week. Everyday I get up at 2:00am and go to my gym in Lake Stevens, WA. From there I proceed to work which is up in the hills and woods about 12 miles from town  (Monroe). Normally I have about an hour to catch a nap before actually working, I usually pull off to the side of the road a couple of miles from the work site as its in a secured area and the gates are close and locked. This particular morning I just arrived at my normal dozing spot and saw what resembled a satellite, though somewhat lower appearing. It was moving slow like a satellite does so I watched it for about a minute when a much brighter light appeared over the tree line (easiest way to describe it was imagine the North star the brightest you&rsquo;ve seen it) it and the &lsquo;satellite&rsquo; moved towards one another and they both stopped, right next to each other for about 30 seconds. Then the satellite went back from the way it came!  I was already thinking to myself wow this is interesting. At this point for the sheer hell of it I flashed my lights 3 times. The UFO started directly towards me! It got to what I guess to be about 2 hundred yards (maybe closer) and stopped. I had my windows down and there was absolutely no noise whatsoever. It sat there for about 15 seconds so I flashed it again. Then it was like it leaped up very fast but only a short distance and continued away from me over the wood line in the direction the &lsquo;satellite&rsquo; had gone, at a slow speed compared to what I saw when it leaped straight up.. I could not make out any shape of any type of craft that might have been there, but the light honestly resembled a bright star.  I got the impression that what I was looking at couldn&rsquo;t be any bigger than my Ford Ranger pick-up. The color of the light was a bright white. It was really bright but seemed to be almost contained somehow. I don&rsquo;t know, hard to describe. Anyway, that is what I saw. I went back the next morning hoping to see something else. Nothing occurred.", "Dublin, Ireland.  I don&rsquo;t know if you could describe this as a &ldquo;UFO&rdquo; sighting as what I saw appeared to be with the stars (and same size) in the night sky.  As far as I remember I was around 15 years old and was looking up at the sky.  It was a very clear night and all the stars were visible.  I notice 2 stars about a finger apart as you hold out your hand from your face, one star would shoot a white object to the other and the other would in turn shoot it back.  This went on for about one minute when one of the stars went out.  The other star remained.  Neither star moved during this event.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

They believed they were going to meet the spaceship behind Hale Bopp to go to a UFO.That was the joking talk among my group at breakfast.  I knew the day would end much more pleasantly.That late afternoon, back home in Palm Springs, I welcomed several friends, armed with binoculars and telescopes, all come to comet-watch from my front lawn, which faces West, the direction the Comet would be visibly arcing over shortly.Wine was served and each staked out a spot.  I chose a spot on my outdoor-living room wall, facing the foothills of the mountains directly in front of my house.  Soon, just before twilight, the first lights of the comet, coming from the north west were visible.   Everyone made trips inside for snacks and drinks and chatter  until darkness began to fall.  The night was very still and clear and dark, and the lights from the arcing comet were spectacular.  Several of the group,  once they saw the comet,  had enough of that and were gathered in the living room enjoying each other&rsquo;s company and the wine.  I stayed at my post as, from my point of view,  it was too wonderful to miss a moment of.Leaning my elbows on the wall, I was very comfortably watching the show with my binoculars.  I did notice that directly in front of me there were two very bright  unblinking &ldquo;stars&rdquo;, just over the top of the foothills, it seemed: (it was by now quite dark, so I surmised they were right over the top of the foothills.)  Suddenly about 45 minutes  into watching the comet arc ever closer to the front of my house, (probably about 7 or 7:30 PM) , just as Hale-Bopp was almost directly overhead. The two &ldquo;stars&rdquo;  shot forward, like blazing headlights, straight toward me. Startled, I almost dropped my binoculars.  But I no longer needed them as these objects were so bright as to be blinding.  They looked like the headlights of the largest vehicle ever and they zoomed toward me.  Just as I knew they would crash into me and my house, they just as swiftly in concert zoomed to my right,( north)  toward Hale-Bopp.  When I say zoomed, these lights moved with  swiftness and with a smoothness of flight I had never imagined possible.  Obviously what I had thought to be &ldquo;stars&rdquo; was one object.  The two lights sailed in perfect concert  directly toward the comet, and seemed to disappear behind it, in moments going so fast and so far they became invisible in the light of the comet.I ran inside to see who else had seen it , but everyone else had been inside.I was later told  that some of my neighbors down the street saw it, and that there was something in the next day&rsquo;s Palm Springs newspapers.  I did not see the articles.Perhaps the members of Heaven&rsquo;s Gate were in that &ldquo;spaceship&rdquo; behind the comet, and just maybe they got to the anticipated UFO they sought?  I do hope so for them.But that was not the only experience with strange phenomenon here in these mountains and foothills.  About a year ago, in the fall of 2007, Palm Springs experienced a night of thunderstorms.  The foothills and mountains were covered in clouds and thunder rumbled all night.  About 3 AM the noise woke me, and going into my all-glass living room, I looked up at the mountains in front of me.  I was astonished to see four huge squares of bright lights.  I would estimate that given the distance from me the largest one was about 50&rsquo; square, and the smaller two were about 30 &lsquo; square.  Each had a spectacular whiteness but while they were extraordinarily bright they were not shining the light anywhere.  They were like beacons.  And they were moving.  They were not stationary.  I could not imagine how people could possibly be way up there in those rocky  foothill-mountains, and moving those huge lights about. It just would not be possible to stand up there in the darkness and move those lights about.  I stared at this phenomenon for about fifteen minutes, mesmerized.  I hesitated to call the police.   I kept thinking perhaps the police were doing this!  (Now that&rsquo;s crazy sounding , I know, but that is what I was thinking.)  Just as I had decided to call someone, the  lights just went out.  One minute they were there.  Then they were out.  Nothing sped away.  They just went out.  The next day I searched with binoculars that area and knew that it would have been impossible for people to be walking and standing in those areas, way at the top of those mountains.  And no way they could have in the dark held and moved those lights. But where did they go?  What were they? And a third occurrence  in these mountains.One day I was driving home from the Palm Springs airport, traveling west on Tahquitz.  At one point I happened to look up, and there over the top of the mountains at the end of that street, was an enormous blimp-like object, just hovering there.  It did not move while I was looking.  At the next stop light I noticed it had moved slightly forward but not much.   I could not see any windows or anything distinguishing about it, as it was very far from me at that point.  But I could see that it was gigantic in size, nothing like the blimps we see advertising things from time to time.  This thing would have fit five or six of such blimps into it.  Again I notice the huge thing move slightly backward.  I called Le Vallauris restaurant, as it seemed to be directly over the area where they are located.  But lunch service was on and the secretary in the office was out to lunch.  I drove as fast as I could trying to get to the end of the road to have a good look at it.  When suddenly it just disappeared.  Gone.  No sign of it anywhere.Obviously these three occurrences are connected in that they all happened in the same location.  Yet they all appear to be totally different one from the other.  What can any of them have been?  Not one((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))", "A large, black object crossed a country road at night with two huge, round lights at the back of it.I was driving through Norfolk, NY, around 11 o&apos;clock and was in an area of farm fields.  It was really dark out.  All of a sudden something big and even blacker than the night sky came across the road in front of me from my right.  My headlights didn&apos;t light it up or anything.  There were no lights around it so it was just this huge, black thing.  I was so startled I said, &quot;Whoa!&quot; and momentarily crossed the dividing line in the road while looking at it.  Believe me, I have never done that in my life!  As I kept looking out my side window I could make out two huge lights at the back of the black thing.  I couldn&apos;t get a sense of the shape of this object against the night sky, but it was huge, low, moving steadily, and only had these two huge, round lights on the back end.  They had to be the size of plate glass windows.  I was really confused because I didn&apos;t understand why, if this was a plane, it didn&apos;t have the usual lights on it, and why it was flying so darned low.  No lights but those two huge lights at the back.  I&apos;ve thought and thought about that night so many times and the thing that really stays with me is the fact that there was no glare from those lights.  Even a street light has a glow around it and lights on houses have a kind of glow around them from the distance.  These lights didn&apos;t have a glow like they were an exhaust.  You couldn&apos;t see anything but bright white, and the way they were lit made no sense.  Why didn&apos;t they glow, you know?  If it was a plane and those were the tail ends where engine heat should be coming out of, why didn&apos;t it appear to be doing that?  And why was there no sound?  A plane that low would have been noisy.  I didn&apos;t even notice the thing until it was right overhead in front of me.  I&apos;ve looked online at lots of airplanes since I saw that and I haven&apos;t seen the back end of one plane that looks like that thing did.  I would have pulled over that night to look at it, but there were two cars a ways behind me and there was not enough space for me ! to get s afely off the road.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))", "Bright light in the sky that illuminated the clouds.It was a rainy night, and a light that illuminated the clouds caught my attention. The light was oval in shape and appeared to illuminate the clouds in what could be best described as a rotating spotlight. When the light appeared away from us it would light up clouds in a circumference 15-20 time the size of the light in the center. The light then rotated slowly towards us and it was very bright, bright enough to cast very small shadows in the field from the trees. When facing us it appeared to veer left to right at minimal distances, but at very high speed. The light held my attention and never did disappear completely, nor did it do anything stranger than that of which I have described.", "1952 daylight sighting of multiple discs in formationIn the early Fall of 1952, I was on the playground of my grammar school in Kansas City, MO, when I happened to glance eastward at the horizon. I saw a very large number of disc-shaped UFO&apos;s glinting in the sunlight.  As I watched in astonishment, the objects passed directly over my head and continued onward until I lost sight of them, in all an event of about 90 seconds.  I had the good sense (even as a 10-year-old) to punch a nearby playmate and point upward.  He saw them too. After school the two of us went to my house and called Richards-Gebauer AFB to report on what we had seen.  About two or three weeks later, two Air Force officers came to my school and I was called out of class and interrogated by them.  First, they asked me how many objects there were and I said about a hundred.  They were obviously shocked and, intimidated, I said maybe there were fifty.  I have always believed the number to be closer to a hundred.  I explained that the discs flew in perfect formation, in what I would today call a chevron formation.  I also explained that they did not fly in an uninterrupted, straight-ahead motion, but displayed a yo-yo motion, almost as if they were intaking air to propel themselves, then resting momentarily before the next intake and move forward, and so on.  This they did in perfect unison.  The two officers were skeptical and asked me if I knew what ducks look like in formation.  I made a V with my fingers and refused to go along with the duck hypothesis.  Then they told me that &quot;these things are usually reported in two&apos;s and three&apos;s, not in large formations.&quot;  They asked if anyone else saw the event, and I told them the name of my playmate, who was sitting in his classroom, not 100 feet from where we were sitting.  They then said they had all the information they needed and left without interviewing the other boy.Over the years, I have read much of the published UFO literature and have found only one sighting that somewhat resembled my own--that of a U.S. soldier in the South Pacific in 1942.  He also saw a large formation of disc-like objects, which at one point made a loud rumbling sound.  In my case, there was no detectible sound.  The amazing thing is that there were at least 100 children playing on that playground, and as far as I was able to determine at the time, no one else noticed this obvious intrusion into the skies above our school.  Had I not thought to signal my playmate, even I might have concluded that I saw an optical illusion.  But it was no illusion.On a couple of other occasions, years ago, I attempted to contact other UFO organizations, but no one got back to me.  Now I am 66 years old and feel strongly that I want some permanent record of what I saw to exist after I am gone.  I would also like to explore whether the record of my Air Force interrogation still exists, though I doubt it.  I have always felt very privileged to have had this unusual sighting, at the same time frustrated by the official disinformation campaign that obviously is still going on.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

The direction was North East from Union, NJ.After looking at the airplane for a few seconds, an extremely bright light appeared at a lower altitude than the plane and then shot off to the left in an arc leaving a slight trail of light behind it.This single point of light was very pure white and much larger in appearence (2 to 3 times its size) than the airplane which is why I assume it was at a lower altitude.I have spent a good deal of time on my deck for the last 10 years and never observed anything like this.

My grandma, uncle, and I were outside looking at the stars. My uncle told us he saw a glowing light about fifteen feet in front of us. We all looked where he was pointing. For about 10 seconds ever 5 or so minutes, an extremely bright light about the shape and size of a softball would glow. It was white and extremely bright. Our cabin is pretty isolated so it is pitch dark except for the stars. After watching the glowing orb for about half an hour, I noticed there was another one in the trees to our left. We began to get a little freaked out and tried to come up with explanations, because we were all hardly ones to believe in UFOs.After watching the orb in the tree and the one in the tall grass 15 feet in front of us, we noticed one far in the distance on the top of Black Butte (the mountain in front of our cabin). At first we thought it was a star, because it was on the edge. But it was so bright and too big to be a star. At that point, it began to inch extremely slow in a straight line across the mountain.I really have no idea how to explain the next part of our sighting to you. We had been watching the orbs for give or take an hour and a half. We were frozen there, mesmerized by what was going on. All of the sudden, out of the pitch black, a bright white light swept across the side of the mountain, and across the field beneath the mountain next to our cabin. We could see everything in the light. Everything else was pitch black except for were the light was hitting, it was illuminating every tree, every blade of grass, everything in its path. I ran inside to get my dad and my grandpa, but by the time I got them to come out, everything was gone. We tried to explain what had just happened but it just sounded crazy.

I looked down for a split second as I took a step forward to try and get a better look and the thing appeared as though it was just shrinking; As if it were floating straight away, with no sound what so ever. I could still see the stars, and as it got smaller (further away) more stars appeared behind it, and no clouds were in that area.I don&apos;t know what it was, and I won&apos;t say it was a UFO, but it was definitely something weird floating in the sky that I could not explain. Very large, no sound, glowing orange and I watched the object &quot;shrink&quot; into nothing and completely disappear very quickly.It confused me and the more I went outside and looked around at the sky to see other objects in the sky in relation to where this thing was, the less I can explain what I saw!  This is my report and is honest and accurate to the best of my knowledge", "Large bright white ball of light flying through local area.I was taking a walk in my neighborhood and looked into the sky and saw a rather large bright ball of light. The ball of light was moving slowly through the clear night sky at about the speed and height you would see a normal aircraft move. The ball only stayed at this speed for a few seconds and began to accelerate and instantly shot off and disappeared into the night sky. There were no clouds in the area for the light to go behind and there was no mistaking this for an airplane.  Like I said the movement the ball made when it disappeared into the sky was instantaneous.   I proceeded to call a friend five to ten minutes later when I reached my house and decided to walk back outside.  Just as I was describing the ball of light over the phone it returned with the great speed it had left with. The ball of light had shot back into the nearby sky and began to hover for a few moments in a circular motion. I then grew tired and watching the object and went inside to report the sighting. I am 21 years old and a junior in college and have lived in this neighborhood for almost my entire life.", "It occurred late at night when i happened to be gazing at the stars on a clear night.  i was looking all the big stars towards the north when i noticed one of them was moving. At first i figured it was just a plane high in the sky, but then realized that it wasn&apos;t traveling in a straight line nor moving at one speed.  Plus it had no sound.  The object would move down, then stop and hold its position.  it did this a few times until it made it down to i&apos;d say about 500ft. and about 1 mile from me.  It then hovered up and down in a line for a few minutes, before lowering behind tall trees out of my view.  As it got closer to me i noticed that it had 5 lights.  3 bright whites in a triangle and 2 dim colored lights on the top and bottom.  It was a long time ago but i remember it well.  I&apos;ve always wondered if anyone else had seen this object.  Thats what compelled me to report this old sighting.  you never know.  I do have another witness to prove i&apos;m not crazy.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I am familiar with the flight patterns of planes and this was not a common pattern and planes have wings. The object was round an very dark yet it seemed shiny enough to occasionally reflect the sun. I pointed out the object to my girlfriend who happened to be the driver. We observed it while stopped at a light. It then did something I never saw any plane or manmade flying apparatus do. It stopped dead. And began to move very quickly in the opposite north western direction. We pulled into a home depot parking lot just to watch it. It began to ascend into the clouds that were to the north. Eventually it disappeared into the cloud bank. Shortly after a fast moving helicopter did pass through the exact area we saw the object.", "Blue light over Clearwater CausewayI want to start out by saying, &lsquo;Sorry&rsquo;, since I really am not sure what month it was in 2006 when the following event occurred. I simply cannot recall when it was but I wanted to report this hoping that it may help in some way, some how, even if the significance is miniscule.I was parked with a friend off the road on the Clearwater Causeway. We were facing NE and it was later in the evening. My friend was facing me, and I was looking out over the water. The sky was a beautiful deep purple and was very clear. What happened played out very quickly. So quickly, that I did not blink. A bright blue light appeared in the sky. It just appeared, but then quickly got a slight bit larger, as if it was heading towards me. It had to be extremely far away. It was small, but at the same time it was huge compared to what a passing plane would be, or a helicopter. By the way it was not a helicopter light.I have never ever seen a light that strong or in that bright blue color in the sky before. It stopped and then went up and backwards like in the shape of a slight arch until I could no longer see it. It moved so fast that there is no other technology I can compare it to. You could tell it moved a vast distance when it left. I have tried to find what skeptics would call a &quot;logical&quot; explanation, but I cannot find one. I believe what I saw was a UFO. I have never seen anything before this occurrence, nor after, so far.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

We saw no more UFOS and we took our food in the grilled on the outdoor grills out in the backyard and got ready to eat it. It was really fun to be with my neighbor friends being together and seeing the UFOS we saw it was a very clear night outside and we saw no more UFOS. It was really an exiting experience to see all the UFOS we saw when we were all in the backyard grilling food and we were all together.

Airplane fly over through out the day because I live in a flight pattern, and I always look up to see.  This morning I heard a plane but it was a passenger plane or that size, flying up high and as I looked at the plane, lo and behold if there were not 3 discs shaped &ldquo;craft&rdquo; flying behind this jet.  I could see they were probably higher in altitude; they seemed to just follow along.  The were not flying in a &ldquo;row&rdquo; they were just 3, close in proximity and one of them seemed to be going back and forth, as if &ldquo;playing around.&rdquo;  I watched one of the &ldquo;craft&rdquo; fly up even higher and disappear as the other 2 continued following. Now this happened in a 15-20 second span.  They were reflecting light so they were solid.  Not birds, not balloons, no wings but clearly following above and behind the plane.  I wanted to run and get my camera but I knew that by the time I got it they would be out of view from my vantage point.  I am not crazy and actually feel crazy even writing this but it&rsquo;s not the first time I have seen &ldquo;ufo&rdquo; activity here in this area and it is never reported on the news.

My only reason for this report is to document the incident.On November 20, 2007 I was traveling with four friends and a driver in Beijing, China.  We were on vacation visiting the country and enjoying the sights.  I was sitting in the back seat of the car, if you could call it a seat, because the little suv was full with the 6 of us. I was looking out the front window past the driver when my friend says, &quot;Hey guys, whats that up in the sky by the tower?&quot; We didn&apos;t know what to think as we clamored to the left side of the car to get a good look. Everyone else immediately saw it, except the driver (he spoke absolutely no English)and myself, and began to throw around comments like, &quot;it&apos;s a blimp&quot; or &quot;maybe it&apos;s a ufo.&quot;  As I struggled in vain to find the object, my friends took out there cameras and snapped a couple of images of the ufo and tower.  Eventually, I saw it.  The reason I had missed it was because I assumed the altitude of the supposed object to be around 3,000 - 5,000ft. In actuality, the ufo was at an altitude of 15,000 - 20,000ft (roughly. See photo).  The ufo itself appeared round and definitely had a grey/metallic color. It hovered/remained still the entire time we watched (2-3min), that is, until it vanished from view. I don&apos;t know exactly how, but when my eyes were distracted momentarily they returned to find the object gone. Vanished completely, with no sign of it in the surrounding area or contrails.In total, five of us saw the object. I forgot about the incident because it was a friend who took the photographs.  Later, remembering the incident, I got copies of it and looked at them.  I didn&apos;t see anything.  That is, until I began to zoom in and scan the area I remember seeing the object around. Another interesting piece of the puzzle was in the second photo, the object is a little more blurred but there are 4 gold/yellow disk&apos;s at approximately the same height only about a mile or two away. I did not mention these disk&apos;s earlier because I did not actually see them that day, only the one ufo. It was only upon scrutinizing the photos that I saw them. I am not sure whether or not my friends saw them in addition to the one object.I have four photos of the incident.  Only two of them containing anything.  The other two are after the object departed.Hope this is helpful.", "fast moving object size of star shoots fast east and then lights up and disappears.I was walking out to my car to put the windows up ( i had school in the morning and i didn&apos;t want my windshield to be a fogged up).

At this point the object lit up with lights for a good 2 seconds, and then disappeared. I sat outside for a good half an hour to see if this object would come back, but it never did.

As I do if i&apos;m out there.  Just below the constelattion was a small star, same size as the others and same colour as the rest of the stars but it was moving very very slowly.It may well have been a satellite or the space station but after witnessing both of these on many occasions I found it a little odd that it was so distant and so slow.  I find satellites tend to leave a trail as a shooting star should and are fast and the space station when we see it is very bright.  first time we saw the space station i thought it was some kind of spy plane.", "A massive object in the sky, that shined a light in front of me that was very weird....this happened when Iwas ten years old and around sept. 10th 1993. It was after dark on apartly cloudy night with the moon out there was no other aircaft around and the weather was good. Every Friday evening my Mom and I would walk around the school I was going to for fun Etc. on the way back about half a block from my house I was looking down and was about 7 feet behind my mom  Out of nowhere a very bright dark blue light flashes on the ground right in front of me. the best way to describe this light is it looks like the light you would see at the bottom of a pool with the water moving kinda like bubbles but not kinda like electricity, but not very weird but pretty I guess you could say the light had no noise to it.Once is saw the light i looked up to the sky and there happened to be a opening in the clouds that was a good 2 to 3 miles wide. there was a very large cloud behind me, but I saw nothing. I began to think it was so funny lightining or something like that. At this point I ask my mom did you see that she said no.At about the same time we both lookedagain to see anything one more time and out of the cloud comes a very very very large rectangle object at a very fast speed going west tored Luke Air Force Base about 7 miles west of where I am at. I lost track of it in the clouds about ten seconds after I saw it, but in those ten seconds it was proable 7 miles away already.The Clouds that night where about normal alttuide and like I said earlier the opening was about 2 to 3 miles long and about a mile wide this object was bigger then the opening in the clouds I want to say it was 12 to 15 aircarft carries long and 6 to 8 wide it was HUGH. The object had a ton of lights on it all over the place they could have been in a pattern , but it went by so fast and unexpectedly was unable to see that. The one thing I did notice was the back end of the object, the back end was all white/blue lights kinda like a rocket area or where the engines are at. The object looked to have a blueish silver metal on it.The object made no noise at all and did not displace a cloud that was the weirdest part of all for something that big, that fast, and with what looked simalur to rockets on back that was just not right. I have been a beleaver ever since. I have never seen or heard of anyhting like this ever again. also to note for the next hour after seening this my eyes were burning.if you have any questions please contact me thanks  P.S.I also saw the Phoenix lights and those in any way where not flares, even if they were there not going to do any military trainning where they were at becasue it was over a Indain resrevion and that test area they were talking about its near yuma Arizona 95 miles south west of Phoenix((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

However, after a few moments as the light passed in front of a star it disappeared.   I kept searching for a moment or so for it to reappear, it didn&rsquo;t.

As it headed across the sky, it did not appear to be going in a straight trajectory but rather sort of a &quot;squiggly&quot; path. It climbed higher and higher as it went.

We were watching a low flying, large airplane that was flying overhead which is unusual for this area.  My daughter looked down to talk to me and at that time I saw 2 triangles sort of adjoining or maybe it moved so fast it just looked like two.  It just suddenly appeared (maybe it was behind a cloud?) and before I could tell my daughter to look into the sky, it sped off at a right, upward angle into the night.  As far as the size, it is hard to describe because of how high it was, but compared to the airplane it was about 1/4 to 1/2 the size of the low flying ,large airplane that had already passed us.  It did not look like it was following it - but who knows it disappeared rather quickly.  I could see a trail of light as I watched it, but it didn&apos;t leave a trail in the sky.

They were clear as day, five SPHERES moving in formation, much too slowly to be planes. It almost seemed like they were moving too slow to even be able to fly. They were way too small to be blimps and shiny metallic. I would estimate they were about 2.5 miles away or less, and following the path of the 5 freeway. I also thought it was odd, because they appeared &quot;locked&quot; in formation with absolutely zero individual movement. I immediately went for my camera, because they just didn&apos;t seem to belong.As I was fumbling to grab my camera, I lost track of them once getting into the turning lane onto Hollywood Way, as they were blocked by the tall buildings. I was surprised to see them again when getting to Hollywood Way and Riverside Drive, where I finally got this picture. There are only four in this picture, because the 2nd from the right is blocked by the tree. I was getting honked at by people behind me and everyone walking on the street was looking to see what I was trying to get a picture of. I couldn&apos;t tell if they could see from their vantage points.I pulled over at the 76 Station at Hollywood Way and Alameda to get better pictures out of my car, but I could no longer locate them anywhere in the sky.

IT WAS THE COOLEST THING I&apos;VE EVER SEEN. IT WOULD GET REAL BRIGHT, THE DIM, IT WOULD MOVE FAST THEN SLOW. I CALLED CHANNEL 3 NEW, THEY SAID NOBODY REPORTED IT BUT THEY WOULD LOOK INTO IT. WE WATCHED IT FOR 35 MINUTES UNTIL IT STARTED FLOATING DOWN AND SHAKING FROM SIDE TO SIDE, AND THE LAST 30 SECONDS I COULD SEE THERE WAS SOMETHING ON TOP OF THE LIGHT. IT WENT DOWN WHERE WE COULDN&apos;T SEE IT ANYMORE AND NEVER CAME BACK UP. DID ANYONE SEE ANYTHING ON AUGUST 16 BETWEEN 10:40 AND 11:15?

Then they kind of faded out then appeared again within about 30 seconds and spread out in a single file line and multiplied to 6 or 7 lights all slightly blinking.  The lights then moved in line from west to east with no sound.  I am just south of Tulsa Airport and at first thought it was a jet that was taking off because I did hear a rumbling sound when I had first seen the lights.  But when the lights split into multiple lights I humorously thought a jet might have been sent to investigate the lights.  I do not know who to contact to see if there was a series of jets that took off that morning.  Surely they would not allow 6 or 7 jets to take flight at 1:30am with surrounding residential areas so close to the airport.", "Yellow/Orange Lights Over BurbankMy partner and I were sitting in our lounge chairs on the dec in our backyard when we noticed a yellow-orange light appoarching us from the Glendale area. At first, I thought it was a helicopter or a plane, but I didn&apos;t see any red/blue flashing lights.  Just a solid yellow-orange light, it was pretty high on a stable trajactory going from east to west as the object got closer, we could see it there was another object hovering over the light but we could barely see it, and there was no noise coming from the object as it flew over us. It was very quite.We ran inside to get our camera and started video taping he object as it was moving away in stable line.

The particular part of the road can see a cell tower in which to the right of it was the object. It appeared very bright (almost like Venus) but seemed to dim a lot and eventually disapated after looking at the same location about a minute up the road. Very low in the sky. It looked sort of circular and bright yellow/white and as it dimmed it went into a diamond shape, top being the widest. It was still dusk and could still see the outline of trees and the sky was dark blue. The object was about 3 miles west of my location on the road.After driving down the road a bit I felt odd sensations but nothing too particular.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I had stepped out on back deck which faces the west, in my back yard are 50 foot pine trees in a line. I noticed what appeared to be a bright light , like landing lights on a plane. I watched the light get closer but was shielded by trees as object was very low.  My mistake after all these years, i assumed this to be a plane ! Object moving , my guess 30 mph, as it cleared the trees , the object was not over 100 feet in the air. To my shock, it flew right over me silently! and disappeared to the east over the tree in my side yard. The object was triangle ,had 3 huge lights (approx 4 to 5 feet across)on each tip and a small light in middle blinking. The lights actually lite up the ground and i had to shield my eyes to get a good look at it.The lights were bright enough for me to see the shape ., triangle smooth rounded edges and corners, approx. 35 to 40 feet in length. The lights were unusual, they werent a focused light like a flashlight , more diffused almost like frosted glass, in the light it appeared like filaments with light pulsing all over it, if you will sparkly. Ive never seen anything like it , it could be military , i dont have a clue. I didnt report this for awhile on purpose hoping if military they might use this flight path again. To date have not see again ., will keep observing.I would take a lie detector test to what i saw and to all the hoaxers out there , you non believers are in for a surprise and the truth is coming i just hope its a good thing.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

On Saturday evening (8/23/08) at 7:40 PM, I returned to my backyard in Westlake, LA and started a through watch to the South and South West direction. (The same direction that I had observed the &ldquo;daylight star&rdquo; a day earlier. At 7:50 PM, again a very large and bright starlike object appears suddenly to the South West against the still clear blue sky. (Sunset was at 7:46 PM and the sky was still very well lit up at this time). I watched the object for a minute or so to make sure that it was indeed a stationary object. I then attempted to get the attention of someone inside my home by knocking on the windows while trying to watch the object at the same time. (I did not want to take my eyes off the object just in case it faded away into thin air as it did the day before after observing it for 40 minutes). After knocking on windows for another minute or so to no avail, I momentarily took my eyes off the object three times and was easily able to re-sight the object each time until the third time and then the object was gone when I looked back up. I remained outside watching for another hour without ever seeing the very large and bright &ldquo;daylight star&rdquo; again. However, during this time frame all of the &ldquo;normal stars&rdquo; that I normally see each evening began to slowly and dimly appear starting around 8:15 PM. I did not notice any &ldquo;normal stars&rdquo; moving or disappearing. I do not know what this very large bright starlike object is, but I am almost positive that it is not a star or a planet.

I was smoking a cigarette listening to my Ipod in my driveway early one morning when i started to wave my hand over the light to create a slow strobe pattern.  After a couple of minutes i took my headphones off and looked at the sky.  I didn&apos;t hear or see anything come near me, but I looked up and saw a trapezoid shaped craft hovering silently about 75-100 feet above me.  The outline of the craft was a flashing red line that was the shape of a trapezoid, two equal sides then the front of the craft was shorter than the bottom.  It moved from side to side in a kind of sporadic movement, I was frozen stiff scared and stood there for about 20 seconds staring at it then cautiously waved at it, it then changed to a red and white light pattern and hovered away towards the moon behind my house.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

It appeared almost as if it were engulfed in flames. The object came north towards us then turned and went east very quickly. much faster than any terrestrial air craft Ive ever encountered. Then about a half hour later another came and went. It was obviously not a balloon or a firework or something due to the longevity of its flight and its ridiculous speed. There were several witnesses in attendance. There were several other commercial aircraft in the vivinity at the time suggesting governmental experimentation.

It was the size of a large star but, as the object came closer overhead, it grew almost to the size of a full moon. It suddenly veered off towards the south and only a white tip, the size of a large star, was visible with the exception of a black rectangular shadow that seemed attached to the tip. There were small sparks/flames from the tip (like a firework}. It moved exceedingly rapidly.  It then vanished for a split second.Suddenly, in its place appeared a huge, clearly defined horizontal teardrop shaped object--with 2 extending tips on each end at the middle - that was a brilliant orange. This object was the size of at least two (2) full moons not including the tips. The object was not moving.  Just as suddenly this entire object turned beautiful neon green. The shape did not change nor did object move.Then, all of a sudden there appeared, at the top middle and middle rear part of the object, what appeared to be cartoon lightening streaks. In other words these streaks were jagged, had width but were very small in comparison (approximately 3 - 4 regular stars in length). They were gold in color. They did not move nor did they glow. They did not seem like rays and their shape was clearly defined.Just as suddenly the entire object completely disappeared without any trace. There was no noticeable sound at any time.

Then at about 12:00 direction something caught my eye, it was a silver, reflective orb or possibly egg shaped object that seemed to be undulating colors, possibly blue or purple. Then a large passenger jet entered my vision at approx. 7:00 direction. Although I had 3 other standard aircraft in view it was very difficult to determine size or distance of the fourth out-of-place flying object. It seemed to be flying at about the same altitude as the jets or perhaps a bit lower. The object moved so strangely (sort of curving or arced movements) that I ran inside to grab the digital camera. Of course the damn battery was recharging in the wall socket. Grabbed it anyway, loaded into camera, ran outside (it turned on), but when I aimed at object it was already getting too far away to see anything. I could still see with my eyes but couldn&apos;t train viewfinder on it, very frustrating. Camera only has 3x zoom. Lost sight of object after fiddling with camera further.

There was a car in front of me but I am certain it did not slow down or had any light changes that might have caused my seeing during the incident.I was driving about 60km/h in an inclined road but not significant enough for any object i saw on my right to descend from the sky about 1 metre relative to me on my driver&apos;s window side in about 1 second. My first guess was that it might have been just a plane landing close to me, but there was no airport around that area and there should have been sound if it was, none was heard and it was not windy tonight.On the second time i looked, it was actually a burning &quot;fireball-like&quot; object descending so quickly in the air and very far away from me that i figured it was travelling at a very swift speed, descending 90 degrees down from the horizontal.In within 2-3 seconds of watching the descend when i realised the incident was rather inhuman the object stopped in the air for about 1 second as if it knew i was watching, and the fire burned brighter as if it&apos;s engine fired up and propelled towards exactly were i was looking at.When the fire was dimmer( something like how a jet plane gets its propulsion force from the burning of fuel but seemed like rocket&apos;s engines used in mid-air) i saw an object that looked like the back of a jet plane, but without the top wing which i assumed to be a flat surfaced object with 2 wings and the hole that produced fire was relatively about 70% of that UFO&apos;s size. Right after the fire was put out, there was absolutely nothing in the sky.All these happened in within 5 seconds or less and i actually stopped accelerating(not brake) but not accelerating to look over that object. There was no illusion or reflection, because I am a smoker and i had my window down but i was not smoking.It seemed to me it just travelled in an unbelievable speed like breaking the speed of light as soon as i realised that object was not normal. That however, might have been coincidence, but the acceleration it had was definitely not and no sound was produced, not even change in wind, nothing around me changed or moved that was ideal before.", "At around 11 pm, me and my three friends saw a large fireball with a trial of sparks behind it.

To begin with, I am a skeptic to ufos being extraterestrials, but still am interested in understanding this phenomenom, whatever it is.I have read about the &quot;hollow earth&quot; hypothesis, which I took as being as ridiculous as the flat earth belief, eventhough it was believed by Columbus and Halley . I have read about both South and North Poles expeditions, some claiming such areas being entrances within the earth&apos;s inner world; about Admiral Byrd&apos;s secret diary. I enjoyed reading such stories as science fiction and nothing else.One day I while I was searching for world maps on the internet, I stumbled upon Google Earth. I downloaded the free version and was extremely impressed with the satelite shots. After zooming on Paris,France, I actually could see cars on the streets.One boring night,I started using Google earth to zoom focus some sites associated with fictional, mythical settings such as the Pyramids, and the sea bed floor within the area some claim Antlantis might be located...looking for some abnormalities or maybe signs of human hands.I believe I saw some interesting landmaks however, the imagination was maybe leading me to see things that aren&apos;t dimentionally correct...just in order to, well believe in the mythical side of Life. I was starting to feel like a child again, one who still believes in such things as Santa Claus.The Alan Parson&apos;s song popped into my head....&quot;I am the eye in the sky, .........I am the maker of rules....... This made me think of the conspiracy theories....Freemasonry and the likes of the Illuminaties. The eye in the sky....satellites? within a triangle... meaning perhaps the process of triangulation?? Har har, however the symbol was much too old to even support the thought.One thing struck me though. The pyramid&apos;s view seemed to come directly from above, as if the satelite was directly above it,unlike the buildings I saw in other places such Paris. Google earth, I then thought, could actually mean &quot;go ogle earth&quot;...ogle being the term I heard used many times for the eye within the triangle....I was starting to enjoy myself in all of this.I said, let&apos;s take a look at the supposed hole in North Pole. And there it was....very impressive indeed. Although, true, this phenomenom certainly must be associated with the earth&apos;s magnetic field,however, the thought was proposed very long ago. Columbus thought the ocean water entered into the North Pole in order to exit the south...it does matches somewhat the Oceans currents. The image certainly seemed as if the ocean was indeed whirling in the earth itself.Next, the South Pole. The sight was even more impressive. Inside the continent Antartica, there is an image of what seems to be a sphere, having colour close to something like another smaller earth. Again, this phenomenom is associated with the magnetic field since the same blurry image exist like that of the North Pole.Now, what about the night sky? Nasa sent some signals (beatle&apos;s song Accross the Universe) to Polaris. I switched to the night sky setting and looked in the region of Polaris. Here is something I don&apos;t quite understand...the same phenomenom seen in the North Pole and South Pole exists....but why? The earth&apos;s magnetic field should not affect view of Polaris. I then turn to Octantis, the South Pole Star....same phenomenom again.Turning back to Polaris, I zoomed all the much I can, and that particular blurry spherical region came into view as something quite different than that from a constellation of stars.... The stars seemed more like lights; the edge of the sphere when highly magnefied, looked very much like a metallic perimeter.This is the reason why I sent this e-mail.... to have another perspective, and maybe some answers. I would like it if someone else would take a look and get back to me.Thank you for letting share this with you Andre((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

In my case it was the kids wake tube that was left in the camper so I was actually lying back and I happened to look up at the night ski and noticed a very bright that was traveling towards us in a southeast direction. At first I thought is was a plane on approach to Calgary. It was a clear night with many stars and It was a clear night with many stars and the moon visible the moon visible. What was funny about this light though was how it seemed to radiate out in all directions - different than say the lights on a plane because there like a cars headlights (projection style) you can see the beam and its intensity changes as it passes or changes direction. This light was intense and also shined into the blue spectrum and its intensity never changed as it approached, passed over and traveled off so I thought this is not a plane or chopper. I thought as well it may be a satellite, I&rsquo;ve seen them before but they reflect light and this beamed light and at first seemed too low to be a satellite and traveling to fast to be aircraft. As I said the night was clear and just from its approach and over flight I think we were observing something quite large. When I first saw it I made a comment to the other 3 people that were with me and 2 of them were able to pick it up almost immediately in the night sky and follow its path with me; my friend Darren and his wife Laurie. The other person with us was my wife who had trouble finding it in the night sky.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe Laurie watched the object until it went overhead then began to talk with my wife so only Darren and myself followed the light I then leaned over to a tree to steady myse! lf as I just got up from the wake tube and wanted make sure the object was tracking straight because I have looked at stars and other fixed lights at night before and if you are not braced against some thing solid a fixed point can look like its moving. Any how as I leaned against the tree I closed one eye and was watching the light move away from us (still just as bright as it was when approaching or over head) the light zigged to the left approximately 30 to 45 degrees instantly then zagged back onto its original course a second latter. My friend shouted, &ldquo;did you see that thing zigg zagg&rdquo; I replied &ldquo;yes&rdquo; but was dumbfounded at what I just saw. After the zigg zagg we followed it for another 2 or three seconds and it disappeared behind a tree-covered hill behind us to the southeast that was probably at a 20-degree slope from our site&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thing that was seemed funny afterward was how the experience we were watching gave me the Willies and left me feel kind of unnerved afterward.

Then we looked around where we sighted the first one initially and others began to appear. There were two that were above what we initially thought was a triangle formation. The two above the others were moving up and down but seemed to be stationed in the same location. All began to flicker and we witnessed one in particular move horizontally, flash then flicker out. We then witnessed three form a vertical line on the right side of the triangle formation. We were astounded because there appeared to be many more than we originally thought.

Both happened at 11:30 p.m. on two consecutive night. This seemed to last slightly longer than the night before.  Duration was 5-6 seconds on the 23rd. of July and the 24th sighting seemed a second or so longer. This one came from the Northeast to the Southeast.  Both nights the meteor was huge in size as well as the brightest meteor I have ever seen.  We are very used to seeing meteor&apos;s in the sky.

The night was a clear night with a good view of the stars. The person I was with was standing near the corner of McAllister and Baker streets and observed what we at first thought was a plane.  She pointed it out to me - I was standing about 15 feet south of her - and I looked up and saw 3 dim points of light (about the brightness of a dim star) that formed an equilateral triangle, moving quickly in smooth, straight line north/northeast.  At first we thought this might be a plane but considering that the craft appeared to be silent, and that the lights were a decent distance from one another it does not match the description of any plane that either of us has ever seen.  the craft moved smoothly out of sight and we ran uphill to try and continue observing it but were unable to. For what it is worth, I grew up in a town that was home to a Navy Air Station and was within the flight path for a major international airport and did not recognize the lights we saw as being consistent with any plane or helicopter that I&apos;ve ever seen.", "For about 10 minutes, my father and I watched a solid dot move in a zig-zag pattern across the night sky moving to the Northeast.My father and I were outside looking at a clear night sky.  Suddenly, we saw this light moving at a moderate speed across the night sky heading Northeast.  We knew it could not be a plane, satellite, or falling star because the flight path was very eradict.   The light kept moving at a zig-zag pattern from west to east will continue to go towards the northeast.  We both watched the object for 10 minutes before it finally moved out of our sight range.My father is a former state policeman from South Dakota and has had many sightings in the past.

Far off in another direction, we saw a  helicopter, and by comparison, the size of this unknown craft was at least 10 times bigger.  We followed it by car, as it moved just over the tree tops in our view.  It flew on an even plane, at a speed that seemed faster than a blimp, but slower than an airplane.

The &quot;aqua&quot; colored light lit the cloud uniformly.

It was totally brown with red eyes, and one by one four more popped up from the near by plants.At about 3:00 I noticed five triangular discs in the sky that were moving very slowly, zig zagging. At times they were stationary and at times they would move slowly. At about 3:50 AM they just disappeared/ vanished. It was like a light switch turning off.

At that point I knew it had to have been a UFO because nothing can move that fast.  I looked at my watch as it disappeared and it was exactly 11:32PM.One interesting characteristic about this is that when I saw the lights, there  seemed to be an aura or hue.  It was dark, so I could not clearly see the craft, but it seemed to have a metallic, or &quot;mother of pearl&quot; look and I could see the shape of the craft was round and appeared to be roughly the size of a dime.

These lights were moving in unison with eachother and were moving slowly to the southeast, I ran inside and woke up my girlfriend and had her come out and see them as well. When we came out the object was still in the sky, but started moving more in a southern direction. within a minute or two the object did another series of slow turns, first east and then ended in a southbound tragectory, flying away from us. Then the lights went out first the front then rear left and finally rear right.The object itself could not have been made out without the lights. It made no sound. It seemed to be flying very high, and the lights appeared as satelites do in the night sky. One could have even mistaken them for stars at a glance.

The date today is the 11th of August, 2008.  This was actually my 2nd UFO encounter in about the past week and a half.  I would first like to talk about my first encounter which happened about 1 and a half weeks ago.  It was about 9:45 PM and I had been at my friend&rsquo;s house across town.  I started to head back home which was about a 15 minute drive.  On the way home I noticed 2 large lights about 60 to 80 feet hovering in the air, lights almost touching each other.  As I began to drive towards the lights I actually began to joke to myself that this might be a UFO.  I continued on highland drive and when I got to the Amort&rsquo;s farming fields I clearly saw this object floating soundless in the air.  Other cars drove extremely slow past this object, as if to wonder what was sitting up in the air.  The strange thing was of the 3 or 4 cars I saw pass this object, no one stopped or got out of their car, but each car drove past this thing at about 5mph to catch a glimpse.  As I drove past this object I could clearly see the shape and color of this unknown craft.  It was diamond shaped with 4 bright lights on each corner.  The crazy thing was you could see these lights from so far away but when you got up the craft the lights appeared pretty small.  Also when I looked into this light it didn&rsquo;t hurt my eyes as a regular light would.  As I rolled down the street almost directly under this craft I rolled down my window and heard no noise, at all.  Please tell me what can float 80 feet off the ground and not make noise.  The lights on the bottom of the craft are what created enough light to view the craft.  The bottom of the diamond was some sort of black material.  After passing the craft on the long street of highland I was only about 2 minutes away from my house and I wanted to get my brother and a video camera as proof to this sighting.  Unfo! rtunatel y when I arrived home he was gone and 10 minutes later when I returned the object had vanished.  When I got back home my parents were now there and I decided to tell them about this strange event.  On the way home they had seen this object in the Amort&rsquo;s farming fields just like I had.  I figured out that they passed by this same object about 5 minutes after I had.  My parent&rsquo;s first impression of the object was it was not normal and was a UFO.  They believed as they passed the object it began to move forward slowly but they never saw it disappear quickly.  The funny thing about this is that my family and I decided not to report this; I decided to report it after what happened to me, tonight, the night of August 11th.  I was over at one of my brother&rsquo;s friend&rsquo;s houses and it was about 11:15 PM.  I was tired and decided to head back to my house.  I was almost to my street when I noticed a weird light hovering, in place, a good distance behind the Warlow&rsquo;s farming fields.  I decided that because of my recent sighting nearly 2 weeks ago, that I would park in their driveway and watch this red light.  I noticed that the object began to hover straight up into the air at a pretty fast pace.  The object reached a height of probably about 200 to 300 feet and began to move fast towards my vehicle.  At this point I was pretty much scared shit less and pulled back as fast I could and made a fast dash towards my house.  The object hovered parallel with my vehicle but essentially right above me.  I remember as I made the sharp turn onto my street I glanced out my window and up into the sky and there it was right above me, following me but still at an altitude of about 200 to 300 feet.  I could clearly see the lights on the UFO and the brightness of the moon made everything pretty visible.  It was high enough up that I couldn&rsquo;t quite make out the shape but it moved quickly.  At this point I was freaked out of my mind and my adrenaline was running.  The object proceeded to follow me up my street until I made it to a lar! ge pass of overhanging trees.  I live out in the forest and there are a lot of trees that hang over my street, it creates some good cover from the skies.  As I reached this pass of overhanging trees before my house I was continuously looking in the air to see if the UFO was still present.  When I got to my house I was so scarred I didn&rsquo;t even get out of my car.  I locked the doors and called my mom to open the front door of my house, so I could run in with no delays.  This event scared me to the point of reporting both these UFO incidents event though I had been contemplating revealing the first incident.  The thing about this 2nd one is that I was out by myself witnessing all of this.  My lights were shined out towards the UFO which probably got its attention because after about a minute or 2 it headed straight towards me.  I really thought this unknown craft was trying to do something the way it responded to me showing up and witnessing it out in the Warlow field.  The craft had 3 lights, 1 red and 2 white (bright).  This may sound like a plane or something but this was not, I know for a fact.  It made no sound, flew 200 to 300 feet above the ground almost directly above my car, the craft essentially engaged me and I ran.  In my mind I really believed it was trying to abduct me and luckily I was about 1 minute from my house and I went about 50 to 60 mph on a 25 mph street to escape this thing that was tailing me.  I strongly have believed in aliens before these events but I feel unsafe out here.  This is the 2nd UFO I have seen and unfortunately I have to pictures or videos to prove it, just the fact that my parents saw the first sighting and they strongly believe there was no possibility it was from this planet.  I&rsquo;m now carrying a video camera in my car and will update this site if I capture or see anything else.  I hope my word and others will soon unveil the alien presence on earth. P.S:  I just wrote this right after my 2nd incident with a UFO as seen above in my script", "The phoenix lights were also seen in Ohio.This event occurred 11 years ago and at the time I was only in 8th grade. I only put in a small amount of effort to find out more about the sighting. Even though I only put in little effort in finding out facts at the time, this was a significant event for me in my life.It was about 9 or ten o&rsquo;clock; I am not sure the exact date, the big news was the hale bob comet. A few friends and I decide to go out and take another look at the comet since you could see it perfectly and clearly in the sky. We walked out on my front porch and into to my front yard facing southward to look at the comet. After being outside for a few minutes we noticed a light southwest above a hill. Next thing you know right beside it in consecutive order 3 or four lights appear right beside the first light, from left to right. Next, two lights disappeared from right to left and then reappeared. Then two more lights appeared in consecutive order with the others and one more after that. These things were staying perfectly still in the air not moving at all and making no noise. After a series of lights disappearing and appearing again a second row of consecutive lights started appearing directly in order and below the lights above. These things were hovering in the air whatever they were. I have seen pictures of the flares that people used to try to duplicate the phoenix lights (which wasn&rsquo;t even close), and I have military experience in which I have seen flares with my own eyes so I know for 100% fact they were not flares. All theses lights appeared, disappeared and reappeared again in the exact same spot in the sky. They all also stayed perfectly still. Nothing man made could stay as perfectly still and in order as these did. The only thing I have ever seen in my life that I could use to compare this experience with is the phoenix lights. The way the phoenix lights appear and disappear was exactly what I seen. All I can tell you is, I seen exactly what was seen in phoenix.Directly after the event my friends and I called our science teacher and told him about what was going on and he said maybe some debris was falling off the comet and my friends and I knew that was not the case. A few weeks later my teacher told me he heard the military was doing something with flares. I do not remember his sources; actually I am pretty sure he never told me exactly how he found that out. I knew, once again 100% for a fact, they were not flares. At this time in my 8th grade life I knew no other way to find anything out about this. Then after even more time started going by I never really even thought to pursue this. Then after having kids and settling down a bit I started watching more TV and about two years ago learned of the phoenix lights. The incident had already been bothering me for years but now it has been tearing me up. I am becoming more obsessed with finding more about this interesting subject and what happened that night Also I have seen other strange things in the sky but nothing that was as definitive as this. I would really like to know if there were any other sightings around this time, or ever around here.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I thought at first it was a plane, but there were no lights blinking on it like there were on a plane over the nearby Marin Headlands.  it seemed to be made of metal, or something that reflects, and the bottom of it was like the bottom of a bowl, reflecting the light of the sun beneath it.  The top of it was like a smaller, upside-bowl, and although it appeared to be solid, it seemed to be invisible except where the sunlight was reflecting off of it, like I was seeing the outline of a bubble in the light.  My second thought was that it was a missile, because it moved like a missile, like it was up so high and was far enough away to appear to be moving very slowly, but it was moving towards the beach. I watched it from 7:30 to 8:08 pm, when the fog rolled in, and it disappeared. Several other people on the beach also witnessed it and took pictures with their cell phones.", "My Cousin,and my sister were on just entering lakeland when we saw greenish, blueish light fall into the sky and disspeared.

When I looked up I saw it was the sun reflecting off of an object.  I wasn&apos;t sure what it was so I watched it to see if it was a plane or something else.  The light only reflected of it for a few more seconds then I could see it long, and cylindrical.  It was kind of grayish in color and appeared to be moving kind of slow for a plane.  It was moving from the southwest to the northeast.   Just to the northwest of the object I could see a jet flying higher and faster in the opposite direction.  I could hear no sound from either one and could see no exhaust trail from the object but I could see one from the jet.As the object moved closer and more in front of me I could see there were no visible wings.  It was low enough that if there were any wings they should have been at least somewhat visible.  At this time I went in the house to get my wife to look at it and when I came back outside I couldn&apos;t see it anymore.  I took my groceries in and came back out and it was back but appeared to be farther away but I could still see it pretty good and then my wife got a look at it too and agreed that it didn&apos;t look like any plane that she had seen before.  We continued to watch it until it disappeared in the distance.  As it got farther away it looked like it was descending but that could&apos;ve been because of the angle it was moving away at.  As it disappeared there was another jet was coming from north of where I last saw the object.  Both jets were also military type jets, in this area were rarely see any commercial jets as the nearest major airport is 100 miles away in Memphis, TN.I&apos;ve never seen a ufo before but have always been interested in them and believe they exist, but I&apos;m very objective when I look at things and if I had the slightest feeling that this was a plane I would never report it.

I looked around at other stars to really make sure it wasn&apos;t my eyes. As I looked around I say a star that was positioned in the triangle that shows up in the sky that normally is not there. It also had a tail. The tails would get long and then short. I watched these for a while to see if they would move or disappear but they were just hovering.

My neighbor figured it was a balloon. However there was no gondola of any kind nor was there an engine or steering mechanism. I also noticed in quick succession two small white objects in the same vicinity moving at varying speeds in a straight line away from the object. Neither my neighbor nor my wife saw these, having believed it was indeed a balloon and therefore losing interest. I alone continued to watch through the binoculars.

We watched this object for awhile. Over the next 15 or 20 minutes the object got a little brighter. It seemed to flash colors from red to green to blue to white and so on especially when viewed through binoculars.... At approximately 1:30 a.m. the witnesses drew my attention to a bright starlike object over the western horizon. This object was also flashing colors and getting brighter, then dimmer, appearing to approach and recede...

We were on Padre Island fishing the canals off of Whitecap Rd.  It was about 10:00 P. M. when we noticed a bright light coming towards us out of the western clear night sky.The light seemed to be hovering or floating as it moved slightly side to side as it moved forward. There was absolutely no sound coming from it and we both waited to hear jet engines or a helicopter noise. Then, as we watched intenly a Navy trainer flew over head and seemed to fly directly towards the hovering light.  As we watched, the light or flying machine took evasive action and did a 90 degree maneuver flying straight up into the clear night sky. We watched the light ascend into the deep blue space until it disappeared.  This was no ordinary flying machine, but I have no doubt it was some kind of advanced flying machine.", "4 criss cross lights that came from ground and moved out towards the sky.

I immediately called my husband and son so they can take a look at it.  We looked thru our binoculars and can clearly see 4 lights 2 blue and 2 white, but sometimes one of the white lights would merge into one of the other lights making it 3 lights.  The lights changed around sometimes forming a triangle, a square, a diamond and other times three lights would line up and the fourth would stand across the them.These lights hovered for several hours moving up and down and to the sides.  I believe it was 4 crafts because of the way the lights moved around but we could see a dark shadow between the lights that implied it may have been one ship and it&rsquo;s lights were moving around it.Eventually the neighbors started noticing the lights and at one point there were about 11 of us outside witnessing the same thing.Eventually the lights moved out of our line of sight and unfortunately we were unable to continue seeing them.", "Low Flying Quiet Object in Sky with 4 Bright White LightsLocation of Object: One object was seen in the sky on the west side of Woodman Drive, near Woodman Drive and East Dorothy Lane in Kettering OH, 45440.

At first, and this happened quickly, there was only one, a green tubular shaped light. Then another slightly behind it. The second light stopped or appeared  behind the first, then the two slowly circled each other without changing orientation. That is to say they were still pointing east.

I couldn&apos;t tell how big or how high they were, I had nothing to reference from. Clear sky, no clouds no moon.

Next, a second craft appeared, and although difficult to see through the trees, appeared identical to the first craft. Suddenly, they began to speed up and for the next 5 minutes approx, they began zig-zagging up, down, with great acceleration. It was almost like they were chasing each other for fun.

I was too late for a pic of the object, but I did get a good shot of the Military style helicopter.. someone said it looked like a next gen.Cobra? Not sure myself.I know, this doesnt mean that what we saw today was &apos;ET&apos;, it just means that we are quite sure it wasnt an airplane, and it was far to low to be a satellite.. ( maybe new sats fly that low, but im not aware of them).so it could have been ours (man-made), or who knows what.. but the fact the this &quot;military&quot; helicopter.. ( thats what im calling it, you can tell me what you think it is, i got a pic of the copter). .. but the fact that that came shortly after.. is interesting, though at the time, the two didnt even click....we knew it wasnt the regular hospital choppers that fly over , but we were wondering why one of those would fly over.

I ran in the house, and ran back out thru the front door where it was headed... and looked, couldnt see it.. i looked out back to phil, and said, where is it? you see it? he said yeah i lookin at it, hurry up... so.. i raann back to where he was... and i couldnt see squat, he tried pointing it out, but it was to far by then. haha, what a clown i am running around with a camera.. LOL  anyway...it was silvery white, maybe about 10 times as high as when planes fly overhead when getting ready to land.... ( best i can describe height)..

I dunno, now that i sit a couple hours later, seeing that weird thing and then the helicopter a little while later was weird/interesting. cool though.hmmm.....Heres the chopper pic not touched, and Ill asdd the blown up one in a few minutes, you guys might have something better to blow it up with, but ill do it anyway.Helicopter pics added.

It had rained and I wanted to see if it was still overcast guessing at whether it might rain again or perhaps in the morning.I saw a streak of light in the western sky and had thought at first it was a bolt of lightning.  However as I continued to view the growing darkness of night I realized that there were silent bright white globe&apos;s or sphere&apos;s with trailing lines of light that simultaneously came out of each direction--north, south, east and west; met in the northern sky spun in a clockwise direction three or four times and then each went back from where they came to start the dance in the twilight over again.These &quot;lights&quot; were not saucer or cylinder shape they were &quot;globes&quot; or &quot;sphere&apos;s&quot; of intensely bright white light they appeared to be as large if not slightly larger than the full moon.  As they traveled from each direction bright white light trailed behind them.  When they met and spun they appeared to look like four &quot;ying and yang&quot; shapes.I live about one to one and a half miles away from several car dealerships which are in the north and I thought to myself that perhaps it was a laser light show used as an advertising tool.  Waterbury, Connecticut is known for its steep hills and valleys so to me it seemed impossible as each globe went to the north south east and west as far as the eye could see; if it was a laser show a hill or valley would get in the way stopping me from seeing its straight continuous path.These &quot;globes&quot; traveled faster than any plane, helicopter or jet that I have ever witnessed in my fifty plus years.I do not drink alcohol and I do not take any illegal substances I was not sleeping before I took my dog outside so I wasn&apos;t dreaming.  I have NEVER seen anything like this.

We lived in Monmouth County, NJ, not far from the Raritan Bay. Our house faced nearly due West. The night was average temperature, not hot, cold or uncomfortable. I am not sure if it was Spring or Autumn, but something tells me it was around September. I remember my Father parking the Dodge Dart in the street because the driveway had a steep upward slope and the walkway was a more comfortable grade. It was late and we were tired.  As we made our way up the walk one of my sisters told us to look above the neighbor&apos;s house on the corner of our street, to the southwest of our house. Above the corner lot was a large craft with white lights, apparently spinning and hovering about 100 feet above a neighbor&apos;s house, diagonally across the street. For reference, if you were to hold your hands out at arms length at the width of a Frisbee, that would be an accurate reference of the craft&apos;s size. It was very large and low to the rooftop. We stood silently watching the saucer for what seemed to be about 5 minutes, then the craft moved directly above us, hovered for a minute, and shot due east over the house amazingly fast, - almost instantaneously. I remember not being able to see the sky while I leaned my head all the way back looking up, not hearing a sound. After the craft flew away, my Father commented &ldquo;It must be some kind of advertisement&rdquo;. We walked inside and nobody said a word about the event for 18 years. Eighteen years later in October, I was with my girlfriend, now my wife, in Long Beach Island, NJ. I remember that we had been dating for 5 years at that time, as we met in November of 1984. A good friend and his parents were loaned a house on the beach for the weekend and we stayed with them. I remember the day very well, the weather was cloudy and warm &ndash; and the water was still a perfect temperature for swimming. The water in NJ doesn&apos;t start turning cold until late October, so I estimate that date as being early October in 1989. That night we went out to dinner near LBI. The conversation turned to UFO&apos;s, and I mentioned for the first time that I had a couple of encounters when I was young. My now-wife and friend didn&apos;t believe me at first because I had never mentioned it to either of them before. In fact, the saucer event was common knowledge at home, but my family never told anyone outside the house about it. It wasn&apos;t because we were shy or embarrassed, it was just that the topic never surfaced. Even writing this is difficult for me since something in the back of my mind is telling me to forget about it - but I can&apos;t. Nor can I forget several other encounters, some of which I still can&apos;t explain. This is the third time I wrote about this encounter in the past year with the intention of sending it to you, but previously deleted it. Anyway, I told everyone my story that night and all were amazed that nobody said a word about it. To this day I can&apos;t explain why we didn&apos;t tell anyone. There were other encounters too, one in which my eldest sister shared with my Father and me. I can detail that story in another form and submit it if this one interests you. The second sighting deals with hieroglyphics circling around a small, gold saucer hovering over the Shrewsbury / Navesink River in Red Bank, NJ. For years it registered as a dream to me, but both my Father and Sister remembered it clearly. My sister still talks about how we tried to understand the letters moving around the craft, but they were different than anything we had ever seen. I know that I have the characters etched in my  memory, somewhere. One looked like lambda, as I recall it now. My stories are truthful accounts that I can&apos;t explain. I have nothing to gain and everything to lose by sharing them. I have live witnesses who remember it clearly. Dad passed away last year, but Mom and my two sisters were there. Dad wouldn&apos;t discuss it anyway since he worked in the Avionics industry, and he had a security clearance. He would definitely lose his job if he talked about the topic. Now that he&apos;s gone there is no risk to him, so I decided to tell the story. There is also a neighbor who still lives at the end of my prior street, and she saw the craft as well. She was terrified when she heard our story. Please keep in mind that I have bosses, co-workers and clients who will drop me like a bad habit if they were to find out who I am. I have no problem sharing my experiences, but I can&apos;t reveal my identity; or for now anyway, I don&apos;t feel very comfortable in doing so. I am licensed Professional Land Surveyor in 2 states. Along with several other creepy encounters there is also an amazing experience, with documented survey data relating to my profession that I can share with you. For now, I only have time to tell about the first encounter.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))", "While on a roof top on 13 th and N streets NW, I imaged a sphere (egg shaped) anomaly shooting a beam of light towards the ground? Imaged with 1080 i HD camera technology.

No noise was heard, image sample is extraordinary!", "Very bright light moved extremely quickly across the sky. Seen again within a few seconds going opposite direction.I was driving into Mt. Airy with another passenger in the car, all of a sudden a very large bright flash of light moved quickly (about 1 second) across the sky from right to left diagonally and then disappear. A few seconds passed and the passenger in the car saw another bright light move diagonally from left to right and then disappear again. This also took place within a second. The light seen was bigger than a car headlight and much brighter. The Verizon tower was down all day long and no one from Verizon had any service, the weather was also noticeably different for this time of year.", "light in the skysaw a round light about 45&apos; over the ocean.

It first looked to be a plane, or maybe a satelite, but it was stationary for at least 15 minutes, but through the binoculars it looked like it was spinning. It also looked like it may have been jumping around a bit. It was emitting red and blue and white lights. After a while it slowly started to move to the right, and then up. I have seen the same object once before about 8 months ago. Very strange.", "White lights over Knoxville TNIt was around 11:30 pm.   My husband was outside on our front porch when he saw them.  He came in and got me to come out and look.  There were white lights that would just appear and look like stars off in the distance in the sky.  They would sit still for a second and then zig zag around and disappear.  Sometimes it was one at a time and sometimes there were 2 at a time.  Once it started out as one light and when it took off, it separated in to 2 separate lights.  They don&rsquo;t leave any kind of trail behind them.  They don&rsquo;t make straight lines either.  They either zig zig or circle around.My husband has seen them once before, but I don&rsquo;t remember the date or time.", "Bright silver cigar-shape ( no visible wings ) moving towards the N.East. viewed over Bangs Lake.On Sunday evening 8/17/08 at about 7:00 pm I was fishing off the public pier at Bangs Lake with my 14 year old son and two other fishermen. The sky was bright and clear with only light clouds overhead. We were facing south when I told my son to look at the large jet (its color scheme was gray with 4 red engines and red tail) that probably took-off from O&rsquo;Hare airport and was just passing over us.That is when I saw much higher up more to the left a bright silver cigar shape traveling from S.West to N.East just below the clouds. I said out loud &quot;look at it, it has no wings!&quot;  So I grabbed my binoculars (7x) from my fishing bucket/chair and stared at it almost straight overhead.It was a silver cigar without wings and was traveling as fast as or faster than a military jet but the next thing that struck me weird is this thing did not produce any vapor trail at all. None.It sped through 2 of the clouds before it was gone from sight in the n.east and it stayed very bright silver until out of my sight. Definitely was not a jet.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I looked up into the sky as I was driving and saw two objects about a half a mile in front of me land distance. I was just coming to the intersection of Vista Del Sol Rd. and Lomaland Rd. to a red light. It was dusk (almost dark) and their was a large thunderstorm coming in from the north. I watched the objects as I was stopped at the stop light. There were two dark (blackish/dark gray) objects floating (best description) across the sky. They stayed the same distance a part as they traveled. They were moving sort of towards the thunderstorm, perpendicular to Vista Del Sol. There movement reminded me of the gyrocopter from the movie the Road Warrior. But they were not gyrocopters I don&rsquo;t think. Their size in relation to their altitude in the sky ruled that out as did their staying the same distance from each other. They sort of looked like they were being towed by something that wasn&rsquo;t there and they were just floating behind. They had no lights and made no sound that I could hear. They didn&rsquo;t appear to be moving that fast. I can not say how high in the sky they were but they didn&rsquo;t appear to be to high. As if a balloon at the edge of your sight or a low flying helicopter or plane but not low enough to see detail.. They appeared to be sort of (aerodynamic motorcycle not German WW II) helmet shaped with some sort of &ldquo;foundation&rdquo; that protruded around the base. They had other protrusions but it was dark so you couldn&rsquo;t make out any detail. It was weird. I turned right on to Lomaland so I could continue observing them. They appeared to start moving at a faster pace as they were getting nearer to the thunderstorm. This is based on the speed they were going at the stop light and where they were in the sky as I proceeded up Lomaland. I wanted to see if other folks thought they were UFOs so I pulled into the first apartment complex on the right. A young man about 14years old was there in the parking lot and I pointed at them and said &ldquo;Do you see those UFOs?&rdquo; He looked up into the sky and his jaw immediately dropped. He turned and ran towards the apartments yelling at his companion that there were UFOs. I drove another 10 or 15 feet into the apartment complex because I saw another guy looking right up at them. I said to him, &ldquo;You see those UFOs right?&rdquo; and he said, &ldquo;Yes I do. I wish I had a camera.&rdquo; I explained quickly that I wish I had my cell phone with me. I pulled up another twenty feet and by this time the objects were moving directly towards the thunderstorm. The thunderstorm was at least 20 miles off to the north. On the other side of El Paso International Airport. Within seconds one disappeared into the storm and then the other. I came home directly after the incident and as I was driving I didn&rsquo;t see anything unusual in the sky. I did see  two planes or copters over the airport as I could see their lights blinking. The whole incident lasted maybe 4 to 7 minutes. I am a 44 year old white male. I am a wildlife biologist. I have a Bachelors degree and will complete my Masters this Winter. I have extensive scientific knowledge and spend much of my time out of doors, in the desert, from March through October many times at night. I am familiar with the southeast and southwest US. My step-son is 13 years old. He is a nature lover and watches cartoons and plays video games. He will be in the 7 th grade this year.", "inverted objects in Upstate New YorkWhile traveling  east on rounte 17 I observed three  large oval objects that flew in and out of the clouds that were over the river  flowing in the same direction as route  17. The objects were observed flying from south to north . The best description I can offer would be fan blades spinning in reverse directions.  Very fast, they were flying through and through the the clouds. Inverting over and over again. All three dis this a few times before they disappeared before they just disappeared.", "Daylight sighting of very large and bright starlike object moves then disappears after 40 min. observationAs it has been my new custom for the past three months to spend my evenings laying in my backyard pool relaxing, birdwatching, and watching the sunset on every clear sky evening possible; I was doing the same yesterday (08/22/2008).While sky gazing at 7:15 PM yesterday, I noticed a very bright object in the sky due South of my residence in Westlake, LA at the 3 o&rsquo;clock position in the sky. The object looked similar to a star, except it appeared to be about ten times larger and brighter than any star or planet that I have ever witnessed in my many years of sky watching. It should be noted that sunset this evening was at 7:46 PM and normally stars would not start to appear until about 30 minutes after sunset. (This &ldquo;star&rdquo; was out about an hour early with the sun still shining brightly). I watched the object for several minutes and it appeared to be stationary. I then went into the house and got my binoculars to have a better look at it and still it appeared to look only like a extremely large star. However, due to the size of the object and the way it appeared in the sky I would say that the object appeared to be high in the sky but not beyond the atmosphere.At 7:30 PM, I called my wife out of the house to witness the unusual day light &ldquo;star&rdquo;.I continued to watch the &ldquo;star&rdquo; until 7:55 PM (a total of 40 minutes) and to the eye it appeared stationary, but apparently it was slowly moving to the West as it was now clearly located directly South West (a 45 degree change in direction), but still at the 3 o&rsquo;clock position in the sky. At this point, the very bright clearly seen &ldquo;star&rdquo; got fuzzy and appeared to be starting to pull apart and quickly faded away against the cloudless sky. About a minute after the &ldquo;star&rdquo; faded away, an Air Force B-52 flew directly over my house at a low altitude flying South Westerly and flew exactly past the last position of the large daylight &ldquo;star&rdquo; that had just faded away. I had called my wife back out of the house to witness that the &ldquo;star&rdquo; was now gone, as the B-52 aircraft passed overhead. It should be noted that this is first time that I have ever witnessed a B-52 in flight since leaving the military in 1982. I believe that the closest active military air base to my home in 200 miles to the North in Shreveport, LA and any military aircraft in our area is somewhat rare.I remained outside to document the time that readily recognized &ldquo;normal&rdquo; stars start to appear with the first dim star appearing at 8:00 PM and the second at 8:15 PM. The extremely large and bright daylight &ldquo;star&rdquo; that faded away against a clear sky never reappeared in the sky by the time I ended my watch at 10:00 PM last night.For the record, this is my second UFO report filed with the NUFORC.  The first and more spectacular event occurred near Kinder, LA in May 1977.", "Reflective Spinning object high over Sunriver, Oregon. 8/3/2008I was watching our local glider rides guy and I spotted this sparkling thing in the sky to the west of Sunriver.  I grabbed the video camera and shot over 15 minutes of video.  I watched this object for over 45 minutes.  It started to the west of Sunriver out over the Cascades, moved to the South East over LaPine, then headed due North over Bend.  It was way up there.  I saw a jet flying which I guessed was at 30-36 thousand feet and this object was over twice as high.  You can see in the video I shot that the object is spinning and has somewhat of an irregular shape.

Was walking east to west carrying my sleeping daughter and I just happened to look up to the west towards downtown Los Angeles And there was a huge rectangular object I could say vertically on top of East Los angeles, I thought the fog was covering the moon but the stars behind it were visible and even some at low altitude.I can only describe its size as possibly as both twin towers put together in height and length. It was not glowing, it seen it was only reflecting the lights of the city so it looked pale in color. I walked in the to house to put my daughter to bed and to get a camera but when I came back out it was gone", "Second sighting of same object two nights later.  Round, white lights with red and green flashing lights.Second sighting two nights later.  At approximately 21:00 on 9/21/08, a second sighting was seen in approximately the same spot in the western sky.  I called my husband to observe and we both watched it in the binoculars.  It had the same erratic movements horizonally left and right, vertically up and down, and in small circles.  It was a round sphere, with white lights and flashing red and green lights this time.  We watched it for about 10 minutes.  I call the local Sheriff and they told me they couldn&apos;t do anything about something in the sky and basically blew me off, not even bothering to take my name or ask any questions.", "I went outside for my afternoon break and happened to look up and see a shiny object traveling thru the sky.  Of course my first thought was it must be a plane.  It was traveling at a leisurely pace from the northeast to the southwest. I observed it from tree line to tree line.I looked at it intensely and could see no wings or protrusions of any kind, and determined that it was a disc shape with a domed top. The sky was very clear and there was also a small plane in another part of the sky that I could look at for comparison.  It was a little higher in the sky than the plane, but appeared to be approximately the same size.This looked nothing like the plane. It was very shiny white/silver and as mentioned before no wings, or tail, or rudder.  It traveled from tree line to tree line, so I saw it from different angles. It went behind the trees and I could no longer see it. It made no sound and as before I could hear the plane", "P.A. sightings /frequent  in small valley of Quiggleville, Cogan StationSaw white lights with red lazer line flashing between, very large as was low to tree lines.. When one would be flying above head it seemed to multiply for there were suddenly 2 then 3 more apearing out of nowhere... criss cossing and circling around each other then proceeding straight out of sight like on a normal flight path..but much larger, faster, and encircling to be normal planes.. Once overhead they appeared triangular in shape, although the outline of the craft was faintly seen..When one would rise/descend behind the treelines three or four more would suddenly appear from nowhere, fly tward the treelines, then take off.. At one point, a tiny version of the big/little dipper appeared above the treelines.. Very Bright!!!.. But like a tear in the middle, and these craft appeared to be comming out of that.. Larger than normal White flickery stars have been all around this region for months.. There one night and not another.. two or three at a time.. Sometimes still, sometimes rising up and vanishing.. Never any noise involved.. Last night was the 1st time we saw the individual crafts all over though.. It was just a feeling like &apos;ok..now we&apos;ve seen and know we can believe something is not right in the world&apos;.. But we will not contact authorities because what can anyone do anyhow?.. Although if this incident happens again, we will let neighbors know for it is their right...When these would get near to above us , the phone would shut off..(I was talking to my husband about what to do..)The sound of Electricity was faintly heard every time they were popping out...Aprox. every 3 minutes.. This went on for an hour..Thank you..", "a round object, with a loud noise and two green lights on the top, spinning, It was there and just like that it was goneMy 14 yr old daughter was getting up for school and heard a loud noise outside.  She looked out her window and there was a round object with two green lights out of the top of it and they, the lights were rotating.  On her way to school a girl on the bus said she had seen something this morning and my daugher waited until she described it.  It was the exact same thing she had seen.  I don&apos;t know how to explain any of this too her.  She is a bit frightened.  Do we call the news or not?", "Dividing object over San Fernando 9/21/08 followed by two jets...Hi I would like to report a sighting from yesterday 9/21/08  I was on vacation for the weekend with my Husband at my brother in law&rsquo;s house, San Fernando Valley, California.At aprox 3:15 we saw in the sky, very high up a silver/chrome colored object was sitting still in the air. Very slowly it started to move in our direction. The object was moving too slow for an airplane. The object appeared to be splitting into two separate objects and then appeared to re-form. It also had almost looked like it was radiating heat as there was a slight ripple like effect surrounding it...As the object slowly moved acorss the sky we saw two jets, one in front of the other fly close to this object as if in some kind of formation to observe whatever this object was.About 30 minutes later the object was still moving slowly and we noticed a pink balloon object drift past the &ldquo;UFO&rdquo; in the opposite direction. So the balloon type object was following the wind direction and the &ldquo;UFO was traveling in the opposite direction, thus confirming for me that the &ldquo;UFO&rdquo; was not a balloon and too slow to be an airplane and much to high to be either a helicopter or a blimp (which it bore no resemblance to anyways) the pink balloon type object almost looked like it was shriveling the &ldquo;UFO&rdquo; as were the jets.All this time the object appeared to be dividing and re-forming.We (my husband, sister in-law and myself) all observed this object for at least 40minutes in which this time it had made a slightly curved course across the sky. I would be very interested if there have been any similar sightings to this one from yesterday and would be very interested in hearing you r opinion. I also called your hotline and left my telephone number, I would be more than happy to talk.", "Honestly, I have never believed in the possibility of UFO&rsquo;s.  That was until tonight.  What I saw is the craziest thing I have ever seen in my life.  I was standing behind my apartment and clearly saw something.  It was circular and was in a cylindrical tube of blue light.  The circular portion was yellow and very bright.  At first I thought it was a shooting star.  The only reason I believe otherwise is because whatever this was slowed down and then disappeared into some clouds.  I feel crazy writing this, but maybe there is some truth to sightings.", "Bright light seen hovering over the western skies of El Paso, TX follwed by smaller lights.Saw one bright light hovering over the western skies of El Paso, TX, disappeared after 10 to 15 minutes then saw smaller colorful lights (blue and red) moving diagnoly were the place of the bright light was before for about 5 minutes.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

Sure enough a long V shape-like how geese fly in the shy when flying away for the season-but there was no sounds coming for it. It was also see though with a pitch white color and very dim lights. There was no tail of dust like a plane no sounds of aircraft. It was scary and creepy", "My family saw a ufo in a distance over the hills and then in a instant it was over us and our home.I dont want to be exposed to the public or exploited. It was terrifying because we didnt know how to protect our family and keep them out if they wanted into our home. I hope you dont think I am crazy when I tell you what happened but I swear to you, its all true. Occasionally our kids still talk about it but none of us shared it because people would never believe it and we would be made to look like fools. Being a skeptic before the incident I know exactly how that would go.Here is what happened. We lived in a new developement in Lexington near Kelso washington. Our home sat in a field alone, and it was very dark. One night around 10:30pm or so we were watching tv in the family room and I noticed my husband kept looking out the sliding glass door into the sky. I asked what was he looking at. He pointed to a light in the sky over the top of the hills in a distance. It did appear to be holding still. Then all at once a smaller light dropped out from the bottom of it and headed downward and to the left. We watched and I made fun of my husband saying &quot;oooh its a UFO!&quot; and I flashed our porch light off and on for probably 10 seconds in the SOS pattern. The light instantly shot over from a tiny dot in the sky to right over us- something so damned bright it blinded us. Our daughter started to cry and hid under a blanket on the couch yelling no, make it stop! It was giant and looked like a big cross of light. I held my hand over my eyes squinting trying to look at it for just a second and started to cry and slammed the sliding glass door shut and locked it and turned off all the lights in our house trying to hide from &quot;it&quot;. but my husband and one son ran outside and stood underneath this thing. I was begging them to come in and not do that. It was so big. It covered our yard and home. It was so bright like no other light I have ever seen. Just writing about it for the first time makes me feel like crying. I have never been so scared. I didnt know what it wanted or what it would do. I was afraid it would hurt my sons and husband.It made no noise. It didnt move. It just hovered over us. We couldnt see anything else. No sky, no trees nothing just the light.  After what seemed like hours but was maybe one minute it retracted back up to the sky. It moved so fast that it was there and then it zoomed away in just a flash it was a tiny light again in the distance.We were all shook up. I held our daughter and comforted her. The boys wanted me to hold them close too. Our little girl and the two boys wanted to sleep in our bedroom with us. We put a sleeping bag on our floor for our daughter and told the boys to sleep with the doors open from their room to ours. I feel so bad now looking back. I should have piled them all into my bedroom.We fell asleep and woke to hear our boys screaming and banging on our door. I ran to their room and they were both shouting at the same time. I couldnt understand at first. Soon my husband came in to see what was going on.They described a bright light like a flame coming to their bedroom window and then a person type thing with long arms, but it was short, was just there in their bedroom. The dog &quot;bumper&quot; barked at it. It just stood there looking at them. The boys said they were screaming as loud as they could but neither our daughter or either of us woke. They said it was almost the second we had gone to bed. It makes no sence. why didnt we hear them screaming? The boys realized we were not coming to help them and One of our sons told the other on the count of three they were going to run past it to our room and get us. They said the &quot;thing&quot; just moved from the closet area to the end of the bed without moving its limbs. Like flash, it was here then flash it ws there. The boys were screaming for us and we couldnt hear it! Our bedrooms across the hall from theirs. It doesnt make any sence that we could not hear them. Im a light sleeper and had just crawled into bed. We never could make sence of it. They woke us up by banging on our bedroom door which we had left open, but somehow it was closed!! Even then we had a really hard time waking up to get to the door. It sounds crazy , but its true. So I got up and went to their room. I thought maybe they were making a joke or something. I felt really confused and dazed, and I didnt even believe them. I calmed them down and they slept on my floor beside our daughter for the remainder of the night. Later I felt just horrible about it because the next morning they were still all excited and upset and showed me their bedroom window. ( our home was two story and their bedroom faced the hills where the ufo came from.) their window had a burned hole in the screen and the siding of the house had a burn on it. there was ash inside their windowsill.  I brushed the ash into a baggy and was going to submit it to someone. We talked about it and I was afaid of ending up in some National Inquirer magazine or something horrible. We kept our mouth shut but the trama of it has never left any of us! . It too k about a week for the kids to sleep in their room. I felt so vulnerable. We called someplace and talked on the phone to someone who investigates ufo sighting because we wanted to know how to keep the beings out of our home. We never followed up because as I said before we didnt want to be exploited and our kids to suffer any further than they had already.I am pretty sure that I still have the baggy somewhere. I kept the ash.It IS okay to e-mail if you have questions, but its not okay to send some reporter or do anything to cause my family harm.Sincerely,", "as soon as we all saw the light, a blanket of light, then black showed under it and it disappeard.2 of my friends and I were sitting in a hot tub watching the stars.  One friend said what is that. She described it as a long skinny star that blinked.  None of us could see it.  We kept telling her it was a cluster of stars or a sattlelight. But she said when it lit up, it was faded and if it were a cluster stars, why would they all blink? So I moved to her side of the hot tub and had her point out where it was in coordinance to the little dipper, and she said 12:00. Then the other girl and I saw it.  As soon as we all were saying that is weird, a big flash happend under it and went black.

The conditions were clear with out a cloud in the sky.The first set of lights seen were 3-5 varying bright white lights moving very fast horizontally, faster then any commercial or military jet I have ever seen, northerly in a diagonal formation. The lights suddenly stopped and remained still for 10 &ndash; 15 seconds and then moved vertically straight up into the sky, again very fast. They stopped once again and then proceeded to move horizontally to the south only to stop again and move diagonally downward to the north again. This movement repeated again and again and each time lasted about 5-10 minutes. The lights would be bright and fade and get bright again. At the end of the last sequence the lights got very bright, separated, and each went in different directions and were gone from sight.The second set of lights was 3 bright orange spheres and either all were lit at once or they would alternate illuminating in a sequence. These lights were moving in a horizontal direction toward the south. They would move extremely fast and then stand still illuminating and fading out either gradually or all at once. They continued toward the south appearing and disappearing 3-5 times and then immediately changed direction moving back to the north while still illuminating in the same manner. They reached the point we first saw them and again disappeared only to re-appear again much further south in a matter of less than a minute. This sighting continued for almost an hour and then stopped.", "black survival knife shaped object seen over orlando floridaThis craft was seen in one position for 6 hours long.

Through binoculars it appeared high in the sky as we could see birds which appeared to be at the same height much clearer.  It was an indeterminate color and either possessed it own source of light or was reflecting light from the sun, i.e. it appeared to glow brighter and dimmer. Although moving slowly, and at times changing course it was hard to keep a bead on it.  During my best visual of this object it appeared to be separate round balls of light.  It also had what looked like a black line trailing at the bottom.  My guess is that it might be a released bunch of silver Mylar balloons, the black line, however was not wavy as a string for balloons would be suspended in air.

The color went for white to bright orange and then a dark orange then red as it accelerated towards us.I then phoned my parents that live close and asked them to look at the lights.I went back out to scanned the sky and spotted  2 bright white lights travelling to and fro changing directions instantaneously, at times they travelled together other times appearing to change positions with each other in a lose formation as they travelled across the sky.They disappeared for about 10 seconds then reappeared this time there was a total of 4 the color of the 4 was light orange.The four then flew away into the horizon, as they travelled together they appeared to change the shape of the formation every few seconds.I went inside the house and received a phone call, my parents said that what they thought was a stationary white star all of a sudden flew away changing colours.The activity stopped after the white star left.", "3 UFO over Los AngelesThe day after the incident of 9-11 where all planes were grounded and military jets were protecting our skies I spotted 3 copper colored disk shape craft with a yellow glow in the center flying in a flying v formation about 500-600 feet above my house These craft were going super slow headed north and making no noise at all, almost as if they were flying low to not be detected by radar, me, my brother and father spotted these craft, after about 10 minutes or so we noticed the military jets going into afterburner ...these jets very high in the sky but i noticed because of the loud noise they made and change of speed obviously, My belief is they might have spotted these craft and attempted to chase it,nonetheless I am totally convinced UFO&apos;s exist.", "Extremely Bright White object, Just like we saw at the beginning of the year, in Houston, when thousands saw it!Very very very bright white, moved very fast from south to north, then stopped quickly and hovered for a few minutes, descended slightly, then moved slowly to the west, over the Addicks reservoir (to the west of us) and disappeared.  I did see hints of other colors, but very dim in comparison.  The movements made it impossible to be a helicopter, plane, or anything known to the public that I&apos;m familiar with.  No sound either.  We have been watching the sky a lot since hurricane Ike. Unbelievable bright, the brightest thing I&apos;ve seen except, for when we saw the same exact thing from the same vantage point, in January I think, and then we saw the news that thousands all over texas had seen them, and people in houston saw the same thing we did, that&apos;s why I&apos;m reporting it this time.", "2 witnesses see a yellow light fly across the sky from Nipomo, CA at 1 in the morning on  08/13/2008.Me and my buddy were hanging out in the mountains in Nipomo, there is only 1 or 2 homes around us but other than that the area is pretty isolated from civilization making it one of our favorite spots to relax. It was around 1 o&apos;clock in the morning, we were cooking hot dogs over a fire pit and enjoying ourselves. I noticed a bright, yellow, disk shaped light flying through the night sky, it was about 10 or 20 miles away and about 10,000 to 25,000 feet high. As soon as i saw it i told my friend &quot;Look&quot; and i pointed towards the night sky. We observed this thing fly through the air, it didn&apos;t turn or make any erratic maneuvers, it maintained a straight trajectory.When we first saw it it didn&apos;t make any noise, it went straight and seemingly changed to a blue color or emitted a bright blue light and soon after that happened it dropped an object. So there is this bright yellow light flying across the dark horizon and there is a blinking smaller yellow light under it thats falling towards the earth. By this time the object was emitting a sound similar to maybe a sonic boom or a passenger jet flying overhead. The object continued to fly across the horizon while the smaller blinking object continued to lose altitude, the objects grew farther and farther apart. The loud, jet engine like sound we heard faded away and the smaller blinking object kind of faded away in some fog that was very far from our location. The original, larger light kept flying until it became to faint to see.It was pretty foggy that night, we saw everything happen after the fog cleared up around us but the objects seemed to disappear into the foggy night that surrounded the city of Nipomo, it left a smoke trail behind it. Please keep in mind that it was extremely hard to determine how high and how far this object was. It seemed like it was almost flying above Nipomo but I&apos;m not positive about that. I&apos;m pretty skeptical that this object is a UFO. I think this object is man made, perhaps a rocket of some kind going in to space, or maybe a satellite reentering earths atmosphere. I don&apos;t know what it is but it scared the hell out of us. An explanation would be great.  -If you are investigating this and you have any questions/comments/explanations please contact me via email. Also, I began filming the object after it dropped a smaller object, if you would like to see some footage of the object contact me via email", "Flying wing observed in pennsylvania on september 14 2008Walking home from a party three people observed what appeared to be a flying wing.  It seamed ragged in appearance, and was flying fairly close to the ground.  It made no noise, and its shape did not fluctuate.  It appeared initially to be two birds flying together, but there was no flapping of wings.  When it was first sighted, the object was parallel to the horizon, but shifted to perpendicular after about two minutes.  The object was observed through 7x binoculars but was, at that point, two far away to be identified.  The object was not moving in a decaying trajectory, thus ruling out a falling item.  It made no sudden accelerations, and exhibited no lights.  After about three minutes of observation the object disappeared behind the trees.  The object seemed to be about 12 feet long ad three feet wide.  No further observations were made.((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.  PD))", "Lights over Davie FloridaI was driving home at around 10:55 pm and I saw 7-10 amber colored lights in the sky over in the Flamingo Rd and 595 area. They were in a diagonal line and I thought they were way too low to be airplanes, and nothing was blinking either.  They seemed to be hovering in place.  I drove home to get my family and we went back out there, but by the time we got back (10 minutes), they was nothing there.  Over the next week, I talked to 2 more people that saw the same thing on the same night.", "Bright Orange Light over Ottawa RiverBright orange rectangle seen over Ottawa River while crossing Champlain Bridge.  We drove down street parallel to river, and it had already disappeared.", "Three moving craft near Lowry.Three craft came into formation, moved in different directions, hovered, then flew into the clouds.", "Unidentified Bright cylindrical object in the skyMy husband and I were returning from a movie in the next town over. As I was driving, I noticed a strangely bright light over to my right. Because I was driving and could not stay focused on it I casually mentioned it to my husband (knowing if it was just a plane he would quickly settle the subject as he is very pragmatic) He continued to watch it quietly so I kept trying to grab glimpses to see it as well.We began a discussion of what it might be: a big star??? =No, too big and close, a satellite? =No it was not moving across the sky and again seemed too close and too big...a planet?= nodefinately too big ...a plane? =No it had no other colored lights and was not growing larger or smaller during the duration of the drive like a plane flying toward you might.We were very calm and curious but both fully attentive. I pulled into the drive way and went to look where we had seen it before and it was not there but as I turned back to lock the doors of the car I realized it was now front and center above the tree line before me.Now,I was fully awake. We stood watching it for a bit. There was absolutely no sound. It appeared to be a reflectively bright metal, very roundish with a slight bluish tint. We both remained calm but my husband suggested we go inside and get a camera and binoculars. We turned to do so and saw a bluish light coming from our computer room=which would not be strange except that my husband turns things off obsessively (he is forever accidently locking me in and out of places or turning things like the TV off when I am in the bathroom) So I assure you the computer was turned off when we left for work that morning and no one was in the house all day =to our knowledge. Now we were both unsettled. We went inside quietly and brought out the camera and the binoculars. The object had moved only slightly in what I would liken to the movement that one experiences in an ocean tide...as if it were treading water and had to actively move a bit to stay in place. The camera with a telephoto lens could not pick up any details more than the naked eye but the binoculars gave me enough to reiterate that it appeared to be a craft of metal in the shape of a cylinder on end or a roundish object. I could not see any &quot;spinning&quot; or movement of the craft itself. Given the camera lens was not strong enough and the binoculars were =the distance to teh object might be estimated I would think.My husband suggested that we go inside. Both of us were on edge and when we went into the computer room. The computer was on and my husband asked if I smelled something. He thought it smelled like body odor but I felt it was more an electrical smell with biological undertones to it. The room next over also had a slightly strange scent. We then took a heavy metal flash light and walked the entire house from attic to basement and found nothing else disturbed and Thank God found nothing &ldquo;unusual&rdquo; in the house.We did not check on the light again as we both thought it best just to lock all of the doors and quietly go to bed and leave well enough alone.  Although I am as curious as most about UFOs and have pondered things I have seen in the sky before this was the first encounter that I have had that warrants any comment.We are pretty average people. We are both employed in corporations and work hard. We have 4 children who were all out of town at the time.", "UFO knocks out Comcast???Was working at home alone on some computers, and noticed they started going haywire.  Noticed a dreadful feeling in my gut.  Felt like something bad was happening... and thought I saw some things move in the room.  That was enough to make me want to call my brother who was at a friend&apos;s house.  As I picked up the phone I found that my comcast phone was dead.  Used cell phone to call him.  He promptly headed over to my place.  Upon arriving he announced to me that he&apos;d seen a UFO with bright lights on his way up the hill to my house... blue and red flying over the neighborhood.  He said it was the size of a boeing 777.  Called comcast when the phone line finally came back.  A computer voice at comcast said that they were aware of an outage and were working to repair the problem.Anyway, the craft was visible to him for a few seconds before it darted away at a very high rate of speed and vanished.", "A set of 5-7 unknown lights flash over the city of adelaide, australia.i was sitting outside the house at around midnight when i see a set of 5-7 lights flash in the air...at first i thought they were fire crackers but the light kept climbing and moving in the sky....it travled all the way from above my house to the other side and gradually faded....it coould not have been airplanes bcuz i did not hear any sound of the flight....nor was it a shooting star as the lights kept moving for a good 4min duration...it also left behind a good long trail of light...cloud like..", "WE SAW A GLOW AND THEN A CRAFT TO THE RIGHT OF THE GLOW IN THE CLOUDS.RETURNING FROM DINNER WE CROSSED THE HAMMOCK DUNES BRIDGE HEADING WEST AND SAW A GLOW IN THE CLOUDS AND JUST TO THE RIGHT OF GLOW WE SAW A CIGAR TYPE CRAFT OF SORTS WITH LIGHTED WINDOWS IN THE CENTER OF CRAFT.

I consider myself to be an experienced aircraft spotter having been involved with aviation for close to fifteen years. On the night in question, I was sitting on my back porch, it faces southeast, I sit out there at night sometimes and watch air traffic line up coming from the south with their landing lights fully on, flying north in direction. These are usually flights that are going to be landing into Dallas Love Field, in this instance there was what looked to be two aircraft in line probably about five to six miles in trail, the strange thing about it all, was the aircraft bringing up the rear was closing the distance way faster than it should have been, so I turned my attention to the lead aircraft or what I thought was an aircraft. This was a very unusual light, I couldn&rsquo;t tell at first but as it got closer I could tell this object was not an aircraft and they were not landing lights, it was the shape of an orb or sphere and orange in color, there is a navigational aid or VOR station that aircraft on this route use, its about three miles south of my home. Once an aircraft intercepts this station they turn northwest, the object in question seemed to stop in midair in the area of this turn point, it appeared the trailing aircraft had to make an early turn to avoid the object, once the trailing aircraft was parallel with object, the object just disappeared right in front of my eyes. I&rsquo;ve seen some strange things in skies over the years that can&rsquo;t explain, but this one tops them all.", "Yukon Territory bright sphere bounced along skyline for 24 minutes - sped off.In the fall of 1993 in the Yukon Territory of Alaska I was driving back from the Beaufort Sea heading south on the Dexter Highway at 3:00 a.m.  I was at 63 degrees N by 135 degrees W.In the rear view mirror I noticed a bright yellow round light bouncing along the skyline.  I stopped my car and turned off the engine.  I got out of the car and watched it for 24 minutes as timed by my Timex watch.This light bounced along the skyline and then sped away.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

Sunset was at 7:11 and I was situated at Latitude: 35&deg;32&apos;4.77&quot;N and Longitude: 117&deg;32&apos;43.80&quot;W. I got my camera gear out and got it all set up so that I could be ready for anything. I sat down in my easy chair until it was time for the stars to start showing themselves to the world. One by one they appeared. If you are not fast while you are watching for the stars, they will sneak up on you.Looking at the First Quarter Moon that was to the south of my vantage point, there was a bright star/planet that showed up to the east of the moon, and just a little higher in the night sky compared to the moon. It was very bright and steady. I turned around only to find a brighter star/planet on the horizon where the sun had just set. When I turned back around, there was a second star even farther east of the star that was near the moon!  It too was bright. I started my scan around the heavens to see what was appearing and by the time I got back to the bright star/planet east of the moon, I noticed something very odd. The star/planet to the left of the one that was near the moon was now GONE. One minute it was there and the next minute it was gone. I know it was not a plane as it just sat there in one place when I first noticed it.As the evening progressed, I noticed two objects passing on by. One of them looked like it was headed towards LA and about a half hour later I saw one that was headed north away from LA. Ordinarily I would suspect that they were planes, but there were no strobes on these two objects that looked like stars passing in the night sky. Even though there was no strobe to them, I just noted them as planes. Same speed, no deviation whatsoever.It was about 8:30pm when I looked to the north and off the big dipper to the right, I noticed this light. This light started to get very bright and all of a sudden, I had surmised that this thing was coming right at me. It just kept on getting bigger and bigger. I turned around and grabbed my camcorder and stand as a complete unit, and when I turned back around, I had to say to myself, what is the use. It, by the time I turned around started to get smaller again. So I just stood there watching it as it eventually disappeared.  This object did not go up, go down, go from side to side or anything. It was as if there was a very high candle power light that was being turned up and then back off. This lasted for about 15 seconds. I have no idea what it was, but I can finally say: I have seen something in the nights sky that makes no sense to me. Twice&hellip; In one night&hellip; A disappearing planet and a light that made no sense.I just wish I had someone with me to see what I saw", "Two fighter airplanes, assigned to inspect a white-dot cluster, suddenly disappear off radar, and then the cluster also disappears.Unusual UFO recording at Project Blue Book  In 1955, as part of a publishing team from Bantam Books who had published a book on UFO&apos;s, I was invited to the &quot;inner sanctuary&quot; of Project Blue Book. We were shown many interesting photos, but the most stunning experience came from a radar recording. A radar record showed a number of white dots moving in formation high in the sky over Washington, D.C. Then two fighter airplanes were ordered up to investigate. We watched as they approached closer and closer to the cluster of about 5 or 6 white lights. Suddenly, the radar dots of the planes disappeared. Then, in just a few seconds, the white-lights cluster suddenly moved upward at great speed, and quickly disappeared off of radar altogether.  We sat there in stunned silence--and then the questions and unhappy answers. No, the planes and the pilots were never found. No wreckage. Only conclusion possible: they had been captured by the UFO&apos;s, pilots and planes, in toto. No, the relatives were not told the truth. They had been told that the fighers had disappeared way out in the Atlantic Ocean. And No--you cannot tell the truth, either.  You have been sworn to silence, and you must stick to that. Otherwise, you might stir up a hellish wave of panic. That&apos;s it. Have never mentioned the event for the 53 years between then and 2008, when I thought it was finally time to reveal the event to Peter Davenport at the National UFO Reporting Center, in Seattle, Washington.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.
