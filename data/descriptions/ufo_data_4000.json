["I happened to look out my back window and was shocked to see a huge triangular shaped craft at a very high altitude.I was in the Air Force for five years,but must say that the object I saw that day was unlike anything I had ever seen before.It was partly cloudy with some cummulous clouds but large clear areas.I happened to {for some reason}to look out the back window of the house,and spotted a huge triangular object at a very high altitude moving at what must have been a tremendous rate of speed.By the time I excitedly ran from the bedroom to the livingroom to tell my wife and son about the object{a distance of about ten yards}knowing it would pass by our large window,apparantly the object passed,as I only saw a mettallic glint as the sunlight reflected off it.I have seen many,many jets,both millitary and commercial fly at high altitudes;we are blessed with many clear,cloudless days here,especially in the wintertime.The difference was the comparative size of the object I saw and a jet at approximately the same altitude.I had a casual interest in UFO&apos;s prior to seeing the object,skeptical at best,but what I saw that afternoon literally made the hair on the back of my neck stand on end.Amazing.", "((NUFORC:  Planetary conjunction.  Please see other reports for this date.))Two, possibly three comet-like objects in the nighttime western sky.  Appeared motionless and looked exactly like comets.Two close together comet-like objects hanging motionless in the sky.  Brief memory of a third farther away from the first two noticed.  I have seen a small number of UFO like manifestations in my past and study about them often so after the images did not move or change in any way after a short time I simply shrugged and walked back into the house.", "An object that looked like a star until it moved.On the Oceancoming back from GermanyWent up topside to have a cigarette when two G.I.`s in front of me were discussing it. One said he reported it and was told not to say anything. They didn`t know I was standing behind them. I was looking at the star`s and one of them appeared to move , then stop dead. I watched this for a while and became convinced it was tracking the ship. It would stop and after a while it would move again. It moved so fast and stopped so fast, even then I knew there was not any aircraft that could do that. When I tried to discuss it with the 2 G.I.`s they wouldn`t say anything .", "At 11:20 PM as I saw a triange shaped object with 7 red lights moving slowly to the south.At 11:20 PM as I was preparing to go to work I overheard two police officers on my scanner talking about an object in the sky over 3500 West.  I went outside and saw an object that had 7 red lights that was in the form of a triangle.  There were no flashing lights and I heard absolutely no noise coming from the craft. The object was moving in a southern direction very slowly.  I got in my car and drove over to the Triple Stop Gas Station and watched the object continue to move south into Davis County.  I informed some of my co-workers about what I saw.  The next day in the Ogden Standard Examiner Newspaper it was reported that a number of people saw this object and called the Ogden Airport.  According to the Newspaper the Airport Staff reported this object was a comet.  A statement which I and I am sure all others who saw the object would dispute for it was moving to slow and was clearly not a comet.", "Huge object. At least 2 football fields long. Altitude approx. 500 ft. Observed moving slowly westerly direct. No lights. No sound. Underlit by city lights.My sighting took place in the early seventies, in Salinas, California.  I think I was about 15 or so.  It late and I didn&apos;t feel like going to bed, so I decided to do some stargazing.  I grabbed a soda, and tossed a folding chaise lounge chair up onto the garage roof to lay back on.  After being up there for a short time, I noticed movement in the eastern sky.  It was not a moving point of light that I saw, but rather an area of stars being blocked out by a huge object moving slowly across the night sky.  At first I thought it was a blimp, but quickly dismissed this when I realized that it was much too large.  The best way to describe the object is to say that it looked much like a naval battleship turned upside down, only a little more rounded at the ends.  It displayed no lights of it&apos;s own, but I was able to observe the underside as it had become dimly lit by the city lights.  The thing that was really weird about this craft, was the fact that it moved in total silence.  At one point, it was no more than 500 feet almost directly above me. I heard nothing from it.  The object continued moving slowly in a westerly direction towards the ocean, and disappeared from sight.     I am 42 years old, married 18 years, and the father of six.  Up until now, the only people I&apos;ve told of this were my parents, my wife and kids, and my best friend.  I&apos;m not saying that I&apos;ve ever been abducted, but when I think back, there were some pretty weird things that happened to me during my childhood.  I can remember being scared in the middle of the night, and getting out of bed.  I remember looking down the darkened hallway, and seeing a small figure backlit at the end of the hall.  I remember the figure appearing startled.  I didn&apos;t recall anything after that, and dismissed it as a dream. When I awoke in the morning.  Another time, I awoke in the middle of the night to see a small hooded figure kneeling by my bed.  When I moved, the figure stood up.  It was wearing a long, hooded robe, much like what a monk would wear.  In ! the darkness, I could not see a face.  This really freaked me out, and I snatched the covers up over my head.  The next morning, I asked my parents if either of them had checked on me during the night.  They said they had not.  My mom said that maybe it was an angel, so that&apos;s what I told myself to keep sane as I grew up.  The last weird thing I&apos;d like to mention about my childhood, is a small metallic object I noticed under the skin of my outer thigh.  I say it was metallic, as it was just under the skin to the point where I could tell it was grey metal color.  I don&apos;t remember how it got there.  I remember telling my friends that it was there from getting shot with a pellet gun, and that he pellet was still there, although in fact, I was never shot.  the small &quot;thing&quot; is gone now, and there is no scar.  I&apos;ve never really put all this weird stuff together until the last 10 or 15 years.  I kind of look at it as all being pretty circumstantial.  I have, and do experience sleep paralysis from time to time.  I know what that is.  REALLY scary, but I don&apos;t remember being beamed up to a mothership or any of that stuff.  I&apos;ve lived a pretty normal, relatively uneventful life.  I&apos;ve got some baggage, like most people do, but nothing related to my sighting and the few unexplained occurrences of my childhood.  I don&apos;t think I&apos;m an abductee or anything.  If I am, I don&apos;t think I want to know the details !", "A white flash of light moving east to west stopped for one second in the shape of a green rectangle with round corners.  Then It proceeded to travel, very quickly, vertically and to the east back into a white flash.The visibility that night was very clear due to a Santa ana condition.  While working outside close to the border on the U.S. side,  I observed a white flash traveling from the east to west over the southern hills of Tijuana.  It looked similar to a meteor.  Altough, it stopped in the shape of a rectangle with round corners.  It had a bright green color emiting from it, but it was also &quot;fuzzy&quot; looking.  Then after about a second, it traveled at an angle vertically and to the east back into a white flash. It was very interesting, because I listen to Art Bell and a listener called stating that there was UFO activity in the skies over Tijuana.  I disproved that statement due to the fact I work outside near Tijuana and I hadn&apos;t seen a thing.  Well, now I think I believe it. I would rather not be exact on what I do or my background.

On the ground the object spins around several times very fast with the 2 beams of lights turning back up into the sky at about 45 degee angle The lights go out,and nothing else is seen or heard. There was no wind that night and the object made no sound, it was a very still summer night. The landing site was about 150 yards away in a  depression with small trees. Observer felt that if it was a helicopter there would of been some sound and that by landing in a area of trees the blades would have hit them causing a crash. There was a lot of clear level field to make a safe landing if a helicopter wanted to. There are no helicopers based within 50 miles and no craft would of been up in that severe storm.

I quickly realised that this was not the case as this flame colored, perfectly round object was growing larger, rather than getting smaller. This object continued to grow larger and brighter, maintaining its perfectly round shape. I was alone at the beach but there were approximately six to eight people nearby, and I looked to see if the others were seeing this object, they were watching it as I was. This object grew to the approximate size that a silver dollar would appear when held at arms length. (Its size increasing probably 500 percent during the event lasting maybe two minutes.) Then this object vanished completely in a fraction of a second, it did not fade out, it was big and bright in the daylight sky one second, and totally gone the next second. Within one minute of this object vanishing, those of us on the beach were buzzed by a low flying military helicopter. I do not know whether this was a coincidence, or some sort of message to those of us who had observed this, but this helicopter flew directly over us at no more than 150 feet in the air. I did not speak to any of the other witnesses on the beach with me, because for some reason nearly everyone there immediately started packing up their belongings to leave right after the helicopter flew over, and for reasons that I cannot explain I too left, although my normal course of action, as it seems to me now would have been to stay and watch a little longer to see if this object reappeared, but I left with an uneasy feeling that I cannot explain.", "green fieball shoots across sky.", "At abt. 10:45 PM Alaska;A Flash of light (like a flash from a camera)lighted up the sky; then I would say about a minute after a boom sounded that shook the house.On Jan. 8, 1999 at approx. 10:45 PM (Alaska Time) I had retired to bed and my husband was watching TV downstairs; I noticed a bright Flash through my blinds and I wondered what it was but just shrugged it off as possibly being a big truck with high beams on coming up from the neighbors house across the street.  At the same time my husband noticed a bright flash that lighted up the whole back yard; he shrugged it off too.  Then we both felt that rummbling feeling that you feel with a earth quake and then a big boom like an explosion of some kind.

At first I thought it was the moon, but I knew the moon wouldn&apos;t be in the southwest sky at 9:20 at night...it&apos;s too early. One of us commented seeing the object, and all acknowledged they had been watching it for about a minute. The object was about 1.5x the normal size of the moon in the night sky. The fog had rolled in by then, but about a half-sphere was visible through the fog, as if it was partially masked. The object did not appear to move at all, and within 10 seconds slowly faded into nothing.

My brother saw it first, as I was driving.  He remarked something to the effect of &quot;What the hell is that a comet?&quot;  I looked up and saw an extremely bright light traveling at a very slow rate of speed in a north to south direction.  It looked exactly like pictures of comets that I have seen, a very white part, followed by a long smokey trail. It appeared fairly close to the ground, perhaps 2,000 feet. It was very bright for about twenty to thirty seconds and then it went out.  You could see what appeared to be a smoke trail after it.  It did not have any type of blinking navigation lights like an aircraft.  The bright light was at the aft end of the object as it traveled south.  It could not have been a search light from a helicopter or a landing light as it was pointing in the wrong direction(unless some crafts have landing lights on the rear of them).  We continued to look at the apparent course of travel for about 2-3 minutes.  Suddenly the light appeared again, perhaps 3-5 miles south, south west of the first sighting. I viewed the first incident through the front windshield.  I wanted to rule out reflections so I rolled down my window and viewed the lights clearly through the drivers side window. It exhibited the exact same characteristics, very bright, no Nav lights, &quot;smoke&quot; trailing from behind it.  It stayed illuminated for about fifteen or twenty seconds and went out again. You could clearly observe some type of &quot;smoke&quot; trailing from behind the object.  The smoke did not swirl or appear to move as if acted upon by rotor blades, jet engines, etc.  The object could not have been a jet, as if in afterburners, as it was moving far too slow to be a jet in burners.  Further, the color exhibited was very pure white and had not blue colored flame to it like a jet engine does.  It could not have been a balloon as it was too low, you could have easily seen the balloon being illuminated by the flame, furt! her it was moving too fast to be a hot air balloon.  It obsolutely was not any type of flare as has been reported by many in the past.  It was moving too fast to be a flare floating in the wind, and it would have been low enough to see a parachute suspending it.  Further, I am unaware of a flare that can relight itself after traveling five miles at a constant altitude.  There were no aircraft in the immediate vicinity of the light which could have released a flare.  The closest airforce base would be Luke some twenty miles to the north west and no military aircraft of any type were seen.  However, there were about a dozen commercial aircraft in the pattern around SkyHarbor.  They were very obviously aircraft with Nav lights.  Several were traveling south of the airport in an Easterly direction.  It would have been very easy for them to see the lights, at a lower altitude and directly in front of them.", "During a road trip to Panama City a friend and I witnessed a pair of luminous light formations appear and dissappear over the Gulf.This was years ago, so my memory of exact times and dates may be assumed to be a &quot;best guess&quot; but all details of the objects, and their behavior are still completely clear in my mind. A close friend and I had been working our tails off all year without a break, as we were both enrolled in the University of Alabama at Birmingham, and he(my friend) was also employed as the assistant to the broadcasting(mass comm) department(in which I was taking classes at the time), and in addition we produced a public access cable show in our spare time, which there was little of. In short, we needed a break, and thought it would make an interesting show if we documented ourselves winning the florida state lottery, so we used the show as an excuse for a road trip, and took one of the department&apos;s cameras with us (no, we didn&apos;t expect to win, but if we had it would&apos;ve made great television). So after a long drive from Birmingham, and a long afternoon of filling out lottery tickets, neither of us wanted to drive back, so we found a cheap motel, and put away our stuff to stay the night. It was about 4:00 or 5:00 in the afternoon when we both went out to the beach behind our hotel, and plopped down into a pair of those wooden beach chairs, and admired the calm sea, making small talk as the sun sank to the horizon. I don&apos;t recall which of us saw it first, because at first we didn&apos;t think anything of it, as there had been planes in the sky all day, and this seemed at the outset to be just an oddly-colored set of airplane lights. Although after about 15 or 20 minutes the lights hadn&apos;t moved, and we both took notice then. There were two rows of lights, the top row was an arc of four (reddish-violet in color)and were larger (not brighter) than the bottom row of three (bright yellow) they were arranged like this: O O   &lt;----Violet arc of lights O ... O ^------Yellow row of lights My initial thought was of a jetliner with four violet lights on the front of it&apos;s wings, and three bright yellow tail lights, seen in perspective flying towards the land. However since it was somewhat within a cloud, no structure was apparent. Also, nothing that size(jumbo-jet size) that I know of can hover, noiselessly (or if it did make noise, it was drowned out by the incoming surf). We watched the object, for a few moments, and it dawned on me that we had a camera in the trunk of the car, and there might be some way to profit from having a (near)professional quality UFO video (students are often broke, y&apos;know), so I told my friend to go get the camera-he had the keys (we had driven in his car). He refused to be moved from staring at the thing, and I quite frankly, didn&apos;t want to miss a moment either, so we stood there arguing about who should get the camera, while waching the object, when it dissappeared, like somone flipping off a light switch. We both stood there for a moment, then I sat back down on the chair, as did he, and we started talking about what we had just saw, and UFO&apos;s in general. By this time the sun had completely set, and we could see stars in the (mostly) clear sky. As we sat there looking around for any other strange things, we both noticed a number of planes in the air(or should I say red tail lights of planes)passing overhead at extremely high altitude, always in pairs, from right horizon to left (west to east) then back again. There must have been more than a dozen planes in the air in the next hour, before they finally stopped flying over our position. When the sky was clear again, as if on cue the object reappeared just as suddenly as it had vanished, and seemingly hadn&apos;t moved an inch. This time I was yelling &quot;GET THE CAMERA!&quot;(while elbowing my poor pal), and as we watched, another set of lights appeared, to the right, and above the first set(this time it was too dark to see if there was a connecting structure), and the first set of lights slowly faded away. After the dissapearance of the first object, my friend (FINALLY) trundled off back to the car, to get the camera. as he went away, so did the second object, lightswitch-style. Then I looked around the beach, and noticed that there wasn&apos;t a soul in sight. I must admit it-I got the creeps at that point, with the mist and surf slowly creeping up to the chairs, it was all I could do to sit still, and not run ! off to help my friend with the camera. As I sat there looking at the sky, I saw one final display. It was as if one of the objects was turned upside-down, right next to the other, with all lights on both glowing an intense yellow. Like this: O O O ... O O ... O O O This flashed brightly for a moment,low near the horizon, then was gone. After many long minutes my friend returned with the camera, tripod, and batteries, plopped it all down, and we both set it up. We searched the sky for an indeterminate amout of time to no avail, there was to be no more light show that night. But as we packed up to go back to our room, there was one other person on the beach who walked up to us and asked if we had seen the lights, too. &quot;Yes,&quot;we replied &quot;what the hell were they?&quot; &quot;Don&apos;t know, but that&apos;s been going on all week&quot; he replied. I later determined(by looking at our handy road map)that to our west was Eglin AFB, the likely source of the planes, and nearby was Gulf Breeze, which I later suspected may have been the source of the other things. Additionally, the lights of each set of lights never never changed position relative to each other which is what leads me to believe that there were two seperate objects whose surfaces were adorned with these lights. Also, the lights gave off an aura (almost like neon, but as bright as incandescent) which readily differentiated them from regular lights (though during the daylight sighting I attributed this aura to the lights being inside the boundary of a cloud, diffracting through the water vapor, but at night- it was a whole different story). Also , when we got home, my friend and I drew sketches of what we saw seperately (to make sure we both had the same experience) and they matched exactly.", "eight perfectly round balloons passed over head and dissapeared into a cloudI was in the basement of our home, it was afternoon,about 2pm when I heard frantic calling from the backyard from my wife and kids, I rushed up and out into the yard where the kids were pointing straight up. I looked up to see what i considered balloons, im saying at least eight,they moved from straight over head to a large, very large! cloud.from over head to the clouds position would be 45 degrees, the children were screaming men in black repeatedly (it occurs to me now they didn&apos;t see it as balloons). as the spheres, or balls which were extremly white,  reached the cloud they seperated equally to each side and entered one by one. during this I held my hand up to this cloud that was at 45 degrees,and its width was wider than my hand at arms lenght the balls were the size of my fingernails. it made me consider that if one of those things were near us it would have been the size of our two car garage. then after realizing the balls seemed to pause and enter the cloud one by one, I found a different interest to see what would happen next. balloons I thought would act randomly so we all waited for them to exit the cloud at some time somewhere. we watched the cloud and followed it to the horizon (as far as we could possibly see  but they never emerged also the cloud seemed to have accelerated once the balls got inside it had an eastward heading.

Align right edge of right hand to East. Object appeared at a point overhead of the left edge of the two hands. Center the two hands on the new, ENE-ish point, and with the wrists at eye level, the meteor/space debris/ appeared to fall in a path that would trace a line roughly across the fingertips, from center of the two hands to the left, and down the left side of the left hand to a level near the (5th distal metacarpal).

Just after going through the stop sign at the intersection of Kirkland Ave. and Slater St. S., I saw three large, bright, round headlights very low in the sky ahead of me.  Two were very bright, white.  The third, in between the white ones and slightly lower, was bright red.  All three were at least three times the size of a standard car headlight.  Two smaller white lights were to the rear.  In spite of the glowing brightness of the lights, the street was not brightly illuminated, considering that the lights appeared to be  just above the tree tops.  From my vantage point, they were behind and slightly to the left of the next intersection. I slowed down, turned off the radio and stopped the car, for the briefest moment, in order to have a better look at what was happening since I was heading in their direction.  Instantly,I realized that the lights weren&apos;t moving, there was no engine noise, the pattern of lights was not like an airplane and there were no blinking lights such as an airplane would have,  plus it was much too close to the ground-maybe 150 feet or so up.  This was something different. Since I had stopped just short of the driveway of the house before mine, my next thought was to hit the Genie button and head for my garage.  As I accelerated and drove toward my driveway, in the direction of the lights, I saw that the lights were moving toward me; very slowly and noiselessly, staying at the same height and now parallel to the road.  At this point I was very anxious to get into the garage.  As I turned left into my driveway, I saw that the garage door had not opened so I pressed the Genie button again and paused at the bottom of the drive in order to make sure that the door was opening. (My driveway is gravel, on an uphill slope. I can&apos;t stop halfway up because the wheels spin in the gravel and the car can&apos;t safely make it inside without swerving.)  I looked up to the right and saw that the lights were slowly approaching where I was stopped.  They were so close that I could see the under-belly of a triangular, wedge-shaped craft, somewhat like a Stealth Bomber.  It was a clear, windless night and the shape was a black sillouette against the night sky, but there was no noise.  At that point, the craft was at the far corner of my front yard, up above (approx.150 ft +-) the telephone pole which is about 80 ft from my driveway. I stepped on the accelerator and drove into the garage with just enough clearance to get under the door, which was still rising.  Immediately,  I hit the Genie button and remained rivited to my seat until the door closed. It was then I realized that the engine was still running.  Next, I shut off the engine, ran into the house, shut off the alarm, waited a moment so I could reset it and immediately ran to the nearest window.  The craft was gone.  For the next few minutes I ran around the darkened house looking through various windows but the only other thing I saw was a shooting light over Lake Washington at about Laurelhurst. I called the friend I had just dropped off before heading home.  And then by 11:49, I had called you to report what I had seen", "A large triangular shaped object travelling from NE to SW at approx. 2,000 ft.My friend and I were travelling in a Westerly direction when she spotted a bright object to the NE.  We stopped and observed it traversing the sky from the NE to the SW.  It was triangular shaped with a light at each apex.  I&apos;m guessing that it was at approx. 2,000 feet because I saw a small private acft fly under it.  If my estimate in distance is correct, than this thing had to be the size of a football field.  The sky was clear and their was a decent amount of ambient light.  The one thing that struck me as really strange was that as soon as it flew out of sight beyong the treeline, we then saw 2 Blackhawk helicopters flying back from the opposite direction, travelling SW to NE at treetop level.  I was a naval aircrewman, so I know what I&apos;m talking about when it comes to aircraft, and I&apos;ve never seen any configuration like it before.", "Bright lights approx. 1/2 mi. east of us - was still for &apos;bout a min. or so - no sound - and the slowly moving towards the south.

Shortly after noticing this, the lights vanished (as if you turned out a light) and was followed by 2 short bursts of light on the ground.On Wednesday March 17, 1999, after leaving Wendover Nevada, we were heading east to Salt Lake City on I-80.  At mile marker 28 all occupants in our vehicle noticed 4 circular shapes with very bright yellow lights.  Shortly after noticing this, the lights quickly dimmed - as is you were to turn out the lights.  Within seconds, two short burts of light appeared on the ground below. I have not been one to firmly believe in UFO&apos;s but after seeing these lights, I will not doubt them.", "We were driving on sr500 when we saw a green fireball streak accross the skyWe saw a bright green fireball streak accross the sky from the n.w. to the s.e..  It was very bright and very green.  It just streaked accross the sky and disapeared.", "Disc shaped object, approximatly 100 ft in air. large light and a strob in center. around 20-30 ft deep.On or around 1975 mid summer while driving home from work about 11.30pm on Hwy 395 north of Spokane WA. from about 14 miles I saw directly ahead of me about 2 miles a bright light.  It looked like a football stadium at night from a distance.  Only in the air. I continued on,looking at the lights all the way.  As I got closer the lights were larger and very close to the ground. I had one more hill to go up before I reached my turn, Just about 1/2 milefrome the town of Deer Park. I climbed the hill watching the lights all the way.  As I reached the crest of the hill I was directly in front of the object.  It covered the highway on one side, the center  of the object was off the road to the left directly over a small farm house the barn and sourounding property.  As I look back I would say it was roughly 3-4 hundred yards round 30-40 ft high. with large lights all the way around and a large strob like light in the center (no colored lights) which was in the center on the bottom.  The object was only obout 100ft off the ground.  I do not recall any noise. As I drove directly under the object I had to make my turn (right). So I drove under and looked up, I do not recall seeing anthing other than lights and the strob.  I made my turn and stoped.  I got straight out to get a better look and it was just gone.  The only thing in the clear sky was stars...  Not a sign of what I had been watching nothing what so ever... I had no missing time, or any reason to think anything wierd had occurd..  Just a lasting memory.", "I&apos;d just finished watching a video and had gathered my things to go upstairs.  When I walked into my bedroom I saw I&apos;d left the drapes pulled completely back, so I decided not to turn on my lamp just yet. I stepped to the window instead just to look out at the street and the sky.  And standing there in the dark of my room, I see what I&apos;d best describe as a luminous green object, shoot downward from the southeast. It headed in a mostly western direction and slightly to the north. It was larger than the Hale-Bopp comet had been when it appeared in out skies, with an appearance similar to a comet, having a tail. Quite good sized, considering it was under the cloud cover.  You know how fast a shooting star is?  Well that&apos;s how this thing moved - *that fast!  It disappeared from my vision when it passed the roofline of the 2-story building across the street. I turned to my clock to see it was 11:00 p.m. Since I&apos;m not sure what the definition of a &quot;green fireball&quot; is, I don&apos;t know if that&apos;s what I saw. But I can tell you I was kinda dumbfounded.  I just stood there and quietly said, &quot;What was *that&quot;. This was nothing like any of the other craft I&apos;ve seen over the years, that&apos;s for sure.", "Disapeering flying objectMy friend and I live in Richmond, Va. and we use to go up to Colonial Beach, which is on the Potomach River and go fishing. The river is a couple of miles wide and on the other side of the river is Maryland. This location is about 10 miles from a militray bas, Fort A.P. Hill. We were fishing behind this seafood restaurant which has a couple of peirs to fish from. On the other peir there was a family of 3. Well, while we were fishing I noticed up in the sky probably 1000 ft. up was a white object flying slowy over the river. It was making no sound. The crazy thing about it was, as it was flying over the river it would just fade out and vanish when it was close to the other side of the river. And amazingly after this would occur, it would re-appear back where it started from. This went on for about 20 minutes. I even ran over to the other pier to show the people there what it was doing. We all saw it in broad daylight on a clear day. The other strange thing was, after it had stopped flying over, a few minutes later a fighter jet flew up through the area that this UFO craft had just been flying in.

I assumed it to be an satelite as it did not have 2 sets of lights. i then noticed a second identical light to the left-behind the first light. they were moving at normal air-speed for a small aircraft, i thought this strange as i have been in the military and jets that fly in such formation are very noisy at such altitudes(approximate same as for airplanes arriving to the Williamsport/Lycoming Airport.  I didn&apos;t hear any sounds.  Then i heard a small aircraft and within a few seconds did see a small aircraft heading east toward the airport.  As i watched the &quot;tandem&quot; lights they seemed to have a light pattern: first a whitish-yellow, then a blueish slightly green, and then red.  I have also had instruction in astronomy and have utilized several college observatories.  I have never seen two satelites(sp?) orbit in such fashion. or at such low altitudes.  And once the small aircraft dissappeared from veiw i no longer heard a sound, but still saw the lights.  The lights appeared to accelerate slightly and then the front light flashed a &quot;beam-kind of like you would see lightning between clouds&quot;.  This did not light up the entire sky, but slightly illuminated the area directly around the 2 objects/lights.  within about 5-10 seconds the light to the rear &quot;sent&quot; the same type of &quot;beam&quot; back to the first object. My attention was distracted to the west and i thought i saw a shooting star.. it went directly towards the point where the 2 objects were located.  Those 2 objects began to show a change in behavior.  Their lights got brighter/stronger..the item to the rear picked up speed and seemed to run into the first the flashing of the lights continued(no beams, just the white,green, red) Then another shooting white light came straight down to again seem to come to a target or convergence area.  Another appeared coming from the Wilkes-barre/Scranton area. My next thought was that of a meteor shower, but i know there aren&apos;t any right now. Then all of the white lights stopped all logical behavior and seemed to move around. More erratically than you would see from a spotlight..like when a child plays with a 4TH of July sparkler and swirls it around in front and you can see the tip glowing.... At this point there were at least 5 lights in the sky.  I could no longer rationalize anything reasonable that i could blame this on...i wanted to verify with the airport . I left the window and called the Williamsport airport, but no answer. i called a delta 800 line...the reservations person took a bit of information and told me that i needed to hang up and call 911 and make a report, and again asked me to please do so right away. I called 911 embarrased.  I am an educated person, but this was too weird.  I wanted some reasonable explanation of the events.  I went back later to look again(took me a while to get up the courage..the incident really seemed to get me in the gut..but there was nothing.  I live in Williamsport on edwin street there is a hospital--Williamsport hospital about 5 blocks directly north of my home. The activity appeared to take place directly over the hospital. It was way too low for a satelite(sp?) but was at a higher altitude than the small aircraft that passed through the area. I have never seen anything like it in my life.  it was very unnerving. Please feel free to contact me for any additional information.  I was unaware that anyone would even call me about this.  I had already received a phone call from Stan Gordon.  I was a bit unnerved by the second phone call from Peter.  My apologies for any rudeness.  I keep private to myself and was not prepared to be getting calls asking me questions.  Again, feel free to call or e-mail me.  I would like to find out what I saw.  I am very bothered by the incident.  Respectfully, Pamela Gill", "As I was coming home from a meeting last night I saw a very bright light hanging low in the sky.  I have no idea why I drove toward it but as I got closer I noticed three white lights which looked to be in a straight line.  It was not moving.  There was no noise--I had my car radio turned off.  As I turned to go down a hill the thing kind of turned also and I noticed that the three lights were actually two in the front and on in the back forming a perfect triagle.  There were no other lights.  I did not notice anything connecting the lights.  The thing moved to from the left side of my car to the right then I watched it in the rear view mirror and lost sight of it.

All of a sudden, I noticed out of the clouds approximately 8-11 sphere&apos;s of lights traveling in a group at the same rate of speed.  Three or four more followed.  They were followed seconds later by two more sphere&apos;s of light.

It was a clear night, just a couple days after Christmas and the area we were in was located around forest preserves and low lighting.  We looked up towards the north end of the sky because there were several lights in the distance.  Everyone kept saying they were planes but then quickly dismissed that idea when the lights began to change from white to blue to red in very short bursts, so fast that the colrs seemed to blend togather.  These lights were stationary in their positions.  There were five of them: three formed a perfect triangle and the other two just stayed outside of the triangle.  They never moved for five minutes and then all of a sudden one would disappear completely and reappear on the other side of the triangle.  This pattern repeated itself several times, but the triangle always stayed constant and the lights kept flickering colors.  We didn&apos;t stay outside long because we had to work and also because no one belived it could be a UFO, may be just something that was ahappening over Lake Michigan with helicopters or something.  Helicopters don&apos;t flass several colors at an amazing speed, stay stationary for a while and disappear completely and reappear.", "I was driving north on HWY 101 over the hill from Peteluma to Cotati when I saw a green/blue orb pass in front of my car in the upper part of my windshield.  It traveled west to east and disapeared out of my view over the town of Cotati.This object first appeared to be a shooting star but normally when I those they appear high in the sky.  This object appeared to be much closer to the surface of the earth. By this I mean possibly at the same height of a low flying plane.  I did not at first think to do or say anything about it until I saw a news blurb on NBC for a later broadcast that people in the north bay had seen a green &quot;comet like&quot; object in the sky.

It caught my eye as a blur, but as it flew almost overhead it looked solid; as it left our position it became a blur again--like camoflage.We were entering our backyard. As it entered our line of vision in the south, and left it in the north it was just a narrow band of orange light as if it had camoflage; but while over our yard and the neighbor&apos;s yards it was clear, blocked out the light of the stars, silent and steady. The six round, pale orange lights were all the same size and close together, perfectly equidistant from one another: one at the narrow end of the tri- angle, two in the next row, and three across the broad end; of course, the narrow end was the leading edge. It did not seem to become a blur in the north until it was about a mile beyond us going north: it did not disappear so much as blend slowly into the appearance of space.

All nightime workers used to watch these as a matter of routine.Eary 1970&apos;s - Sinop, Turkey. In the mountains on the north coast of Turkey we would experience nightly light shows. White sphere shaped balls of light would &quot;pop&quot; up into the air. Sometimes a large &quot;ball&quot;, as I&apos;ll call it, would rise with a smaller one orbiting around it. Others would come up and down out of the mountains and just sit there. Usually that&apos;s all they would do - just sit there. Occasionally they would leap-frog over each other but would never leave the mountain tops or approach the base. One night working the midnight shift, I had to drive to a remote part of the base to another building. As I was waiting for clearance to enter the building the large &quot;ball&quot; came up with it&apos;s smaller companion orbiting around it. I mentioned it to the MP in the guard shack who just smiled and said, &quot;Yeah, they&apos;ve been real busy tonight.&quot; No one ever talked about them and my captain didn&apos;t want to hear of it.

PD))", "((NUFORC:  Several planets were positioned quite closely to one another in the southwest sky during February 1999.  The fact that the observer does not cite the other bright objects in the western, or southwestern, sky, in addition to the objects he observed, suggest to us that he may well have been looking at the conjunction of four planets.))Two lights similar to planets but with unusual coloration and slow but discernable motion. Each eventually faded from sight.Approximateley 20:00 local time, approximately due West, approximately 30 degrees above the (distant) horizon: I observed two fairly bright lights separated nearly vertically by about the width of two full moons. The lower was considerably brighter than the upper. They looked exactly like two planets and I assumed that is what they were. About 10 minutes later I noticed them again but perhaps 20 degrees above and slightly further north on the horizon. The spacing appeared to be exactly the same. I realized planets would not be moving this fast so I grabbed my 10 power binoculars for a better look. Through the binoculars the upper light had a pronouced orange coloration similar to a sodium vapor lamp. The lower light appeared to be an almost bluish white, then on longer inspection it seemed to be cycling through several colors. It was considerably brighter than the upper. At this point I called my wife, Debby, who has low vision but with her monocular observed the two lights. She describes one as brighter and possibly changing color. I steadied my binoculars on a porch railing. I was now able to just barely make out that the lower light was composed of either two white lights one above the other or a verically elongated white light. Between the two lights (or at the center of the elongated one) and barely to the left (south) was a red light flashing once every second or two. Apparently this is what I mistook for changing colors. I now called my uncle Tom, to grab his binoculars and look. No more than a minute can have passed but when I got back outside, the lower and previously brighter light had faded to near invisibilty (it was no longer visible to me without my binoculars). While I watched, it continued to fade until it was no longer visible (about 30 more seconds). So Uncle Tom only observed the upper light, but he also felt it was moving very slowly. I now concentrated on the upper light. The color and brightness were unchanged but as I watched, it appeared to slowly elongated vertically to a length that was still a small fraction of the width of the moon (maybe 5%). This may have taken half a minute. It then began to fade. Over perhaps another 30 seconds it faded to near invisibility and I lowered my binoculars. Maybe 15 seconds later I raised the binoculars for one more look and it was again visible but at only about half its original brighness. It then slowly faded away. Through all this its color never changed. Occasionally during this period I swung my binoculars to various stars. They all were clearly point sources of light, unlike the unknown objects that appeared to be slightly elongated. Yet the elongation of the upper object was so slight I kept wondering if it could have been caused by a trembling of the binoculars. Still I did not see it on stars. Still I repeat, although the lower light was tiny, even through binoculars, I could clearly distinquish an elongated white light with a flashing red light slightly to the left and centered vertically. There were no stars clearly visible as near the horizon as the objects but toward the zenith the stars were clear and bright. I am familiar with the sight of airplanes at night. I am 60 miles south of Pittsburgh PA and there are almost always one or two visible in the night sky. The unknown objects moved far two slowly to be airplanes and the lights were simply not the same. And although I obsereved airplanes elsewhere in the sky during this period, I never saw any near the objects. They were not LEO satellites. They moved far two slowly and they were much too bright. I am absolutely certain they were not celestial objects. The colors, the motion and the fading demonstrate that. I have seen many objects in the sky that were unusual at first glance but that I was eventually able to identify. Prolonged observation proved these objects to be more and more strange. I have no idea what it was that I saw.", "The UFO I saw was stationary, brightly flaming on the bottom and dripping profusely toward the ground.On a recent trip to Colorado Spring in the Fall of 1998 between employment, I picked up a paper that serves several towns 15 to 50 miles east of Colorado Springs.  The headline in the August 27, 1998 &quot;RanchLand News&quot; (published in Simla, CO) described recent UFO sightings.  The article described a UFO sighting exactly like I personally had while driving south from Colorado Springs on highway 115 in the late 80&apos;s to 1990. Every time I stopped at a convenience store on Hwy 24 East of Colorado Springs over the days I was there, I mentioned the UFO headlines of their local paper.  To my surprise many locals shared of their sightings near this multiple Air Base region.  One man of &apos;credible&apos; nature who is a pilot said him and his wife were driving east on Hwy 24 to Colorado Springs when they saw a large ball of fire heading towards Cheyenne Mountain (NORAD).  He added that it veer to the right along the mountain and disappear over the side then went towards &quot;Pikes Peak&quot;.  Both him and his wife saw this at about 5 a.m. earlier this summer.  I then told him of my 1990ish sighting and he commented that the UFO I saw stationary in the sky must have had a &quot;fuel problem&quot;. Until this recent trip to Colorado Springs I never really talked about the sighting much to anyone.   In re-driving the hwy 115 I found at about the county line what I believe is the location where I had the sighting.  There is evidence of brush having previously been burnt there&mdash;perhaps set by the flaming UFO? This is what I remember of my earlier sighting back in the late 80&apos;s to 1990: It was late at night--probably 11:00 p.m. or later.  I was driving south of Colorado Springs on highway 115.  Fort Carson is on the East Side of the road.  About 4/10ths to a half-mile to my front-left just over a notch in a ridge was a large object suspended in the sky. It was brightly flaming on the bottom and dripping profusely toward the ground over the ridge.  At first I thought it was a &quot;dirigible&quot; (large blimp) on fire, but it was only burning on the lower half.  Being that it was over Fort Carson, I thought that it might be some kind of military base experiment.  I pulled over to the side of the road for a few minutes, but then just shrugged it off and drove on.  I never drove the road again until this fall of 1998.", "A black or dark dot was seen hanging in the sky for a period of several minutes.Approximatly thirty people witnessed a dark object - very distinct dark black round object against the clear sky. It was just about dusk and the object was getting hard to see. It stayed fixed at its position for approx. 10 minutes. It was February 27th at about 5:35.", "While driving saw a disc shaped object very briefly. My girlfriend wgo was with me also saw it. The interesting thing about is that we felt some kind of mental contact from it which alerted usto it&apos;s presence.While driving on a country road, my girlfriend and I got an impulse, or I guess you couldcall it an irresistable impression or desire to look out and upward through the windshield. We had to lean forward, which we both did at the exact dame time. Upward and slightly to the right of us was a disk shaped object. This happened in just an instant. It was there, then it was gone. It actually was visible for a little less than second, this is why neither I nor my girlfriend, could recall any details of the object, other than it&apos;s shape and color. I just remember that it was silver and disk shaped. After the event, I of course discussd the incident with my girlfriend and both remembered going through the same experience and seeing the same thing. I have to admit that we both were stunned and awed by the experience. What impressed us most about the event was the psychic or mental impulse we both had at the exact same time to look in the exact direction and place where the object was. What we would really like to know is whether the mental attraction we experienced was something that the object generated to anyone who was within a certain distance or radius to the object, or was the impulse directed specifically to my girlfriend and I?", "like a flashlight that you can carry but up in the ski as if it were an airplane although it only had one headlight. it was broad daylight and it was sooooooo bright. then, as soon as i pointed to it, and said to my husband as he drove the car) i said, &quot;look!&quot; that fast it took off straight into the distance. usually things get smaller into the distance but this light went so fast that i could only realize that it just took off into the distance. i cant measure the time it took to go into the distance until it was not visable but i know it was not like shutting off a flashlight.  it went into the distance in broad day light. i wonder if it was one of those stealths?  or if so, why would it have a bright rear light on it. oh, i did not hear an engine either. it was close enough that i should have heard something. thanks for having room for this information.

I SAW THE OBJECT THROUGH MY GLASS STORM DOOR. I TURNED THE POARCH LIGHT OFF TRYING TO GET A BETTER LOOK AT IT.  AT FIRST I THOUGHT THAT IT WAS A STREET LIGHT.  BUT IT WAS MUCH TOO HIGH IN THE SKY TO BE A STREET LIGHT.  IT WAS VERY BRIGHT&amp; BIG SO I DID NOT THINK THAT IT COULD BE A STAR.  FINALLY, I ASSUMED THAT IT WAS A STAR SO I CALLED MY MOTHER TO TELL HER ABOUT IT.  AT THAT TIME MY NEIGHBOR CAME OUTSIDE TO LEAVE.  I RAN OUTSIDE TO TELL HIM TO LOOK  AT THAT TIME THE &quot;STAR&quot; STARTED MOVING STRAIGHT UP INTO THE AIR ALSO THE BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT WENT OFF &amp; A RED &amp; A GREEN LIGHT CAME ON.  AFTER IT MOVED UP IT STARTED MOVING WEST AT THE SAME TIME LIKE IN A SLANT  ALSO IT LEFT A VERY DIM TAIL BEHIND BUT VERY BRIEFLY ALMOST LIKE FIREWORKS DOTHEN IT STOPPED MOVING UP &amp; ONLY MOVED WEST.  MY NEIGHBOR &amp; I WERE SAYING &quot;WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?&apos; TO EACH OTHER WHILE IT WAS STILL MOVING UP &amp; WEST I RAN INSIDE TO GET MY CAMERA.  WHEN I CAME BACK OUT MY NEIGHBOR SAID GO GET YOUR CAMERA.  I SAID IVE GOT IT IVE GOT IT SO I TOOK SOME PICTURES THEN HE SAID TAKE ANOTHER PICTURE MY CAMERA ONLY TAKES PICTURES UP TO 15 FT THIS THING WAS HUNDREDS OF FEET AWAY SO I KNOW IT WILL NOT SHOW UP IN A PICTURE.  THIS OBJECT NEVER PUT OFF ANY SOUND  ANY TIME THAT I HAVE SEEN AN AIRPLANE OR HELICOPTER THAT LOW TO THE GROUND I HAVE HEARD A SOUND", "One third larger and twice as bright as venus. The object did not twinkle as one would expect if it were a star.At approximately 0515 my wife and I were driving SSE on Pondrosa St. and at appromixmately 35 degres to the horizon she and I saw an object as discribed above flying in a NNE to SSW direction.It was flying on a 90 degres with the horizon. Ten seconds went by and the object made an abrupt 35 to 40 degre downward turn.. Take a pencil and draw a streight line for a time and then an abrupt turn downward 30 or 40 degres. This what my wife and I saw. I know of nothing that cand move like that. I would conclude that the object was VERT high in altitude. We compared the speed of a jet liner that normally flies at say 30 thousand feet to the speed of this object and figured it was very large and high in altitude. The object was traveling 15 times the speed of a jet airliner if you observe the jet at 30 thousand feet. The objest disappeared over the horizon.

The objects came in from the West, until they were over the house across the street at which time they made a leisurely turn to the North. I was at 97.08872W 32.75318N at the time, in fact, I still reside there. The objects were not at all impressive, being a gull grey in color and making no strange aerobatics. WEATHER CONDITIONS: Heavy Cloud : YES Dusk : YES Warm : YES UFO ACTIONS: Disappear/Reappear: YES Noise Info : NONE I have a book by Robert Emenegger called &quot;UFOs, Past, Present and Future,&quot; and it has a sighting survey based upon the Observer&apos;s Data Sheet prepared for the USAF. I filled it out at the time and am using it to provide the data I&apos;m entering here. I still remember it well, and will attempt to properly describe it in words, though my drawing from the time would be of better use. My mother and grandparents first called the objects to my attention. I went outside and was joined by my sister, her friend and my brother. We all saw them, and I had all but my grandparents sign the sighting report as witnesses. Now, however, they have nearly, if not totally, forgotten the episode. When I got outside, I saw the objects coming in over the roof of the house to our left, westwards. I live on a Circle, with the entrance on the east connecting to a north-south road. Our house is on the south-east corner facing the connecting road with the driveway leading to the entrance to the circle, where we were all standing. When I saw the objects, I rushed inside to get my binoculars only to find that my sister had broken them from when she had last borrowed them; this is why the event is so prominent in my memory. I then got my telescope, a small thing from K-mart, maybe 50x, and dragged it outside. By the time I got back outside, the lead object was over the house across from our driveway, to the north, and had started its turn to the north. Now, to be honest, I would still swear that there were three of the things, but my notes from the time only indicate a single craft; not in so many words, but Question #10 of the sighting survey asks if there was more than one phenomenon, and I had left it blank. Other parts of the form are blank as well, but simply those things that I did not have data on at the time and never had a chance to fill in, so perhaps I had missed the question or some other event caused me to not enter more than one object. At any rate, I believe I saw three of them and will assume so in this report. I trained my ! telescope on the lead object and managed to get a lengthy view until it was just too much of a hassle keeping it in focus and trained, so I just used the Mark-1 eyeball until they went out of sight to the north. I had 8 minutes of clear view, except for my trip inside for my binoculars and telescope, before they disappeared into some clouds. There was only one star out at the time, and the moon wasn&rsquo;t up until 9:30pm. The only other traffic I saw was an airplane on the opposite sky when the objects were almost out of view. I live near D/FW Airport, but it had only just opened back then and it&rsquo;s a good bit away. Besides, I know aircraft, and was a member of the Air Force JROTC at my high school. I can&rsquo;t think of any aircraft that would take 8minutes to travel a mile, give or take. To describe them, I think the best thing to do is to think of a Dorito chip with very rounded corners. Now, take the chip and bend the rounded corners up to form a shallow bowl shape. Put a small raised hump on top of the chip in the center (only just visible past the edge) and a small circular light on the bottom in each corner and that&rsquo;s pretty much it. The view I had was a three-quarter view from the bottom, so all I saw of the seeming hump was just what poked over the edge. The bottom was very round as were the edges. The object was an overall grey, and the lights were pretty much just white spots, they weren&rsquo;t bright at all, in fact, they weren&rsquo;t even visible until I used the telescope and remains of my binoculars. The objects didn&rsquo;t give off any light or sound and made a very slow leisurely trip across the sky; as I had said, nothing impressive at all. I still have the drawings of it, and can forward them in future if you so desire and I can get to a scanner. I reported the sighting to the police that same day, but I have no idea if they kept any record or anything. Well, that&rsquo;s about it. I&rsquo;ve tried to put down all I could think of and could find on that sighting survey, and I hope it helps. Feel free to contact me about it. Est. Height: 500 - 1000 feet Est.

I was very young like about only 4 years old at the time and I am 55 now this was one of the two times I was a wittness of UFOs. These objects did not move enough  for me to notice. they were not like the weather balloons that were prevalant during those days but because these were right over head and not like the side view that the weather baloons were. None of the caricteristics below fit the objects that I observed. We were poor people that had to raise as much food as we could in the summer months to have enough food for the cold winters we have here. Mom was a mother of 8 and practicly alone in her indever to raise us. so we spent a lot of time in the large gardens we had at that time. For the most part we ignored the objects and went back to our task of hoeing the strawberry plants growing in that particular garden plot.", "Saw oscillating light from a distance streak to the left then up and to the right out of sight so fast I could hardly believe what I had seenPosting this as 6/1/75 to coincide with the other report that I just read.  But I don&apos;t think it was in June because I was in junior high and we were still in school, which in New Mexico back then got out in May.  I think it was September or October 1975.  I remember the kids whose parents were stationed at Cannon Air Force Base came to school one day and they were saying that that night their dads went on scramble alert and they were chasing something around that was too fast for them to catch. Of course that night my buddy came over to spend the night We spent a few hours checking out stars and looking for anything wierd. I remember we had found about three different lights that seemed to pulsate red,white, &amp; blue but our science teacher had warned us in all the excitement that the atmosphere can make starlight pulsate.  The lights were far enough away to be indistinguishable from stars.  We tried to convince ourselves we were seeing UFOs but they weren&apos;t moving. So we were about to call it quits.  But while we were looking at the brightest of the pulsing lights, it glowed even brighter for a second, then streaked to its left, then up and to the right, completely out of sight.  I still to this day remember my amazement that we had actually seen something.  We stammered back and forth at each other then ran inside my house and dragged my dad outside.  He didn&apos;t see anything and smiled and went back inside.  It moved so fast, it was incredible.  I still get chills when I think about how it streaked out of sight right before my eyes.  We watched the other candidates for a while and kept searching the sky but we never saw anything else. Although I knew several people who were checking out the skies that second night nobody else saw anything. That&apos;s my story.  Not much but it really did happen.  I was so relieved to find out that someone else had already documented the incident and revealed some interesting facts.", "Bright object 10000-20000 + feet in eastearn sky at first statoinary then appearing in different location in general area of sky without travelingWas driving east on the Massachusetts turnpike. I looked up and observed a shiny circular shape in the sky at 10000-20000 feet. In the sky as I approached the area below the object, It began to appear from one location to the other without traveling. It then appeared to have a shape oblong and horizontal thinning on the outer edge, it then started to move higher and further away, The object then moved above a thin strip of cloud cover and did not come out the other side. when I arived in Boston my truck clock was one hour behind the time.", "Object crossed over Highway I-76, Heading Northeast about 100 feet off the ground. The object moved very slowly, to slow for an airplane. Had 4 bright &quot;headlights&quot; on the front, but insted of pointing ahead, they pointed down in a 45 degree angle. One red light &quot;not flashing&quot; set centered between the two inner most lights.On Feb. 18 at about 11:30 pm, I was traveling west on I-76 in N.E. Ohio, While crossing over Lake Milton in the portage county area, I noticed 4 bright lights slowly moving across the sky at a low altitude for this area. At first I thought it was a plane, but this did not more at a speed that a plane would fly. It was about 100+ feet off the ground, I thought it was going to crash into the lake. I watched this craft for about 2 minutes, as it hung over the highway. It WAS moving but much to slow.  I got on the cb and asked if anyone else could make out what it was, everyone else said either they did not know, or that it was a plane. But no one could actually see the shape of the craft. It was to dark outside and the lights were to bright to make out any shape. One of the truckdrivers said that there was a military airport just north of us, but I live in this area. The base IS north of us, but it is not close enough for aircraft to fly this low. The 4 lights on the front of this craft were pointing down in a 45 degree angle to the flight path of the craft. I looked for other lights that would prove it was an airplane. I saw 1 red light directly center of the 4 &quot;headlights&quot; But it was not flashing, just glowing. Unfortunatly I could not stop to watch the craft or see where it would have went. No one else could tell where it had went to either. One driver made the comment that &quot;he thought it was going to land on his truck&quot; this craft made no noticable noise (what I could here from inside my truck) and did not seem to displace any air at the low altitude it was flying. Mr. Davenport, I dismissed this as an airplane, possibly military. However after listening to you on Art Bells show on Feb. 19th. I found myself second guessing what I saw. One of the ladies, that you had interviewed and replayed on the show, described what I had seen almost to a tee!  Now I am wondering just what I really saw. I know my experiance only lasted but a few short minutes, but it felt like many minutes longer. This is not far from Trumble county or from the Pennsilvania State line. Thanks for taking the time to listen. What ever it was!", "Second sighting of object in the Preston Hwy./Gilmore Lane area. This was the same silent, metallic, dome-shaped object sighted almost 3 years earlier in the same area.On this occasion it was a warm summer night in July 1979. The sky was clear and neither the moon or stars were visible. My best friend came running into my house and was screaming and trying to drag me outside to see something. As soon as we ran out into my front yard I saw it. I yelled to her (as we ran after it!) that it was the same object I described to her 3 years ago. It was the same silent, slow-moving, metallic, dome-shaped object with a center light on the bottom and slow counter-clockwise moving smaller lights surrounding it. It once again moved off in an eastward direction along Gilmore Lane toward Poplar Level Rd.", "Green fire ball appearing to fall at very high velocityI was driving to work,on highway 17, just west of olean, ny, and observed a green fire ball moving very fast and straight, appearing to be headed straight for the ground.  I do not believe it could have been a shooting star, it was to big and very green, as the color of burning copper.  There was an earlier event of the same, only was heading north, northwest.  The date of this one is unknown.  Once again, only a second to view.  Co-worker also seen the this event, although I do not feel he would talk about it with any one else.", "V-shaped object with brite white lights running all under it. Flying East to WestI went outside to walk my dog @ approx 9:00 looked up at sky &amp; saw a small plane (could tell plane because it had the familiar white on one side red on the other blinking).  Then out of the clouds, I saw what I believed to be a large plane descend straight down &amp; glide across overhead traveling from East to West.  It made no noise &amp; was large &amp; V-shaped. Lots of big bright white lights running underneath its V-shape. Tried to get someone from in my house out to look at it before it was gone.  By the time anyone else came out with me, it was gone.", "I saw a green-white fire ball moving west southwest.  It looked like(size and shape) the HailBop comet but, moving much faster.12/13/93 @ APROX. TIME 2310HRS. I was standing in front of 3655 Boulevard Place facing West when, I saw a white/green flared light moving rapidly South west out of my field of view.  I listened for impact sound there was none.  Unlike other shooting stars I&apos;ve seen the flare was wider and had a green hue to it.  Its overall shape was like that of the Hailbop Comet.", "Going to work, ahead of me at a stop light I saw a small object moving at a fast rate. It was crossing my direction of travel at an estimated distance of a 1/2 to3/4 mile distance. I watched it for 5 to 6 sec until it disapeared behind trees. It was moving in a straight line.It was oval shaped with a dull white color. I did not see any protruding features like wings or tail. Due to its small size it was hard to tell how far it was. I feel it was close to a 1/2 mile ahead. Size comparison to birds [ducks or seagulls] in the vincinity but closer was that of the torso of a large bird at 3 to 400 yards without a head or wings. The object was moving too low and fast to belong where it was.Small object. Oval shape Dull white with maybe some darker shaded areas I related its appearance to birds that were in the area  closer to me and between myself and the object. It was the approximate same size as these birds if you could see them without wings or head and just a torso. I was going to work westbound on Evans Street. I came to the stop light behind three or four cars at the Broadway intersection. At this location the street is on a decline. Basically the terrain here is part of the Platte river basin.It was a clear,cold morning with the Rocky mountains visible in the distance.My office is just 2 miles further west on Evans street.I work for the State of Colorado At A Rehabilitation center for the blind.I am in my 17th year at this job.I am college educated and have never seen anything like this in my 52 years. I&apos;ve had been out of town until today [12/24]so I am, only at this time doing this report. This gave me a lot of time to think about this sighting and to evaluate what I actually saw. What I saw was this: While coming to a halt at the intersection on icy pavement, I looked to the area just past the intersection, I was slightly higher at this spot as the street was on a decline with several cars ahead of me. We were all waiting for the light to change. This afforded me a view of the viaduct ahead that goes over the Platte River. This viaduct is about a 1/4 mile past Broadway. A few large trees line the river bank on the left. I think they are cottonwoods at about 40 feet in height. That puts the trees  to the south side of my west bound route on Evans Street.The sky was clear with a plume of smoke coming off a power plant to the southwest area beyond these trees. As I looked up I was watching 2 or 3 large birds flying around the trees and the river.I then saw the object come into my line of sight from the right heading from north to south,southwest. I fixxed my eyes on the object because of its speed and course. It past by a bird headed in the same direction at a higher altitude and it was moving!!!. The bird it past is what I compared it to in size. The object was farther away and above some power lines as well. The power lines were closer in, but I can go back and visualize the position of the object above the power lines. I watched it for 5 or 6 seconds until it went behind the trees to the south and traffic started to move again. I moved with traffic across Broadway and up on the viaduct past the trees to see if I could see it again. The object was gone. I beleive the sighting was 5 or6 seconds in duration because I later later recreated its velocity with my finger and move my finger as the object moved and counted the seconds. I know this object did not belong over populated Denver at its altitude and speed. It moved in a straight line with maybe a slight incline to the south southwest direction. The object appeared to be between me and the powerplant to the southwest. The speed I estimate would be comprable to a military jet at 3 or 400 miles per hour. The OBject was not a plane.", "The spaceship was shaped like two spheres attached by a cylinder curiously resembling dumbbells.I have had a close encounter with an alien spaceship.  This occurred on a partially sunny afternoon in Ponce, Puerto Rico, at approximately 3:00 or 4:00 in the afternoon in what could have been January or February 1974.  The spaceship was shaped like two spheres attached by a cylinder curiously resembling dumbbells. The spaceship was not shinny nor did it have any blinking lights or humming noises, it was opaque white in a color resembling the color of white clouds.  The spaceship moved silently, and very slow, almost hovering in what appeared to be almost a reconnaissance flight. It moved from a southerly position to the north.  I observed the spaceship until it camouflaged itself behind some clouds and I never saw it or have seen it again.", "Atlanta &quot;meteor&quot; fireball, December 5th 1998, approx. 03:00am Image computer recreation of event mailed to &apos;images site&apos;.TIME &amp; PLACE: The event happened Saturday morning approx. 3:00am December 5th 1998. Did not have a watch at the time, but estimates that to be the correct time span. Came home from work and had just parked my car. As I walked toward the apartment I saw this bright light coming from ABOVE TOWARD THE GROUND. This event took place South-West (correction) from MY location in the North-Eastern Buckhead area which is about 6 miles north-north-east of downtown Atlanta. LIGHT &amp; SOUND: The object was glowing red, and as it streaked toward the ground the tail seemed to ignite. The colors of the tail that followed were bright neon blue at its core, and toward the yellow and red spectrum closer to the edges of the fire/&quot;explosion&quot;. The tail seemed to ignite after the object had passed through the same space, and remained glowing in the sky for about 1 to 1.5 seconds after the main object crashed all the way toward the ground. The object itself was glowing bright red. I estimate the brightness to be one large sized unit of exploding fireworks. Maybe even somewhat brighter. I heard no sound (contrary to what others witnessed two days later Sunday night with another fireball). There was no streetnoise otherwise in the area. SIZE: The size of the red glowing object was no larger than 1/16 of a full moon, and the streak was approx. 12 inches in length from the edge of my hand when outstreched in front of me.((Name deleted))", "We saw a spherical, metallic object in the west.  Moving extremely fast to the west.  No way to determine the size of the craft as we didn&apos;t know how far away from us it was.One mile south of shea on Hwy 87, I and daughter saw a metallic sherical object off in the west.  It was close enough to discern that it had no wings.  Travelled westerly at 10 times the speed of a commercial craft. When mentioned this too son traveling in another car.  He said, you saw that too?", "I saw this when I was in the navy and was afraid to talk about it for years. Isaw it in the middle of the night as it lifted up off what was known at that time as the back of the base.", "while traveling east on Hwy 50 I spotted a cluster (6 or 7?) of red lights in the northeast sky app. 9:00 angle. They appeared to be connected as moving in unison.  (Put me in mind of Phoenix lights, for some reason) We were stopped at a stoplight at the time.  I asked my companion if she saw the Lights, but she did not, I watched for several seconds till they were out of line of vision.  They appeared to be traveling down toward horizon.A friend and I were traveling East on Royal Gorge Hwy in Canon City, when I spotted a cluster (loose) of several bright red lights in the (slightly) northeast sky.  My friend could not see the lights when I tried to point them out.  I watched for several seconds till they were out of my line of vision.  There were trees, buildings, etc in the way. Since I was in an enclosed car with other traffic sounds, I could not tell if there was any sound.  Later that evening while talking with another friend who lives on the 13th floor of apt building.  She interrupted me to ask if I had seen the lights. Evidently she had seen the same thing. She said they appeared to land and blink out.  They did not seem too far away, though I have a depth perception problem and can not really judge.  I called the radio station, and no one had reported any lights.  She later called and they said two other people had reported lights.", "craft was stationary for app. 5 min., moved higher &amp; west, pulsed several times then disappearedI was driving on I270 between Germantown and Frederick when I saw the craft to my left (west).  The sky was mostly clear, and with the near-full moon, the shape of the craft was plainly visible.  It had small lights on the bottom and some lights around the circumference, some of which were pulsing.  There were about 4 planes flying in a large circular pattern around the craft (similar to planes flying around fireworks on 7/4).  The craft was stationary for about 5 minutes, moved (fast!) higher and to the west, pulsed several times, then disappeared.  After the craft had vanished, the flight-paths of the planes seemed to change, slowly criss-crossing back and forth across the area the craft had been in.  On my southbound return, I noticed many contrails coming from the area the craft had been in, going toward a point east/northeast (returning home?).", "On Saturday night 2 other persons and myself observed 4 primary targets in a parallel formation, traveling in the eastern horizon at about 120&apos;,the direction of travel was South to North. (prior to this I observed 1 target in the same direction of travel 15 minutes prior, this must been a lead craft) they appeared to be square shaped with a orange white glow, like when the sun goes down,they appeared to be turning in a clockwise direction. As they continued North Bound they disappeared. I lost sight of them. The location of the sighting was in the backyard of my house. I have never seen this type of craft before. These targets were moving at est. 300 kts, I estimate the altitude at 18000-20000&apos;  this whole ordeal lasted apx. 30 seconds", "My friend and I had just got out of my car in my driveway, looked up to the night sky which was the western sky, and saw a small light, like the size of a star moving North West at a slow even pace I then said &quot;What is that!&quot;, and my friend said &quot;I don&apos;t know&quot;, then we said &quot;Maybe a satellite or a balloon&quot;, then it quicky picked up speed shot straight up into the sky and disappeared.", "&quot;Two Craft&quot;,strobe light effects,the ability to ; hover ,turn at right angles ,disappear ,reappear , accelerate quickly ,lose altitute at tremendous speedsOn Hwy#10 north in the west sky .

We got out and viewed for three minutes two craft that were flashing like strobe lights.They started out hovering together, then , each craft took one turn at some sort of a flight pattern.While one craft hovered , the other would fly extremly fast across the horizon where it instantly turned at a right angle, then flew quickly across the sky in that direction while at the same time losing altitute ,  then it disapppeared instantly. Afew seconds later it appeared in the sky in another location. Then it flew across the horizon back to the other stationary craft. Then the stationary craft did a similar flight pattern to the first craft ,while the other remained stationary. When the second craft had finished its flight pattern , both craft hovered together for a few seconds and then before our eyes without a blink they both diappeared. Each craft was a light like a strobe light doing spectacular flight patterns.Both craft were completely silent with no exhaust trail . Due to the brightness of the strobe type lights there was an aura or haze around them, a glow.", "While walking with two friends in single file. First in line stopped and said something to second friend who was also second in line with myself following in rear. Second friend turned to me and said to look up. As I did I saw three objects moving very fast over head. At which point I immediately said, &quot;Those are UFO&apos;s!&quot;On the night of July 12, 1993, at 11:30PM, myself and two friends left my house in downtown Niagara Falls to travel by foot approximately 6 blocks in a northerly direction. While transiting between two fairly large buildings (4-8 stories) and traveling through a gravel parking lot single file, my first friend turned to my second friend, who was also second in line and said something, all while keeping pace and in step. After about one more step, my second friend, the one second in line, turned to me and said to &quot;look up&quot;, at which point I did. I immediately said, &quot;THOSE ARE UFO&apos;S!.&quot;  I have been involved since my teenage years with aircraft. I used to wash airplanes for rides at the local airport. I&apos;ve had the opportunity to fly in just about any and every type of aircraft imaginable, from hot air balloons over Niagara Falls to flying sailplanes around Pike&apos;s Peak. I have flown in acrobatic biplanes, helicopters and in general I am familiar with most modern and historic aircraft and their flight capabilities. What I and my friends saw at the time of the incident was unlike anything I/we had ever witnessed conventional aircraft do. Both friends have at least some form of familiarity with aircraft simular to my own. When I looked overhead, what I saw was three objects traveling in a northerly heading, from S.W. to N.E. at a relatively high altitude. 5,000 feet + and very fast speed. The speed was very fast for the altitude, as aircraft appear to the eye to move more slowly, the higher the altitude. There was no sound, either direct to ground or doppler effect. The three lights (at the aft portion of craft, as they traveled away) appeared to be a singular circular white glow, with a pink tinge encirling the circle of white light. As we were watching the three lights speed across the night sky, the object on the left, #1, broke off to the left, or west, at about 20 degrees from the other two. Just prior to this break-off, the other two craft, #2 and #3, oscillated in and out in a sort of &quot;bump&quot; manueavor. It was at that point that the #1 craft changed course and started to vere left and upward into the sky. All three objects then began to race upward and outward away from the earth and disappear with one craft on the right, #3 remaining for a moment longer and then too disappeared upward and away from the earth. The two aerodynamic annomalies that struck all of us were the craft&apos;s ability to rapidly move side to side and their upward arc away from the earth, as opposed to following the earth contour, horizon to horizon, as you would expect &quot;normal&quot; aircraft to do. Duration of the incident was about 20-30 seconds.", "Reported by my girlfriend&apos;s son, seen over North Chico. He described a very large craft with several lights, not blinking.Not much more to report--see summary.

It was a cool night quiet night on a Sunday when I looked in the sky to my left I saw a small orange object about the size of a quarter moving fairly slow almost due west. I didn&apos;t think much about it because was heading toward the airport. I watched it fly away then I saw another.it was closer about the size of a coffee sauser flying in the same direction, it was orange almost translucent and round. I was watching it and it dawned on me...no sound at all. It was moving slowly from the ground it looked about 20 miles an hour. At this point I ran inside to get my roommate. When we got back out side we watched it for about a min before it flew over the mountin. I was watching for more to my left when my roommate yelled &quot;what the hell is that!&quot; when I turned to my right the same orange color but it was about the size of the early full moon flying over the house next door(we were about 20 feet from the house next door) It shook me up no sound what so ever. While we were standing there watching it it split into two seperat circles and started flying side by side. At this point I ran in the house and grabed the phone and called the police department and ran back outside.I ask them to see if they had an officer in the area just to see if they could see it but they blew me off, so I called the Sheriff&apos;s dept but there was no one in the area where the lights were going. After the what ever it was went over the mountin there were no more. The next day when I went to work I was talking about the objects and the shift Sgt that was on the street that night(he was patroling north of where I saw the lights) said that about that same time his electric locks in his car started flicking back and forth for about 30 seconds.", "I was outside with my girlfriend looking at the moon with my telescope and something passed within my line of sight,i looked up from the telescope and watched a v shaped solid craft floating about 300-500 feet off the ground headed due north east.the craft was completely silent ,it had no lights on it and produced no jet stream.we watched it glide by for about 5-7 seconds until it left our line of sight.setting:10:15 out on my balcony looking at the moon through my telescope ,temp.approx.58degrees ,quiet neighborhood. object:black brown color,v shaped appeared to be gliding through the air heading northeast just above the treeline,no lights no sound whatsoever about 2 moons wide from my vantage point.", "Red fireball travelling south to north with tail 4 or 5 times size of object.

The residential power on my block was out, but the street lights were still functioning. I had opened up my blinds in order to let in some of this light. With the power out, I became very bored, and called up my friend to chat (my phone was still functioning). While I talked to her, I was casually studying the sky outside my window. It was then that I noticed a green glowing ball in the sky. I informed my friend, and she causually brushed it off. I, in turn, became intrigued. Within the next hour, I saw five more of these objects. They appeared in the South-East part of the sky, and traveled soundlessly to the North-West, where they dissappeared out of my view. They flew at what appeared to be the same altitude as the planes that usually fly in the area, though, curiously, I can&apos;t recall any planes in the area at the time. I know that the objects weren&apos;t planes. I live realitively near O&apos;Hare airport, and have literaly hundreds of planes fly over me every year. I know what they look like, and sound like, and these objects were denfinatly not them. These objects were sphereical and neon green. They looked a bit like comets without tails. At this point, I have no idea what I saw on that night. My friend (the one I was on the phone with) has spent a great deal of time trying to convince me to drop the subject, saying that it was probably something very normal. I then pointed out to her that green flying balls are *not* normal. I want to know what was in the sky that night, flying over my head.

I had just gotten in the bed in the sleeper compartment of the truck when my husband asked me to come up front and look at this weird light coming at us. By the time I got up and put my glasses on it was getting very close to us. It was a triangle shaped craft and was very dark in color. I would say black or very dark green. It was silent and only about 1,000 feet above our truck, that we had pulled over to the side of the road. We were on hwy. 278. and just after the sighting, I got the name of the small town and wrote it down, along with the time and date. We have had several sightings and I would be so excited or should I say scared that I wouldn&apos;t even think to write any information down. I did have a camera and camcoder with me but I was so excited that I didn&apos;t even think about picking one on them up. I said that I would if we ever had another sighting. This is not an easy thing to do when your scared. The craft started off being off to our left and then came toward our truck and then passing right over the top of us.

I think it was about the size of a BB held at arms length.I got a good look at it. It moved so fast I could hardly follow it with my eyes. My father saw one of these almost twenty years ago, and chased it with his airplane.", "I saw one triangular shaped craft, it had two very big randomly flashing lights(bluish white color).This was a roughly triangular shaped craft with two whitish blue brilliant lights which lit up the craft making it&apos;s shape visible.  The craft seemed to be huge because it was above the clouds and the size of it was amazingly big compared to if there was a 747 at that height.  It had a sound of that which if you took a very large electromagnet and applied a considerable amount of current to it(a sort of a deep humming sound with a pulse in it).  We saw that the craft just seemed to be passing by going north then changed direction to northwest.  The sky was clear with some clouds and some stars.  The color of the craft seemed to be a metallic bluish black surface.

As soon as it had reached its maximum brightness, it moved in a straight line from the northwest, where it first appeared, to the north. Within about half to three quarters of a second it had gone behind a tree so I could no longer keep track of it. It was much too fast for an aeroplane or satellite, and considerably slower than a meteorite. I couldn&apos;t really tell its altitude.

We did see one car on a distant road, but it&apos;s lights were not pointing in our direction. Suddenly, a bright blue &quot;fireball&quot; (for lack of a better word) streaked across the sky. It had no distinct shape that we could recall, only a big blue ball of bright light. It could not have been more than 1000ft in the air above us and had a deafening roar. The event lasted no more than a few seconds as it roared across the sky. I would say from east to west. I had seen meteors by that age and knew it was not a meteor. This was a very intense light and was not from something burning up. It was a very brilliant light. I am not sure that it left any sort of trail, but I believe it did not. The event was reprted on the local news the that evening and UFO enthusiasts were out the next evening searching the skies with spotlights and such.

It was mid-December of 1998, approximately. There was no noise whatsoever as it passed over my home at an extremely low rate of speed while heading directly west. The Lehigh Valley International Airport is nearby so I am aware of the various shapes of aircraft lights at night and this object did not fit the light patterns that are  known to me.

It was particularly dark that night, no moon or new moon.  The atmosphere was especially clear and the stars were brilliant from horizon to horizon. Many of the neighborhood kids were congregated in the road in front of our home talking when I noticed that all of the stars on the eastern horizon began to &apos;wink&apos; out.  Thinking it might be a cloud system moving in, I continued watching.  The object was moving slowly yet too quickly to be a cloudbank.  There was no wind or breeze.  As it approached overhead, we could make out only five, dim white lights stretching out north to south along the bottom of the craft.  It passed overhead, silently and steadily, and continued until it disappeared over the western horizon. The entire incident took maybe five minutes.  We were all asking each other if we could make out a shape, but because of the inky black sky, none us could make out any perceptible shape.  It was enormous however, based on the large expanse of starlit sky that it covered.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The sky was becoming light but the sun had not risen yet. As I came over the top of a ridge I saw an extremely bright light in the sky ahead of me that appeared to be moving down towards the horizon in a gradual, steady motion and also appeared to be shimmering or pulsating. Being somewhat of a skeptic I attributed the movement I perceived to the fact that I was coming over the top of a ridge and going back down the other side and I attributed the shimmering aspect the the crisp cold air. As I came across the next ridge the object now was in full view and stayed in the same position for the next several minutes. It really grabbed my attention because it was at least three to four times brighter than a star. I thought several times that it was possibly a planet in the morning sky buy it was extremely bright, a white/silver color. I continued to observe the object for several minutes while it appeared to be stationary. There was no movement and as the morning light increased there was no change in the brightness of the object. I stopped at the QT quick mart at the intersection of Hwy 94 and O&apos;Fallon Rd to grab a soda and a bag of pretzels. As I stepped out of my car I gazed at the object for a period to try to ascertain exactly what it might be, it was extremely bright, still about three to four times brighter than the brightest star I have observed and in the western morning sky all by itself. I quickly ran in to get what I needed, I would guess it took me a total of 45 seconds to one minute because I knew exactly what I wanted and I was the only customer in the store. When I stepped out of the store the first thing I did was look up where the object had been to look at it again and it was gone! This was obviously not a plane or a star.", "saw 2 very bright objects in western sky, one disappearing from view somehow (not sure where it went) the other object was huge, triangular, w/a few lights on the sides + middle.  was flying very low and no soundDriving home late one night last fall, my boyfriend and I were heading from the east side of Rockford to the west side.  Immediately, we noticed 2 very bright lights in the western sky and they appeared to be flying quite low.  I assumed they were helicopters because they were too low to be planes, plus they were not going very fast.  Within a minute, we lost sight of one of the objects and it never did reappear.  What happened to it, I do not know.  The other object, however, was within view during our whole trip home.  The farther west we drove, the larger this object began to appear.  As we neared home, the object was nearly overhead and it seemed huge.  It was triangular in shape.  We were so concerned with what it was that we pulled over the car on a side street and got out to get a good look at it.  We could not figure out what the hell it was!  It was at least the size of a commercial airplane, but I believe it was possibly quite a bit bigger...it was hard to judge the actual size and distance away, but it was flying extremely low...I would estimate it was flying no higher than 1000-2000 feet above the ground.  There were a few lights on the sides and one or two in the middle...cannot remember the color of these lights, but I believe they were white and possibly blue.  The object produced absolutely NO SOUND WHATSOEVER.  That was how we were certain that it was not a plane...unless it was some kind of military craft, but rarely do any military craft fly over Rockford, and even if they did, why would they do so at 1 am?  This object was flying towards the south at a very slow but steady rate of speed, but then took an extremely sharp turn to the west, and we then lost track of it because trees were blocking our view from where we had gotten out of the car.

It was moving vertically and the craft was also vertical as if standing on end. I watched it descend and saw it through the trees.

I went outside in my backyard about 4:30 a.m. to get another look as it was so facinating, when I noticed an object moving through the sky very quickly and it was white in the front and had an orange/bluish contrail.  I found this interesting as it wasn&apos;t falling from the sky, it was moving perpendicular to the Earth.  Then, I saw dark objects following it.  And how I saw this was due to the fact they crossed in front of stars.  One of my roomates came out and saw the objects following the colorful object.

It went up at about the same speed as a large firework and then came down.  At that moment I percieved the light to be a firework.  Then we saw it come out from the mountains farther to the left.  It shot out of view.  Now after this happened shivers shook all through my body.  The second look assured me it was no firework.

I pulled to the curb shut off the car engine and listened for the sound of a motor. this residential area is very quiet and no sound came from the object until it was almost dierectly overhead. that is when I heard a single pop or more like a crack, as you might here from an electrical arc .from high above, I checked the time it was 7:59.  my nine year ol d granddaughter would be out of the meeting so i continued to the school a few blocks away. A couple of streets west and turning south again on Glendora Ave. I looked back to wher it should have been but there was nothing. when I arrived back home I took out my binoculars and went outside to my driveway. At about 8:30 p.m. to the north of my house are high voltage transmition lines,about 1.1/2 mi away .

We could see the outline of the wings in the sky.When we spotted the light, we joked that it was a UFO then we noticed it was not moving, but hovering.  The red lights seemed very tiny but the white light that first caught our attention was huge.  It was larger than the landing light under a normal plane.  I came to a stop to observe it.  Then the lights turned to green and there seemed to be several around the outline of the wings.  About that time, it started in our direction.", "Lights and glowing craft seen by several people in several cars, which stopped on the road to observe.

We saw it out of the window. we lost track of it and then saw it again whan we reached our destination.We were driving down the road, I was in the back seat of the car. It looked like it was circular, there would be a light and than right in front of it another light would appear. It looked like it was turning in the sky, the way the lights turned. About 2 minutes later we lost it, but when we reached where we were going, we could see it again. My mom, &quot;one of the other people&quot;, said that it seemed like it followed us.

Same intensity in the its light when falling, but appr 5 degrees above horizon it fades like if it had burned and then faded very quickly and left a track of glowing particles that however disssappeared within a second. It could have been fireworks, but it didn&apos;t look like any firework I or the other witnesses have seen. It seemed very large to be a firework, and it stood still such a short time and then raced towards the ground. No explosion was heard as fireworks often give. A pretty bad forework would it have been that glowed for such a short time. The light of the sphere was very bright and very large and clearly bluish/greenish, so a star is absolutely out of the question. A falling particle from space? No, it suddenly appeared on one spot and stood still there for appr half of a second. Observer one (me): 23 year old medicine student. Observer two: 48 year old MD.

One below the belt of orion and the other to my right which appeared to be a planet. Then I saw a metallic craft pass across the sky right infront of me without any sort of illumination. I coudn&apos;t quite see an exact formation, but I did notice the head of the craft was rounded but the rest just seemed to blend into the sky. This craft disappeared within 6 seconds and the other two lights remained in their position of the constellation without further movement.", "It was about the size of a mid-sized car. Very Bright yellowish orange. It moved parallel to the ground.the sky was dark and there were only a few lights in the parking lot. The glow from the object was very VERY bright. It moved across the horizon at a slow pace. It looked somewhat oval with a haze surround the edges.  I could tell that it was pretty high up in the sky, but at the same time, it was really big.  There were no trails at all.", "I observed a bright light in the distance that seemed to be making some very strange/irregular/quick movements across the night sky.  The object kept getting closer as it was heading our direction.  We pulled over off an exit ramp and observed the triangular shaped object silently hovering overhead.One night, years ago, sometime between 1967/68, while driving home from a movie with my younger brother and my best friend (actually, my friend was driving, I was the front sea passenger), I observed a bright light in the distance making some very impressive, yet highly unorthodox, movements across the distant sky.  As we continued to observe and we realized we were approaching the object and that it was heading our way too.  The strange motion behavior I&apos;m referring too, is it would appear to quickly race across the sky, come to a virtual standstill, then quickly dash across the sky in another completely different direction, where it would once again appear to just halt in the sky.  It was a single bright light and did not have any flashing lights (typical of conventional aircraft).  This observational phase went on for a few minutes.  Eventually, we realized it was getting real close as we pulled off the highway exit ramp and pulled over.  We were in an old ragtop VW so we didn&apos;t even have to get out of the car to witness what we then saw.  Much to our astonishment, virtually hovering right over our head @ approximately 500-1,000 feet was a single, black, triangle shaped object.  It had lights on each of its three tips, but none of them blinked, and they were all white/yellow in color.  Needless to say, we were all blown away.  We had never seen or heard of anything like what we were now observing.  As we watched, the object literally just floated silently overhead in a very small circle course, right overhead.  I remember verbally describing it in detail to my friend, so we could both validate we were observing, as frankly, it was very difficult to believe, event though we were all seeing ith with our own eyes.  It was black, and totally silent.  It would just slowly hover overhead or just come to a complete standstill.  Becasue it was a clear night and the visibility was good, we could clearly see that it did not have wings and it certainly was no helicopter or any other conventional aircraft.  It w! as simply a black triangle with no markings or flashing lights of any kind.  It was completely silent in the quiet night sky; no prop sounds; no jet sounds.  After watching it for a few minutes, it quit circling overhead and started to fly away slowly.  Then, as quickly as you could blink your eye, it suddenly just shot off into the night sky faster than a bullet, without so much as emitting a single sound.  It was truly an astonishing event to observe.  We were all excited and drove home where we told our story to my disbeleining mom and dad.  I actully called the local police dept. and Miami International airport to tell them what we saw and ask them if they had seen the object or traced it on radar.  Both indicated that they didn&apos;t have a clue about what I described. None-the-less, my friend, my brother, and I all knew what we saw, and it was very real, and it wasn&apos;t anything that we knew existed in conventional aircraft.  Over the years, I learned to just remain silent on the subject, as the usual response was one of disbelief.  Frankly, that didn&apos;t bother me too much, because had I not seen what I saw with my own eyes, I too would&apos;ve had a very hard time believing it.  Then, I saw a special on TV recently (where I got your webpage info) and was totally blown away to discover that other people had also seen triangular UFOs!  Prior to that, I thought all UFOs were circular or cigar shaped, as that&apos;s mostly what was represented in the various UFO books that I had stumbled on over the years.  However, I must confess, that I have always been an airplane bluff and have kept pretty current over the years, so I was totally blown away when I first saw our F-117 Stealth plane.  It made me wonder, &quot;where did the air force come up with that idea/design?&quot;  Also, I have since actually seen the F-117 and though my memory has definitely faded some over the years, I&apos;d guess that the physical size of the triangle we saw, was about the size of an F-117.  However, what we saw was definitely NOT an F-117, as they can hove! r and they are louder than hell.  Needless to say, I am convinced that what we saw over 30 years ago was definitely not of this earth.", "looking in eastern sky. i witnessed what appaered to be a star moving in the shape of a figure 8 around a couple other stars, then it stopped. this happened 2 nights in a row at approx. the same time at nighti witnessed what appeared to be a &quot;star&quot; move in a figure 8. it started to move in the figure and returned to it&apos;s origional position and stop. it did this two or three consecutive nights at approx. the same time each night. this event lasted only about 1 minute or so. this was witnessed only by myself because by the time i got somebody (other family members) the event was over with. we were at our cottage in ONTARIO CANADA, on a fairly secluded lake with very little man made lights to obscure the night sky. our cottage is located in MABERLY ONTARIO, (approx. 1 hour noth of KINGSTON ONTARIO, on BOBS LAKE. only if you have further questions or similar situations, or even a reasonable answer, do you need to contact me. i just thought that this was a very unusual event. thank you for your time", "White and red objects in sky videotaped over Tallahassee, Fl is a no go.

I observed the craft fly through or above one cloud.   I tried to show my 16-year old son, but it was almost invisable and I lost sight of it after seeing it only three times as it moved north in a straight line.I am a retired deputy sheriff.  I have lived in Elk Grove for almost 30 years.  I have always been interested in aircraft.  When I was assigned to Sacramento&apos;s Metro Airport, I became very familiar with the many different models of commercial, military, and private airplanes and jet aircraft.  I still watch aircraft flying high over the Sacramento/Elk Grove area.  I can usually identify the model of aircraft (747s, DC10s, 727s, 737s, DC-9/80s, B-52s, KC-135s, KC-10s, etc.).  I have never seen a &quot;UFO&quot; before. The single craft was almond shaped with the widest part at the rear.  The edge around the object appeared to be white.  The space inside the perimeter of the object was almost transparent.  I could see the blue sky through it.  The white edge around the craft looked like a slow spinning gear.  It moved north in a straight line.  The craft was flying at a high altitude.  It had no wings and it did not emit smoke.  There was no contrail.  No lights.  No sound.  At high altitude, it was longer than, and much wider than, a high flying B-52.  At least two times as wide.  It was not moving across the sky as fast as a large jet aircraft.  Because it was transparent, I can&apos;t estimate how tall it was.  I have never seen anything like this object.  It was not a large helicopter.  It was not a hot air balloon.  It did not look capable of flight. I tried to show my son the object, but I lost sight of it twice when I momentarily looked away.  I saw it two more times and then lost sight of it as it moved farther away.

I looked up and was startled to see a v-shaped thing in the sky with 5 amber colored lights that really stood out in contrast to the brilliant white stars on that pitch black night.It was either incredibly enormous, or really low. It was almost stationary, and made absolutely no noise. My friend took off running, and was sobbing in fear. He made me swear to never tell his colleagues of this, or to ever bring the matter up in his presence.", "Was observing a jet aircraft, at altitude and manifesting contrail.  Suddenly, a second object, brightly reflecting sunlight, closed rapidly behind the jet from the aft starboard quarter.  I lost visual of said object as I scrambled outside with my digital camera, and never reacquired a visual on the unknown.  I would estimate object in question was at about 1500 yards distance from jet aircraft when observed, and closed distance by approximately half in the short duration of the observed event.  Whatever it was, it was way too close to the jet aircraft for normal flight spacing parameter&apos;s for safety.  No contrail observed from unknown!Only additional information I can add is that the jet aircraft was in a Northwesterly heading at time of said event!  The unknown was in a more westerly heading during time of event, as if to intersect with the contrail a few hundred yards behind jet!  Unknown appeared to be highly reflective of sunlight, but no reflection or glare from sun was observed from airframe at same time of sighting/event.  Though I am in Cumberland County, I believe the event ocurred over Franklin County to my west.  This was my 2nd such sighting of this type in this same air corridor over the last year or so!

I also called my mom, and local authorities.  The two appeared to come closer as I flashed my lights, and as I drove with lights out to track them, I saw an additional vehicle transport from one craft, to the other.  In the valley (over water) called Stateline Cove, I then saw several, but moving so rapidly in every direction (1 mile away) I was unsure of the #.  I actually saw them land repeatedly on water, then rise again.  One brighter one stayed high up as to stand watch.

I used a fence with a sign in the foreground, with rapid shots, to show movement.  I contacted my brother also, and another neighbor to watch.  I saw a pattern in their movement in an area I am very familiar with, so I was able to track them all the way to my house.  The main colors were two clear (blueish) lights, one in lower left and one in upper right that would flash, then immediately many red lights would flash.  Object could travel any direction, and disappear and reappear at will, but did keep somewhat of a pattern. Always a &quot;lookout&quot; craft before the others would move from one location to another.  I have photos from two sides of the crafts at one point, and they seemed to travel counter clockwise, beginning in the west from my standpoint. I marked all my locations.  The objects did not go away, I simply got exhausted chasing them, sometimes traveling well in excess of 80mph.  Please contact me for more info, I am very thorough.  Almost forgot, before I walked outside at the lakehouse, I heard a large, loud aircraft I figured was a DC-10, but didn&apos;t get sight of it.  Objects also flew very near GA Power Plant!

I have hesitated to write about it until now.  No one would have (nor did) take me seriously in 1966.  Perhaps there were other sightings by people who did not think that such things happened in the 1960&apos;s.  I was 13 years old.  I had been sleeping soundly in my bed when I awoke for some reason.  My bed was just below the window in my bedroom.  For some reason, I got on my knees and stared out the window.  At the end of the cul-de-sac, directly in front on my window, there was a UFO hovering above the ground.  It was very large, circular in shape, but with many layers to it.  Nothing that looked like the shape of an eye. Many straight edges, and lots of colored lights.  I was on my knees staring at it for the longest time.  I didn&apos;t doubt that I was awake as I pinched myself numerous times and in the morning I noticed the welts I myself had inflicted.  My sister was in the room with me but she was sound asleep.  My parents in the next room but I knew I would catch &quot;heck&quot; if I awakened them..  It was a working day the next day for the both of them.  I also KNEW that if I uttered a single sound, whoever was in the UFO would hear, and leave.  And I didn&apos;t want that just yet.  I watched the object to see if anything was going in or out or if there was any movement at all.  There wasn&apos;t.  I was able to see it quite clearly as at the end of the cul-de-sac there was a street lamp.  It gave a little illumination, but the colored lights themselves provided quite a bit.  I was in awe of this object.  It hovered precisely between two houses, on an empty lot that had yet to be developed.  I summoned up enough courage to open the window.  I hung my head out, listening.  Not a single sound.  I mean, not a SINGLE sound.  I pulled my head back in and latched the window.  I continued to watch.  After about 10 minutes, the lights started flickering, and something underneath began to rotate.  The UFO rose very slowly up into the air.  And hovered again.  It then started to move, across the tops of trees, he! ading in a westerly direction.  It moved with the speed of a helicopter, over the tops of many trees, until just as I thought it would move completely out of sight, it took off on a steep angle and climbed to the stars.  There had been no sound at all the entire time.  I marvelled at what I had seen and went back to bed.  The next day I told my story to anyone who would listen and was met with complete skepticism.  I don&apos;t tell the tale unless the subject comes up.", "First off I just want to say I have no idea what is going on in Ft smith Ark Also I just want to say I was not going to report this at all because I can not believe that within the last week I have seen 2 objects to which I have no explanation for.my wife saw this one also so i will let her explain.

Fireball was bluish green (possibly the nickel composition) and a 3 to 400 yard  tail of the same color.  The speed was remarkable considering its acute angle it maintained till it went down.  I thought it hit the ground close to Waples Pond on Route One, but I understand other people saw it land in a field near Lewes; and again I received email from Delaware State News employee saying they saw it pass East of Millsboro, Delaware.  That&apos;s about 25 miles difference; it was difficult to judge since it seemed to be so close to the ground and then the intense light went out.  Since it was dark, I might have lost track of it as it past me due to trees, etc.  At any rate, I called 911 to make sure that they new of a possible impact and/or fire; they probably thought I was crazy.  Many people had to see it, because it was traveling approximately 150 yards south of route 1. The fireball was somewhere between the size of a baseball or larger than a basketball...it was impossible to distinguish by the violent ball of fire.  It was just beautiful and something I will never forget.  Maybe some farmer or some hunter trekking through the field/woods will find it someday and we can recall this moment all over again!  I imagine there is a lot of mass left because it maintained such great speed.  Because of such an acute angle, it either skipped across the ground or left a large gash on the earth&apos;s surface.  I don&apos;t think it can hide forever!  Wish I had time to investigate, check for large burn area, etc...this is a large area to cover.  I talked to radio station and also State newspaper and they&apos;re putting the word out, too. Above statement was used to report to other people I know in Delaware. Since then, I have come to the conclusion that what I saw relative to my traveling south in my car was seemingly close, but may have been several miles away and with a higher altitude.  Nevertheless the relative speed must have been faster than I originally thought.  From what a few people have told me, I have rough coordinates...it may have landed in the Indian River, a body of water in Southern Delaware.  I know more people saw this as it was traveling within obvious view of Route One which heads north and south, becoming route 113 by Dover AirForce Base and north. Delaware State News recommended I report this to you. Please let me know if there were any other sightings beyond Southern Delaware. Thanks in Advance!

I live in the country and I was going to drive into town to get to my work place.  I was with a co-worker who lived on the way to town (we were car pooling).

What is that thing?&quot;  I am not an aircraft expert, but that thing didn&apos;t look like any aircraft I&apos;ve ever seen.  It was in a sort of oval shape, more like an egg.  It was a dark gray color.  There weren&apos;t any lights or anything like that.  The object made no noise.  It was about 1000 feet in the air and it was moving very fast across the sky.  Then there was a jet aircraft chasing after it about three seconds after the craft passed.  The jet made jet noises, unlike the craft.  The craft didn&apos;t have any jet engines, but it was going so fast that it would almost have to.  Both me and my co-worker didn&apos;t know what the craft was.

The object was as bright as a welder&apos;s arc, and remained stationary for almost half an hour. Occasionally the object would disappear, and reappear in the exact spot. The clouds surrounding the object had dozens of lights &quot;swimming&quot; through them.  The lights looked like the end of a Hollywood searchlight, were not coming from the ground, and seemed to be inside the clouds.  The lights followed the boundaries of the clouds, and when they would travel from one cloud to the next, the would disappear until they reached the next cloud. These lights darted about like fish in water, and seemed to have some sort of repetitive pattern to their movement. We called the St. Louis Police Department and several news stations, but the incident was brushed off as &quot;probably just lights coming from the airport&quot;. Well, the airport is 25 miles from the location at which we observed the object and lights, and we could not imagine how the airport could have been &quot;beaming&quot; lights of this nature to this location.  Nor would it explain the triangular shaped object, which appeared and disappeared in the same spot in the sky several times in the half hour we watched it.  This object was not a faint glow, it was extrememly distinct and bright. I have included an animated rendering of what we saw in an e-mail I sent to you.

I looked at it with binoculars, but could not make out any detail.  I thought about waking my mom, but she had taken some back medication, and was in too deep a sleep.  I was about to get my camera, and run out to the craft, but I then remebered watching a show on UFO.  The people that got too close to UFO would have there electronic equiptment shut down.  And, people that got too close would recieve radiation poisoning, or if they were really unfortunate, get abducted.  I watched it for 20 more minutes, then, the light was gone.

Each morning, before daybreak,  on the way to work I saw a triangle formation of three lights in the sky, west of Bud Wilson Road. Knowing that their is a small public airport in that direction, I did not think much of it the first morning. The formation looked as though an airplane had a nose light and two wing lights. The formation changed as though the airplane was making performing maneuvers(sp?. I thought it was odd though, because I lived around the airport for thirty years and know what to expect as far as how airplane sound and look. This aircraft had no sound and the lights seemed to stretch apart and contract further that a normal light formation  on any aircraft that I had ever seen. The next morning, I saw it again. This time I slowed down to get a better look. Once again, the formation was very odd and their was no sound. Their is a mojor International Airport aprox. 20 miles past the small public airport that I mentioned earlier, so I thought that perhaps I was witnessing landing trafic at that airport. But that did not turn out to be the case either. The third morning, I slowed down once again and studied the formation. The lights traveled in a triangle formation. The two trailing lights would stretch apart untill one of the trailing light would become the leading light and this would continue with the lights alternating. The road that I traveled goes South for aprox one mile, then curves to the west and goes about two and one half miles, like two sides of a rectangle. I could tell that the formation was confined to this area. Finally, on the forth morning, the aircraft decided to follow me along the road. It was not directly over me. I could look out the window and see it(the lights that is). Still no sound. Keep in mind that this is a very dark and quite area at 6:00 in the morning. Their are no buildings or traffic. Just a cattle farm on one side and some hunting land on the other. By the time I got to the end of Bud Wilson Road, it was no longer there. I lost it while tring to stay on the road. Then the fifth morning was the one that really onvenced me that this was no airplane or passenger jet. This morning, when I first spotted the formation, I pulled the truck over, rolled down the window, cut off the engine, and enjoyed the show. The formation appeared first to the west, over the trees. I watched the strange change of formations for a few minutes. Then the formation  came toward me. The change in formation did not always coraspond(sp?) with a change in direction. TIt came so close that it no longer appeared over trees, but directly in the sky above me.

It moved in a straight line across the sky heading west to east , and then sudenly vanished.  It was traveling very slowly (slower than most prop planes-less than 200 mph).It was a small blue ight.  I had just steped outside and saw it.  At first I thought it was a satalite.  But it was too bright as the sky was not that dark.  i called my girfriend outside, she saw it too and suggested it might be an airplane.  I am in the Air Force and I could tell that it wasn&apos;t behaving like a normal prop plane.  the single constant light, the percieved altitude (10,000 ft) didn&apos;t seem to be typical of the normal aricraft that are present in the area.She agreed that it didn&apos;t look like an airplane. She said, &quot;wow, I don&apos;t know what that would be.&quot;  I said that I was going to go down stairs to my apartment and look at it through my roomates binoculars.  the object was traveling slowly so I would have enough time.  I ran down stairs fumbled with the lock opened the door, grabed the binoculars (35x), and went out on the back deck(the object had traveled over the apartment by now).  I could hear my girlfriend discussing the object with her roomate on the deck above me.  I looked at the object through the binoculars and it didn&apos;t reveal anything more.  I saw no craft or airplane as I was half expecting to see.  It looked like a star would look under a telescope, just a point of blue light moving across the sky.  the poit was much sharper and smaller under the power of the binoculars but that was the only change.  I then reached up to the deck above and handed my girlfriend the binoculars and let her look at the object. when the object had traveled most of the length of the skyand was slowly moving away, it suddenly dissapeared.  It just faded out and was gone.  My girlfriend remarked, &quot;that was weird!&quot;  I said, &quot; I think that was a UFO.&quot;  through out the event the object made no sound as the other aircraft in the area were.", "Triangle, approx 75 degree, 5 bluish lights-tip &amp; 2 each side, NE to SW, No Sound, Fast, Large.While walking dogs object(s?) passed directly overhead.  Sky clear with bright stars and large broken clouds.  Five lights were seen in triangular pattern defining angle of about 75 degrees from apex.  Lights were white to bluish white and constant.  Movement was constant in speed and direction.  First impression was that of satellite movement - speed and size of lights similar to satellite observation, but in perfect &quot;V&quot; formation.  Appeared to be at or just above cloud level.  Was travelling parallel to and apparently in/above long cloud bank from NE to SW across valley.  Moved into and out of wisps of this cloud bank during observation. Traversed arc of approx. 25 degrees from my viewing position during about 5 seconds, until it was lost above clouds.  Absolutely quiet.  Unable to discern if this was one object at cloud level or a formation much at much higher altitude, but if it was at high elevation,it was very fast.  If it was lower, it was very quiet.", "Super Bright Ruby Red Lights Aproxmatly 1000 feet apart and aproxmate altatude of 3500 feet moving 5mph at times stationary totaly silent.Objects apeared in the southeastern sky at 3:45 am and moved in a north west direction and at times became totally stationary then turned southwest and slowly dissapeared. Total time overhead was 25 minutes. They were 2 miles south of Hobby airport and were observed by the control tower for 25 minutes. The control tower at Hobby Airport stated they had no Radar contact with the objects but did have visual sighting and were totally mystified. They stated they contacted the military and NASA and no one knew what they were.", "Moving lightLight about 1.5 times as bright as the stars seen in the NW sky about it was an airliner with the landing lights on,heading for a point over the landing lights on,heading for a point over me, then it started moving back and forth horizontally in a manner that a conventional aircraft would not do. after a few minutes it just went out... nothing but dark sky.", "A round bright light, the size of a baseball, with a halo around it, danced around my wall for about 10 seconds, then shot out of my window and my computer under the window turned itself on.I layed down on my bed and turned my bedlight off. My cat&apos;s nightly ritual is, she then jumps up next to me to get her bellly scratched. All of the sudden she flips over and looks at the wall. Her ears went straight up, so I looked at the wall to see what had her attention. There was a beautiful light the size of a baseball with a halo around it. The bright light danced on the wall for a few seconds, then it shot straight out my window. I live on the third floor of my apartments and my windows are heavily draped, including a black out shade that was pulled down. My cat was so freaked out. It took her a least 15 minutes to calm down.

I did not lhear any sound but I was indoors at the time of viewing.", "We looked up and saw something out of the ordinary. An apparent high flying airplane began to make improbable changes in direction.My wife and I were outside at midnight for the sake of our dog. I was watching our dog when suddenly my wife called to me to look up at the sky, to the south but nearly over head. Finally I saw what she was seeing.  It had about the dim visibility of a high flying plane.  But it made odd curved motions at what must have been fantastic speeds and changes of path that shouldn&apos;t have been possible.  Because we are near a major airport, there was air traffic visible with which to compare this object. It did not seem to be an airplane.  It was a light in the sky. But was it just reflecting moonlight or was it lit? I wonder if any of the flight crews saw what we did?", "While walking our dogs my son and I noticed a strange craft or light that seemed to travel in short spurts( not particularly fast). The craft then would completely stop and travel side to side or up and down. It travel out of sight and would come back into view until finally it stopped. Then my Daughter came out and noticed the exact same lights behind us a few miles away. I got my Binoculars and verified that they were vertically shaped lights that rotated in an intelligent fashion. We then saw tiny red lights and white ones exiting the craft from the top and re-entering at the bottom. We observed the sighting at about 9:50 and it was at 12 o&apos;clock high facing SOUTH with the other craft doing the opposite.See Above", "Large sphere, several projectiles and a rounded cube!Family of 5 witnessed large orange sphere moving west, stopping, moving south, stopping and hovering.

The cresent moon was bright enough to show the &apos;unlit&apos; protion in silouqete. I then noticed that there was a blinking light near to the lower left of the cresent. It seemed about as far away as the moon itself. At first I wondered if it were perhaps a star that was partly obscured by the moon, but it blinked red,yellowish-white and blue regularly. I informed my brother and his wife to observe it as well. As we watched it for about 5 minutes or so it moved slighly &quot;beneth&quot; the cresent itself. I came home, a drive of a couple of minutes tops, and grabed my binoculars to observe it. It seemed to be in relativly the same position and viewing it thru the binoculars confirmed that the object was outside the orbit of the earth. In fact it seemed to be holding a position close to the moon itself. I continuted to observe it for 10 to 15 minutes and the object maintained its position continuing to flash in the same manner as before. I came in to phone a friend in central Illinois to see if he was able to observe the same thing near to the moon as I, but unfortunatly the moon had set already from his vantage point. I came outside some short time later (about 2140) and the object was still in the sky however its position was further below the setting moon than previously.See above", "My Brother and I believed we saw something that sped up time with light&apos;s from a ship. While we were in transit with a Vessel to Seattle from Alaska&apos;s waterway&apos;s in the Wrangle Narrows, very brite white light&apos;s!!! almost a daylight effect on shore, I saw as I made us a snack in the galley, I ran to the bridge, tried to talk to my brother...turn on the light&apos;s his face had been burned, like a sun burn, only on part of his face...we were scared and didn&apos;t talk again until the next day, we didn&apos;t feel good...alittle werid feeling inside...you know? missing time I think also...we were wide awake it was our shift together while our father and the enginnier we sleeping.It was the summer of &apos;85, we all had finished our season as a tender in Alaska, our ship was a 300&apos; Vessel we were on our way to Seattle, there were four on board me (deleted) my brother (deleted) and our father (deleted) and our chief enginnier. Leaving the Gulf of Alaska, entering what is called Cape St. Elis, this is where you enter when there is bad sea&apos;s, it is also known as the inside passage, very beautiful passage you can almost jump off the ship to shore if you want to, the summer night&apos;s do not get dark, until 11:30 to 12:30.  My brother (deleted) is a first-mate and we share shift&apos;s together, ours is from 12 midnight to 6am,  were all up in bridge when I saw a Bright light under our ship, it lite up the whole ship under water we were in motion about 9 knots or so, can&apos;t go too fast in the passage, then it moved towards the bow of the vessel...within seconds it was gone? My father the Captain said I was a whale that was moving under us and the (phosferus) in the water was making the light...? mabe he was right but I remembered the jet that flew over head that woke us up earlier, it buzzed us a few times and was gone...we were very glad that we were on our way back home to Seattle! so nothing more about it...as our father said, are we ready to take over...warned us about going fast in here, we said don&apos;t worry we&apos;ll be fine, about this time I ask my brother if he was hungry, I said I&apos;ll go to the galley and make us something to eat...he said ok...I waited for a moment or two he said, what about the food?, I said ok then I traveled down the stairs to the galley, I was looking in the cooler to see what I can make... I think I started cooking on the grill or making sandwitches...I was looking out the porthole I saw the trees....wondering why I can see them so cleary? I was night time and It looked like daytime...so I heard my brother on the intercom yelling at me to come up to the pilot house!!!! so I ran up the stairs...as I got outside It was daylight! all around the ship! everywhere I looked I saw light it was bright at first, but my eyes were trying to get used to the light, I got upstairs finale and my brother is talking loud!!! can you see that? I said yeah I can...we opened the side door to the bridge and we could come out but I was stopped by him grabbing me saying Tony don&apos;t go!!!! as soon as we did stop or talk the light was gone...back to darkness...it was werid cause our or my eyes had to adjust back to the night....in silence for a long time my brother asked me did I see that? What Happened?....I turned on the light&apos;s and noticed that his face was burned, mine was alittle my right hand, had a werid burn on it, as I look on my hand now it&apos;s gone, I thought I would have that burn forever....my brother face cleared up the next day, mabe a few days...we told everyone we knew,  all thought we were crazy....by the way our trip back home? as soon as you leave the inside passage, you enter the outside Ocean,  it was to be bad weather....it was flat calm...not even a ripple...no wind...sunny skies all the way back to Seattle....that was very unusal for this time of year....I&apos;ll never forget what happened to me and my brother (deleted)!. I remember this as if it happened yesterday!....to be more detailed the lights did change from white to yellow, very bright colors, there was no sound...the night was black so fast as if someone turned out the light&apos;s? I know the object was round the shape was very huge much bigger and closer than I ever thought of to be, as the UFO left I did hear the engines again so mabe there was a sound?, there was not a loud sound that I remember? but we noticed that this did take time to do all this, It felt like seconds or a few minutes..but not 2 hours I notice that it was later than, it was alittle after 2am I believed it started around 12 ish...I guess the ufo went straight up or behind us cause there were light colored particles in the air, as if it sped away in a half a second, extermely fast, gone.&hellip;", "Prior to the full lunar eclipse I clearly saw an impact on the moon at the 11 o&apos;clock portion of the moon followed by a much smaller after shock. I always wanted to discuss this with Dr.Schumacher but his untimly demise saddened us all. I have had three other sightings but I have no frame of reference in currently accepted reality to explain them as I can with the lunar impact.Immediatly prior to the moon entering its peach orange phase preceding the full lunar eclipse, I saw an explosion on the moon that briefly extended from the 11 o&apos;clock postion outward into space to a distance of .20 lunar diameters. It dissipated quickly followed by an after shock less than a third the size of the first impact. Note I could only see the explosion from the edge of the moon outward into space. Only the black background of space allowed me to see this event which lasted an entire 4 seconds and fading to nothing in 6 seconds. While in Rochester I witnessed an inexplicable passage of two globes of soft nebulus lights six to eight inches in diameter. One followed two feet behind the first in the same trajectory. THEY WOULD NOT INTERACT WITH SOLID MATTER , PASSING THROUGH BRICK WALLS WITH ABSOLUTLY NO IMPEDENCE I tried to touch one of the globes. It had no discernable surface and with some trepidation I hesitated to penetrate its outer haze and it continued to pass through an inner wall about a foot below the ceiling. Since this event I do not recall a single week that I don&apos;t relive those brief moments. In fact my study of Hyperspace and 4th dimensional physics has been a great solace in understanding events we weren&apos;t taught in school.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

( we were in a vehicle )Since I was sitting in the back seat, must younger and much smaller I couldn&apos;t follow the shape of the object. All I remembered was seeing red and blue lights ( possibly had green light, I cant remember ) going over the tops of some trees. It was very low, practically touching the tops of the trees. The lights must have been at the back of the craft since the craft was moving forward. The lights were round and didn&apos;t seem to be going on and off. I was 15 yrs old then, I am now 41. Looking back over the years this has puzzled me a lot. I dont remember anything after that, I don&apos;t even remember going home. And no, I never used drugs. There was a lot of talk going on in the area at that time about ufo&apos;s being spotted. I never took any of it serious. I just went along for the ride. My main question is, were there really ufo&apos;s in that area that particular time in the 70&apos;s?", "While watching Prime Time live on TV, they stopped for the Crash of USAir Flight 427 and when showing the sky, the only object seen was a saucer with a dome.After seeing this described above we wrote to the Prime Time show requesting information about the above and were summarily ignored.", "These were four brightly luminous objects observed in the broad daylight.  They were lined up in a row-vertically.  They were all spherically shaped except the upppermost, which was shaped like a classic child&apos;s top.  They were all self-luminescent, and the appearance suggested some type of connecting, luminous cord.  All objects gave off a bright glow, similar to the glow given off by adjacent, moisture-laden clouds reflecting the bright sunlight.  The bottom sphere seemed to be smaller than the middle two, and, as stated before, the uppermost was shaped like your classic spinning top.  These objects would have never been detected had I not deliberately looked up.  I went in the house-they were first observed from my front porch-to get a camera.  When I returned, they were gone.

I stopped and got out of the car. It was a single white light and moved quite fast in one direction. I believed it could have been an airplane but if so, I would not have seen a steady white light, instead a flashing red strobe would have been visible. It was just before day break so it could be the sun reflecting the fuselage. The reason I tell you this is that I have seen this kind of light before, some years ago now.

We use our spa at least every other night, so we are familiar the activities  and the aircraft in our area.  The round shaped craft approached from the west, headed eastward and going slow and was at a high altitude. It was a very bright green glow until it was overhead, and at this point, the four green lights were distinguishable and then completely came to a full stop. The lights on the craft went out and two red to blue lights illuminated.  (two jets approached into the area)  We noticed that the craft went dark and then we saw very bright sparks, like thruster sparks (red) shoot out and the craft , and then went from being still, to gaining altitude at an angle, and then it dissappeared into the sky.ADDENDUM SUBMITTED BY ORIGINAL WITNESS:Previously submitted on 4-19-99I have previously submitted our report on the events that took place on Monday evening.  A few people have spoken to me regarding this event that took place and we do not see why others shouldn&apos;t know the truth.  We are comfortable knowing the truth of what we witnessed and have spoken to another individual who has also seen it, on the same night.  I anticipate that there will be many others that have witnessed this but failed to report it through the lack of knowing what to do.  We thank you for listening to us and am additionally glad that someone in Lake Wood saw it too.

At approx. 2015 hrs. I observed 15 flares dropped in close succession with in 3 mls. of my location. This was unusual because the area seemed to be over &apos;D&apos; area or Dart Drop as it is called but is NOT used for night target exercises because of the close proximity to the Base. The closest target area is South in Range 3 - EastTac another 5-8 mls. SE. The flares dropped were close enough that I could see the white smoke as each burned, but the parachutes were not visible.  15-16 flares were dropped into a near perfect &apos;V&apos; shape pointing west. I had only observed 2-5 flares used at a time and usually staggered. Another officer remarked on his radio that he thought a bunch of people were going to report a UFO after seeing that.  Someone else said he did hear on the news over the radio that people were reporting a v-shaped ufo over PHX.  Later, I listened to the Art Bell show for the begining 10 mins. and heard the same.  There are at least 3 mt.ranges between here and Phx., all of which are at a higher elevation than the height of the flares I observed. The closest town is Ajo another 40 mls. S. of Gila Bend, and I doubt that anyone there could have seen these flares. And about 10 mls. further N. on hwy.85 the ranges start blocking the South view.

The light moved in a northeast direction as I ran back home to get my wife to witness this.  My wife came outside and we both observed (I through binoculars) as the orange sphere released several smaller spheres of light, dropping them downward.  At one point there were at least 3 of these lights dropping at the same time as another light shot up from above the object.  We continued to watch as the light pulsated brighter and then dimmed until it dimmed or winked out.  This is the identical object that we observed on 3/29 at approximately the same time of night.

It was traveling East, just above tree top level and although the distance was difficult to judge because the size is unknown my wife and I both got the impression it was fairly close (50 - 300 yards away). We opened the window and could hear no noise. The sky was overcast but the object was well below the level of the clouds. The object was perfectly round or spherical but appeared to have very small spikes or rays around the edge. It moved behind trees and we could no longer observe it.", "A ball of orange light, 5X apparent size of a star. Drifted SW towards E.  No flashing lights. Soundless except for once when it seemed to drop shower of sparks or more lights - popping sound, as if fire-crackers. 2nd time it did this (no sound noticed) I had binocs on it - looked like it dropped 3 smaller lights, which vanished. At end, object seemed to go directly South, then faded &amp; winked out. A plane in same general area later made obvious sound.About 1:10 am, April 8, 1999. Night exceptionally clear (and cold by Southern California standards) I was about to go to bed, but I happened to glance out kitchen window, which looks West. Saw a spot of orange light to SW at about 40 degrees above horizon. I went out on front deck, it was still there, but had moved even in that short time, heading East across South arc of sky. As it was cold, I went in house, grabbed my bathrobe and a pair of binoculars. The object appeared to be about 5 times apparent size of a large star, larger than a light of a plane would be. Color was orange - like the color of those supposedly fog-cutting street-lights (if you know what I mean). There were no flashing lights, just a steady glow. Twice it appeared to drop a series of lights from bottom. The first time, with naked eye, it looked like a shower of sparks. I thought I heard popping sounds, like distant fire-crackers. This was odd, because otherwise, the whole display was absolutly soundless. The second time I had my binoculars on it - it seemed to drop 3 seperate small balls of light, same color as main object. These small lights disappeared or winked out. I don&apos;t remember popping sounds the second time. The object had by this time traversed the sky from SW to a point directly south of me. The movement was not direct and purposfull like a plane, rather, it was more like drifting. At the end, it seemed like it was heading directly South. It faded a few times and then disappeared or winked-out. The only other detail I can think of to mention here is that I seemed to see several spikes projecting from the bottom of the object - this may be an artifact of scratches on my glasses or the general effect of looking at lights in the sky. The whole episode lasted 7-10 minutes. A few minutes later, a plane flew by in the same general area - compared to object, the plane was swifter, smaller, had flashing lights, and made obvious sound. What might it have been? The only conventional explanations I can think of are: 1-- a hot-air b! alloon (these are common in our area as a tourist attraction, thought not at night - I&apos;m sure there&apos;s a law against that for safty reasons); it was silent, the large orange ball effect could have been the fire reflecting off and through the balloon itself, the dropping lights might have been sparks or falling, burning debris. There was no news report today of such an incident - and our local news loves balloon disasters. 2-- a flare drifting on a balloon or parachute, although a flare probably would not appear so large, and why would it be up there in the first place? I was the only observer - only my cat can verify that I was outside with binoculars late at night. Cardiff By The Sea is almost exactly 25 miles North of down-town San Diego and 20 miles or so South of Camp Pendelton, a large Marine Base. We can often hear shelling, and sometimes sonic booms from Camp Pendelton or other nearby Millitary installations. My house is about a mile or two from the coast.  I am a single, University-educated male, age 36.", "While walking to another building for a lunch break, I and many other people saw this &quot;craft&quot; hovering over the city Of Rochester for 20 mins.I realize that it has been many years since my sighting, but I wasn&apos;t comfortable coming out with this until now. Mainly because nobody beleived me who didn&apos;t witness this event.  I was working the &quot;B&quot; shift at The Eastman Kodak company at the time. As many of us were going to lunch, we walked to the ajacent building to the employee cafeteria. On our way over, we notice a guy looking up over towards downtown Rochester and pointing to an object in the sky. We were looking in a Easterly direction. There, about a mile or so away, about 2000 feet up was this sphere shaped object just hovering there. It wasn&apos;t possible to see any distinct color except for the changing color lights. It would change from green to red to amber. Sounds like a traffic light, but seriously, this thing was seen by scores of people. As others passed by, we pointed it out only to be teased and mocked. There were about 4 or 5 of us who stood there for at least 20 minutes and watched this out of pure facanation. The sky was clear and before sunset. All this object did was hover and didn&apos;t move at all. There were no other aircraft in the area. A short time later, the other employees were  returning from their lunch. Some looked at it and scoffed,&quot; Aw, thats just a balloon&quot; and some other cheeseie explanations and continued back to work. At that point, I myself had to return to work because lunch was over. Needless to say, I never got my lunch, I was too facanated with what we were witnessing. When I got home, I called the local planetarium to see if they saw anything. They saw nothing. I KNOW what I saw along with 4 or 5 other people. Not to mention the many other skeptics. I looked up as I was walking up to my building and it was simply vanished. The others saw this too. When I tried to tell others about it, they all just laughed and because of this I never spoke of it again.", "14 Lights lined up at approximately a 45 degree angle High point left to low point right,  7 bright white lights made up the upper &#x5C; shape,  and 7 dimmer and smaller red lights made up the bottem half of this &#x5C; pattern on the horizon..14 Lights lined up at approximately a 45 degree angle High point left to low point right,  7 bright white lights made up the upper &#x5C; shape,  and 7 dimmer and smaller red lights made up the bottem half of this &#x5C; pattern on the horizon..

The whole &quot;Line&quot; of lights would move very slowly,  keeping shape,  but changing the degree of angle,  toward the ground and back up again..  These movements were very slow and only seen by using a reference point to analyze small changes..  The approximate time duration was unknown;  I got home at about 2:30 and got ready for bed..  I went out to smoke one last cig and notice 3 lights that I thought were 3 planets lining up instead of the two,  (venus and mars),  that I&apos;ve known about to happen..   I then moved to a better clearing / Angle,  and realized the above..   I was very tired that night and was only able to watch for about 1 Hr, 4:20am,  Which I HAD to go to bed..

In a stationary position its lights would change position,intencey, and turn to a red on ocasion. I watched for about 5 min. then the light faded and showed back up over the river with in a min. My self and the others were on our way in to a class we are takeing so that we can be confermed on Easter.It was unexpected and we did have class so we went in for about an hour. When we came back out it was, to our surprize, across the river above the hill moving back and forth Still with the patern of bright lights changeing intentcy and ocasionaly turning red because of the odd movement and light we knew it was the same object. I got in my car hopping to catch up to it and get a better view but by the time I got down to the river I saw the lights one last time about a 1/4 mile away over the river they got realy bright then nothing. That was the last time I saw it.If some one could e-mail me I would like to know if any one else saw it. This is the first time I have seen any thing like this. I just want to know what it was. Thank you", "An incrediably bright fireball streaked towards the southern horizon and disappeared quicklyWe were headed south from Howards Grove towards Sheboygan Falls when we noticed a very bright fireball falling towards the southern horizon.  It was green and emitted a light green trail at the end that stood for 5 minutes.", "We saw a light in the sky that was hovering and moving too oddly to be a terrestrial aircraft.It was about at 8:00 at night. 2 of my friends, my brother, and I were out on our bikes and we were going around our neighborhood. We were not to far from my home when we saw 3 lights in the sky. The lights were connected by a red beam, and kept hovering from place to place in odd directions. One of my friend and I, after watching it for a while, turned around and rode AT TOP SPEED back to our house. My other friend and my brother followed us after about 10 seconds. I myself must confess that I am somewhat of a UFO buff, but my other 3 companions are not too knowledgeable about UFOs.", "I saw two circluar lights attached to a dark shape, which moved silently and quickly and disappeared.I was outside the house and facing it.  Suddenly appeared a large, dark object in the sky.  It was impossible to tell what shape it was, It seemed to be flat, and possibly triangular, but that is only a guess.  The two lights were parallel to each other.  They each emitted a white light.  The lights were fixed on a point in front of the object, and as I was looking at it from an angle, it was hard to see on what it was focused. There was no sound at all, and it moved behind the house, where it disappeared.  I live about 20 miles from an airport but this could not have been an areoplane.  Firstly there was no sound at all, and we can hear the sound of planes clearly even when indoors.  Secondly, for the lights to have been the size they were, the areoplane would have to be landing in our backgarden.  No one else saw the object, and as it lasted only a short while I could do nothing but watch.", "Large tear drop shaped opening in the sky lasting 2 seconds observed while witness was flying a radio controlled plane west of Spokane.While flying a model aircraft slowly at about 1000 feet and about one quarter of a mile out, I observed what looked like a portal open in the sky for about 2 seconds and then close. The anomoly description: Tear dropped shaped with the wide part at the bottom. The anomoly was tilted slightly to the left and the tail at the top, tapering to a point at the bottom. The anomoly was titled slightly to the left and the tail at the bottom was also tilted to the left at about a 45 degree angle. At the lower right side of the anomoly there was an area on the edge of the anomoly of light orange in color. The orientation of this anomoly was vertical. The anomoly was solid black, and appeared to be rounded towards me. There is no way to tell how far away this anomoly was from me at the time of the sighting, but if it were to be at the same distance as my model aircraft I would estimate its vehicular size to be from 500 to 800 feet in height. Note that the sky was a cloudless field of blue at the time of this sighting. The anomoly stayed fixed in one position with no movement during the sighting. It was there one moment and gone the next.

I took a look down the lake to the east towards the marina some 3 miles away. I noticed two lights low in the sky which seem to be moving my direction, so I stopped and parked on the side of the road to watch. My thought was that it was an airplane heading to the airport to the west of my position. But as I watched, the two lights seperated to travel one on each side of the lake, both objects stayed at a very low altitude, possibly less than a 100 feet above the ground. This was really getting interesting. As they got within several hundred yards maybe further, the one on the right shore line moved across the lake to fall in behind the other and they passed my position one following the other, some 200 yard from me. The interesting traites where that these objects made no noise at all and as they passed, the objects stayed a ball of light no matter what angle they were to me, never did there appear to be any frame or structure to them. They may have been the size of possibly a truck tire, it is hard to figure the size and they did not have the halo glow like a street light, I don&apos;t recall them eluminating things. I watched as they passed and can&apos;t really remember how they left my vision. I had no missing time and have had no later memories of anything else happening other than the wonderful unexplainable sighting. Being a student of metaphysics, my interpertation of what I saw, was that these were energy beings checking on the state of the ecology here. Interesting to this was that a couple of weeks later, riding as a passenger in my sister&apos;s car, returning from visiting these friend again, crossing the same point, I looked out across the lake to the west and saw what appeared to be a UFO hovering and at that instance it appeared that a blue beam of light flashed from the object to the ground. Having recently read about abductions and that a lot of the people abducted stated that they were moved from the ground to the ship on a beam of blue light, I would guess an abduction may have been in process. This second encounter now adds the possible purpose of the first sighting as that maybe they were locating this abductee. I was unable to watch the second sighting unfold, being that may sister had no intention of stopping that close to what could be a UFO. I feel extemely fortunate to have had this experience as it has helped to open my mind to the fact that there is more going on around us than we can ever imagine.", "i was walking with a few friends and i saw 3 lights in the sky and they kept on getting closer and closer and suddenly i could make out the shape of the crafts. there was a bright light and the shape of the craft was trangular and and they hovered for 20 minutes and then vanished. you can reach me at ((address deleted))@hotmail.com for more info", "It pulsated, It went from point A to point B like no other aircraft I&apos;ve ever seen. NW to N, Then in a fixed postion from when I saw it.I stopped at a rest area. I was coming home from Jamestown NY to Salamanca NY. There is a rest area just before the Randolph truck stop I looked to my left which would be north. There was a light cloud bank to the north. There was the cloud bank closer to the stars. A lower cloud bank towards the ground. About 1000 feet. It was just sitting there in between the cloud banks. The rest area sit about halfway up a mountain side. I could see fog in the valley below. I noticed it out of the corner of my left eye. Then I looked at it directly. It was just sitting there pulsating. After about five minutes. It took off in a North Westernly direction. It hit a high point above the top cloud bank. It went north for about I would say 5 miles. It came back down in a southeastly direction. It just sat there pulsating. After sitting there for about another 5 minutes. It took off. Straight up into the sky. I perceded to head home. That was my very first encounter with a UFO. Then in April of 97. I would say mid april. I was driving on route 241 from Randolph to Connawango. It&apos;s a small village just NW of Randolph. I proceded to go up route 62 from the village of Connawango. I had a small Dodge Ram pick-up truck. About a mile and a half from the village is the Town of Connawango barns. I pulled into the parking lot of the barns. Because of a slow leak in my tire. I checked out the tire and I got back into my truck. I was about to pull back onto the highway. When I saw this object coming from a North Westerly direction. It had lights on the front. It looked just like an airplane that was going to land. I thought, gee why would a airplane want to land here. Unless it was having trouble. The craft came right towards the town barns. Before coming over the town barns. The craft went in a southerly direction. I got quite close to the building across the road from the barns. I believe is a farm. there was ground fog. About 1/4 of a miles west of the farm was a cloud bank. Not a real thick one. It veered West South West into the cloud bank. I got a good view of the craft from its side. Have you ever seen a horseshoe crab. If you look at a side view of a horseshoe crab. That&apos;s what the object looked like. Nothing like I&apos;ve ever seen before. There are street lights at the barns kind of shone on the side of the oject. Plus there was a full moon. The front of the oject where the lights were was elongated oval. The lights bobbed down to the ground like it was searching for something, before it went into the cloud bank. The craft or object made no sound what so ever. The color of the object or craft was tannish. I have never told anyone of my experience except here. When I found this on the internet. I felt it was time. Since then. I will at times go out on the back deck and look west. Like I sense theres more objects or crafts flying around over there at Connawango to Randoph. There is a mountain just in back of my house in the city of Salamanca. Also I was taking a shower one evening. This was just before my father died of cancer. A battle he fought for 8 years. He was in his bedroom doing something. He came out of his bedroom. He looked out the hall window. Which looks out the rear of the house. He got very excited, he pounded on the bahroom door. He wanted me to see what he thought was a UFO. He said there was an other craft persuing it. But I was in the shower. I came out of course after he encountered it. I don&apos;t know. But I sense to the west of my house is Ufo coradoor. I haven&apos;t driven over to the area sinse then. I have drive! n to Jamestown and back. But never went to check the area out. It certainly was an unique experience. One I will never forget. It also changed my view on the possibility. That there is life other than ours. Also the object that I talked about in the begining. When it flew it left a trail.", "It looked as a pointed horseshoe. It was full daylight, and it had a lighter shade than the rest of the sky. There was no clouds at all, and it lasted for about one minute. Then it disappered, and reappered after a while for another minute at the  same spot. We drove a car when it appeared. It would surprise me if no one else noticed it.", "Large aircraft, size of 747, flying 1000ft, no sound, 10-25 MPH, flew over Mt Kisco NY and many people witnessed the event.The object was very large. I commented to my wife (Girlfriend at the time) that a B-52 was coming towards us.  We joked that maybe it was a UFO. As it moved with a 1/2 mile distance, we stopped joking about it possibly being a UFO and we got in our car and drove quickly to a spot with more people.  We were frightened by the fact that it moved slow and made no noise.  The UFO had red and white lights around the perimeter with a smaller trailing light. We drove from a parking lot where we had just gotten off work (Caldors) and drove to a near-by gas station (ARCO).  The craft flew over our heads slowly and we watched it for 5-10 more minutes.  There were a number of people at the ARCO and all the people were stunned.  I haven&apos;t thought much about the incident since it hapened, however, the stories out of Arizona in 1997 were remarkably similar.  I believe by the descriptions, that the UFO&apos;s were the same, only they were 14 years and 2000 miles apart.  At the time, the authorities said it was a joke by ultra-light aircraft pilots. If it was ultra-light pilots, they moved to Arizona 14 years later!!", "I was laying in my bed with the ability to look out the window while watching television.

The object never chaned direction, and had a very destinct tail light of an bright orange color.The size of the object was about 4 to 5 times the size of a star. I have lived in seattle for over 9 years. I personally have not seen any green objects such as this until this past year. This is the third time I have seen the green light.

I was about 10m from a gate when I looked up at the sky. It was dark, the only light being from the moon which was almost entirely hidden by thick clouds. The clouds were reasonably stationary. I started to look down from the sky when a very bright circle of light caught my eye. It was a steady white colour. The light was completely stationary. It was a little below the cloud line in about a North Easterly direction a fair distance above the mountain range. I stopped and looked again. It was above the mountains so not originating from there. It wasn&apos;t a radio tower. It was far too large, bright and stationary to be a plane (There is a flight path running through the area.) My first thought was that it was a search helicopter (with a search light). (They are not unusual in the area) But the light seemed far too big and bright, especially since the light was quite a distance away. The light was also vey steady. Helicopters are also noisy. I didn&apos;t hear anything that sounded like a helicopter. It was just a quiet night. It stayed stationary for about a min. then suddenly the light appeared to diminish in size, as if fading from the outside in. This only took about 2 seconds.

I was about a mile south of the Pits when I looked up to the left and saw a slowly moving huge triangular craft with a white unblinking light in each apex and a red light centered in the middle slowly pulsing. The white lights illuminated the bottom of the craft which reflected a light grey triangular shape against the dark sky. The craft was clearly triangular. The craft was heading slightly east of north so I was expecting to be directly underneath it when I rounded the bend to the Pits, but instead, the craft was now seen to be heading hard west of north. It was so low that it disapeared over the small hill west and parallel to the Blvd. I went up over Mt. Baker and then Capital hill to try and catch it in the distance, but there were no objects-airplane or other-flying west or north west where it should have been. As an oddity, before I lost sight of it,  I saw one horizontal dim white light beam cross over and above me in a west-east direction on two occasions just before it disapeared over the hill.  This may or may not have been associated with the craft.  My first impression was that  I had been shot at with something and I jumped in the way someone would jump if you threw something at them, then I realized that the streak going overhead was a beam of light.

My sighting involved a night out near the beach in Provincetown, MA, looking for satellites. I observed a triangle formation of three white lights moving at a &quot;jet liner&quot; speed, as if at 35,000 feet altitude, and at 50 degrees elevation or so.  The lights moved across a short arc and disappeared in sequence.  I was impressed by their lock-step movement, and I thought at the time that even military craft would not fly at that distance apart.  This sighting may seem innocuous, except that the West Dennis case involves what I am sure is the same sort of thing.  On another occasion, by the way, I was looking for satellites in Maine while on vacation and I saw a white light moving like a satellite, when it suddenly made a 90-degree turn!  This happened in Aug. of 1992 near Bath, ME.", "dark triangular craft, white lights on corners, red light center underneath followed by a smaller, disk shaped craft, white lights around circumference. Both traveling west to east toward ocean, speed very slow, low humming sound heard. If diameter of disk was 30 to 50 ft (estimated), the triangular craft was at least", "stargazers looking at a beautiful sky full of stars on a perfectly clear night, wittness several craft buzzing over Cross lake. One craft approached and observed the group shined lights on us, windows appeared and we were able to see two creatures gazing at us.A group of five people were star gazing on a beautiful clear Minnisota night, after 15-20 minutes of sky watching, we noticed a cloud cover converging over the lake from the left and the right (simultaniously) we thought this strange since clouds seem to usually come from one direction We were sitting lake level at a friends farm (away from it all,out of town on dirt roads the farm house itself was about 50 yards away), we were at the boat landing area and talking and visiting. Earlier we had commented on the sounds of the night, crickits, frogs, dogs night birds etc. As the clouds closed up the entire view of the sky, we noticed a dim light which appeared to be about 20 yards out on the lake. The only thing I could think of that this might be was someone night fishing with a lantern or some kind of light source in a rowboat with that source being below the rim of the boat, thus giving of a weird glow.We could make no lines out so we had no idea of shape or distance, out in the country on a lake it gets very very dark. It was myself and 4 lady friends there that night,heres where it gets strange. From the lenght of the light and the size of a row boat I figured it must be about 20 yards out, I called out,..hey are you catching anything? No response ..I repeated myself again.. no response. While listening for a response I noticed that all of the night sounds had vanisher and there was no sounds at all, except.... the sound of a finely tuned engine ,barely detectable, but every thing else seemed oddly still. Since there was no response and knowing a person would usually respond to a call out, I picked up my flashlight a shinned it toward the light...it illuminated nothing, thats strange, I decided to walk up the hill towards the farm and get an elevated view. Walking up the incline with the 4 girls close behind.(inches) I got a veiw of a good portion of this good sized lake, to my surprise ai saw 4 other light buzzing around the lake also at a foot or two above the water it seemed. I turned to the girls and asked them if they saw what I saw and they said what do you see? Anyway we all saw these lights moving around on the lake. By this time the hair on the back of my neck was standing on end.We ruled out all possibilities except UFO&apos;S. As we stood there with our jaws dropped the light that we had first thought to be a fishing boat, began to levitate to our eye level,about 30 feet above water level. Now I always said if I had an encounter, I would make friends, forget it, as the light followed us up the hill to the stairs of the farmhouse I along with the girls were fearful of the light. My friends family was sleeping in the house(father and grandmother)we noticed that the trusty dog that lives on the front steps that was there earlier was gone, we were there to camp by the lake and were set up there. I didn&apos;t want to go into the farmhouse out of respect, and I still was in a state of disbelief over all this trying to convince myself it wasn&apos;t happining. So I told the girls , lets just sit on the steps for a moment and see what happens. The length of yard was about 35 feet before a small 20 foot incline down to the shore, we sat down, the light now out over the water directly in front of us glowing like a light with a dimmer on it at a very low level. We sat in disbelief as the light at once became brighter, we could now make out some kind of shape, it was like a coffee saucer was upside down, wider at the bottom than top,there appeared to be a pattern within that light(window)and that was like those iron grates you see on sidewalk accesses for sewer systems, kind of honey combed. Behind the grate and in front of the light source were two silhouett figures. I was unable to make out any features since it seemed the light source was behind them. They had triangular type bodies with the shoulders being the wide point, same with their heads shaped like drawings of Greys. These two seemed to be observing us, moving side to side, we were mesmerized. After a few minutes the light once again dimmed, this scared us enough to get inside the house. I decided it was time to wake up  my friends father, I went into his bedroom and woke him saying that there were flying saucers outside, he&apos;d been drinking and mumbled we must be on drugs and drifted back to sleep, I then tried Grandma ..same thing. I grabbed a shotgun out of the closet and went back to the kitchen with the girls who immediatley convinced me to put the gun away, that it would only make things worse if they felt provoked...I listened.   We then not knowing what else we could do and driven be fear as well as curiosity we went back to the steps sat down and watched the low glowing light in front of us. We werent sure how big this thing was because as I stated it was dark out there and it was just a light and we couldn&apos;t see the whole thing,anyway after a minute the light got a bit brighter and from underneath three laser type lights popped on and started scanning very quickly the house the trees,us etc. The lights were straight beams about 6inchis acroos that were very strong and as I said in a laser type beam, it scanned everything in a very deliberate fasion this went on for mayby 15 seconds then the lights went out and the saucer lights also got very weak and we heard about 6 very loud splashes in the lake, I imagined that beings were jumping into the water(like frog men)and would be comming up over the hill any second, we all got very scared at the thought of this and ran back in the house to the upstaires, where the family had some extra beds for company. The upstairs was unfinnished, the farmhouse was over 100 years old and didn&apos;y have a ceiling just the roof then a few wooden cross beams or rafters. this was a summer getaway and was not insulated upstairs. On the center beam going accross the ceiling there was an old ceramic light fixture with a bulb and a string to turn it on and off, there was an open window with a screen on it on one wall. We were all very frightened so told every one to pair up and take one of the three beds. This put  us two to a bed all staring at the window. I said mayby it will just go away, we sat there for maybe 2 minutes which seemed like forever, then suddenly it got very bright above the house it seemed as if the sun were shinning we could see dust particles and light comming through cracks and nailholes and it was like daytime outside the window, then suddenly two little balls of light the size of say handballs came through the screen without making a hole! These things were circling around each other at a very fast rate, they zoomed around us and the room and went to the hanging light bulb fixture on the ceiling beam they seemed drawn to it for 5 seconds or so then thew swooshed back out the screen as fast as they had come. Two seconds later it was dark again. We all sat there virtually paralized! Soon I guess our senses came back and we could hear in the distance the sound of a car comming down the dirt road, the sound got closer and closer we heard the car pull into the long driveway and a car door slam ( we realized it was my friend whos farm we were at that we had split up from earlier in the evening finally returning home ) I ran to the window and saw it was our friend, I then shouted to him to stay there!! We all ran outside to save him! As we ran up the driveway to warn him we must have seemed histerical, trying to explain we looked around, the sky was clear , the night sounds back, the old trusty dog was back and it seemed like every thing was back to normal. The local town paper reported several people seeing funny lights and passed them off as meteors. NO WAY The next thing is I looked at my watch and noticed it was about 12:15 am, this started around 10:pm it didn&apos;t seem possible that 2 hours could have passed...maybe 21-30 minutes.", "Slowly moving orange light in a clear night sky disappears in an in an instant.I was sitting out side my apartment looking to the nort east. I noticed a orange light flying very slowly coming at an angle towards my position. If you were a few blocks away from a street light this would be about the size of the orange light. I took my eyes off this thing just for a second and it was gone. How could this be? There was all kinds of clear sky around this thing. Where did this thing go?", "sighted an orange ball moving all over the sky near the moon over oceanI heard on the artbell show that a police officer in the Los Angeles coastal area flying in a helicopter had an encounter with an orange object.  One night about a week ago while driving home from work I saw this same object in the north western sky while northbound on I-5,  It was moving almost as a helicopter would but it was orange with no other color lights that I could see.  It was only a mile or two off of the coast of north San Diego County and I thought it was a planet at first but the orange object was circling in the sky over a distance of several miles perhaps,  I have 20-15 vision with both eyes and I had my window open and saw it clearly.  I waved to it and said to the object &quot;hey fellars come on down&quot;  then I got a strange feeling as if the occupants heard me and were amused", "Something burst out of the sky and plummeted downward.

Suddenly an object came out of the sky. At first I thought it was a plane that was going to crash.  The color of it though had a green glow with just a little white at the end of it.  It didn&apos;t look like a ball shape and it had no tail like a comet.  The size from the distance we were at looked about the size of a commercial jet or larger (which is why at first I thought it was a plane.  It fell towards the horizon and then disappeared from our view. I almost expected an explosion from something that size, but there was no sound.

Contrails ran from NE to SW and from NNE to SSW.I was looking at the two formed contrails when a dark red object with black edges appeared. My first thought was a UFO, then I thought it was a kite, but it was too high for that. Then I thought it was a private plane as it seemed to be travelling about that speed towards me. I was listening to hear an engine and when I didn&apos;t hear one I turned my head to call inside the house to my wife to come quickly. When she didn&apos;t respond (about 4 secs.)

The UFO appeared from over the horizon and flew up, performed a loop and plunged into the sea, or vanished back over the horizon, possibly. As it dropped it seemed to shrink, the light grew smaller and brighter, but there was no sound. At first we all thought that it was a flare or firework, but it moved too fast and went much too far. It also left a glowing trail which lit up the clouds for three hours, until well after dark. Everyone who saw it agreed that it was not a firework or a flare.It happened at 5 o&apos;clock in the afternoon, and at first we all thought that it was a fireball. Someone even said &quot;Look! A fireball.&quot; We watched it arc up from behind the blocks of flats and hotels on the skyline. It was a fiercely intense point of light, like a distress flare, except it was white. It moved very fast from right to left in front of us, rising, then performing a loop and almost immediately shooting down towards the sea. There was no sign of impact, no sound, no flare of light indicating an explosion. It might have vanished over the horizon, or it might have entered the sea, there was no way to tell. The trail it left in the sky, which resembled glowing smoke, we continued to watch, since it showed no sign of dimming, and it fascinated us. It even seemed to get brighter as the daylight waned. We waited until well after sunset, when the sky was pitch dark and full of stars, but the trail remainded, hardly dimmer than when it was made. In fact, when we eventually left, it was still there, so I don&apos;t know how long it took to fade. It was the glowing trail that convinced us that this was no fireball or flare.", "Silver/White disk shaped object seenDriving through NW Lincoln, west on Adams Street towards 1st Street, I looked up and saw an object.  Traveling South/soughwest to the North/northeast, I thought it was a military airplane, possibly a T-38 because I&apos;ve watched them do touch and go&apos;s from the airport, which is approximately 2 miles west from my location.  I noticed that the object was slowing down and at one point during the sighting, the object stopped.  The difficulty of the sighting was that I was in a vehicle and the driving conditions would not permit me to stop the vehicle and go outside.  But while I had stopped and was waiting for the traffic to clear, I looked north and I located the object in between a grove of trees.  I turned north on 1st Street, towards the object.  Directly in front of me, a car was turning left on a side street, therefore I lost the view of the oject.  I located the object once the car had turned, continuing on there was a bicyclist in front of me, so therefore once again my attention was diverted from the object.  When I safely cleared the bicylce, I then located the object once again, and at this time it was moving rapidly to the north/northeast.  The unique feature of this sighting is I believe from my advantage point, when I first saw the object, it would have flown through the Lincoln Municap Airport Corridor.", "Observed pink/orange glowing ball &quot;bouncing&quot; along railroad tracks for length of @ 2 city blocks, then shoot straight up and disappear out of sightI observed one pink/orange glowing ball, @ 3 ft. in diameter &quot;bouncing&quot; along railroad tracks for the length of @ 2 city blocks, this occurred slowly enough for me to follow it down the 2nd &quot;block&quot; at a distance of @ 25 yards.

We had decided drive pass Flagstaff and take a road that passed through Prescott. The road was filled with curves that we thought would never end. As we approached the bottom of the mountain road I had noticed a white ball or sphere objects that had a trail following behind it. The object was not high enough to be an airplane plus it was bright white with a trail following behind. I knew that the oject was not a falling star because we have seen many of thoughs after living on the plains for 3 years. I had brought this object to my wifes attention so that I could prove to myself that I was not seeing things. My wife did see it and then I proceeded to pull the car over so that we could focus a little bit better on the object.

I got up and my son was still awake so we went outside to look. That&apos;s when we heard the sound of Bell Huey helicopters. Moving from the southwest to the southeast was a ball of light. It was traveling fast! Behind it and going really fast too were two large helicopters. It seemed that they were chasing the light object. We watched until they were out of sight and then went back inside. I returned to bed because I had to get up to go to work this morning. No sooner than I had got back in bed, I heard helicopters again. I jumped back up and ran back outside with my son and we saw two or three more huge helicopters going really fast from the southwest to the southeast.The object and the helicopters seemed to be traveling fairly low about 200 to 300 feet above the treeline.

We Spotted a Very Fast moving, very bright White Light/Fireball which eventually turned green as it &quot;flew&quot; or dropped closer to earth.   It was fast, and bright. That&apos;s what caught our eye. It was descending toward earth and would dismiss it as a Meteorite but it had no streak behind it. It was very much brighter than approaching airplanes. The flight path that this thing came down on, was the flight path into Kennedy Airport(planes from the West) Several planes were on the same flight path, one every three- four minutes.... one of those pilots must have seen this thing above them , or down ahead, and in front, at this time approximate 23:15- 23:30 April 14th, 1999. The closest plane was just crossing the &quot;Verrazano Bridge&quot; which is the Longest Suspension Bridge in the USA...the pilots would remember the location if they did see it, as it is the major landmark into NYC.

We only saw it for 2-3 seconds as we do not have &quot;open skys,&quot; here in the &apos;City&apos; ...more like tunnel vision. Judging from where the planes were and the intensity of this lighted fireball, it could have been as far out from us as 5-10 miles out...no telling, due to its brightness, or, as I said it may have been just a meteorite,and the distances would be therefore unknown.

At about 1600 hours I what I first thought to be an airplain come from the southern horizon at around 25000 feet. It crossed the entire sky in about 12 seconds, which would be a very fast rate of speed considering the height it was at. It appeared to be about the height of the contrails which were mentioned before, although they had disappeared by this time. It was hard to tell the shape because VERY BRIGHT flashes were coming from it at the rate of about 4-5 per second. The brightness of the flashes was MANY TIMES BRIGHTER than a strobe light or light on a plane, which would not have showed up because of the bright sunny sky. It was as though a mirror was aimed at the sun and reflected back to me. I might add that there are many commercial airlines flying over this area and the ones that fly over are almost all east to west (Detroit to Toronto) and take the usual 3 - 5 minutes to fly over at that altitude.", "High, Fast-moving contrail of smokeWhile stuck in traffic on US1(Dixie Hwy), through the open top of my Jeep Wrangler I noticed a contrail in the sky. It was moving from E-SE to W-NW. Itried to see the source of this contrail, but it was too, too high to see. That&apos;s when I started to question it&apos;s origin. It was moving too fast for a plane that was that high(far away). At the next stop in traffic(app. 45 sec.), I watched it cross in close proximity to the Sun. It was hard to keep it in view at this point, so I waited for it to come out the other side of the Sun&apos;s influence. It never appeared again, and I then went to look back at the beginning of the trail. It was nowhere to be seen.", "Very bright orange object in clear night sky at almost exactly due north from my location and 20 degrees from the horizon moved very slowly to my right and appeared to have what I can only describe as a halo around it or smaller lights rotating around it very quickly indeed. After five or six minutes it turned from orange to white and seemed to close like a camera lense, or rapidly move away from me. It was too far away for me to tell. I am not a crackpot or looking for fame in any way and am reporting exactly what I saw. There were the usual stars twinkling in the dark sky and I am used to seeing them every clear morning because I always have to get up at 4am to go to work. As for the size of the object I can only hazard a guess but I would say that as it was apparently some distance away from my position, it was at least ten times larger than the largest star I could see.  I hesitated to fetch my video camera, binoculars or still camera in case it dissapeared whilst I was getting them from my study. If I see anything like it again I shall make haste to get my binoculars and camera and risk losing sight of whatever it is.", "I saw 2 triangular shaped objects with circular lights along the left &amp; right sides. Approx. 5 min. later I saw one by itself flying in the same direction. 5-10 min. later still I saw another further north of the first 3. ALL were silent. The circular lights were much larger than those I can clearly see on commercial aircraft departing LAX.I was out for a smoke. Looking up towards the LITTLE dipper (I think) I noticed a commercial airline jet leaving LAX (as my job is under the departing flight path for those flights heading east). My location was approx. 3/4mi south of the 10 frwy &amp; 1/10 mi. east of PCH. 5-10 sec. later I saw something I&apos;d never seen before, like no other aircraft I&apos;d known. The TWO aircraft I saw appeared to &apos;chase&apos; the jet from LAX but appeared to be LOWER in altitude than the jet. Each of the two &quot;chase&quot; craft had 5 or 6 circular lights along each edge (not the rear) of the craft. I could&apos;nt believe what I saw.  Convinced I&apos;d seen something truly strange...I stayed outside to see what else I might see. 5 minutes or so went by &amp; YES I saw another one! Flying in the same direction...this thing looked just like the first two I&apos;d earlier seen. Thinking I might miss something I stayed outside for another 5-10 minutes. Then I saw a fourth, but this time something looked like it was chasing the &apos;spacecraft shape&apos; I saw earlier and it was a &quot;pinhead&quot; in size compared in size to the larger craft. All of these craft I saw were the same size as the planes I see departing from LAX. I also live under the departing flight path of LAX as planes head east. I have seen A LOT of planes from LAX &amp; this was like NOTHING I have ever seen before.  I also have lived in the San Fernando Valley &amp; have seen Stealth fighters exit Van Nuys airport when they leave from the yearly airshow. I don&apos;t think these were Stealth. These craft were absoloutely silent, nothing no boom...nothing, yet I can hear just fine all of the jets and prop planes in the area. The circular lights did not blink but remained solid and were much larger than the lights I&apos;ve seen on all the LAX jets...yet the craft was about the same size as an LAX jet. After I saw this FOURTH craft I alerted a coworker, shaken a bit. We watched for 5 min. or so, he went back to work, but I stayed &amp; watched for an hour or so. I had seen all I was to see for the night.", "I observed the object in the oprox location towqard the south west. the object was hovering above a farm house and then it procedded to shoot a bright light toward the ground. after around two or three minutes it started to move toward the east and then it just shot off like a rocket.my wife and a friend of ours was driving around Germantown  when we saw an object located in the west. the object was hovering above a farm house and stayed there for about two or three minutes . it then moved toward the east and shot a bright light toward something, I did not know what it was but after a few minutes it took off towards the east.", "Two lightly orange glowing triangle objectsWhile looking at NGC 2024 in the Orion constellation with a pair of binoculars, I saw two triangle shaped objects appear. The objects were traveling East to West and appeared to be glowing a peach color and were about three times as wide as they were long. There was no sound or flashing lights and the objects appeared translucent. I took the binoculars from my eyes and could not see the objects. I looked through the binoculars again and could see both objects clearly. I followed the objects until I lost them behind a tree(about 10 seconds). The objects were traveling at a  high rate of speed. For a size estimate I say this, If the objects were the size of a small airplane, they would have been about three miles away. Looking the direction where I saw the objects, I see many aircraft on a flight path toward Houston,TX. These were NOT airplanes. My first thought was &quot;what the hell is that?&quot;. I have never seen anything before that I would call a UFO and could be viewed as some what of a non-believer.

Maybe greyhound bus size appearance", "Observed bright light approaching from west, drawing closer proved to be 3 separate lights on triangular craft, which passed directly overhead at low altitude, totally silent.I was returning home after work, between midnight &amp; 2 AM, &amp; saw an intense, bright light in the southwest sky. Thinking it was a very bright star, I continued to monitor it as I drove. Soon it separated into 3 distinct lights, &amp; I realized it was approaching. As it got closer I saw there were 3 lights, one at each corner of an aircraft. I stopped my truck in the middle of the road, &amp; got out to watch. The craft flew directly overhead, was maybe 40 feet across, and made no sound of note. It seemed to be just above the tops of the trees, &amp; I was puzzled that there would be no discernible engine noise. I don&apos;t recall being able to distinguish the surface of the craft, just seeing the three lights, &amp; the triangular shape as it passed overhead. I assumed it was something headed to the Little Rock Air Force Base, though as I said, it was so quiet, &amp; so low to the ground, that I was in awe. Unfortunately I never made note of this occurence, so I don&apos;t know the date. I assume it would be in the winter months, as the road is in a very wooded area, &amp; I remember seeing lots of clear space, as I do here when the trees are bare. The road, Dyer Street,  runs South of Malvern for about 4 miles... I stopped about 3 miles from Main Street to watch. I only can guess the year being between 1988 &amp; 1990 because I was driving the truck I owned at that time. I report this now because I have since heard of similar type craft being observed.((NUFORC Note:  Date and time are approximate.  We have assigned an arbitrary date in 1989 so that the report sorts to that year.  PD))", "Looking in Southeast &lt;saucer with amber colored lights on bottom of craft, moving fast, with no sound , Approx.10,000ft.Rotating in a gyro type motion.", "7 lights observed around Mauna Kea, HIMy wife and I were descending Mauna Loa to the weather station, at 11,500 feet, after a day summit hike.  In the developing twilight, we missed a trail marker and had to finish our descent in the dark.  Fortunately, the weather station has a red beacon over it, so we were able to home in on it.  Less fortunate was that we had to hike over about a mile or two of what Hawaiians call &quot;ah ah,&quot; the very loose, jagged clinkly lava.  This required a great deal of effort on our parts as we held hands and snaked our way across the lava field towards the beacon at the weather station.  One of us would get a firm footing to support the other while the other would then move forward.  Not fast progress, but we were able to keep our feet for the most part. It was during one of our many rests that I noticed these little whitish lights dancing around Mauna Kea.  It was clear, beautiful night with a few small clouds around the summit of Mauna Kea and one very large cloud directly above the summit.  The moon had not yet risen. I was suffering a bit of altitude sickness and was wondering if these dancing lights around Mauna Kea were a manifestation of that.  After watching these lights dart about the top of the mountain across the island for a while, I turned to my wife who it turns out was watching them, too. We tried to figure out what they might be.  There is an observatory atop Mauna Kea and we thought the lights might be a reflection in the clouds of descending vehicle headlights.  That didn&apos;t make sense as the lights would zip and dart very fast not only across the face of the mountain, but beyond its extents as well.  Then the lights would just as suddenly stop and hover.  Vehicle lights would behave in a more consistant pattern. We wondered if they were some kind of laser projection as we could see occasional beams of light from the moving lights to the large cloud above the summit of Mauna Kea.  Since the beams would initiate at either the lights or in the cloud and then terminate at the other, not going beyond, we reasoned we were watching some type of transmission. We listened closely, as it is very quiet on a large mountain at night, and could detect no sound which ruled out helicopters.  We would have heard them loud and clear.  Besides, the lights could move much faster than I have ever seen any aircraft move.  They were a most unique phenomenon in that they would dart swiftly from place to place about the mountain and then hover. We continued our descent of Mauna Loa and would stop to watch the dancing lights when we took our rests for the next 3 - 4 hours.  At one point I suggested to my wife that we attempt to signal the craft to see if we could get a ride down to our car.  Needless to say, whe was not particularly enthusiastic about this idea, so we continued snaking our way down the mountain. When we arrived at our car at about 02:00, the lights were still there darting about and hovering.  We drove down the mountain to Hilo and fell exhaustedly into bed.  The next day we both got massages and related the story to our masseuses.  They both commented that many people have had strange sightings up on the mountain.", "On 032699 at 2330 hours I noticed a light in the sky that kept changing from red to gree to yellow.  I obseved the light, stationary in the sky with binoculars,  for approximately one hour, before the cloud cover concealed it.  Three nights later I observed the same object in another part of the sky.  I summons three of my neighbors, who saw the light also.  We observed the light through binoculars for approximately 45 min before in moved below the tree line.  The entire time the light continued to change from red to green to yellow.  Through the binoculars it almost appeared the red light was rotating around in a circle.I first saw this light on 032699 at 2330 hours.  The thing that caught my attention is the red light that was ommiting from itt.  I got my binoculars and through them I could see the light was changing from red to green to yellow.  It also appeared the red light may have been rotating around in a circlet.  My wife and I watched the light for approximately one hour, before the cloud cover concealed it.  The light appeared to be stationary and was as bright at the stars in the sky.  Three days later on 032999 at 2300 hours I again saw the light in a different part of the sky.  Through the binoculars I could still see the light changing from red to green to yellow.  This time I summons three of my neighbors who also observed the light and the changing colors.  It also appeared this time that the light was moving.  We watched it for approximately 45  min before it dissappeared below the tree line.  We are not pranksters.  We are reporting this because we would like to know if any one else in the area has reported this thing.  We would also like to know what it is.  Two of us are police officers and  another one of us is in the  U.S. Air Force.  My dad was in the Air force for twenty five years and I lived on Air  Force Bases for much of that time.  I know what an air plane looks like and this was not a plane or a star.  None of the other hundred stars in the sky on these two nights was doing what this particular light was doing.

To the South lay a cloud bank that I believe to have hung over Centralia. This object passed between our position and the southern bank of clouds that hung in the twilight. The entire event lasted no more than 2-4 seconds in duration. I have no doubt that the impact was somewhere SE of the I-5 corridor in Olympia. I work as a underground utility location dispatcher in Bellevue, Washington. My trip to Olympia Saturday was to attend a house warming of a old friend. As a sometimes avid skywatcher I have in my life seen many meteor showers.This was not the most spectacular event I have witnessed, but this one definitely hit deck so to speak. I am aware of the Montana event and have spoke to an aquantence who believes he saw that same object Friday somewhere on the 405 North corridor in Bellevue. The object I saw however was definitely an independant event occuring Saturday.", "it was roughly 13 lights in a triangle shaped formation flying in a zig-zag pattern from north to south. speed was unknown, except they traveled from horizon to horizon in the matter of a few brief seconds.As a preteenager us boys would hung out in a backyard to have UFO watches. This one night all of us (5) for one very brief moment in time. Saw 13 small white lights flying in a triangle pattern, zig-zaging across the sky. As they moved from horizon to horizon across the sky. Less than 5 seconds. These lights never broke formation. These lights where traveling at a very high rate of speed. I would estimate that these lights where at least 50,000 feet in the air. The speed of these lights, plus the hard, sharp turns of the zig-zag formation. Truly convinces me, that what we saw that night. Was not part of this earth. I know this could be easily passed off as kids with over active imaginations. But, we truly saw something that night.

A light appeared out of nowhere among the stars, and began to move unlike any aircraft that I&apos;ve heard of, before retreating at extremely high speed and vanishing with a flash.The sighting occurred during the middle of summer,  and I was talking to my friend outside underneath a clear sky. I believe that it was the 15 of July, a day before my friend&apos;s birthday, although I&apos;m not completely sure. My friend was talking to me on her stomach, so she didn&apos;t see anything, but I was on my back looking at the stars. I was randomly looking around, when all of sudden this fiercly bright light appeared at a high altitude (I assume), and it sat still for a second. Then, it began to move in a tight zig-zaggish pattern, with extremely straight lines, at about the speed that you see a plane going at, or a sattelite. It paused for a bit after each movement, and then it changed direction. I then noticed that it stopped and began to grow insanely bright. Not bigger, but just brighter. Then, it sped off extremely quickly... it was like a blur of light, and left with a flash, disappearing from sight at one point in the sky. It&apos;s movements, I noticed, were extremely clean, like a hovercraft does on water, except in very clean, straight lines. This all took place within my approximation of  about ten seconds.", "Saw something that looked like a billiard rack silently moving south to north.It was&apos;t very dark, the city lights were reflecting off the low rolling clouds. I went outside the house by the pool. I looked up and saw what I thought was a 2-sided triangle of birds flying in formation beneath the clouds. The only thing is, upon closer examination, the thing had three sides and for the life of me I could not see individual birds flying. It looked to me like one of those racks you use for playing billiards. It was silent, moving south to north. I asked my girlfriend to look at it, she didn&apos;t know what to make of it. It had no lights. I tried to calculate its size by comparing it to the distance to the bottom of the low rolling clouds. The reason I say &quot;rolling&quot; is that I could see the bottom of the clouds in detail, they were moving pretty fast. It was kind of windy that night. I&apos;ve heard a lot of reports of &quot;triangles&quot; flying in the air, but never one like what I saw.

It went from the top of the sky, down past the horizon, right to left. I saw it for about 15 seconds. It was a circle that was a little bit bigger than a dinner plate from where I was and it had a tail that was greenish and had sparks in it, sort of like the sparks from when a knife is being sharpened. It reminded me of a comet, but much, much bigger. It didn&apos;t make any sound.

Stood and watched it for 15-20min. until it sped away. Sped acroos the horizon at lightening speed.It happened about 12 miles from Belzoni,MS on a local road named Broad Lake Rd. The road runs east to west. Our house was located on the north side of the road. We had been attending church that evening and got to the house about 10:30pm. As we got out of the car, my mother and I spotted it at the same time. We both uttered to the others to take a look into the south to southwestern sky about 1/2 mile out where some woods were located. As we stood looking at the object it seemed to be hubbering not more that 50 feet off the top of the trees, spinning around omitting serveral bright colors. Red, Green, Blue, and White. But to me the white light seemed different. It seemed to be reaching out to us, like maybe a scan of some sort. The light was not affected by our appearance. But after about 6-8 minutes the light turned off. We were amazed at what we had seen so we stood there to see if we could see it again. After being turned off for 60 or so, seconds. The light came back on. It continued to hubber and spin in the very same position that we had first seen it, for another 5 to 8 minutes. After that, it moved towards the west at a rate of speed that I have never seen before or again since. During the duration of our expirience, we all agreed that the craft had not made a sound at all. Not even when it left. It has been a number of years since it happened and some of us have departed since. Some of us have a veige memory and some of us dont remember it at all. But, I remember it as if it happened yesterday. We never made a report of our sighting due to the fact that it was a small town and noone would believe us. And some of us didn&apos;t want that type of publicity. At this point in my life, I dont want the publicity either. But maybe someone else in the area had seen it too, and this story will help them some how. Neither me, nor any of my family members were abducted during the sighting.

Similar craft seen a few minutes later.We were returning home from Perkins when, on Kansas St. heading east, we saw a triangular craft hovering above a residence across from a public school.  The sky was overcast, and it was very windy.  The craft was below the clouds, as evidenced by the reflection of its lights.  We stopped our van and looked and listened, hearing nothing.  No props, no blades, no engines.  We turned left onto the street the residence was facing, and as we did so, the craft moved northwest.  We persued it as best we could through the residential area, but in a matter of 1-2 minutes it was beyond the horizon.  We made our way back, and in doing so saw another craft, which at first appeared to be a helicopter, then a plane, then, as we saw it better, exactly like the first.  It made no sound.  Both craft were black, with white lights on the triangle tips and a red light in the center.  Only the first appeared to hover.

McClellan) NO WAY!!!!I am not sure of exact year about 1971 or 72 maybe even 73. This event happened in the spring of the year when my family was cleaning off the garden spot.It was our tradition to have a weiner roast and burn just prior to planting.  We had already finished the roast and our large bonfire had burned down pretty low . My sister had gone inside, mom was getting the stuff to take in. Dad and I were raking more onto the fire to finish burning.  There is a cow pasture on the northern side of the garden spot with a sloping hillside. At the eastern end of the pasture is a small stand of trees (mostly longleaf pines).Almost simultaneously mom, dad, and I saw the craft right at the edge of these trees and below treetop level. Dad&apos;s comment &quot;what&apos;n th hell?&quot; was instantly followed by &quot; ya&apos;ll get to the house&quot;. I responded &quot;no, I want to see it &quot;  but don&apos;t think I could have moved if I tried.  Mom just kept saying &quot;oh Lord, what is it?&quot;  The disc spun  silently for several minutes. There appeared to be a strip of light in the center of the disc  all the way around. As it was spinning it seemed to constantly change colors like those of a prism .  It seemed as though the craft was reflecting the lights from within.The craft itself was a silvery color. Our coonhounds were in the pen right beside us but paid no attention . I do remember that the rooster crowed but whether or not it was his normal evening crow is debatable because it was right at dark.  After a few minutes the craft took off going straight up. It was completely out of sight in a matter of 2 - 3 seconds.  Although the craft itself made no sound there was a sound like when you inhale deeply just as it started up ( like moving air) but we felt no wind.  I said earlier that I don&apos;t think I could have moved and I substantiate this by the fact that as soon as the craft took off my mom  started toward the house saying she was going to call the police. Until it was gone none of us had moved even one step, just stood there dumbfounded.  Daddy stopped mama telling! her she would not call the police or anybody else. He told us not to tell anybody about it. Said he didn&apos;t want people thinking we were crazy. The next day there was an article in the local paper &quot;The Daily Home&quot; in which officials from Ft. McClellan Army Base about 40 miles away claimed this was a weather balloon. There had been numerous reports of a strange light made the evening before.  Apparently all the reports were made by persons who saw the craft airborn and from a distance because what we saw from less than 100 yards, stationary and as big as a small house would have taken a far stretch of the imigination to conclude to be a weather balloon. I made no mention of the event for several years.  While engaged to my husband I told him about it and was promply laughed at. For several years his skepticism continued.  Then on January 31, 1996 he too witnessed some unusual craft from a lookout point at Oak Level in Cleberne Co. AL  We reported the incident to the UFO hotline that morning but I have been unable to find documentation of the report on this website.  This being the case I will file a report on it as well.", "We saw a comet-like light in the southwest sky while travelling toward Wellington NevadaWhile driving toward Wellington, NV from the East Walker River on Hwy 208 I noticed a large, white, comet-like shape just over the horizon.  This became visable to us as we climbed in elevation so, by the time we noticed it it was very large, suggesting it was fairly close.  It was much larger than the moon would appear to be if in the same position. The very center of the &quot;ball&quot; had a green tint that was only noticable if viewed with peripheral vision.  Also, there was a red tail eminating from the green center that extended downward at about 45 degrees.  The object seemed to grow in diameter and lessen in intensity over the next five minutes until it disappeared. It was &quot;cloudlike&quot; and I would best describe it as an explosion of some sort.  As the light diminished we noticed two other objects, much smaller.  One looked to be heading south at a high rate of speed just over the horizon of the Seirra&apos;s, while the other appeared to be dropping from the &quot;explosion&quot;.  This object moved erratically as if it were debris.  Both of these objects also looked like small comets, looking like small flashlights in the sky.  They may have been aircraft or helicopters?  One was definetly flying, but the other seemed to be &quot;floating&quot; downward and not in control.  Both were approximately the same size and had the same level of intensity.  I&apos;ve read other posts at this sight from the Fresno area, and although I thought this was much closer to us in Nevada this may have been the same object(s).  I&apos;m not trying to jump on any bandwagon but since I saw this thing I&apos;ve been searching the web to see if anyone else saw anything.  I really believed at the time that an airliner exploded.  This object was so large I assumed that many people had to see it.", "We saw two sets of crosses composed of five luminous spheres each.  One cross was slightly higher than the other. The spheres were of various pastel luminous colors.The crosses were made up of three vertical spheres and one other sphere on either side of the center sphere.  They appeared to be about one mile above us and were in plain sight.  The croses did not move.  We were traveling in our car and witnessed the phemonena for at least three minutes before it moved out of our range of vision.  One witness is an associate professor of the arts and the other is a retired hospital worker.", "police helicoter crew see unknown object as it flew at their helicopter and then north at a high rate of speed, out of view.0039 hours: A Police Helicopter crew, cosisting of one pilot and one observer, working a call in the city of Carson, Los Angeles. The pilot tells the observer, &quot;Hey! You want to see a UFO? Look at that!&quot; The observer and pilot see a orange ball of light in front of the helicopter, heading from west to east at the same altitude. The object is at 2 miles and closing. The helicopter is in right hand orbits over the call at approximately 400 to 500 AGL. The object was moving at a normal speed for the area ( under 200 knotts) at what the crew estimated at around 150 knotts or so. the object was at the helicopters 12 O&apos; clock postion as the nose of the aircraft passed through the west (270- 280 degrees) while in the orbit. the object was moving slower relative to the nose of the aircraft while it continued to orbit. As the nose of the aircraft came to about 360 degrees (north) the pilot began a straight and level flight path. The object was moving across the wind screen from left to right (from 10 O&apos; clock to our 2 O&apos; clock). As it got to the 2 O&apos; clock position, the object changed direction and did a wide right hand orbit to the south.the pilot adjusts the aircrafts flight path puting the object at the 2 o&apos; clock position again. the object then changed direction again, accelerated, and headed directly at the observers door (right side) of the helicopter. Startled, the observer, thinking he was pressing the intercom button, said to the pilot, &quot;Oh SHIT!&quot; as the object came at them. The observer had acually pressed both of the foot switches, activating both the intercom system and the radio transmitter. The object got within about 200 feet of the aircraft and then changed direction again, flying to the north at a very high rate of speed and out of view. The ground units call the office after the crew had landed and wanted to know what happened and why the crew left with out saying any thing but, &quot;Oh SHIT!&quot;. They did not see the object. It should be noted that hte object was able to change direction with out any ! type of turning manuver. it just changed direction. If you were to draw its&apos; flight path, you would draw all right angles. the only time that it turned semi-normal was when it started the right hand orbit to the south but even that did not look normal. The movement almost looked like a Hollywood special effect. I hope you don&apos;t think I&apos;m a nut but I&apos;ve been around/involved in aviation for a long time. I&apos;ve never seen anything like this. The texture, the shape, the movement, the speed changes and the drastic angles all add up to it NOT being anything that I have ever seen. PS I would like to keep my name and agency out of the report but would be more than happy to speak to anyone from your organization that would be interested in this event. It was a bit un-nerving. I was the observer.", "Sightings in our area have persisted for one year. The individuals kept these sightings silent so as not to create a &quot;hot spot&quot;until they could verify that it was not military and obtain photographs and contact if possiable. These individuals invested in some low tech equipment and were able to get the craft/crafts to respond to signal. The individuals are a former police dispatcher, an airline mechanic, a former private investigator and a CNA.It is not until now that they have chosen to make the location of sightings to your center. Currently details of their sightings including times,location,and response from local military bases and FAA will be posted on a web site 24 hours from the sending of this report,whose address is http://www.((URL deleted)) Currently they are conducting their own investigation. Several astronomy individuals have also sighted objects. These four feel that simply reporting a sighting or even getting video tape is not enough to change the proof already offered in large volume. Therefor, their goal is not neccarilly to photograph but to contact and or signal the craft. They have been successful with signaling the craft on two seperate occassions.Yesterday a report was sent to you concerning Lake Wales Florida. We did not give you the correct web address for a database of these sightings. the correct address is http://www.((address deleted)).html This is where the four investigators in central Florida after remaining non public for almost a year have put their findings , sightings on the net.

This is the email I sent then: About 1:20 am tonight I was working here at my computer which has a whole wall of windows beside it.  We live on San Juan island in Washington BTW.  Out of the corner of my eye I noticed a very bright light in the sky. I looked over at it and saw it was very bright and looked unusual.  So I grabbed the binoculars I have here for ship watching. In looking through my binoculars I could see a triangular shaped thing in the sky, very bright with one side red lights and the other green.  It seemed to be just hovering motionlessly.  I thought it must be a helicopter but it just never seemed to move.  When I took down the binoculars I could see it was quite high in the sky near the off coast island of Chatham.  I watched it for about five minutes and it didn&apos;t move although sometimes it seemed to change angle or something as the lights got dimmer at times (as though it was being seen side on or something).  It then moved down a bit slowly, then stopped, then moved a bit etc.  The red and green lights were very bright at times and it was sometimes a distinct triangle shape and other times not clearly shaped (it seemed to move so that I was seeing it from different angles).  My husband was asleep so I didn&apos;t wake him up..until suddenly this object started moving *very fast* and very erratically..........just squiggles of light streaking and darting about in a very random way and very fast.  With that I called my husband and he came downstairs.  He came over to the window and I told him what I was still seeing and I said I know of nothing that moved that way and handed him the binoculars.  Unfortunately he was totally mistaken about where to look although I told him where (he wasted 2 or more minutes looking into the water!).  By the time he got that when I said &quot;I think I might be seeing a UFO&quot; it would be best to look at the bright object in the sky as I said, it had stopped moving.  I saw with my naked eye the object was now over the city of Victoria (this was about 1:40 am PST tonight Feb 14).  He looked through his binoculars and said yes it was red and green lights and he thought it was triangle shaped and it wasn&apos;t moving.  He watched it for about 7 minutes and then said it was getting fainter.  I looked through the binoculars and saw that indeed it was getting faint and it seemed to fade away (into the distance?). The lights were *not small blinking lights* as one normally sees on an airplane.  They were a *bank* of lights and did not blink.  The red was on the left and green on the right as I observed it.  My husband confirmed with me that he observed the same thing.  Also he confirmed with me that he watched this *unmoving* object for approximately 10 minutes.  Before I called him downstairs to see it, I watched it for about 15 minutes then as I was hesitant to awake him.  As I said earlier it did not move in that time period until its sudden darting movement which caused me to call my husband. Other than this one burst of sudden movement it always seemed to be stationary until it faded away.  I don&apos;t know of any airplane that moves that way or looks like that.  I have often seen planes in the sky and they did not look this way. As a test a few nights later (the night after I wrote the email) we both trying looking at everything we saw in the sky for over 1 hour both outside and through the windows.  Planes looked nothing like it. Stars looked nothing like it.  Planets (we could see Mars and probably Jupiter early in the evening) did not look like it.  I even tried to duplicate the darting type motion by moving my head as I watch through the binoculars and I had to move my head about a great deal to make the light I was looking at seem to *move*.  I assure you I was not moving my head when I watched the strange light on the 14th nor was I having any tremors in my hands.", "I looked up into the night sky only to see a &quot;comet&quot; streaking across the sky, but then it made a squiggle and disappeared.I had been visiting my neighbor and was outside saying good-night when above her head I saw a comet (I was facing south and the comet went from east to west). But the comet made a squiggle (as if someone was holding a flashlight and started jostling it up-&amp;-down rapidly). Then the comet was gone. I dismissed it thinking it may have been a moth, but moths don&apos;t just disappear. This &quot;comet&quot; was orange, was flying in a straight line;then it made a squiggle and just as quickly as it appeared, it disappeared. Vanished. As if plucked from the sky. At this time, it was dark, but there was a street light directly to my left, thus my thought it was a moth that had been flying away from the street light. We&apos;ve had a good view of the stars at night until last night. I did noth bring this to my friends attention as she was facing the wrong way and by the time I could have blurted out the words, it would have been too late. And I didn&apos;t want her thinking I was seeing things.", "Moving light around a stationary object...As my friends and I were walking home from a store, we we&apos;re looking at the sky, and noticed a white light rovolving around what seemed to be a star.  The light was too high to be a plane or heliocopter.  As we were watching it, it revolved around the &quot;star&quot; 5 times, and then as it got right over my head, the white revolving light flashed very bright.  My friends and I went inside to get the attention of our parents, and when we came out and looked in the exact same spot that the &quot;star&quot; and the light were, they were gone, and there were no clouds in the sky at that time.", "aLL LIGHTS WENT OFF , BUT, ELECTRONIC EQUIPTMENT CAME ON , EVEN THOUGHT THERE WAS NO POWER  ( THER WERE NO STORMS , THUNDER, LIGHTENING @ THIS TIME ...THE SKY THEN LITE UP ALL WHITE AS THOUGH IT WERE DAY TIME ,,SAME AS ABOVE ---PEOPLE IN A SMALL TOWN AWAY FROM US 3 MILES SAID THEY SAW IT (sKY)", "My name is ((deleted)) and i was driving down the street.

No sound, Shape well defined, Sky dark and clear, 30-40 degree temp. Observed for approx. 2 minutesThe object was sighted from a &quot;Ground Observer Corp&quot;. post on the roof of a hotel in Aberdeen SD.It was in November, around the 15th. The weather was clear and cold. At about 18:30 hrs we stepped out of our shelter building on the roof to get a bit of fresh air. As we walked toward the roof edge we noticed an orange eliptical shape traveling towards us at a fairly slow rate of speed. When it was first noticed it, it was about 25 degrees above the horizon. It appeared to travel straight south to north and directally above the main street below. As it approached, the shape changed to a more circular shape. when it was directally over head it appeared circular. As it continued North, it again took on a more eliptical shape. We returned to the shelter where we called in the sighting to the G.O.C. reporting station in Huron SD, 90 miles due South of our location. The officer taking our report indicated that an object of the same description had been sighted at their location about 3 minutes earlier, it was traveling North. It&apos;s shape was well defined against a fairly black winter night sky. Some air glow was present but planets and stars were visible. Both of the observers were highschool students who had signed up to be Ground Observers and were on their normal shift. Although we felt there was little chance of us seeing a foriegn military plane at our location, we did keep good track of all civilian aircraft in and out of the airport some 8 miles to the East of our location. During the week and during the previous week there had been several reports by ranchers of cattle mutilations so we were especially watchfull for non aircraft in the skys. It was reported on the local radio station that theres on the North edge of town had also seen the object about the same time as we had seen it a few miles South of their location. Thgis sighting was near the end of a week long series of sightings around the state.", "on 03-25-99 me and my wife were on interstate 40 east bound when we saw a bright light in front of us it stoped and then all of a sudden it was gone at a very fast speed it lasted about 8 sec. and left at a very fast speed I do not think that this was any of our aircraft .

My wife also saw a tilted disc shape to its immediate left with what appeared to be light dots inside. We observed this object from our porch for several minutes. During this period it also moved slowly to the right a few degrees then stopped briefly before moving vertically several degrees.

It was at this point the next dorr neighbour who also saw the event went and fetched his binoculars although too late as the ball curved and went off to the south. By the time we went back to the rear of the house and chatted over the fence about what we saw another could be seen far of in the distance coming from the same direction, so the next door neighbour went and grabbed his binoculars again and we just waited for the object to come. It did the exact same thing as the first following the same path, but this time we were able to get a really good look at it through the binoculars.

Then in the next five minutes, three more craft appeared. They were in a V-shaped flight formation heading to the north.  My son came on the deck with me and my wife four minutes after the other three appeared. After a short time, maybe a couple minutes, the craft took off at very high speed to the north.

It looked like the crafts in the Mexico City sightings. Metalic body with a dark stripe running through the middle. There was no noise, like you would expect from a conventional aircraft.

Vernon border. At first it was stationary and then much to our surprise it dropped an impossible distance and effortlessly circled and shifted its position with unbelievable ease and speed. We observed the familiar lights of a commercial jet in the distance which gave us a frame of reference to place this object closer to us than the plane as it passed in between. It continued to move up and down and from side to side, sometimes at dizzying speed, for almost 40 minutes unitl at least two helicopters arrived, presumably, to investigate it.  Up until the helicopters arrival we had not noticed that the object was moving about in total silence. The din of the choppers gave us that frame of reference. Nothing had been reported on the news, however, the local authorities did state that they had received numerous calls reporting the same object.", "Three bright white lights evenly spaced with a additional flashing red light to the immediate left of the center bright white light.  It was traveling over the Indianola area (Miller Bay), toward Saquamish and Bainbridge Island, south-west at 21:19-21:28.  There was also a bright white/green white strobe with every third blink of the red light.  Quiet and huge in width, height unknown, speed hard to estimate not knowing the height or actual size.  It did travel at a constant speed.Looking out my window in a south-west direction a very large object with lights caught my attention passing over our budding alder tree.  I jumped up looked out my window and spotted 3 steady bright white lights lined up in a straight line and evenly spaced to my upper left still moving in a south-west direction overhead. I looked at my watch and it read 9:19pm.  The center steady white light had a blinking red light near it and an additional whitish or slightly greenish strobe.  The whitish light flashed with every third or so red flash.  The red light flashed once every other second or so.  I grabbed our W.W.II tank binoculars mounted on a tripod and checked it out.  It was really wide, a lot wider and larger than any plane I have ever seen here, I could not establish what the objects shape was, I could only see the line of lights.  I ran out onto the balcony and did not hear engines, then I ran back into living room and watching with the binoculars as it disappeared into a long white wispy cloud. There were very few clouds in the south-west sky. I looked at my watch and now it read 9:23pm. I called my wife in San Diego and told her what I saw, while keeping my eyes on the cloud.  I thought it had gone, when all of a sudden it reemerged on the far side of the cloud (the south-west side) and made a left turn.  I again looked at my watch and now it read 09:28.  I followed it with the binoculars until it faded after what seemed to be 3-4 minutes.  I forgot to look at my watch this time because I ran into the den, grabbed a compass and ran back into the living room.  I established the course heading at approximately 200-210 degrees on the south-west leg from 9:19-9:23pm.  When it came out of the cloud at 09:28pm and changed its course to the left, I approximated the left turn to be about 60 degrees. That is a really rough guess.  I approximated using existing land marks, my compass, estimated time and the objects diminishing relative size.  I am still not sure just how high it was but it was big. There were small plane passing between me and the cloud the object disappeared into and they were really dwarfed in comparison to the width of the line of lights, probably about a 15:1 ratio.", "white light suddenly appeared; then turning neon green.

Inoticed them moving towards my home. It had a triangular shape,with 2 very bright lights on corners.To whom it may concern, On April 7,1999 at 10:58 pm, I was in my bathroom when I noticed a stange light outside the window. I immediately pulled the sheers to the side to have a better look. The lights resembled car headlights from a distance. As the craft approached towards my home, the lights seemed to spread apart. At this point the craft was slightly above maple trees in my front yard. Thats when I saw it had a triangular shape. The bright lights were on the corners of the object, and the wing span was about 37-40 ft long. It also had red pusating lights on the bottom.The speed of the craft was faster than it appeared.

Suddenly, we saw a very strong light coming from behind the nearby (?) hill, and the light appeared to be &quot;searching.&quot;   At first, we thought that it might be a border guard or military helicopter, but within a few minutes, we noticed a large light-green ball, with a beam of light apparently being projected from the bottom portion of the object.  The object was moving very slowly toward us, and after approximatley, it divided into 3 small balls.  The three objects then rose in the atmosphere very rapidly.  I believe that the object was not man-made.  In those times, we did not know about UFO&apos;s, but I am convinced that I saw something very strange.

We waited about 15 minutes and got ready 2 play horseshoes when i looked strait up and there was another one.I got the binoculars and looked up to see what looked like maybe a weather ballon but as quick as i thought that it changed to look like a rectangle silver shape.I gave the binoculars to someone else and ran in the house to get the movie camera! By the time i got that ready it must have been a couple of miles away.

AL  appx. 45 min. later. Because this is Public Hunting on National Forest he wanted to claim the spot for the last day of deer season. He planned to sleep in the truck until daybreak. When parked at the top of the mountain and facing west the glow of lights from the cities of Anniston (S.W.), Jacksonville (due west) and Piedmont (N.W.) are visible on a clear night which this was. Shortly after arriving he reclined the seat to nap but noticed a bright light over the city of Jacksonville.This he passed off as a bright star or the planet Venus. That is until the &quot;star&quot; started to move. He passed this off as a helicopter training flight from Ft. McClellan which lay just to the south of Jacksonville  in the Anniston glow of lights.  His assumption of a training flight was suddenly changed when this light darted at a humanly impossible speed to the north toward Piedmont. In less than a second the light hovered in the glow of Piedmont&apos;s lights having covered a distance of about 15 miles almost instantaneously.  After a few minutes the craft darted back so that it was again over Jacksonville.  This time he witnessed a beam flash downward. By now he had raised the seat from its reclining position astounded by what he was seeing. He observed the movements of this light for quite some time and in fact became bored and eventually drifted off to sleep.  After dozing for and an hour or so he awoke to the same activity in the skies to the west  This soon after changed when the light was approached by a larger and brighter one which came from the west.  The smaller began  moving around it in a way that is most easily compared to insects flitting around a light. This seemed to have served to convey some type of message because at that point the smaller light headed straight in my husband&apos;s direction. The larger light faded backwar! d in the direction from which it had come (that of Sand Mtn. approx. 4o miles WNWof Jacksonville.)  As the craft continued in his direction my husband chambered a shell  into his deer rifle.  This done the light almost instantly began backing away in the same direction taken by the larger as if it sensed danger. My macho husband who had for years treated my early 1970&apos;s sighting as a joke waited until daylight then raced home afraid that his headlights may allow the crafts to pinpoint where to get him in the future. He woke me as soon as he came in saying &quot;I won&apos;t ever laugh at you again&quot;.  He then related the story insisting that we report the incident. We called the local airports at both Weaver and Anniston.  They in turn referred us to the Airport in Birmingham who had no record of Military training flights that night.  My husband was able to tell them approximate times for commercial flights from Atlanta to Memphis  and from Birmingham to Chattanooga that had passed over during these events.  We were able to get the number for the UFO hotline from the Birmingham facility and filed a report that morning before 8:00. These events happened in the very early morning hours of Sunday, January 31,1996. Unknown to us at the time there had been numerous reports during the previous night and early morning. Similar sightings were associated with reports of cattle mutilations carried out with surgical precision in the Sand Mtn. area over the course of the next several weeks. Reports were filed by law enforcement officials, city council representatives and other such reliable figures.  The area was visited by  UFOlogists and there was quite a bit of press coverage. I believe this event had a profound impact on my husband. I noticed distinct changes in his personality almost immediately. He was better able to express his feelings and demonstrated increased patience and anger control. He also seemed more sensitive to the feelings of others. He seemed to sense when I did not feel well. I also noticed that he seemed m! ore protective of the children and me.  Although I have questioned the fact that maybe one of those beams got him he insists that it is not possible. He insists that he went to sleep during these events which I feel would have been impossible given his level of excitement upon returning home.", "A bright object in the sky moved towards us then flew away.During the summer of 1990 while serving in the US Army at Sinai Peninsula, myself and 3 other soldiers witnessed a star-like object moving towards us. It seemed to get brighter and bigger in diameter as it got closer. We were all looking at it and it was as if it were looking at us also. The object then stopped and took of into the sky almost like a reverse shooting star quickly fading over the horizon. We never actually saw the object itself, only the light from it. It appeared to be only a star, but that was the first time I ever saw a star move in that manner. Could somebody please E-mail me and let me know if there is any explanation for what we saw?", "3rd sighting of UFO&apos;s in DIA areaWas in backyard with girlfriend who&apos;s always watching as we&apos;ve had 2 other sightings since December, both reported here. I was giving her a hard time about always watching when I looked up and there was our &quot;light&quot; friend again. It went back and forth a small distance and sometimes hovered then just disappeared. A couple neightbor kids came over and saw it also, their parents don&apos;t appreciate this. I developed the film from our last sighting and in addition to the lights there are also &quot;steaking&quot; objects that we didn&apos;t origianlly witness with our eyes. IF you live in the Denver area take five or ten minutes every day to look at the sky... you might be surprised....we&apos;ve come to expepct to see them every now and then.", "At 20:00 hours, on March 29, 1999, I was closing my upstairs bedroom window that looks out to the Monterey Bay, I noticed that two stars were starting to move to the Southwest, then turned started to come towards the shore.  I grabbed a pair of small binoculars and ran outside on my deck, at that point, to the naked eye, I watched these two sheres, come together and forma a &apos;Triangle&apos;.  I was excited, because I read so much about these type craft.  In my sight line, thru the binoculars, I could make out the shape with a white light on both sides and a red type light in the front, I am an ex-pilot and live directly under the flight approach path, for the &apos;Monterey Peninsula Airport&apos;, I know what different aircraft come and go at all times of the day.  There was no sound at all, I watched the craft go out over the Bay towards Santa Cruz, Calif.  It was heading due North to NW. At about 2 to 3 minutes, another aircraft was in the distance coming towards it, it seemed like a small propeller, private plane.  And then there was a normal commercial jet that was over my head about 8,000 feet in the approach path for San Jose International Airport, I could here the regular engine sound as it went over my head.  At that time the Triangular Craft had gone out of sight.  From the time I viewed it, there was no sound at all and there was no other activity over the Bay that was making any sound at all, except a high tide, with normal ocean noise, (as I live a block from the beach).  I did not report any of this to any Police or Airport tower agenccies, as I was excited and at the same time watching the Nat&apos;l College Basketball Game on T.V. I called one friend, who is interested in this type of data, after my sighting.  Keep up the good work, as I am always interested in your fine Web Site and continuing coverage on &apos;Art Bell&apos;s radio show. Thank you, have a great day!  Ciao,  J.F.", "One large, orangeish light seen initially during thunder storm. Another similar light appeared a good distance away.During a severe thunderstorm, I looked out my office window to the West and observed a singular, very bright, orangeish light above the horizon. I have noticed a similar light there before, and thought it to be a planet. However, we were now in the midst of a strong thunderstorm, and there were no other lights to be seen. I went outside to get my binocculars, and to search the sky thouroughly in an effort to verify that there were no other lights to be seen. There weren&apos;t, and I became very curious about this one. I went back inside to continue to observe this light. As I was watching, Another light instantly appeared a fair distance away from the first one. This second light was identical in every observable detail. The only exception was that this one began to move slowly upward. It stopped for a while, and then it moved again to left. I was periodically observing this light with my binocculars, and After it had moved as described, it then stopped. Now It seemed to have other features. It seemed to have length, because it had other lights on it that allowed me to discern that it wasn&apos;t simply a glowing ball. the first ligh is still stationary at this point. The storm began to subside, and the sky cleared up. I went outside to get a better view. The second object began to &quot;drift&quot; away, until it was out of view entirely. Then, to the right of the first object, another light apeared. Very bright, and it was drifting east, (toward my viewpoint) then it stopped for about 10 seconds. The light that it was eminating was more white than orange, and as I observed it through my binocculars, the light, which resembled a spotlight to me, seemed to become more foccused in my direction, as if the craft was rotating slightly. It then began to move again, and proceeded to fly almost directly over my head. (However, these objects were not close at all, and it was very difficult to view any details) The only description I can give you is that it seemed to be rather long, based, again, on the lights I was observing on the craft. This object &quot;drifted&quot; out of view. When I turned my attention back to the first light, The one I first saw durring the storm, I noticed a much more interesting flying craft: Seen without the binocculars, it very much ressembled the other lights (Bright Glowing Ball) With the binocculars I observed Five lights associated with this craft: It seemed to be a rectangular object, Very large, with white lights at each corner, and a blinking red light in the middle. It seemed to be flying a large holding pattern over an area where there would be no reason to do this. (No Airport) I observed it repeating this pattern twice. Then it disapeared. The first light was no longer vissible when I went back upstairs. I don&apos;t know what all of this was, and I realize that it may be very explainable. But I have never observed such a display. I don&apos;t know what was hovering about, but I would love to speak to anyone else who saw this.", "saw what we thought was a helicopter in trouble. disk was approx 35feet above ground and sitting motionless making no noise approx 40 feet in front of usOn the way to work, traveling west, just on the outskirts of town next to a small airport, we saw what appeared to be a helicopter in trouble. The craft had blue and red lights, and came from the sky, settling over the highway, very close to the ground. It sat for a second then slowly moved south, moving into the yard of a small home that sits right at the end of the airport, and next to the highway. There was a thunderstorm beginning and there was alot of high lightening. Our community was also having their July 4th fireworks display. As i approached the spot where the craft had entered the yard, i stopped my vehicle right in the highway, opened my door and stood outside looking at the craft sitting just above an electrical or telephone wire that was going into the home from a pole next to the highway. My passenger stayed in the car and watched from the passenger side. The craft sat motionless above the wire. It was round and metallic gray in color (dark grey)with a smokey glass dome shape in the center bottom of the craft. It was no bigger than a large car in diameter, and it was not as thick as a car would be. It didnt look big enough for a human to sit in upright. The lights of the craft were pulsing from the edges of the craft, and appeared to be coming from inside. They did not look like they were like our lights would be like on a car. They were pulsing and growing dimmer. I was approx. 40 feet away from the object, and we watched it until the lights dimmed out completely. When they were completely out, if you didnt know it was there, it would have been extremely hard to see. My passenger began to scream and stomp her feet on the floor of the car, and I felt like i was coming out of a trance or something. I jumped in the car, had much difficulty getting it into gear, (it was still running) and left as fast as i could. We did not talk at all for most of the drive to work, (25 miles) and when we did, we were trying to explain it, trying to convince each other that it could be something from this earth. We both had been in a state of shock. Bye the time on my car clock, I knew we had watched the craft for approx 10 mins. My passenger and I both worked as machine operators for a major manufacturer in Rochelle Ill. 2 years later, I became a Training Coordinator for the plant, teaching trainers how to train properly, creating training manuals and training materials, and also taking care of any issues or problems that may come up during a training period.  My passenger worked for approx 1 more year, then moved out of area.", "WHILE TAKING MY POLICE PARTNER TO HIS HOME IN THE SOUTH BAY, WE WERE DRIVING SOUTHBOUND ON INTERSTATE 5 NEAR IMPERIAL BEACH, CA., WHEN WE SAY A BRIGHT FAST MOVING ROUND WHITE OBJECT MOVING FROM EAST TO SOUTH WEST AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED.ON APRIL 1, 1999 , I WAS TAKING MY POLICE PARTNER TO HIS HOME IN THE SOUTHBAY CITY SUBURB OF SAN DIEGO CALLED IMPERIAL BEACH.

WHEN IT FINALLY STOPPED, IT WAS OUT OVER THE OCEAN, AND LOOKED A LITTLE BIT SMALLER IN SIZE, BUT JUST AS WHITE AND JUST AS BRIGHT.

Went north about a mile and then made a hard left bank and came back. Then turned west and went over town and was goneI am a pilot so I know what I saw cannot be done. This craft went right over us. I looked at my son and he had the same look I did, our mouths were hanging open. Went north and made such a hard bank and moving so slow it would have stalled. But it came out of it&apos;s hard bank and came back toward us. Oh, did I mention this thing made no noise what so ever. Thats why I knew what it was doing could not be done. It had a marker light on each side and after it came back at us you could see two dimmer lights in the front. We just stood there watching it knowing it was not from here. It came back south and then turned west and went over town untill it dissapeared. We both just stood there like it froze us. Hope this is helpful .", "I saw a bright white light approximately 80 ft. above the lake and approximately 2 football fields length away from me.I was driving westbound on hwy. 200, east of Sandpoint. I came around a few curves and noticed a bright white light off to my right over the lake. It was perfectly still and  below the horizon. Emanating from the light was a triangular beam of light going down to the water. The triangular beam was a grey/white color. I was able to see the light and beam for approximately 10-12 sec. and then it went out. Immediately after the light and beam went off I thought I saw what appeared to be 2 narrow rectangular dim red lights. The rectangular lights looked as though they closed up. I continued driving and looking through my rear and side view mirrors. After about 1 mile further away from the site I saw the light and beam reappear, as I continued to drive.", "I and a friend went outside for an evening cigarette at approx. 11:00p.m. The evening was crystal clear. Because it was so clear we looked up into the sky and saw 6 to 7 small white objects going at extremely high speed, doing moves that no known aircraft could make.  We observed them for approx. 1/2 hour.  I then went back inside and upstairs.  My friend then screamed out to me, &quot;Maureen!, Maureen! come here!  What is this?  I ran outside and looked up and saw a huge craft, with pulsating multi-colored lights underneath it.  It was beginning to slowly descend, and was circling the area.  About one block.  I ran inside and up the stairs to look out, then downstairs, outside in the front yard.  I could not understand why no one else was outside, and the streets were deserted.  I stayed out front by myself for about 15 min.  Then I ran inside to call the police.  The police said that they did not know what I was talking about, &quot;There isn&apos;t anything up there&quot;.  After I hung up I called to my own home which is about 10 min. away.  I had my husband, and 24 yr old son go outside and look.  They said also that they could not see anything.  I hung up and ran back out to the back yard and my friend and I observed the objects for about another 1/2 hr.  Finally it shot up and disappeared.  We were totally disoriented and we were nonchalant about the happening, almost robotic, and we both checked our watches and went back to what we were previously doing.  Several days later, I commented to my friend how strangely we acted, why were we so calm, why didn&apos;t we speak about it?  At that time my friend glossed over my comments. She did not want to talk about it, because she could not logically explain it, and it perplexed her as she is a mathematician from Poland. Our experience did not make sense to her.  Also, her husband was very ill at the time. Her husband has since passed on.  In June of 1998 she watched by accident a show about UFO&apos;s and it reminded her of our incident. When I stopped by for visit several days after the show she mentioned to me about our sighting, and was very curious about what it was that we saw. She had not thought about it since it happened.

The kids were getting ready to go to sleep when we spotted the lights. I recall sitting in the lawnchair with my husband standing behind me.

We never saw them again....", "I was visiting the site of the famous civil war battles by myself.  At that night, I was restless and got out of bed.  I looked out of my hotel window for no given reason.  There was a bright red-orange-yellow sphere in the sky.I woke up at 10:50.  I was very restless and I got out of bed to get a drink of water.  After a quick bathroom break I walked over to the hotel window, and pulled the curtain aside.  Nothing was normal at first to me.  I remember noticing the object in the sky and quickly passing it off for a plane or something else.  After a while it dawned on me that the object in the sky was not moving and was a very unnatural color which kept changing from red to yellow to orange and back to red again.  I could not tell what the shape of the craft was because of the lights which were growing and shrinking in size.  I stared at this figure in the sky for a long time.  Suddenly, the light dissapeared completely from sight, leaving no trace of its existance.  When I looked at the clock again it was 11:12.  The strangest part of this experience was that when I stepped back into bed, even though I had just experienced a strange and even scarry sight, I felt very relaxed and happy, and fell back to sleep easily.", "Bright yellow-orange light that morphed into two, then one, then faded in and out before disappearing.Saw my second UFO in a month last night (5/6/99). Interestingly enough, I had a &quot;feeling&quot; about it before it happened. The incident occurred while we were driving home from a shopping foray into Pueblo, CO. A little after sunset I spotted another yellow-orange light, this time in the Western sky, though not as bright as the prior UFO. It was stationary and I thought it might be a star but then it split into TWO lights right next to each other, then merged back into one, then two--the strangest thing. After a couple of minutes of shape-shifting, it started fading in and out. It would disappear for 30-40 seconds, then appear again. This occurred MULTIPLE times and there were ZERO clouds in the sky that could have caused the light to be periodically obscured. Also it was not a mechanical strobing like airplane lights but more random and the source wasn&apos;t moving much. Finally, after another 3-4 minutes, it just faded out for good. My wife saw it too, although she couldn&apos;t get as sustained a look because she was driving when it occurred.", "Saw unusal light &quot;star&quot; move across sky - amber orb lowered and followed 2 witnesses (from dime size to basketball size in seconds. while 2 others watched. It came to within few 100 ft. of ground, manuevered uturn and went up and south at rapid speed.  Made no noise, did not flash.One the evening of April 13, 1999 my sister, 12 year old son, and 9 year old daughter, were outside watching stars.  A neighbor had recently spotted an unusual looking flashing star, and we speculated that it could&apos;ve been a number of optical illusions, he felt it may have been a satellite or other manmade object. Nevertheless, we (me, son, daughter, and sister) were watching the stars that night and I attempted to point out the particular star the neighbor had commented about.  He was on the phone with me at this time (about 8:45 pm) it was dark. I was on my front porch at this time.  I was looking in a southerly direction as he attempted to explain where the star he&apos;d viewed was.  My sister 9 year old daughter and 12 year old son walked approx 500 feet away from the house (south - towards the neighbor&apos;s house) and were looking for the flashing star.  My neighbor had looked at the star with binoculars and I yelled for my daughter to get a small pair we had.  She came to the house to get these, leaving my son and sister still watching the sky.  My neighbor was on the phone still, and as my daughter went inside a &quot;star&quot; moved across the sky and stopped. My neighbor on the phone who was watching for his &quot;odd&quot; flashing star said he saw something move across the sky. I said I had just witnessed it myself, we both felt it looked like a star.  He then said he could no longer see it from his house.  The star had dropped down considerably.  When it first moved it appeared about the size of a dime, and at this time it was much larger, and seemed to be just lower than the hill between my neighbor and me.  My sister and son yelled out &quot;Did you see that?&quot; I yelled back &quot;Yes&quot; I hung up the phone telling my neighbor that we were watching the moving star.  My daughter came out to the front porch about this time, and had just seen the movement she stood there with me for the duration of the event, and consequently did not find the binoculars.  At this point the star seemed to be about the size of a baseball or apple, bu! t was getting larger as it appeared to be getting lower. I yelled for my sister and son to come to the house. The were on there way to the house by this time,  stopping to look back at the star.  My stopped several times,  and seemed quite amaized or even mesmorized by the light. I kept yelling for them to hurry up and I knew my son was stopping to look because my sister was telling him to &quot;come on&quot;. The star lowered and was about the size of a basketball, and began slowly coming towards me,  in a direction I believe is north.  It was slow and paused a couple of times but it just kind of floated or glided towards me. My sister and son had made it back near our front porch and I could see that my son was very curious about the light. It is also puzzling to me and the others that by this point, it seemed to be lighter outside, closer to just after dusk, than dark, but it had been dark (I hope this makes some sort of sense to anyone reading this).  The light came to about 100 feet from us (south of us) and seemed to be lower by a little bit, than the hill top (I should probably explain that we live in hallow)  and stopped breifly - then it made an uturn and rapidle went upward and south and was completely gone within an instant. It may be important to you to know that none of use heard anytning, no engine sounds, wind, or anything else from the orb.  It did not flash in any way, and there was no other color of light associated with it. After the light was gone,  we noticed a lot of planes were flying over, and found it to be unusual.((NUFORC Note:  One of four reports from same student.

I observed them from Buffalo and Lone Mtn intersection.  About a minute later after arriving at home, they had disappeared, but a group of 4 Nellis fighters were flying in the direction the lights were seen.  Shortly after that, another group of 4 fighters headed in the same direction.  The flashing lights of the fighters were seen to eventually head first west from the AFB, but ended up more N above the Sheep Mtn Rng.

We have been sitting @huck(a local restraunt) and chatting about shtuff.  We left.

It was the wierdest thing that i have ever seen.  ANyway, after it did the loop it shot off into the NE sky out of sight.  It flew... very very very very very very very fast.  I have honestly never seen anything like it.

Then as we got closer to the mountains, about a 100 ft up in the sky we notice 6 triangler shape ships with bright orange l lights just sitting paused in the sky. I didn&apos;t know what to do so I pulled the car over as well as other cars pulled over to the side of the road to observer the space crafts. My wife asked me to just take off because she was scarred. With in minutes we notice 18 or so air force jets coming in from all directions. It looked like they were trying to circle in the space crafts. Then two of space crafts took off fast over the mountains as four air force jet tryed to chase them, but the looked way too fast. The resrt of the space crafts looked like they took off in different directions with air force jets trying to chase them as well. The rest of the night, looked like the air force owend the sky&apos;s. I think that NORAD must of saw something on radar. Why else would air force jets come at top speeds trying to circle the space ships in.

Major axis was several full moon widths long. Minor axis about half of major. No colors or marks. Early to mid AM.This report is in response to the 9/20/73 incident in Mansfield , Ohio which was reported January 1999. I have just now read this and am compelled to send in the account of my observation , which is remarkable only in that it occurred one mile NW from the location of the 9/20/73 incident. Regrettably, I can only narrow the date to between 1972 and 1974, though it did occur during the regular school year. I was a pupil of the Woodland Elementary school at the time. It was early to mid morning with clear skies. I was leaning with my back against a SW wall looking south when I looked up. I do not know why I looked up, but when I did I immediately saw an oval image directly overhead moving slowly from west to east. It was pure white with a slight homogenous glow over its shape.  The major axis of the oval was several full moon widths long and the minor axis was about half of the major. The edges were slightly  fuzzy due to the glow. The image had no colors or marks and I did not hear any sound from it. The lack of markings or sharp edges prevented me from judging it&rsquo;s altitude, but I did have the impression that it was low, maybe tree top level.  I observed this for three to six seconds until it passed out of view behind the school roof. I paused for just enough seconds to say to myself, &ldquo;what in the...?&rdquo;, then ran away from the building expecting to see it again.

They would stop then move laterally for a few seconds. They would again move forward, then hover, and move sideways. I went inside to get my binoculars, and to dress warmer, when I returned some 8-10 minutes later, the 2 outside lights had moved. One out of my sight, the other was closer to me and very close to the horizon. It had gotten very bright. A minute or so later, this light moved vertically at a high velocity and stopped instantly. It appeared higher than the two remaining lights (with the red between) which seemed farther off too. I estimate the elevation to be about 5,000 ft, if so the light that shot vertically was travelling around 700 mph. They all eventually moved south and lower until they were out of my sight. I don&apos;t think these lights were helicopters, airplanes, or stars (I compared the lights positions to other objects in the night sky including stars and trees). So what is left? Was this one object with four parts, or four objects anchored together at first?", "Saw 7 unidentified objects travelling from South-East to West over a period of 5 hours.There were 2 types of sightings.  The first 3 were all seen more to the southern portion of the sky and then travelled east at about 3-4 times the speed of an aircraft. There was an aircraft in the sjy around the same time. There were no flashing lights and the light was steady, no twinkling.  One made a 90 degree maneuver at one point.  They eventually diminished in size and dissapeared.  The next 4 appeared anywhere from 5 to 45 minutes apart and they all had the same similar location of origin but they would at first appear very large before diminishing to nothing.  Compared to the Large Red star in the southern sky (Mars? - Planet??) that was visible that night it would have been almost twice as large.  They moved very fast and dissapeared from sight in almost 10-15 seconds.  They were not comets or meteors or stars.  We were not convinced they were ships but they were definitely unusual.  The light appeared &quot;smooth&quot; in the sky as opposed to a plane when moving (slight jerky or halted motion??).", "Silver rod the size of a 1.5&quot; section of slender ballpoint at arm&apos;s length.

It was highly reflective, with no tail or wing structure, and no variation in the diameter of the rod.  It left no visible trail.  I heard nothing, perhaps because of driving with a dozen other nearby cars on I90. When I first noticed the rod, it was straight ahead and low in the sky.  The distance appeared to be about 1/2 mile.  It was climbing to my right at about 30 degrees.  Within 5 seconds I could no longer see it even though I leaned forward to look as high as I could through the windshield of my vehicle.", "Glowing ball flying parrallel to the earth at about 10,000 feetWe were on the beach waiting for new year. Population of the island was about 1000 people and is a very quite island. No artificial light was observed. We were sitting facing East. The object flew in a North to South direction. At first thought it was a comet. Then realized it was traveling more like a satelite. Path was parallel to the earth at 10,000 feet. I am a pilot and feel the altitude was accurate and the speed was in excess 800 knots. No flashing anti collision lights, just a bright glow with a yellowish color. A slight trail was evident. Absolutley no sound was heard. We watched the object pass behind a cloud and reappear which gave me the impression that it was fairly close to us and not in the outer atmosphere.

I looked up at the western sky while talking to my daughter and noticed three, bright white lights in a horizontal row flying slowly to the west which I assumed was an airplane.  Something seemed strange about the lights - they were too big and too bright for a plane - so I watched it while talking with my daughter about her turtle.  Suddenly three bright red lights in a row came from the left side of the object with the three white lights and flew quickly off to the south. The object or three bright red lights flew off at a speed faster than any airplane would fly.  When I first saw the one object &quot;split&quot; into two objects, I froze in disbelief. My 13 year old daughter asked me what was wrong and I told her what happened.  She saw the two objects as they flew away.  There were no flashing lights on either object.  The objects were a little larger than the diameter of a dime held at arm&apos;s length. Both objects flew low and along the flight paths as planes that are landing at DFW Airport and that&apos;s why I thought the first object WAS a plane...until it split into two objects (I estimate the objects would have been over Lake Lewisville at the time they seemed to &quot;split&quot; into two objects - about 6 miles away).  These were not two planes crossing paths as I was looking straight at the first object and there were no other planes or lights in the area when the red lights suddenly emerged from the left side of the first object.  I heard no sound but probably wouldn&apos;t hear any sound from that distance anyway.  Right after I lost sight of both objects due to the trees I saw a bright flash of light like a beam of light coming from the ground to the north west of the objects but I only saw it once.  I stood outside watching the area for another ten minutes but did not see any more flashes of light or anything unusual. Exactly two years ago on June 7, 1997 I saw a large, crescent moon-shaped UFO only a little to the north of what I saw tonight.  I have seen flashes of light come from the ground in that area before (mostly lake and open fields there) as well as a circle of light that appeared on the ground with no originating source above.  About two weeks after I saw the UFO on June 7th, my daughter and I saw something flash/explode about 1/2 mile due north of our back yard - it lit up the whole northern sky.  Within 5 minutes of the flash/explosion, a helicopter arrived from the west and circled the area with two bright beams of light alternately circling and landing for over an hour seeming to search the ground for something (video taped it).

Movement caught my eye and I turned to look behind me (I have wide periferal vision) and it seemed a small lintel shaped cloud was moving in the opposite direction (south) of the plane.  I mentally checked whether the planes velocity caused me to think it was moving if at all it wasnt, but then it made a westerly turn and started on the same northly trajectory as my plane above the mass of clouds below.  There were two colum shaped clouds that formed a kind of gate and I watched the small moving cloud approach them and told myself, &quot; If this flying cloud goes between those colums I&apos;ll know Im not crazy.&quot;  It did and began to gain on us. At that point I turned around to see if anybody else was seeing this except me, but nobody in the sparsely occupied plane was looking.  I watched it fly between the coloums and as it approached to a point in a perfect line with my shoulder DIVE into the cloud mass below at aproximately a 30 degree angle and disappeared.", "Myself and 3 others were in a car on the freeway when we saw a vertically long flying object moving slowly approximately 4 months ago.I was traveling to my fathers house with my friend and his mother when his mother started asking what the oddly shaped aircraft in the sky was. At first I ignored her and brushed it off as an airplane without looking out the window of the car for myself. It was when my firend looked out the window that he got my attention and i looked out the right window of the car. We were traveling northbound on the freeway at approx. 65 mph. The craft appeared to be traveling at a slow but not too slow pace, probably around 30-40 mph. Now here&apos;s the tricky part. It had a large disc at the top much like the radar discs on military airplanes, but then under the disc was a long cylinder, approx. 20 feet long. That cylinder coned-out and was joined by several slim tubes to another cylinder below it, this one no more than 10 feet long. It had a non-blinking white light directly on top (i saw this because it was quite a bit in front of us when i first saw it), and then 3 purple lights; one on the first cylinder, one on the connecting tubes and one on the very bottom of the lower cylinder. it was all white in color and it was flying very low or so it seemed. It couldn&apos;t have been more than 3 or 4 hundred feet off the ground. It was flying at a very slow pace and as we approached the point of intersection where we were to drive directly underneath the craft, while it passed over the freeway, it appeared to stop and hover just before crossing the freeway, and then out of nowhere it jetted off at a rate of about 80-90 mph. It was traveling much faster than it had previously been moving. It was out of sight within a matter of 10 or 15 seconds. Now you must forgive me for being so vague and approximate in my descriptions; it happened at night while i was in a moving car on the freeway and i was very tired at the time. I was fully concious at the time of the incident though. after it disappeared it was simply forgotten of and disregarded as nothing. i have not mentioned anything of this incident to anyone since it happened until! now. I saw your story on channel 7 eyewitness news last night and thought i would share my story with you and leave it to you to figure out what its worth.", "The space craft was flying at a 45 degree angle, approximatly a mile high, running parallel to Van Nuy Blvd on a clear day.The craft was ember in color, going about 15 to 20 miles hr. There were no light, combustable jets, propeller assisting in its travel. It flew right over the State of California Employment Development Department. It made no noise and was flying in a straight path. There were no windows, or doors. The ship was solid.

A highly brilliant white/blue light appeared south of our position. It was at least 25,000 ft or more above ground when first spotted it dropped several thousand feet dimmened then brightened again then dimmened to a pinpoint light before dissapearing. Most remarkable thing was it&apos;s almost total verticle descent. It was not a reentry pattern nor was there a tail as in comet or meteor.

There were 5 of us out there, my friend was the first to see it, I just happened to look up and before i could say anything my friend started stutterring, trying to say look. Then m other friend looked up and saw it. we stood there for about 2 minutes and then right before the other 2 people that were with us could look up and see it, tthe oval shaped light turned red and went really fast and disappeared over the trees, the 2 that didnt see it thought that we were seeing things bu tthe 3 of us that did see it tried to tell them taht we did see it.

We didnt say anything to anyone about it because we knew no one would believe us. but now i am reporting it.", "Orange light seen in Northeast sky moving slowly upward, then stopping and then moving to right (south) - approx altitude 25,000 feetMy wife and I walked out our front door toward our car and I immediately noticed a bright orange light to the right and slightly downward from the moon in the Northeastern sky. The unusual color caused us to watch closely as it moved slowly upward, stopped for about 45 seconds, and then moved slowly to right (south). There was cloud cover which had clear areas. The light appeared to be above the clouds. At first we assumed it was a plane or helicopter, but the movement of the light was not consistent as we would expect of an airplane and the orange color seemed unusual. It moved to the right (south) until it was directly eastward from us. Although the brightness had been steady at first, at this point it seemed to wax and wane although not necessarily in correlation with the breaks in the clouds. The light then disappeared and although we watched for it for several more minutes it did not appear again. Several times I thought I saw a smaller white light leave the orange light going in a southerly direction for a short distance although it was very dim because of the distance. There was never any sound that we could associate with the light as might be expected in the case of a jet passing overhead. Shortly after the light disappeared, a small light plane passed over coming from the north and flying toward the area where the light had disappeared. This may have been entirely coincidental as we do have fairly regular air traffic flying overhead.", "My roomate was taking a picture of me on a mountain. When he snapped a picture of the craft also. I was electrified or something and my roomate does not remember what happened after he took the photo. All i know is i was back at the car by my friend, right after the shot was taken.We both realized that about an hour or so was gone.There were no sounds or lights about the craft.

It was about 9:18 AM, May 14 (Friday).   We had just passed over Lake Mead; I had the left window seat.  I saw Bullhead City, where I often vacationed.  I did not see Las Vegas, so it must have been on the right of our plane. We were probably travelling almost directly along the California/Nevada border.  Judging from my atlas, the aircraft I saw was probably in the vicinity of Death Valley (valley), in California, somewhere in an area bounded by Cima, Shoshone, Ballarat and Barstow. We had just passed directly over another commercial jetliner, much below our altitude.  I looked up to see a black, jagged, roughly-rectangular aircraft slowly rise to our same altitude, going very slow, counter to our direction, gradually stopping relative movement and seeming to stay even with our flight. It appeared about half the size of the other aircraft (737&apos;s) we passed, which all shone brightly light in the clear sun.  This craft made a densely-black silhouette; no wings or fins were apparent.  It did not diminish in size as it would have if it were travelling away from us. It was west of us, at roughly ten o&apos;clock out the window. I watched it for a few minutes. I looked away for approximately 1 to 2 seconds, and looked back.  It had totally disappeared from the cloudless sky. I have been a bird watcher for years, so know how to scan for flying things. We were at full altitude, above the haze line.  I estimate it was 2 to 10 miles from us.  I did not know about Area 51 until after the flight, when I spoke with the pilot.  He said we were in that area at the time I described, and that many unusual sightings had been reported there. However, he did not acknowledge seeing any aircraft at our altitude (which surely must have come to their attention).", "While walking dog along RR tracks my brother and I witnessed five fast moving craft in the eastern sky. Several of the craft headed for the Mtn.Lights which looked just like stars (IE: not blinking) crossed over our visual horizon in the Eastern sky. We observed three commercial jetliners in the same field of vision while we were observing these lights. There is no possible way for them to have missed them. Concurrently we observed almost from the start of our paying attention several lights on the MTN itself that were in places were no vehicles can travel. From the distance we were observing there was in our opinion no way for the lights to be hikers (brightness, weather conditions in the area-high winds, cold temps) As stated three of the moving stars dissapeared on the MTN. two of the moving lights crossed in parallel fashion while a commercial jetliner was headed north. Of the three commercial jets two went N&gt;S, one went E&gt;W OF the five fast moving lights three went ESE&gt;E and disappeared on the MTN The other two went north and south respectively. We were in near complete darkness (very little ambeint light.)((name deleted)), my brother was the one who called in, I am visiting on vacation.

Facing northeast. Noticed what seemed to be a small whitish cloud captured in a light cloud cover hanging over Columbia. (Stars were visible through clouds.) Then noticed that the little cloud was moving to the north. At first it just looked like a cloud moving through the sky. But as it moved it kept its cambre. It looked like a ship plowing water; the front was raised. AS it got a little closer to us I could see that there was a more brightly lit area at the front. The general appearance was oval.  There was a bright area, a point of light at the front, followed by a lighter area which trailed off in a tail which lengthened and shortened (dissipated) as it moved. The speed seemed constant.  (The &quot;body/oval&quot; was about 1 inch at arms length and the &quot;tail&quot; as long as three inches.)  We watched it for about a minute till it moved off to the north.  It was low eneough that it seemed to be reflecting the lights from Columbia Mall. As it moved north and away from the lights the &quot;cloud&quot; no longer reflected the light, subsequently we lost sight of it.

The object was as big a full moon in the sky.I was driving in Kennewick, Washington around 9:00-9:15pm and was heading east on Clearwater Ave. I was approaching Columbia Center Blvd. and saw a huge object in the sky. The object was round and looked like a giant fire ball. The object was bright red with fire coming off of the surface. I saw this fireball in the south eastern part of the sky and it seemed bigger than the moon in the sky that night(which was only a partial crescent moon). I would say it was as big as a full moon when comparing it to the objects in the sky. It definitely was the largest, unidentified object I have ever seen in my life. It was so large I expected to feel some type of impact after it disapeared beyond the outline of the buildings(which were in my way, so I could not see it land or crash).", "It was about 10:30 p.m. and I was looking out side of my house at the stars.

I felt that there was a person in my room.  I heard faint talking and then I realized that there were about 3 people, I thought men, in my room.  I was scared and my heart was beating fast.  I felt paralyzed and couldn&apos;t turn to look.  I was so scared I was afraid of looking.  I was sleeping on my right side with back towards the windows and they were standing behind me.  I felt hands come to the front of my neck, right where the crease is.  The hands or tips of the fingers touched there, resting on the crease.  I felt my torso tingling.  The phone rang and I completely woke up and was thankful.  I told the person on the phone what had happened.  I also told other people because it was so real to me.  One person mentioned that it sounded like an alien encounter.  Two weeks past the incident I went in for my annual check-up and the nurse left a message on my phone to contact them about my lab results.  I have always been in perfect health except for skin cancer and tooth problems.  I called and she said that my blood showed that I had a hyperthyroid and that I needed to come in for tests.  I was totally shocked.  However, the next day the occurrence of what happened two weeks prior came to my mind and the placement of the hands.  They were placed on my thyroid.  I go in for tests on May 11.  I still don&apos;t know for sure if it was a dream or reality but to me it seemed very real.  Not too many things frighten me but I was very scared and felt there was something going on behind my back (no puns intended).  I witnessed a UFO sighting in 1966 - saw the craft up close and thought that maybe they are tracking me.  I have never reported my sighting until now.  The person that saw the UFO with me is now dead but the last time I was with him we talked about it.

Weather was calm, clear, temperature very mild, moon- less sky &amp; dark except for lights of Taft and Bakersfield (30 miles away).  While sitting in front of our trailer enjoying the serenity of the Spring evening at approx. 10:30 pm, I noticed a white light approaching from the NW in the direction of Taft Airport.  The light was fairly un- spectacular in appearance, not nearly as bright as an aircraft landing light and rather indistinct. The light, however, kept my attention due to its very high speed and relatively low altitude of approx. 5,000 ft. Once the light was directly over the town of Taft it began to slow down considerably to what I would say was a normal lightplane cruising speed. At that moment, the object &quot;blinked&quot; on an enormous conical shaped beam of yellowish light straight down. The beam at its widest &amp; lowest point was at least five times the size of the object itself.  I grabbed a pair of 8x50 binoculars out of my flight box and observed the object and the beam for only a very few seconds. The object was a very hazy, indistinct ball of white light with no apparent anti-collision or navigation lights like an airplane.  The beam was very well defined against the night sky and did not reach the hill tops below it. As quickly as the beam &quot;blinked&quot; on it turned off and the object started to accelerate very rapidly as it resumed its southeasterly course paralleling the Diablo Range &amp; heading over the Tehachapis towards Los Angeles. My wife saw the object too, and remained fairly unimpressed by the spectacle, dismissing it as nothing more than an experimental military aircraft from Edwards AFB.  The craft followed the same course as the airliners that were flying high above it since this is on the main flight corridor between L.A. and the S.F. Bay Area following the Coast Range. The object was in sight approx. 15 seconds and made no sound even though it travelled at jet fighter-like speed.", "While observing Mars and Spica I observed a glowing white orb approaching from the South West. The object wa traveling faster than an orbiting sattelite. It then stopped and began to ascend until I could no longer see it.

I am also sure it was no meteorite.I would like to know if anyone else saw what I did.", "Appeared to be a formation of sorts at first; 1500-2500&apos; feet off the surface; 1/2-3/4 mile in length E-W, 1/4 mile wide N-S; over Lake Ponchatrain,LA;Driving from New Orleans I saw what I thought was a helicopter squadron flying in a rectangular formation (6 lights) over Lake Ponchatrain. I noticed this because it looked very uniform and clean (like precision flying). As I approached, driving from W to E, I rolled down my window to look closer at this very cool sight. As I approached the leading edge of the &apos;formation&apos;(a very clear night), I looked up and saw nothing but the point of light, as I continued driving, I remember how clear the stars were. As I past the last series of light on the Eastern edge, I remember thinking how odd that there was no sound, and that I couldnt see the &apos;helicopters&apos; just the lights. As I drove I looked back several times to see that it had not moved. It was perfectly suspended from beggining to end 1500-2500&apos; off the surface. A perfect rectangle 1/2 to 3/4 mile E-W long, 1/4 mile N-S wide. If you have ever driven the bridge from New Orleans East across the Lake to Slidell, the object started about just where ... if you look left you can see the train tressel, beyond that basically going E, and extended up to the area before you ascend the large hill of the bridge. Any way thats it...The odd thing, I didnt think about what had occured until I was into Mississippi, then I realized I saw something and that ... well I dont know what I saw. I wasn&apos;t scared ... But like an event where an innocent curiosity takes place you act natural, unsuspecting, non biased, moronic even. Then you talk about it the same way. It looked like a grid, a guide or a reference of some sort.... It was perfectly rectangle, very big, clear, and low!

It just so happens that it rained that day at home and the sun came out.  There was such a brilliant rainbow, I decided to take a picture of it.  I took four pictures of the rainbow. Two were both time-stamped 5:55 p.m.  However, in the first, there is this definite object and the second there is none.  It is somewhat fuzzy, but even so, it still looks like your &quot;standard&quot; UFO you see in films and on TV. I have Photshop on my computer and so I saved a copy on my hard drive and tried to isolate the image.  It is definitely something.  Upon isolating the area around the photo, I see beneath the object in the picture another object triangular in shape.  It appears as if the disc shaped object has what appear to be &quot;rays&quot; coming down and falling upon the triangular shaped object.  Very strange, especially since I did not see any of this when I took the photo and also because these objects do not appear in the photo that I took not more than ten seconds later.", "I was awaken by a humming sound, so I got up and walked to the window and saw two bright flying objects.I was awakened by a strange humming sound, strange, but constant.

The sky was a deep blue with a very few scattered white clouds. I noticed in the eastern part of the sky what appeared to be a white dot that was stationary. The white dot would disappear than re-appear but always stayed in the same spot. It was very high in the sky as an occasional cloud would pass in front of it. I looked at it through a pair of binuculars and the white dot seem to display a hint of a disk shape. Luckily, I had my telescope already set up in the garage as I planned to do some star gazing later that evening. I have been an amateur astromoner since I was 12 years old and am now 55 years of age. The scope I used was a 8&quot; Celestron with a 20mm wide angle lens. I couldn&apos;t believe what I was seeing. This was a disk shaped craft with a definite dome. It was hovering perfictly still but then would occasionally tilt straight up revealing it&apos;s dome. While it was tilted this way, you could see it with your naked eye as it displayed it&apos;s total top surfice area. It would keep this angle for about 5 seconds than tilt back down to its vertical position. At this angle it displayed very little of it&apos;s surface hence it would become invisible to the naked eye but was still visible through my telescope. I called my wife and told her to grab the binoculars and look. As the disk was back to it&apos;s horizonal position it could not be seen with the naked eye. She grabbed the binoculars and started scanning the area of the sky where the scope was pointing. Suddenly, the disk took off to the south so fast that it just gave a hint of a slight streak in the field of view of my telescope. That was the last I saw of it. My wife never did see it as she didn&apos;t have enough time to scan that part of the sky before it streaked off. End of Story.", "A Sphere or Cirle As bright as a star hover atleast 40-60,000 Ft.I was sitting on my parent&apos;s back porch watching a plane traveling North to South when I saw a bright light in the sky. At first I thought it was a star, but it was 19:00 hrs, with the sun well above the horizon.  It was too early to be seeing stars.  So I got a pair of field glasses and got a better look.  It was a bright circle with something dark brown or red on one side of the circle.  During the course of my observations I saw several commercial aircrafts travel at appox. 30-40,000 ft,  It appeared that this object was well above this altitude.  I was able to observe the object for approx. 1 hr.  Both my parents also witnessed the object.  It could have been a weather balloon,  I&apos;ve  never seen one before.  But my guess is you wouldn&apos;t be able to observe one for that long.  Nor would it be as large as I would think this object must have been.  My guess is 2-3 times larger than a airliner.  Eventually I saw it disappear like a light going out.  During the course of the 1hr. the object did travel some distance across the sky, no more that 3 fists from an extended arm.

Huge craft flew over. NO SOUND.  Thought it was a shooting star, went really fast then slowed down.  Weirdest thing.My husband wanted to see the planets lined up and it was the last night for looking, or the second to last night. He thought he saw a shooting star,but then the star slowed down and started coming our way.  Then we thought it was an airplane but it was&apos;nt making any noise.  It flew over our heads, it was bigger then the house when it went over.  no sound what so ever. He got scared because the next minute I&apos;m out there all by myself watching this thing leave.

It was a unusally dark night. We were about a mile from home. As I went by the river, something came over just above the trees. It was going very slow. I stopped the truck and got out for a better look.I left my truck running and could hear no other sound. I was only 150 to 200 feet away. Curious I walked toward the craft. As I did three illuminated triangles came from it and started my direction. Scared for my safety, I ran to the truck and raced home. I was busy driving. My wife said one of the triangles passed through a telephone pole. When we got home we checked the time to be sure none was lost. Two of our children were with us. We don&apos;t talk about it much. The craft must of been dark in color as I could&apos;nt make out a shape. It had nine large lights . Six were gold, with three red in the middle. They were very bright abd I stared at them. That could be why I could&apos;nt see a shape. The newspapers the next day reported mysterious lights in the sky.The triangles had squares around them with a circle in the middle.", "4 lights/hovering/moving radically about 1 general area; gaseous area resolves to chevron formation of jewel color lights/ move slowly over usExiting Monte Carlo Casino in Las Vegas on Sat. Apr 24 around 8:45 to 9:00 p.m., my wife and her brother called my attention to &quot;UFO&apos;s&quot; over the MGM (S.E.ly maybe 20 to 30 degrees from overhead). At first, I didn&apos;t see them and thought they were joking, but I then observed 20 or so people in front of me looking in the same direction and pointing. With the help of my brother-in-law, I was able to locate 4 round lights. (The size of each in relation to my hand at arm&apos;s length was roughly like looking at an eraser on the end of a pencil.) The sky was generally clear, but the four lights were in the area of one of the few clouds in the sky. The lights were all staying in the general area of the cloud, but would move into a gap in the cloud and sometimes out from behind the cloud completely. Even when behind the cloud, the lights were visible. The movement of the lights was very intriguing. Each would hover for a bit, then it might move in a sweeping manner upward. Sometimes one would streak horizontally and then would instantaneously reverse course or move at a radical angle. Each of the lights was moving independently of the others. This continued for several minutes. My wife then exclaimed, &quot;Look at that!&quot; and pointed just a little south of the cloud. I looked in time to see what I would call a gaseous light, greenish in hue, significantly larger than the round lights. It was like looking at an image through heat waves in the desert. I estimate it was three to four inches relative to my hand at arm&apos;s length. Within ten seconds or so the gaseous area resolved into more precise lights, jewel-like and muti-colored and the lights were in a formation that changed and within a few more seconds, appeared as a chevron shape, keeping the same overall size as the initial gaseous image. It then moved towards us, keeping a constant height and a smooth and steady course. I notice a round light, that looked like one of the first lights that we had observed, was flying just to my left of the chevron formation. Looking back into the cloud area at the first lights, I could now only find three of the round lights. They were still hovering and/or moving as before. The chevron/round light formation was continuing on its course and speed and slowly moved directly overhead and beyond until it was eventually obscurred by the Monte Carlo building. I strained to see if I could make out an object in the lights or hear any sound coming from the formation, but could not. Looking back to the area where the chevron first appeared, the &quot;gaseous image resolving to chevron&quot; event repeated. Again, the chevron was joined by a round light. I now could only see two round lights in the cloud area. The combo formation was, like the first, moving towards us. I looked from the sky to the area in which we were standing and noticed that there were now many more people watching the event. Most were exclaiming in amazement, myself included. When the first chevron appeared, I had heard many people shout as had my wife. There were a few cries of fear. It also looked like people on the other side of Las Vegas Boulevard in front of the MGM were also looking skyward and pointing. We crossed the street to the area in front of the New York, New York Casino. The second chevron had now disappeared from view over the Monte Carlo. I could now only see one of the original round lights. I pointed it out to a person coming out of the casino who said that he had seen this event before and that it was a bird, like a hawk, with ground lights reflecting off of it. He did not observe the chevron lights. A few other random observations: We observed the event for about fifteen minutes. I wanted to stay longer, but we had to leave to catch a flight at the airport. Early in the event, I noticed a small civilian aircraft in the general area, but it was lower and farther to the east. The event took place relatively close to the Las Vegas airport. Another friend that accompanied us never saw the round lights, but witnessed the chevrons. Although he is highly skeptical by nature, he had no explanation for what he saw. The MGM has large green lights that illuminate the building. The Luxor, farther south on the Strip, has a laser on top. I am not sure how high the clouds were and consequently have difficulty estimating the actual size or altitude of the formation. I have racked my brain trying to come up with an explanation for what we observed. I do not buy into the bird theory because of the relative speed in relation to the clouds, the radical flight patterns of the round lights, the visibility behind the clouds. Holographic images don&apos;t seen to fit either because of the great distance traveled by the chevrons. Also, at no time were the clouds themselves ever illuminated. We watched the paper for reports of the observation by others. My wife called the newspaper in Las Vegas. They said that they had not received any reports. They did not seem interested in her report. We recently learned of this site and decided to report our experience.", "4 lights in clear/clouds stopping/moving/hispeed @ sharp angles;lrg chevron/luminous objects form from gaseous bar/moves overheadOn April 24, 1999 @ 9:00pm, 4 of us walked out of the Monte Carlo Casino and saw a small group of people pointing at 4 lights in the southeast sky. These lights appeared to be interacting with each other, moving at high speeds, occasionally stopping and moving at extreme angles. The sky was fairly clear with some high clouds. These lights appeared to move behind and through the clouds on occasion. Within a few minutes, there were approx. 50 to 75 people witnessing the event. I could overhear several comments from the other people, and some were suggesting that perhaps they were high flying birds reflecting the lights from the strip. However, I thought that it was highly unlikely since the lights seemed to be very high and moving at extreme speeds. Approx. 5 minutes later, I began to see this long, thin vaporous line move across the sky in front of these 4 lights. It captured my interest because it appeared to move in a deliberate fashion. After observing this for several seconds, the gaseous line instantly materialized into 10 to 15 round, luminous objects that appeared to have all colors of the spectrum, and quite larger than the original 4 lights. They moved slowly high overhead in a chevron formation making no sound. One of the original 4 lights then joined with the objects as they continued high above. I had to bend my neck completely back; almost losing my balance to continue observing the phenomenon until it went over the Monte Carlo Casino and was obscured from my sight. Immediately, people began to shout with excitement. Some women were crying with fear, and some of the &quot;skeptics&quot; were stunned and annoyed that they could not explain it. I was absolutely blown away by what I saw. Perhaps, I could be persuaded to believe in some plausible explanation for the original 4 lights, but this phenomenon could not be explained away as birds, lasers, aircraft, satellites, or natural occurences, i.e., asteroids, meteorites, ball lightening or swamp gas. As we stood around in amazement, we continued to watch the remaining 3 lights in the sky. A minute or so later, I began to observe another vaporous line coming now from a point further south than the first, moving slowly, and instantly materializing again into 10 to 15 round, luminous objects moving in a chevron formation. Each time, it appeared that the objects were moving independently from each other but in formation. It did not appear to be one solid object. Unfortunately, approx. 15 minutes had gone by and the 4 of us had to get to the airport to make our flight back home to Seattle. The lights were still being observed as we walked away. The next day, I called the Las Vegas Journal to see if anything was reported. The Editor laughed and said there always was strange stuff going on in the sky and was not interested in getting my story. Background of Observers: 1.

Est. object length at 1 mile +.On about August 31, 1997 at about 10:30 p.m. I was traveling with my 8-yr. old daughter (Bridget) east on Xway from Brighton, MI toward Detroit (I-96).  Traffic was medium both ways.  We were east of the Brighton exit and about 5 miles west of the South Lyon exits on the map. There was a full bright yellowish moon but very high and heavy dense but thinner cloud cover.  There were occasional breaks in the clouds and stars were clear and bright there. Bridget said &quot;What&apos;s that light, Dad?&quot;  I had been concentrating on the road.  Straight ahead of us and appearing (feeling) to be above and slightly north of downtown Detroit was an object I first related to a giant &quot;harmonica&quot; tilted from 12:00 position to 4:00 position. It was visible through a large break in the clouds and was above the cloud layer.  I guestimate that the cloud layer was above 20,000 ft.  The &apos;feeling&apos; about the object was that it was &apos;enormous&apos; - surely a mile or more in length and 20% of that in thickness.  We did not see depth.  It appeared to be stationary. At this time I only recall two to four rows of rectangular windows.  Each window symetrically directly above the window below, each row about a window&apos;s depth apart.  About 20 to 30 windows per row.  What remains clearest is that each window was &apos;square&apos; and extremely brightly lit with a white light but no blurring, no outward beams from the light - very clearly defined. Also, although there was no illumination of the &apos;body&apos;, there was a definite rectangular shape of a body containing the windows.  My immediate first thought on noticing the object was of a &apos;harmonica&apos; with the lighted windows being the small square holes on the backside.  The object was tilted with the upward end being at 12:00 and the lower end to the right (south) at the 4:00 position on the clockface. We watched it for almost ten minutes as we continued on the expressway to the next exit which was for South Lyon.  Although traffic was steady but not heavy, I wanted to get off the X-way and away from the other car lights to observe the object.  The lower cloud cover obscured the object just before we reached the next (South Lyon) exit. I took this exit and traveled some six miles south, then another 3 miles east, mostly on dark country back roads hoping the cloud cover would open up again but it did not.  We did not see the object again. The lights were not &quot;On&quot; but rather &quot;from within&quot; the object. There was no trail and no haze.  No beams of light were emitted.  It did not change color.  We did not see any other objects exiting, entering or in the area of the object.  No other aircraft were seen in the area.

At first it appeared as a triangular formation of bright greenish lights, each emmiting a trai. The trees and lights below it were clearly visible, as if the craft was transparent or it was a formation of tiny craft flying together. It made no sound, and moved slowly down the valley, then rose, shrank into a single light, and shot away at incredible speed, vanishing in seconds.My mother, sister and her boyfriend saw it first, and called me. It was a triangular shaped cluster of lights, like an invisible delta winged aircraft with lights along the edges of its wings, nose and tail. The lights were bright, greenish and teardrop shaped, like flames. It moved very slowly down the valley below us, making no sound. As it moved away it gathered speed and shrank to a single light, then shot away at incredible speed. That same night, it was sighted in several other places over Mahe and the surrounding sea, each time described differently. Over the airport, witnesses described it as a disc shaped craft with lights all around it, the tracking station described it as a cylinder of lights, and it was seen out at sea as a sphere of lights hovering over the ocean. This was all reported in the local newspaper the following day, complete with illustrations. These sightings were made within minutes of each other, and all the witnesses agreed that it made no sound.", "breakdown of spaceI was on the bus heading to california. traveling through arizonia (I think). It might have been new mexico. I was passing by a solar power station and noticed two white clouds on top of what looked like an antenna tower. At first, I thought it was just gas being expelled. As I got closer I noticed that the clouds were&apos;nt moving as they would if it was gases being expelled. Then it seemed that the two little clouds were two dimensional. As the bus was mid-passed the solar plant, the mountains in background were lined up behind the clouds. Then things got stranger as I could see all the way to the mountains through the clouds. It was like they were far away and yet only a short ways away at the same time. This was very strange.

He told me to stand there and look up in the sky.  I thought he was pulling my leg because he was somewhat of a comedian.  I stood in the middle of the road and looked up at the sky.  Down came a huge craft from the low clouds.  It was covered in lights - large lights - like the kind you see on football fields.  I tried to make the shape out but because of the lights it was impossible to see what the shape of the craft was.  It made no sound and seemed to tilt.  It went back up into the clouds and disappeared.  That night on the radio it was announced that people had seen a meteor go from Vermont to Virginia.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "While driving on Rt. 6 off of Cape Cod I spotted two strange lights crossing the road in front of  my vehicle. They were pale orange points of light and moved in a strange scrambling kind of motion.

After a few moments I described what I saw to my friend who was a passenger.AS the lights moved across the road in front of the vehicle proceeding at 50MPH I watched them to see if they might be a reflection or something explainable but they continued from left to right and wound up at the curb to the right still making their random scrambling movement. I saw no object only the lights. They moved less than a foot off the ground. I wondered later if they may have been attached to some kind of animal but discounted that because of their motion and I would have seen an animal in the headlights.

We started looking at stars and we saw a little ship come out of a large one and one flew overhead and hovered while we got his mom and brother.My friend and I were walking to my house (he lives down the street) when we stopped to look at the moon.  My friend was at the time around 11 and I was 13.  We had been friends since he was in Kindergarten.  I was starting my fascination with outer space around that age. We started looking at stars and naming them, then he spotted one above and to the left of the north star that was somewhat bright (but very far away like a plane would be).  This &quot;star&quot; was keeping it&apos;s possition in the sky, but what was weird about it was that another star with a much lower magnitude seemed to come out of the larger one and travel about 4 degrees across the sky and stay there for about 5 minutes.  After that, it simply went back to where it came from.  I never considered that part of the sighting because it was too far away to tell what it really was.  What I consider the sighting is explained below. After seeing the strange star-like pinpoints across the sky, we began looking for more to see if it was an isolated phenomena.  We continued to walk and look when strait down the road between the rows of suburban houses and over the top of the circle&apos;s trees (the circle being at the end of the short road we live on) was a very bright light, my guess being with about -5 or -6 was just sitting there.  At first it didn&apos;t click in my head because there&apos;s usually red lights in that part of the sky anyway because of power lines in the field.  Then I realized the light wasn&apos;t red, it was a white light.  We were now halfway down the road, standing in awe at the 3-way intersection and stared at the light.  I looked to my friend and asked him what he thought it was, and when I looked back I saw that it doubled in size.  It was coming at us, straight down the road.  We thought it was a helicopter, so we ran back to his house like we were fugitives (we always pretended like that).  When we got to his driveway, it was almost directly overhead and still no sound was coming from it.  I took charge and told him to get his mom (I knew without an older witness that no one would believe us).  He ran inside yelling and his little brother came running out, followed by my friend and his mom.  Now the diamond-shaped craft was directly overhead and hovering like a copter. The rest of the description gets blurry now, I believe there were 4 lights on bottom, the 2 sides being white or dull yellow, the front and back being red. As far as I can remember, it was only there for us to regret not having a camera, then it tilted up at about a 30-35 degree angle and zipped away above his house pretty quickly. The only way I remember this many details about it is because I immediatley wrote it all down in my journal when I got home because I didn&apos;t want to take the chance of forgetting it, or having warped memories about it later.", "i was riding in the car and i looked out the window and saw some strange lights in the sky. i thought it was just and air plane but the light pattern kept changing. i wathced it for a few minutes and then it dissapeared. when i got to my sisters apartment i saw it agian. it was only there for about a minute then it dissapeared again.It was 3 lights in a triangle and kept blinking in a random pattern. while i was wathcing it in the car it seemed to be following me.(i wasnt driving) i didnt want to scare the driver so i kept to my self. when i saw it form the apartment it just hung there and dissapeared.", "Hovering above a hill, then it went behind the hill and went straight up into the sky.((NUFORC Note:  Description applies to a fireball seen by the witness.))", "((NUFORC:  The witness who submitted this report identifies himself as an amateur astronomer, serious enough in that pursuit, for example, to possess computer software that allows one to identify visible satellites.

Peter))At 2:00am I observred what I thought was a single satelite moving north to south.Soon I noticed a multitude of these objects following the first and counted 74 of these objects on the same trajectory within the span of 53 minutes.At 2:10 am Sunday morning May  23rd,I observed what appeared to be a satelite traveling from north to south.It seemed brighter than most I had seen and made note of that to myself.Soon afterwards,I noticed three more of these same lights following the same path.Wow,I thought,looks like the space program got the funding they were after.At this point I scanned a 45 degree arc in the sky from due north to the northeast.I noticed a multitude of these objects within this frame of view.It struck me as very strange at this point and I decided to count the objects just to see if I might be able to explain what I was seeing to a meteorologist or scientist so I could know what the hell I saw.Then ,some of the objects started coming in distinct patterns.Some were triangles,others were following in a straight line. I started to get freaked out because I knew that satelites did not behave in this fashion.I looked to my right (toward the NE) and saw one object that was going from northeast to southwest.It suddenly shifted from that to a straight north-south direction.OK what the hell is going on here!?Some of the lights were very bright and had a bluish tint,others were more dim with a yellowish tint.they all apeeared to move at the same speed though I did see one that sped up and then slowed down.The sky conditions were partly cloudy there were no airplanes in the vicinity.It is interesting to note that they were moving the airport to a new location that morning to Austin Bergstrom International Airport.The airport is south east of me.The new one is even further southeast.At the old airport the planes would fly directly over my apartment at about 500-600 ft.As far as the planes they moved form the old airport to the new,they were flying about 20 of them and would not have gone over my building because the new airport is in the opposite direction.Which leads me to my final observation:I counted 74 fast moving objects  at high altitude for a total of 53 minutes.Does&apos;nt seem conducive to what was going on during the move of the airports.My neck was starting to hurt after awhile and since I did&apos;nt hear any explosions I assumed that we were not under attack and went nervously to bed.", "bluit lights going west to southsuddenly i see a silverwhite lights slip north to south very fast and light is dissappered", "Mohd Fahmi, a Malaysian boy wakes up hearing sound of zinc roof being blown by strong winds.

MOHD FAHMI ABU HASSAN, aged 17, said that the object emitted intense blue light so much so he could not make out the object clearly. He then saw a being about 0.5 meters in height alighting from air. &quot;At that time the light emitted by the object increased and it was difficult to see the creature.&quot; said he here today. UTUSAN (the newspaper)upon searching around the house found seven paw prints about half a centimeter deep. The paw track had four fingers and had sharp claws based on the grip clearly seen from the prints on earth. the student also claimed, UFO was detected first around 4.30 am when he woke up from sleep. MOHD FAHMI said, he woke up upon hearing the zinc roof of his house made loud noise as though being blown by strong winds. &quot;I woke up and found that the wind was blowing as though about rain&quot;, he said.

It then descended to about 400 feet above the ground next to the left hand side of my truck.  The first object then stopped where it then nosed-up to a 45 degree angle and then proceded to descend backwards.

I was on my way to the local stripmall to get an early lunch.  Being into UFOlogy myself, I tend to watch the sky...this was my first sighting. This was last Saturday...and I glanced up at the western sky, and I observed an object traveling towards me (east) at about 8000 feet.  The object was moving at a rapid pace, much like a jet. I assumed, at first, that it was a jet..but I noticed that I could observe no &quot;hard&quot; outline...it did not look like a jet.  It had my attention. The object was on a straight track with my position...and as it continued towards my position, at the very moment the object was directly over me...its STOPPED...and it did not travel in any direction for 20 minutes. Well, needless to say, when the object stopped over me...a VERY sudden deceleration..it definatly had my attention. There was no noise from this object. I could not make out the shape of the object for sure, but it was obviously metallic due to the reflection.  Suddenly the object appeared to change it&apos;s shape slightly..almost like it &quot;split in two&quot;....and the object started to ROTATE Counter-Clockwise!! I continued to watch this object, directly overhead, for a full 7 minutes...and quite frankly Peter, I got bored and went to get my lunch..I was inside for about 5 minutes and when I came out, the object was still there...only now it appeard to have split into 4 &quot;lobes&quot;...still rotating. So I continued to watch it...and after about 5 minutes the object did the most astounding thing.  It suddenly moved in a rapid &quot;figure 8&quot; pattern, but did NOT travel in any direction, per se...it was still quite stationary, other than this manuver and it&apos;s rotation. It was at that point that I knew this had to be a real &quot;hypertechnology vehicle&quot; (ufo) and it was also at this point that I tried to get the attention of the people around me, to look at this. NOW THIS IS THE ODDEST PART OF ALL....I COULD NOT GET ANYONE TO LOOK AT THIS OBJECT!  THIS WAS A CROWDED STRIPMALL, AND YET I COULD NOT GET ANYONE TO EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I WAS EVEN THERE!  NOT ONE SINGLE PERSON EVEN GLANCED IN MY DIRECTION, IT WAS JUST LIKE I WAS NOT EVEN THERE.  THEY HAD TO HEAR ME, I WAS SOMEWHAT FRANTIC, TRYING TO GET THEM TO LOOK AT THIS OBJECT, BUT I SWEAR PETER...IT WAS LIKE I WAS NOT THERE, AND THEY DID NOT REACT AT ALL TO MY WORDS. This really started to bother me...and the object continued to rotate, in place. I stood there for several more minutes. Well, at this point I went back to my office to call a friend of mine who lives a few miles down the road, to see if he could see this object..but he could not. I went back outside to see if it was still there, but it was gone, nowhere to be seen. I did not have a camera at the time...much to my disgrace. I hearby swear that the above events are true and accurate, and I KNOW this was not an ordinary object...it was not a bunch of balloons, such things could not travel that fast and suddenly stop and hover in place..for 20 minutes, it&apos;s impossible. But I have to say peter...the fact that I could not get ANYONES attention really scared me, and I wondered if there was some sort of &quot;mind control&quot; taking place here. --END.", "I saw the ship zooming thriugh the air back and forth.

It was, guessing for distance and altitude, about fifty feet in diameter, spherical, silver, and NOT a weather balloon.

Not very exciting, just odd. However, in 1970 in Eau Claire, WI, My sister and a friend were walking to my parents house from her friends house. The walk, at a leisurely pace, takes about twenty minutes. My sister noticed a large brightly lit saucer in the sky, as did her friend. They observed it for a couple minutes, then got scared and hurried home, running most of the way. Upon arriving home, my sister was grounded for being 2 1/2 hours late. She said that she couldn&apos;t be late, she ran home and it only took her about ten minutes. My mother didn&apos;t believe her, so the grounding stuck. For the following 15 years, my sister was afflicted with stange buzzing sounds in her head. She also remembers that when they started to run, the saucer was no longer there. Deputy Sherrifs in Eau Claire County obsreved a similar object over a hill near my parents about a month prior to that, but that one was a couple hundred yards in diameter. It scorched the tops of the trees on the hill, which was observable for about ten years after.

The lights were not attached to an object, they were 12-20 seperate units. We watched them fly at about the same height as the 8th deck we were on. The formation suddenly stopped and reversed it&apos;s direction. We at first thought that it might have been birds until it did that. The formation then flew towards the ship and then amazingly seperated into individual balls of light and then vanished.

Could not see shape because of high fog.  Live in canyon and have observed every typ of craft from ultra lights to KC-130s and to compare, this was much larger. There seemed to be lights above the fog but I can&apos;t be sure.At approximately 20:30 hours I heard a very loud noise ( actually felt the vibration before I heard it) I went out on our elevated deck that runs around the 2nd story of our house.  I could not actually see the object but could tell it was very large and moving slow for an aircraft. Our house is at about 850&apos; elevation in the low foothills of the Sierra Navada mountains and the high fog was at about 1000&apos; feet.  The object was above or in the fog layer.  What is strange was the sound of the (enginges?) It was more like a vibrating pulse that vibrated everything in the house. I have observed numerous aircraft over the house, some quite close fighting fires where they were dumping water on the house and diving on fires near my fense line.

At my point of observation I was faceing SW and the object passed about 1/2 to 3/4 mile in front of me (SW) traveling from NW to SE. As I said I could not actually see it but only scence lights and tell the sound was moving and the area seemed to equal about 8-10 full moon diameters long and maybe 3 full moon diameters wide at the center.

I don&apos;t know that this qualifies as a UFO but I am hoping maybe someone else saw or heard this also and can give a hint at what is was.

On this night she called me outside to look at what she thought was a peculiar star in the sky. I came outside, looked at it and told her that it was ice crystals far up in the atmosphere causing the effect. I went back inside and within three minutes she had called me back out again. This time the star had moved !! I made sure to look at it from the same location both times so as not to distort my perception of what I was seeing. From our point of view the star/object moved from being over the top of a tree to its side in just a matter of 3 to 4 minutes. I stood and looked at the object for close to 10 minutes. I just to stay in one spot when my wife and I noticed that it was moving out of our line of sight behind the tree. I told her her to keep and eye on it while I got the car keys. We both got into my convertable and headed of in the direction of the object. My wife noticed that as soon as we got into the car the object shot of at great speed to the west. We drove down Hwy. 40 heading towards Folkston looking for the object in the sky. We were halfway between Kingsland and Folkston when I said to my wife that I saw a red light to our left in a clearing as we drove. She saw it but our view was obstructed by a group of trees as we drove more. Within just few seconds my wife and I saw the same red light on the opposite side of the road still above the tree line. My wife started to get scared so I turned around and went back home. It was only upon us discussing the matter when we back home that she told me that she remembered seeing the shape of the object for a brief moment. She said that it did not really occur to her how big the object appeared because she had quick view of it as we were driving. She said that it looked like a pyramid shape. At this point this when I knew we had a bonified sighting. The next night an even more spookier event happened to us. This time we purposely set out see if we could ge! t closer without (detection).(I don&apos;t how or why, but my wife and I knew somehow that the craft could sense our attention of it) The second night when we saw that the same star like object was in the same position as the night before we jumped into the car and drove off down Hwy. 40 again. This time we went as far as Folkston and started driving up Hwy 82 towards Tifton. We could not really tell if anymore if the starlike object we had seen was still there so after driving on 82 for 10 miles I started to turn around go back home. As soon as I slowed and turn my blinker on to make a U turn a bright light popped on in the sky above the tree line and to our right. I kept going forward to see it more. As we got closer I could see that the object was passing over the trees directly to our right. The thing that really capped this night for me and my wife was that there were two to three other cars ahead of us stopped on the side of the road with some of the people out of there cars looking at the light as it went by. I raced back in the direction of the light heading towards home. We both lost site of it. On the way back home we got a little lost on one of the back roads but eventually made it back home. We stood in our driveway now at home looking still up into the sky. Before we went in we saw a craft come directly over our neighborhood that made NO SOUND what so ever. Not even wind noise. At the level it was we both said that we should have heard something. The next morning I got up early right as the sky  begining to blue. I looked out of our bay window and saw that up in the morning sky at about 75 degrees was a brilliant object just hanging in mid air to the south west sky. I looked on for about 6 to 7 minutes and then just dismissed it as a star I got dressed for work and came back out to Our bay window for another look. It was gone!

After the prom my date and i decided to go back to my house so i could get my tux off, and prepare for the rest of the night. The road back into town is wooded, comming up the road i noticed a light up in the sky, I knew something was odd about this light but it didnt click until my date said something to me, she was not from the area and asked me what the light in the sky was. I first of all would have misplaced it as a plain right off the bat, but it was idle and had no lights that indicated it could be a plain, so i said &quot; you know what i dont know what it is&quot; so at that point we just watched it until we got closer and closer. I was really in sort of an amazement when we finally got to my highschool parking lot and this object was still hovering up in the sky pretty much over my school. Of course we were the only two people there. My date and i got out, neither one of us saying anything, I looked up as intently as i could and observered this; A white glowing ovalish ball, with other off white colors on towards the bottom of the ufo. After about 20 seconds of starring in disbelief the object shrunk right before our eyes to a pinPoint and was gone...just like that.

When the clock read 11:59 I was getting ready for the 10 second countdown when I heard a sound like a computer starting up except it was much louder. I looked up and saw 6 tear droped objects shaped like a triangle the lead one was the biggest it was a red glowing color. The other five were smaller and were a yellow glowing color. They were flying to the south-east.They started circling in the air on top of me. I told my friend and they looked and asked what is that? When my friends started the ten second countdown I looked away. When I looked up the shapes were gone. I work at a plane muesem thirty minutes away from my house. I have never seen anything like those things before. I was wondering if anyone else has ever seen anything like that before.", "The night before the comet, at first that&apos;s what I thought it was. It originally appeared as a &quot;ball of fire&quot; in the sky. Then two more showed up. I went in to get my camera (unfortunately a cheap one), and when I got back outside, they started moving around and changing both color and it appeared that they changed shape. I am ex-military, Aviation, these were NOT planes, choppers, or balloons of any kind. They moved in ways and at speeds that our (as in made on this planet) aircraft are simply not capable of doing. The next night my husband to a picture of what looks like the moon, except it was BEHIND him! The pictures are being sent with this report.They appeared as (in the following order) a very large ball of fire, a bright light not unlike a very bright star, then as dark gray. They moved at incredible speeds in several different directions, then would come to a complete halt instantly. The one my husband got a picture of changed colors from white to yellow to blue to red and back to white ...... then it disappeared.", "Noticed two illuminated objects high in the South East part of the sky, one was stationary the other moved towards it and positioned itself below the other, and in about 10 minutes later disappeared in a blue flash, the other remained alone disappeard in a flash and reappeared in a different part of the sky, this happened twice then finally disappeared, it has not been back since.We were standing out in my yard on SUN. 9-28-98 approximately 4:00 on a bright sunny day. We noticed a bright white light moving South fairly fast and high in the atmosphere, towards another white light that was above the other. I called my husband and since we both work for an aerospace company in the area we could tell it was not any type of an aircraft, to be that high, bright and stop so suddenly. The three of us (mother, husband and myself) stood and watched it for about 5 minutes and my mother had to leave, then about 5 minutes later the lower light omitted a blue flash and disappeared in an instant, the other one stayed, and about 10 minutes later it disappeared, but this time i didn&apos;t notice the blue flash and reappeared in a different part of the sky, i watched it for another 15 minutes or so and it seemed to disappear into a cloud staying with the cloud as if to move with it, hiding. About 10-15 more minutes it appeared again in a different part of the sky lower this time, and i could see it very well, no clouds, finally it disappeared as if to fade away.", "I saw two oval shaped U.F.O.&apos;s flying from one side of sky to the other.And then dissapeared.", "See below for more on shape and number of craftWhile playing acoustic music at a city park, two of us in a circle of five were facing South-East when a brilliant light streamed across the sky in a Southwesterly direction.  We&apos;ve had air shows at our local airport and at first I didn&apos;t think it was anything we couldn&apos;t come up with.  It was too bright to distinguish a form but the light remained oblong then suddenly it split, that is, a section of it shot forth. I later came home and heard a caller on Art Bell describe this except that what I saw was MUCH brighter than Venus.", "2 fireballs chasing each other, one runs into another, hear a soft explosion, and it vanishes.I get ready to log-off my computer, when I look out my window, and see 2 faint fireball-shaped craft chasing eachother.

I noticed several commercial airliners in the sky. In front of one there was a star-like object.I&apos;m 30 years old. I just stepped out the front door of my house and looked up to notice a blue sky. The sun hadn&apos;t set completely yet and the stars had not come out. I also noticed that there were several commercial airliners in the sky with trails. All of sudden, I noticed what looked like a star in front of an airliner. This however was not a star. It moved just as fast as the airliner. It did not have a trail and it was so high it did not make a sound. At first I thought it might be nothing, but then it started to move faster. It increased in speed then vanished. Just faded. That was it.", "Two bright amber lights seen over PhoenixAt approximately 8:50 PM, I was looking south-south west from my front yard in North Scottsdale and saw what appeared at first to be distant commercial aircraft landing lights climbing out of Phoenix Sky Harbor. As I continued to watch I noticed that the lights did not move and they also were a distinctly different color than landing lights. I got my binoculars and the lights can only be described as a two separate very bright but deep amber in color with one light slightly lower than the other.  There appeared to be no connecting structure between the lights and no other lights associated with the object(s). I initially estimated the distance at about 10 miles (incorrectly). The sky was clear with many stars visible.  Visibility in the Phoenix area is nearly unlimited and lighted objects could easily be seen at night 100 miles on the low horizon. My wife, and daughter also watched the lights as they remained perfectly motionless. Suddenly, one light dimmed and turned off, then perhaps two seconds later the other turned off. Then a moment later both lights came on again in exactly the same location.  My daughter and I decided to get in the car and investigate at this point. We drove in the direction of the lights all the way into Phoenix, approximately 25 miles south while observing the objects on and off.  The separation between the lights widened as we got closer.  During the drive the lights turned on and off at least two times.  Finally, upon rounding the big bend going southbound at the top of the Squaw Peak highway the lights were clearly visible and obviously much closer. My best estimate of their physical location was approximately 3/4-1 mile west of the South mountain antenna farm, and at an altitude of perhaps 3-4000 feet above ground level. At this point the lights were approximately two and a half fingar widths apart at arms length and still at the same inclination angle but higher above the horizon. They appeared to be literally glued in place...no movement whatsoever. All of this was occuring in Phoenix Sky Harbor&apos;s very busy Class B controlled airspace!! Certainly the tower operators could have had a clear view of these objects to the southwest as they were only about 3 miles away.  At this time the objects were at an approximate 35 degree angle above the horizon. I am an aerospace engineer and private pilot. I roughly estimate the distance between the lights to be 500 feet gauging from the rate of change of spacing and elevation above ground over the distance. Upon reaching the turnoff to Sky Harbor airport the lights turned off and did not return. At home the lights were perhaps 5-10 degrees above the horizon. Our home north of Phoenix is actually 1000 feet higher in field elevation than central Phoenix, plus we had a clear an unobstructed view initially. The following morning I listened on the radio for any reports of the objects, but unbelievably there were no reports!  People see so much in the air that even if something is unusual it is simply shrugged off.  I would like to know if anyone else has seen these objects. They were visible for over an hour. I know these were not an aircraft lighting system, and they were too stationary to be an aircraft or airship.", "From a distance, the object looked to be a true ufo. The lights seemed to circle the craft. When it came closer we seen three lights, one red and two white. As the craft went over our heads. We seen it was light grey and made a unique humming sound. Unlike anything I&apos;ve ever heard before. The craft was diamond shaped,and traveled southwest a few miles. Turned quick and sharply moving south.", "light seen in sky like planeobject bright as Venus travelling as an airplane would.

Object abruptly stopped over south end of speedway at approx 20-30,000 ft altitude and hovered for about 1 minute in an oscillating wobbling motion. It was almost as if whoever was in the craft stopped to see what was going on at this big event. Brought this to attention to friends sitting next to me and they saw it and could not explain it. Saw object through binaculars but still could not see any markings or features. Motion of this sort, the abrubt stop after streaking in from the west, would undoubtably kill a human being because of the abrupt force of the stop. After about a one minute hover, object streaked back to the west at just as fast as it came in and to the same direction it came and vanished.

Dark, floating, soundless UFO floats across sky.At 3AM, about 4 yrs ago, when I was 21, I was delivering papers in Lake Forest, Illinois.  I was 1 block north of Fort Sheridan.  The sky was dimly illuminated by surrounding streetlights, etc...  I looked up, and over treetops a dark, lightless, soundless, UFO floated.  It was so low I probably could of hit it with a rock, easily.  I was excited, and decided to follow it.  I noticed it wasn&apos;t the shape of flying craft normally seen.  It was a solid shape, like rectangle, triangle, square, but I was more excited to follow it, so I didn&apos;t focus on exact shape.  It wasn&apos;t enormous, but not real small neither.  I did notice it seemed to have bumps and ridges on the bottom.  I have a sunroof, so when it flew over my car I could see it.  I chased it, but soon gave up because I couldn&apos;t maneuver the small suburban roads well enough to follow it&apos;s flight path.  It floated in a straight path, not seeming to gain altitude (very low).  It floated slowly.  I lost it in the darkness.  My assumption was it either flew directly over Fort Sheridan, or it took off from Fort Sheridan.  (Fort Sheridan, as to my knowledge, is a closed military base).((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Object appeared as a stationary bright strobing light alternating/flashing white/blue/red. Object observed for approx 20 min. Object did not move throughout observation. Sky conditions were clear. Stars in field of view did not exhibit similiar strobing, and lights appeared brighter than usual ICAO marker lights of aircraft. Oject size appeared to be slightly larger than the surrounding star field and distant. 1 witness of this event; observer thought object was curious but attributed it to atmospheric phenonema or plane. As observer returned to inside of residence for the evening approx. 2125L object was still visible above tree/horizon line. Observer not mention sighting until Sunday May 16, 1999. (2) second/additional sighting at 2315L in NNW sky approximately 15 deg. above horizon from same observation point, a residence in Perry Township. Object was a stationary bright strobing light rapidly flashing white/red/blue. Object remained staionary throughout observation. Sky conditions were clear, and stars in visible field of view did not exhibit similiar strobing effect. Object was much brighter than nearby stars in field of view.  Strobing was brighter/faster than usual ICAO marker lights. 2 Witnesses to this event. Object was observed for app. 30 minutes and remained stationary for entire period. During this observation object was observed through  8 X 40 power binoculars, and the strobing appeared to be a circular, primarily bright white with the blue and red flashes in rotation around the white light. The white light was almost glaring and the object appeared to have a clearly defined/sharp profile, like the light from a lazer pen rather than a flashlight, for example. Observers thought light was curious but attributed to perhaps a blimp or atmospheric phenomena. Observers viewed object until 2345 then returned to residence. One of these observers returned to check again at 0100 and light was gone. There is a regional airfield to the NE of the observation point approx. 5 miles away, and this airfield hosts reserve helicopters. But the object light(s) were unmoving and appeared distant in both the 2105L and 2315L observations, and no rotor blade noise was heard. In fact, no sound was heard at all during either sighting. All observers are long-time residants of area and familiar with air traffic patterns around and over house. Observer of 2105L sighting professional with BS degree currently completing Masters, observers of 2315L sighting (1) degreed ex Air Force Intelligence veteran (2) college bound HS student. Observers discovered mutual sighting event during conversation on morning of May 16th. Observers are familiar with pattern of star motion over residence, and considered if the two sighting were of the same object it was unlikely to be a star or plant, as the object would have had to move south to north. If the observations were of different objects the observers found it curious that other stars/planets in field of view did not exhibit similar strobing effect. And if object was an aircraft then itwas stationary/hovered, and the ICAO markers were about twice the magnitude of those normally observed from passing aircraft. We have had blimps in past years, but the observed strobing was dissimilar to the advertising lights normally seen from them in the past. Of particular curiousity was the fact the the object was completely stationary during observations, and did not exhibit movement as the star field moved. Observers are curious as to what they may have observed; skeptical about supernatural explanation but thought sighting worthwhile for investigation. Will speak with an investigator but have no interest or desire to have observers names/occupations/etc publicized in any way.", "Watched star like object on the horizan go up in an arch and then approach me and fly close enough so I could see the pilot.As a police officer at the time I was on a stake out when I observed a brilliant star on the far horizan. I took my eyes off the star and resumed surveilance of a parking lot. A few minutes later I went back to the star only to find it high in the sky. I then observed it decend in a slight arch back to its original location. I called another officer to my location and he and I sat there and watched as the object got closer and actually came close enough so that we could see the pilot in the cockpit and the instrument lights reflecting off of his helment and visor.The craft had a huge light on the front (about 20 ft. in diameter) but, there was no light emitted from it. I would describe it as more (DIAMOND LIKE) and that is what we mistook for a bright twinkling star. The Pilot was deffinatly humanoid and when he observed us observing him, he put the craft in hyperspeed and left the area in an instant without any sound at all.  I was never allowed to submitt an official report on the incedent and a check of the locall airport indecated nothing on radar at that time.", "Witnessed a fireball in the western sky above the Owyhee Mountains just before sunset.I was approximately five years old at the time.  I was playing with my neighbor on my front porch.  I noticed the fireball in the sky in the western horizon.  The sun was just out of view under the crest of the mountain range.  What is strange about the fireball is that it seemed to hypnotize me.  All I remember is just staring at it.  It did not appear to move vertically or horizontally.  It did not get closer or farther away. After a period of time it just was gone.  I did not know what a UFO was at the time.  I never told anyone other than my family, nor did I ever talk to my neighbor about it. I don&apos;t even know if my neighbor saw it, although he was with me.  I don&apos;t recall talking to him about it at the time it occured, either. Although I have been fortunate enough to see &quot;unidentified flying objects&quot; since, I have not seen anything resembling the fireball on that summer evening, nor have I seen anything as significant. I would like to know if any one else has seen anything like this.  The experience was sublime.  Even as a child, I sensed something sacred; perhaps that is the irony of my curiosity after all this time.  If anyone is interested in sharing info, feel free to email me.  I have other information to share. Thank you.", "While videotaping a craft hovering silently over Saratoga Lake, a second unlit craft shot up from the lake,lit up and hovered.At Riley Cove on the western shore of Saratoga Lake I saw a silent craft hovering over Saratoga Lake.It was emitting a steady, brilliant, warm light, far brighter than an airplane or helicopter.I&apos;d say its altitude was less than 200 feet, and it was about half a mile out over the lake, definitely close enough to hear an aircraft engine, but the craft was completely silent. I stopped my car and started my videocamera,and filmed it hovering there. I zoomed in as tight as I could, then panned back, and as after I did, I saw a black streak shoot up out of the lake, there was just enough twilight left to see it against the sky. It shot up like a bullet. It happened in an instant, but I remember thinking that someone must be shooting something at this craft. But as it reached the altitude of the first craft it began to light up, and suddenly it was a second brilliantly lit craft hovering in the sky, about one hundred yards to the right of the first craft and a little bit higher. I was really shocked, it happened so quickly, I&apos;ve never seen anything move like that, in less than one second it went from the water to hovering in a fixed position in the sky. I kept the camera fixed on the two craft as I undid my seatbelt and got out of the car,and they hovered there for several more minutes. Then the first craft seemed to change, it turned into what appeared to be a flat triangle, which began to pulse and fly slowly past the second object, then slowly looped back around again, remaining nearby the second craft. Conventional airplanes began approaching the second craft, also flying closeby to it.                                       The second craft (the one that shot up into the sky) remained hovering for several more minutes, at times motionless, then drifting slowly slowly one way, then heading back in the other direction towards the southern end of the lake. It started to move more quickly,heading across my field of visio! n so I was seeing the side of the craft. If it were an airplane or helicopter I&apos;d have seen the tail lights, strobing lights, or individual lights, but this craft remained a single, large, solid warm light. The southern end of Saratoga Lake is ringed by a heavily wooded hillside, and the craft was travelling just at the hill&apos;s treeline in a bobbing up-and-down sort of motion, dipping below the treeline, then floating back up from behind the hill&apos;s dark pine trees, eventually going down like a setting sun behind the trees.       I do have this incident on videotape.", "On a spring night in 1997 I was sitting in a car at a park with a friend talking.  I would periodically look out my window for no reason in particular.  At one point looking out the window I saw a bright white sphere definately in our atmosphere.  This white sphere was motionless and far larger than any star.  Not shocked at this point I told my friend to take a look. He acknowledged it.  A moment later the object began to move slowly for ten seconds then rapidly southwest-soon out of sight.  We kept looking in the sky after that and a few moments later it all happend again.  Seemingly the same craft. And upon recognizing it, it did exactly what I previously described.  But this time, possible coincidence, a jet flew toward the S.W. as did the UFO.  We talked to each other for a moment and looked back at the sky.  We saw what I would decribe as a &quot;simon says&quot; game in the sky(blue yellow red green lights) This was certainly a craft and much larger than the spheres.  I started opening my door for a good look, as I did my friend screamed &quot;Oh my god!&quot;and pointed at door.  My door slammed shut on me and there were two Schnauzers(dogs) growling scratching on the door.as if preventing me to leave(it worked!)  I noticed three more of the SAME dogs over to the left.  Two sitting still, one running back and forth histarically in front of the &quot;sitters&quot;. the sitting dogs were looking at our car! There were NO owners around we did not see the dogs before the crafts, and I&apos;ve never seen so many dogs of same breed together unattended in my life! I believe I have had a &quot;screen memory&quot; as described in Whitley Striebers book Communion. Needless to say we started the car and got out of that park right away. The park was next to a highway and residentials, so it would be unbelievable if I had no second witness, but I did. I swear I saw all that I have written here.  All of this experience I will never forget, espescially the &quot;dogs&quot;The first two objects, possibly the same craft were bright white spheres.  The third was circular with four lights.  each light took approx. a quarter of the bottom of craft.  the lights were 1 red, 1green, 1blue, 1yellow.  I also saw five dogs that looked exatly the same. The first two spheres were motionless, then after being witnessed for a moment they took off until out of sight.  The &quot;simon says&quot; game did the same.  Two dogs pounded on my car door, two sat quietly in the distance, one ran back and forth like doing windsprints for football warmups.

This helicopter had placed itself over some treetops near the intersection where I turn to get onto my block. As I neared it, I noticed it seemed to not be a helicopter at all, as it had three lights equally spaced around a less brightly lit center with a small row of red lights flashing one after the other from outside to the inside of the bottom surface. As I turned to go to my house, it slid silently over my truck(which freaked me badly, because by this time the realization was just setting in that this was no helicopter). I nearly missed my turn into my driveway, had to reverse, to turn in (a three point turn gone horribly wrong), and as I got out and looked up, I found that it had vanished.", "Saw three objects which flashed red, blue and white lights.

Brightness was about twice that of jupiter.  The sky was clear.  I thought it was a meteor, but there was no trail and it moved about half the speed of the hundreds of meteors I have seen, but much too fast to be an airplane and made NO SOUND.

Over the years there has been return visits by more than one type of being.  One did not want for there activitys known by the other. At 10 years of age I was made to forget.  When my son was 5 years later they returned and wanted to know about any activities with other aliens. They imployed mind control on both myself and my son, both of us broke from there control just before leaving the house with them, I was unable to move, but was able to tell my son to fight them, he kicked and punched two of the aliens near him.  When hit they did not respond in any way?  They seemed like puppets being controlled remotely, arms and legs of at least 6 (small greys) aliens move together (in sync).  When hit they went blank (stopped moving). At this point I no longer felt fear, and they again had control of me. My son also remembers this encounter, only about 2 or 3 minutes.  After that I only broke out 2 other times for very short periods of time.  One: as they took me into there craft (a joke looked shabby). two: laying down inside being interrogated. When 10 years old on the day I was told I would forget, I wrote what I knew down on paper, put it in jar, buried it behind our home and started a fire on top of it.  Then I went a got the cattle for my dad too milk.  This is were they said I would think of them for the last time.  Coming back I was surprised by men in the woods putting out the fire that I started.  At first I couldn&apos;t even remember that I set the fire.

I was the only one to see the trail, though my dad saw the flash.My dad, uncle (both MUFON members) and I were stargazing the night of 22 May.  We were roughly 4 miles east of Greenwater, Washington on what on the maps is called Huckleberry Mountain, at about 3500 feet. From this vantage point we could see from due east (over some mtns. covering lower 20 deg. of sky) to the NW.  The three of us were regularly looking in different directions.  At 23:15, I was looking to the ESE roughly 45 deg. up, when just below this a very bright meteor- like streak quickly shot nearly straight down (to horizon).  I&apos;m not sure if I saw it from start to finish, but it seemed to only begin 10-20 deg. above the horizon to begin with.  What made this event worth mentioning was the immediate &apos;explosion&apos; after I lost sight of the streak behind a ridge.  I say explosion because it really lit up that part of the sky, enough so that my dad, who was looking in another direction, noticed it as well. Unfortunately my uncle was looking behind us, and did not see any of this.  To me it seemed that this explosion was a double flash, although this did occur in less than a second.  This immediately got all of our attention, and we were silent for a period afterwards in case we could hear a sound from the event, but we never heard anything. After discussing it, we decided that this event was most likely a meteor which either burnt up just before hitting the ground, or perhaps a meteorite which landed in or beyond the Cascades.  The only caveat to this explanation was that I have seen many meteors, though no &apos;bolides&apos;, and this was not the brightest I&apos;ve seen.  I have heard accounts of bolides which actually left a trail, etc., and this did not occur.

(Note: I was wearing my prescription glasses, and with them on my vision is corrected to 20/15 &amp;#8212;  better than perfect.) The color was either white or gray. For just a few seconds the craft banked (corrected course?) to its left (easterly) and the brightness of the setting sun brightly illuminated its belly during that time. I ran in the house and managed to find my binoculars. I went to the front porch to observe the craft more; however, the it was so high and far away by this time that the magnification provided by the binoculars was inconsequential. I then went to my upstairs window, which looks south, and watched until I lost sight of the craft as it headed generally toward Pike&apos;s Peak/Colorado Springs (approximately 100 miles away). * At no time were anti-collision lights observed * Craft was perhaps 30,000 - 40,000 feet high * Two contrails tailed behind * Estimate the craft to be as wide or wider than the wingspan of a Boeing 747 * Though unusual, I feel the craft was definitely earthly in origin owing to the conventional way in which it flew * Craft was probably military, but type and purpose clearly unknown by me * Environmental (neighborhood) noise prevented me from hearing the craft I hereby affirm that the above commentary accurately portrays my observations of unidentified craft sighted June 3, 1999 in Thornton, Colorado.

My dad slowed the car and we all got out to watch it. The lights moved faster and faster until they became a blurr, and you could no longer define one light from the other. Suddenly both lights just dropped and were gone. As we started towards the car there was a big flash and both lights were moving in opposite directions across the sky,green going right,yellow going left. They shot straight up and were gone in a matter of seconds. There is no possible way for it to be a plane. My whole family wittnessed it and we are all in agreement of each detail. This was not a dream.", "Appearing as a plane reflecting sunlight, would disappear and reappear for approx.5min, a second appeard &quot;danced&quot; around eachother and vanishedReturning home from a trip north, I got into the backseat to read awhile, I looked out the window of the car and noticed what looked like a plane reflecting sunlight. I watched for a second or two and glanced back down at the paper. I looked back out the window and noticed the object was still there, however this time it slowly inploded itself. I found this very odd and continued to watch the same area of sky, no more than 30 seconds later it &quot;expanded&quot; from what seemed to be the same area of sky, it was now back to its original size and color(which seemed to be a hazzy oval shape brighter than the blue sky in the background) it then inploded itself again and came back to its original size, it did this several times and never seemd to leave my field of view(as if it too were moving) by this time I called attention to this object to the other passenger in the car, at that moment a second object appeard just to the upper left of the first, it was the same size and color, they both faded in and out, circled onanother at a high rate of speed and were gone. this went on for 10-15 minutes, giving a plane plenty of time to leave my field of view.

The sky was partially clear and it was about 3-4 times larger that the stars behind it.The sky was partially clear and I could see the moon and stars.  I saw a large white circular object shoot across the sky in a south east direction. It lasted for only a few seconds.  I thought it might be an airplane but there were no other lights with it.

It was about 3-4 times larger than the stars in the background and much brighter.", "I witnessed a long-sided huge triangular craft with small pink-orange pairs of lights along its sides. It was huge. It moved slowly behind a hill, then rose out from behind it, then retreated behind the hill out of view. A Washington State MUFON investigator from Vancouver, WA, investigated the sighting, along with another sighting of a different type in the same area the day before. The cluster of sightings were reported in The Daily News (Longview, WA) on 9-18 or 19-91. I have yet to read a report of a triangular UFO with pairs of lights in rows along its side (as opposed to just one row of lights along each side) - I would like to hear from anybody who has seen this type of triangular UFO (with pairs of lights, pink-orange color).

It had plane colors, but it didn&apos;t blink and didn&apos;t move like a plane.  and then three smaller lights came from behind the mountain, and circled the big light.  Then they flew up in formation, and I ran in side to get another witness.  They were gone when I came back out.  There is plane traffic in my area, btu this looked really, really strange.  Not like a plane.Im a college student, a male, and I admit Im a scifi fan, and that &quot;technically&apos; makes me unreliable, but Im sure I saw something wierd.

Looked as far away as other stars. Disappeared behind tall mountains.It was nightime, so my friend was night fishing &amp; I was stargazing. That&apos;s when I noticed an entire constellation was moving. The speed was fast enough to catch my attention, but I was thinking what a great disguise. No one would have seen them if they had only taken a quick look at the sky. They appeared as any other stars, and far away. I regret I don&apos;t know names of constellations well enough to say where they were located.", "Driving North on Highway 66 and saw a 2 bright white lights.  I asked my husband what it was (we drive home this way every day/night).  I asked him if it was a pole?  A tower?  The closer we got the slower it appeared to be moving.  I whipped a U turn to follow it.  I caught up with it 40-50mph with the traffic.  Red, blue, green, yellow, white lights blipped like a pinwheel in the wind.  I kept asking well if it&apos;s a plane where are the &quot;beginning and end lights&quot; of the craft.  Then I asked why does it seem to be trapeziod and why do the lights change so much and twirl around like that!I&apos;ll explain when ya call, if ya call.  Or I will go into detail tommorow.  I&apos;d just like to found out if there was any military craft in the area.  I&apos;m safe to bet it was a couple of Apache&apos;s.  If so, what an awesome piece of equipment!", "9:14 P.M. I was in the house when my husband who had been sitting out in the yard stuck his head in the door and said to come outside to see some UFOs. I ran out to look  and over the city traveling northwest were several ( 3 to 4 that I could see ) red orange swirling lights in a vee formation moving slowly above the city.

Binoculars were of no help.  Over next several nights, saw same thing in same position in sky.  However, the object would only appear after midnight. If I would go out at 11 or 11:30, I wouldn&apos;t see it.  This is the only thing that seems odd to me.  I&apos;m sure it was a star or planet, but it makes me wonder.", "A bright light out my window.I was laying in bed at about 9:00 PM on a dark night. It was very cloudy but was not raining. I was listening to the radio, and trying to get to sleep when all of a sudden the radio just shut off. I looked over at my alarm clock and it was out also. The filter on my fish tank which is in my bedroom shut off completly and the heater light in the fish tank turned off too. Then I had a strange urge to look out my window. And a few seconds later a saw a very bright light, shaped like an circle or oval flew by my window with incredible speed. It was so bright it lit up my entire bedroom and seemed almost as if something as bright as the sun just flew by my window. I made no sound what so ever. My house and my neighbor&apos;s house are only about 10 feet apart, and judging by how bright it was and how close it seemed, I&apos;m sure it flew in between my house and my neighbor&apos;s house. I never did ask my neighbor if he saw anything, so as far I know, I am the only witness. Once the craft left I was about ready to leap out my window to see if I could see it again. But it happened so quickly I didn&apos;t know what to do. Moments later, my alarm clock turned back on but had to be reset. And my radio also turned on again. I beleave it was just a coincidence that I was listening to Sightings on the radio at the time it had happened. I wish to hear your imput and comments concerning this incident.

And I mean into... The object was perfectly round and shiny like the radiance of a brand new penny only gold...it was about the size of my little finger fingernail. The object seemed to glide effortlessly through this place into the sky. I know that isn&apos;t getting the understanding accross but let me try this... in the olden days you use to see these drawing where the earth was drawn in a bubble representing atmosphere... and these aerial items like stars and things were depicted halfway out of the bubble and halfway in...well this craft came out of a place and went just a tiny way and went back in. I was not the only one on the highway but I was the only one on the up-ramp which has a bit of an incline so that my car was pointing into the sky as I approached the highway proper. It happened so quickly that I did not bother to stop... but proceeded awestruck! No sounds were heard... Two jets... almost perpendicular to the location of the craft were visible... they were itty-bitty and heading in a different direction than the craft.(Erie (PA) International Airport is nearby)", "I was called by a friend on the phone who said she and her husband had just seen a bright light moving silently and speedily across the sky, changing directions. I went outside to look and within a few minutes saw a light move from points east to points south, almost the entire field of view. It then made a sudden 45 degree turn and cut straight across the sky, passing directly overhead and continuing until it was out of my field of view. It appeared to be very high in the sky.The object appeared to be a steady, white light,moved without making a sound. It was a very clear night. I thought perhaps it was a plane, shooting star, or even a satelite, but was convinced otherwise when it made its sharp 45 degree turn with no reduction in speed. Speaking of speed, it remained constant the whole time, taking about 45 seconds to go from my far left to my far right, then about another minute after it made its turn. I am 31 yrs old, married with kids, and studying to be an accountant.", "First seen from my backyard: a bright red light with a strobing white light.  It looked about 1/2 the size of Mars and was flying in a short zig-zag hopping fashion from the south to the north in the eastern sky.  It seemed to be far too high for a helicopter (maybe 30,000 feet). When I went to the front yard to see if it continued in the same direction it could not be seen in any part of the sky.My back yard is on the south side of my yard. At about 22:30 I looked up toward the eastern sky.  I believe that the planet visible in that part of the sky at that time of night is the planet Mars. I noticed that the planet was slightly above and east of what seemed to be two overlapping red balls of light, one on the left and the other on the right.  The red lights were about half the size of the planet but equal to its brightness.  A bright white light kept flashing in strobe fashion from the midst of the red lights. Althought they constantly moved in a northerly direction, the lights moved from the south toward the north in short zig-zagging eastward and westward  hops. I watched for about a half minute before entering my house and going to the front yard to see if the lights were continuing in the same direction. When I reached the front yard on the north side of my house I could not find the lights in any part of the sky.  Thinking that something could be obstruc- ting my view, I walked fifty feet to the west and fifty feet to the east of my house for a different perspective.  I was still unable to find a sign of the lights in any direction or at any distance.", "((NUFORC:  The following report was caused by the launch of a Titan IV missile from Vandenberg AFB in California.

Soon after intial sighting two other objects floated down and away from the main object. Then all three disappeared.While driving down Carmel Valley Road, I peered up into the sky and noticed the bright orange retectangular object high  in the sky. We pulled over to observe the strange coincidence. The rectangular object became long and skinny with a white bottom and an orange top. When the object regained it&apos;s original shape the were two smaller objects floating down. It almost seemed as if the three objects had an aura around it. Then a few minutes later the main object then  retracted to a smaller shape and kind of came in and out of focus, eventually disappearing along with the two other objects.", "Watching NASA t.v. as shuttle was flying over storm clouds.  Two objects appeared, one near top of screen, other near bottom.I was watching NASA t.v. and the camera was pointed out towards earth and was showing a series of lightning strikes in the storm clouds below.  Suddenly, a small bright object appeared near the upper left corner of the screen, moving to the right towards the &quot;3 o&apos;clock&quot; position of the screen.  Just as the first object exited the view another object appeared from the lower left corner of the screen.  It shot up towards the upper right (7 o&apos;clock to 1 o&apos;clock).

We were chatting a few minutes before we went to our respective houses.  As I started to get out of the car to unlock the passenger door (the lock was broken at that time).  We both noticed a halogen bright light appear above the shopping center that is about the length of a football field away.  We both assumed that it was the lights of the center comming on for the evening.  As I got out of the car I saw that the lights were not yet on and I assumed that it was a small plane.  The city airport is about two miles away.  As I was walking around the car and looking up a small plane came into view.  And I could clearly tell that it was not a plane.  When I got to the door the light started ascending and moving in a northward direction.  I ran back around to the drivers side and hopped inside, and said &quot;Well what do you think?  Let&apos;s go?&quot;  My friend said ok.  We began to follow this light for about two miles on Petaluma Blvd.  (This road runs parrell with 101.) The light stopped moving, so I drove into a parking lot.  When I stopped the car we could clearly see the light above the tops of some trees.  The lights began to move and it looked triangular, and it appeared to sway in pendulum fashion.  It then began to descend.  We could then see it through the trees.  And it began to move north again.  All of the movements were very slow.  We got back onto Petaluma Blvd. and continued to go north for several miles.  It then stopped again.  We turned West onto Petaluma Blvd. over 101 to get gas. The light then began to move very slowly west.  We got onto Stony Point road and went in a northwest direction and then turned onto Liberty road heading west.  We stayed on this road  watching this light until we reached Petaluma Valley Ford road.  The light was moving out toward the Two Rock Coast Guard station.  We were stopped at the stop sign.  We then turned east and headed back toward Petaluma.  The light appeared to be headi! ng out toward the ocean.  During this sighting it seemed almost as if this light/object were doing survey or taking pictures.

Maybe a minute later I saw a bright flash of light(it crashed?)On June 10. 1997 my boyfriend and myself were heading east towards Denver, CO on I70.  we were just coming up to the exit for Golden (exit 261?) when I saw a large bright white object (maybe about the size of a car headlight if it was 1/4 mile away.)  It was going too fast to be a plane.  I don&apos;t think it was a metoerite or a shooting star.  It was coming from diretly ahead of us(east) and heading to the left (NW).  It was going at a 45 degree angle.  It looked like it crashed behind the town we could seee from the highway.  About a minute later I saw a flash of light coming from the same town.  The flassh was so bright that the mountain behind the town lite up.  It reminded me of the airport landing lightsssssss, but when I mentioned this to my boyfriend he said if it was airport lights they would repeat not just flash once and disappear.  I looked down at the clock and it was approx. 10:30pm. Unfortunately my bofriend didn&apos;t see it.  He thought I was pointing at something else.  The reason I noticed it was that it was a clear night and the object was very bright and moving very quickly.  I forgot to mention that it was round with no visible tail on it.  If we weren&apos;t in a hurry we would have gone to look for it.  For the next several days I looked in the papers to see if there was anything about it.  I also asked several people but no one heard of anything.", "I was inside my house and I looked up thru my skylight to see if there was a full moon.  I saw a triangle shaped craft moving from south to north-northwest.  There was a white spotlight at one corner and a green light at the two other corners. After about 20 minutes I went out my front door to get a better look.  It was a cold and windy night but the sky was clear. I stood on the sidewalk and saw the triangular craft again and then I noticed the other two craft and the lights were the same on them.  Now they didn&apos;t seem to be moving.  A man and a woman came by and I asked them if they believed in UFO&apos;s.  The man said they were in a hurry and they kept walking down the street.  Then a couple of minutes later another couple, a man and woman, came by and I asked them what did they think the lights were up in the sky.  After a minute the guy said he thought it might be a comet.  The woman said she thought she saw blue or green lights.  Then they left after a few minutes.  The craft still didn&apos;t seem to be moving and after about fifteen minutes I saw a small airplane, flying from north to southeast, fly under the large triangular object.   In comparison to the plane, the object seemed to be at least five times bigger than the plane.  After another 15 minutes observing the objects, the clouds started to move in and I went inside my house and didn&apos;t see them anymore.", "Huge fireball that lit up the sky, and lit up the surroundings. It looked like a shooting star. But it was so bright and in our atmosphere.The years and dates above could be out by a year or so either way. All i can really remember is that i was still in high school at the time. I used to stay up late at night to have a ciggarette when my parents would go to bed. I live at the top of a three storey house that faces North, in a hilly area in Melbourne. On this particular night, i was lucky to see whatever it was. ( I have seen alot of shooting stars in my time, and it was either the most spectacular shooting star or something else). The reason i was so lucky is that, as i was pulling open my curtains I saw the event happen. It appeard like someone had shot a flaming arrow from a few feet above the roof above my head, which made the lower part of the roof in front of me ligt up, and it lit up the whole sky as it rocketed across the sky and over the nearest hill. All of this happend in about a second or two. There is no way that it was an aeroplane beacause of the speed of the thing. That is why i thought it must have been a shooting star. I dont know if stars can shoot through our atmosphere or not. But this thing sure did. I checked the newspaper and watched the news the following day but nothing was said.

Therefore, I see lots of flying objects in the sky, and if it&apos;s night I always look up at the planes.  Well, on Monday, May 10, 1999,  around 9:15 pm, I had just dropped off a letter into the postbox and was on my way to the supermarket, when something right above me caught my eye.  At first when I looked at this object I thought &quot;what a strange plane&quot; it was.  It took me about a second to realize that this was no airplane--at least like none that I have seen. It seemed to be triangular in shaped (not equilateral), with golden yellow lights at what would probably be the points, and moving very fast from the southwest to the northeast.  The forward part of the object was not actually a point, but rather more to the left of a point--so I guess if you were to look at a triangle that was turned about 5-8 degrees to the right--the reulting top of it would be the front part of the object (I hope this makes sense).  It made absolutely no noise.  It was VERY large--though without a frame of reference I can&apos;t say exactly how large.  Living in a metro area, I only see (on a really clear night) the major stars and planets, so, I couldn&apos;t tell if any stars were blocked by the object. The most peculiar thing about this object was that I felt like I was viewing it through water.  The image shimmered like a mirage, or something like the transporter scenes from Star Trek when the people are midway in the transport process.  The lights did not seem to be singular but rather arrays at each point; but this impression could be due to the shimmering effect.  The viewing lasted about 5 seconds, at which time the damned thing simply blinked out. The night was crystal clear, not a single cloud in the sky so this was not a case of something being reflected off clouds.  A couple of seconds after the object blinked out a commercial airplane came in (from west to east) for a landing at LaGuardia.   I got the impression that this object was up very high, certainly lots higher than the incoming plane.  Unfortunately, there were no other people near me at the time--well there might have been , but I simply couldn&apos;t take my eyes off this thing and it all happened so quickly--it would have been gone before I could get someone&apos;s attention.", "I was coming home from a friend&apos;s house, then saw a triangle.I was coming home from a friend&apos;s house at about 11:40(this was when I was nearing my neighborhood) and noticed a low-flying helicopter coming from the south, and flying over my neighborhood. This helicopter had placed itself over some treetops near the intersection where I turn to get onto my block. As I neared it, I noticed it seemed to not be a helicopter at all, as it had three lights equally spaced around a less brightly lit center with a small row of red lights flashing one after the other from outside to the inside of the bottom surface. As I turned to go to my house, it slid silently over my truck(which freaked me badly, because by this time the realization was just setting in that this was no helicopter). I nearly missed my turn into my driveway, had to reverse, to turn in (a three point turn gone horribly wrong), and as I got out and looked up, I found that it had vanished. I checked the car&apos;s clock just after the event, and am happy to report no missing time or other wierd phenomena. Also there was a(definite)helicopter in the vicinity just prior to the time of the event, which was landing at a nearby rock quarry- I thought nothing of this at the time, having seen a helicopter there before in daylight, but in retrospect, it seems odd at 11:40 at night-not exactly normal business hours.", "huge fireball approx. 30 mile fire trail, traveling upward at a speed approx. 10,000 miles p.h.I was driving with a friend north on U.S. 301 North, we were just on the other side of the withalacoochee national forest when a orange fireball roured upward toward the sky.  I thought it was some kind of rocket because it seem to be coming from the direction of the space center on the east coast.  It was far to big a fire trail than the space shuttle and the sound much lowder like a constant roar, not a boom like the shuttle makes when it brakes the sound barrier.  Its rate of speed was that of 100x FASTER THAN THE SHUTTLE DOES ON TAKE OFF. I know this was no space shuttle because you can see the space shuttle, but not this,  what ever it was, was covered by fire.", "Observed silvery tubular craft with bright white lights along the sides.  No sound or vapor trail, no wings or tail structure.My wife and I were gardening in early evening about 12 minutes before sunset.  The sky was clear with very few clouds.  We watched as a cylindrical craft traveled from the SW to NE at a uniform rate of speed, passing overhead just to the south of us.  It had a row of very bright white lights along the side of the body, the body had a very reflective metallic appearance. The craft appeared to be at least 25 diameters in length, a very long cylindrical structure.   It was sufficiently low in altitude so that we could see that it was not a conventional aircraft, no wings, tail or other visible structures.  It progressed uniformly along a straight line path at a bearing of about 20 degrees north of East.  No vapor trail or no emission of sounds.  We frequently watch the many high altitude commercial flights that cross over this area.  This craft did not follow any of the paths usually followed by the airliners.  This craft was much lower and any engine noise should have been noticeable.", "My wife was sitting on the back porch that faces west I went outside and me and 3 other people watched it while I took pictures.Me and my wife saw a craft it looked like a very faint saucer you could barely see the outline. the craft at first would dim out completely for about 3 minutes when an aircraft would be on its final aproach to landing at first. then after the craft was in the sky for about ten minutes it would stay illuminated dimming and then get brighter at times it moved side to side very slowly it was about 4-5miles away from us I rushed in the house to get my camera a cannon Eos-10s I had it set to 135mm I took about 35 pictures.  the light got bright it was a white light I took these pictures though the trees on my second story apartment.", "Three of us saw a high flying jet/airplane begin zig-zagging across the sky for about 30 seconds.This happened so long ago that I have never considered reporting it until I heard you on the recent sightings on radio show.  At the time I thought that ufo&apos;s had to be a &quot;flying saucer&quot; to be a real event. But some months ago, I read a recent report that sounded much like mine. I never forgot what happened but I didn&apos;t commit the entire night to memory either.  The date I gave is a pretty wild guess based on who I was with and when we would have been together. Here is what happened. My two friends and I were college friends/roomies off campus at Okla. State Univ.  It must have been early Saturday morning and we had been out chasing the ladies and the bars had closed down so we  decided to go out about 5 miles west of town to Lake Carl Blackwell where we liked to go to watch the stars for meteors.  We were just lying flat on the ground looking straight up.  I was laying with my head facing west and my feet to the east.  At some point I saw what I thought was a high flying airplane or jet (i.e. a point source of light, like a star) moving across the sky at a semmingly normal speed, from west to east. I saw it near my zenith and fixed on it for some reason. After it passed my zenith, it began zig zagging.  It was not &quot;arc-ing&quot; but was making definite hard angles. The relative distance the object moved from one &quot;cut&quot; to the next was about the size of a dime at arms lenghth. It did not speed up or slow down, it just zigged for about 30 seconds and then returned to a straight line until it passed out of sight to the east. I did not say a word and neither did my friends but about a minute after it had slowly disappeared I just asked &quot;Did anybody see that?&quot;  Both of my friends raised up and said in unison, &quot;Did you see that too?&quot;  I asked, &quot;Dale,what did YOU see?&quot; Dale described exactly what I saw.  DeWayne agreed that he saw the same thing.  We scratched our heads and then let it go. Now, we HAD been out on the town earlier but we were not intoxicated, certainly not to a point were it effected what we saw. I have never seen anything act like that before or since and spend alot of time outdoors wathing the night sky.  I&apos;ve seen &quot;satellites&quot; just sort of fade in and then fade out, but never saw anything zig-zagging in or even arc-ing in any manor. I still wonder what it was.", "Saw a what we thought at first as a very large bright STAR or planet? then the object in the S/W direction (from our back yard) dropped or launched a smaller object from it. It was a straight dowm drop from the larger object. The second object we saw was Northwest from where we were standing in our back yard in Pleasanton CA. This 2nd object was red-yellow and also very bright in appearance, It appeared to fire sometype of projectile to the South, the projectile was quick and as it shot-out from the object it was fast then slowed and disappeared. Were there any rockets or NASA type crafts in our area last night?? also both objects stayed in the same area for a good 45 mins---till we gave up and went to bed.. Would appreciate a response...We are a married couple in Pleasanton CA. My husband has worked at a local Car Manufacture Co, for 27 years. We had not been drinking and were completely sober.

On this night my sister on her way to work observed lights in the sky and called me at home to ask if I had seen this. I looked outside the window and reported nothing unusual,as she was explaining the sight to me I also saw it. My girlfriend and I both ran outside and to the east saw three red,steady lights forming a perfect triangle. As I spoke with her on the cordless phone, red lights began shooting from the main shape..one down,one up and south,one back to the east,and the last to the north very erratic,as if it had lost control or something. Also this last weekend I was explaining to my girlfriend weather formations after dark, and how if you can still see the glow of stars through the clouds,they were not very heavy. We suddenly saw three goose shaped glows,not lights appear in a formation of two to the south and one to the north heading east from the north west over our house. They disappeared immediately, duration was only from 5-20 seconds. The weekend of 6/5/99. Thank you for this site,it lets us all share our stories.", "The object moved across the sky in a southern direction at a very high rate of speed.  About 20 min. later, the object was then being pursued by plane.  Object changed color from red to blue to green in a short time.The event started approx. at 20:20 in McEwen, TN.  My parents were outside when my mother (legal secretary) looked up and saw something in the sky. She called out my brother and his wife to look at the same thing.  About 20 minutes later they called me (college student) in a town about 2 hrs. away to make sure that they were not looking at a star or a comet.  The first object that they saw changed from a red, to a green, and then to a blue in a short period of time, and had repeated to do so.  At 20:30, my brother noticed an aircraft following along the same tragechtory as the frist craft.  The second craft appeared at about 20:40 and did a color change similar to the other craft.  At 21:00, both craft were to far down on the horizon for anyone to see clearly.  Throughout this entire time, my brother attempted to use a telescope to look more closely at either craft.  He was unable to maintain focus on either of the craft.", "I saw 4 distinct shapes in the sky flying very slowly . They flew in formation eastward , then wheeled back west . After a few min. of this they hovered for a moment , and then shot off back east . They flew faster then anything I have ever seen .", "heard what souned like a very long sonic boom. but 10 min before I noticed a very unsal contrail looked like nothing I ever seen before, very jagged and all over the place. 1 hour later the smoke like contrail was still in the same area to the north west. Ive heard sonic booms before but never like this it was almost like a very load explosion far off. There seems to many things happening very very many contrails the last 4 wks. But this was very unsal.    I also have a vido tape from 1987 of a ufo in this area if you are interested. I relize its from 12 years ago but its very interesting.

A cell phone call to my wife following in another car confirmed she saw same lights. Similar to lights seen Mar. 7, 1997 in same area.My wife and I were driving separate cars home together on Estrella parkway which heads south at the point where I saw two amber lights through trees and low on the horizon over the area of Rainbow Valley south of Estrella Mountain Ranch. They appeared to be dropping below the crest of the hill up which we were travelling. As we arrived at the intersection of Elliot and Estrella Parkway they dropped below our line of sight into the area of Rainbow Valley. The area is southwest of the Estrella mountains. They lights were seen intermittently as we traveled from the beginning of the Estrella Mountain Ranch property until the intersection of Elliot and Estrella.  A time of about 5  minutes and a distance of several miles. I spoke to my wife by cell phone and she confirmed that she too saw the lights.  She thought they might be flares.  I had seen similar lights about 6 days before the March 13 PHX event in the same general area. I have reported that event in a separate correspondence with Peter,q.v.

This was in the late afternoon, still light outside, this was not a light beam or anything projected, we could see that it was a flying object, with flashing lights like a plane but flying unlike any plane I had ever seen.

It rose up to just slightly above the moon.  The second was, I would estimate, 15 minutes behind.

The first red light appeared at approximately 10:45 PM Eastern Standard time and was just below the visible bottom of the moon.  It sat there until about 11:00 than began to rise at an unhumanlike rate of velocity.  It travled upwards, and as it reached the visible top of the moon, a white one appeared.  It behaved just like the red one.  When the red light began to move northwest in the night sky, the white one began to trail it with an equal speed as if being towed from the moon by the red one.  We observed this for about an hour or so before they were out of sight. The crafts seemed to both be invisible to the naked eye shape and colorwise, just a red light and a white light.", "Green ball off lightOn Tuesday, May 11, at approximately 0435 AM, in Marietta, GA (several miles northwest of Atlanta, GA)  while out jogging, I saw a green (similar to the color of a pre-color  computer screen) &quot;ball of light&quot;.  I was  proceeding approximately due  south  from Terrill Mill Rd. into the North x  Northwest Office Park when I saw what I believed at first to be a meteor.  The object was moving from  northwest  to southeast (approximate bearing 150  degrees), had no tail (unlike a meteor),  had a clearly defined edge, was  visible for about 1 to 2 seconds and  then disappeared  from a relatively clear sky (particularly clear in  the direction of the object (light ball).  The phrase  &quot;winked out&quot; describes the way it disappeared.  There was no  noise  as it passed by and no apparent explosion when it went out.

The lights on the objectdid not blink and were very dim, not as bright as a star, but none the less quite visible.The triangular object hovered for an instant and then took off in a northerly direction at in my opinion 4 to 5 times faster than a commercial airliner and then disappeared.The craft was absolutley silent.", "disk was following my car very bright blinding brightness,low as tree level on windham depot road", "In the pre-dawn hours of the above date I encountered a large, triangular craft hovering silently about 100 foot above the freeway.At the time of this encounter I was 42 years-old.  I have a Bachelor of Science from the University of Michigan (in psychology) and, prior to this event, I had no particular interest in the subject of UFOs.  Like everyone else in the civilized world, I suppose, I&apos;d seen &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; in the 1970&apos;s.  Beyond that, however, I knew very little about this phenomenon and tended to be skeptical - if not completely dismissive - of the occassional reports that I&apos;d see in papers, on the news, etc. It is noteworthy, though, that on the day before this happened to me almost the entire front page of our local newspaper (The Flint Journal) was devoted to reports of UFOs sighted near Holland, Michigan (the past week) and sightings over crowded, residential areas within the City of Flint the previous evening.  The headlines that day were, in fact, in reference to this spate of sightings. At the time I&apos;d picked up a temporary job in a small factory about 50 miles south of Flint and was scheduled to be at work at 6:00 AM.  Traveling south on I-75 (and then US-23), as my car crested the Bristol Rd. overpass, I saw two very bright, airborne &quot;headlights&quot; off in the distance; it was clearly an airborne object of some sort though the lights were quite low on the horizon.  Since the airport was to my right (at the southwestern intersection of I-75 and Bristol Rd.) I simply assumed a very large plane was landing. For the next few miles my view of these lights was often obscured by buildings and foilage because they were, as I&apos;ve said, quite low on the horizon.  At one point the freeeway curves, and from about three-quarters of a mile away, I could see that whatever the object was it wasn&apos;t moving - and it was, indeed, very low to the ground. Approaching the object I had a very ominous feeling.  It was sitting just to the right of the freeway and hovering slightly above a grove off full grown trees.  The northern-facing &quot;headlights&quot;, even from a distance of an eigth-of-a mile, had a brilliant, phosphorus look that was just plain weird.  I would estimate that the lights were about forty feet apart.  As I got closer to the object, which made no sound whatsoever, the lights seemed to be vibrating or to have some sort of internal motion - it&apos;s difficult to describe. Frankly, I was terrified.  I slowed a bit as I passed almost directly underneath the object.  Bending forward to look up at it I saw that it had a red light that was pulsating on it&apos;s bottom.  This light illuminated the outline of a large, triangular craft whose underside had striations - or a ribbing of sorts - and which appeared (as much as I could determine) to be made of metal.  It was very, very large and yet, as I&apos;ve said, made no sound at all. I floored the car in terror and, then, about 100 yards down the freeway hit the brakes and looked back.  I could see it&apos;s outline hanging there above the trees and it was as motionless as a cinder block sitting on an oak table. At work I talked to 3 other people who&apos;d seen it and we were all dumbfounded - and scared to death.  The next day, an air traffic controller at Flint&apos;s Bishop Airport gave me the number for MUFON (I&apos;d never heard of it) and they came to my home a few days later to take a report.  The air traffic controller, by the way, chuckled as he listened to my story but also stated that he&apos;d &quot;seen a lot of things&quot; he couldn&apos;t explain either (no one, he said, had seen anything from the tower the previous morning - this is something which I absolutely DO NOT believe).  He said, to paraphrase, that since Uncle Sam was signing his paychecks he wasn&apos;t going to elaborate on any of his own sightings. The Michigan director of MUFON came to my home, as I&apos;ve said, a few days later and took a report.  She also told me that she&apos;d been contacted by two women who, while carpooling to work at 10 PM the night before my sighting, had seen what I&apos;d described hovering over both lanes of the freeway at precisely the same location.  She went on to say that the women had only seen the object after they&apos;d suddenly realized that they were inexplicably traveling north on I-75 (instead of south) and had exited and turned around; they had no explanation, she said, for how they&apos;d left Flint on southbound I-75 and ended up a bit dazed and headed north (having to turn around to head in the direction of work). Now - this all sounded like a lot of malarky to me.  Even though I&apos;d seen this thing my initial impression was that the lady from MUFON was some sort of kook.  Then, on Tuesday of the next week, a lady with whom I&apos;d become friends approached me at work, looking very upset, and asked me to call her after work. In a nutshell, she had overheard me relating a few details of my conversation with the lady from MUFON with people at the shop.  She seemed like a sane, sober individual (strong Baptist, sang in the choir at church, etc.) but, on the phone that evening, told me of flashbacks she was having of a classic UFO abduction.  She, too, was carpooling that morning with another young women and didn&apos;t see anything.  Her van, however, started spinning out of control and she thought she&apos;d hit &quot;black ice&quot;, as she put it.  The spinning, however, accelerated and she could remember - she said - &quot;going up&quot;. These two ladies, also, found themselves driving north on I-75 (and don&apos;t really understand how this happened), experienced missing time, etc.  The women I spoke to was hysterical, at the time, and - as I&apos;ve indicated - seemed very normal otherwise.  I have no reason to doubt her story (which included seeing her reflection in the large eyes of some big-eyed being). Obviously, the latter part of this is anecdotal but I believe that these two women had experienced what they described - a UFO abudction.  I know exactly what I DID NOT see: I didn&apos;t see a helicopter, swamp gas, the planet Venus, nor state-of-the-art human technology. I&apos;ve typed this extremely fast so I hope it makes sense.  I hope you continue to get at the truth - someone need to.....", "Looked like shooting star, Except they had no tail, went from south horizion to north horizion at a very high rate of speedI am an over the road truck driver, at aprox 02:00 hour&apos;s while I was driving north on hwy 35 between Osceola, Iowa  and  Des Moines, Iowa.

It looked like a shooting star Except there was no tail to it at all, then about 15-20 min&apos;s later, I saw the exact same thing, also going from South to North.  The reason that I am letting you know about this is because this same thing happend about 4 month&apos;s ago, Except it was colder outside and I had the window&apos;s up, and I thought that maybe it was a reflection off the glass from some other source (passing car, ect.) But this time with the window down, that was not the case. I should mention that the first event also had two object&apos;s about 15-20 min&apos;s apart.

The object is not inconsistent with some white, round object, and it does &quot;disappear&quot; from sight on several occasions.

It didnt look like a star or aircraft, it was yellow in color. I told my wife to get the cam corder. The object started to desend rapidly. It leveled off after a few seconds. My wife recorded the object for aprox 15 to 20 sec. then the battery went dead she changed the battery and the object was gone or out of sight. when we played the tape back there was a black rectangle inside the light as if it was part of it. Thinking it could have been an anomily in the camera, I took and shot video of the moon and a star. The rectangle never showed up in the moon or star. With the camera zoomed in the object was about the size of the moon.

I have seen many shooting stars, and this didn&apos;t look anything like a shooting star. This is the second green fireball I have seen falling. The last was in the first week of Nov. 98 and that sighting lasted for only a second. That fireball was clearly visible about 30 degrees above the horizon and large enough to see it&apos;s head and tail destinctively. Interestingly the tail flared out and was wider farther from the head of the fireball and much thiner near the head. However the last green fireball which I saw on the Dec. 28, 1998 could not be made out clearly because of a dark rainy sky. But I could see a large glowing green light falling in or just behind the clouds above and in front of me as I drove west on 50 outside of Orlando. The fireball *seemed* to have fallen well into the lower parts of the atmosphere when it terminated. Unfortuneatly I have no way of estimating how quickly it was moving or how far away it really was. It just seemed close. Compared to a shooting star it moved very slowly. And seemed to just be falling. After about 3 seconds it terminated with a brilliant flash which lit up the clouds in a white light.

Where the road passes over a tributary of Kaydeross Creek is a low, swampy field with a hill line on either side.The creek, which connects Lake Lonely to Saratoga Lake floods this area every spring,and the stretch of land between the two lakes is undeveloped.A bright light over the dark field drew my attention,I turned my head and saw a sphere hovering very low,just above the bare trees, about 70 feet off the ground and about 150 feet from the road. The sphere had a warm orange glow,the light it gave off was like a flare or sparkler,with tiny sparks of red,yellow,orange,even green and blue.It wasn&apos;t lit from external lights,it was lit from within and its entire surface glowed.Its color changed from yellow to green to red to white to blue,changing colors constantly and almost instantly.It was spinning rapidly,not east/west like a globe,but in a south/north spin.As it spun it revealed strange repeating designs,dark bands,question marks,star patterns and squiggles,,particularly interesting is a trident-like design,and the patterns change colors as well. I pulled over,put my car into park,turned on my camcorder and began filming.It started floating to the south away from me soon after I started filming,but I captured it for over a minute, and the features I describe are clear.Freeze-frame shows how quickly and how certainly remarkable designs and patterns cover this craft.", "One night I looked up and saw one &quot;star&quot; slowly move into another. 3 days later I saw a 15 foot wide orange circle.I was eight years old. I remember because my sister was an infant and she is eight years younger, born 11/01/77. I must admit that I saw &quot;Star Wars&quot; but there were aspects that I only came to understand many (14) years later. My Mother, Sister and I lived in one large room of a guest house on a ranch near Topanga Canyon Blvd. and Chatsworth Blvd. in the San Fernando Valley, California. For a few days prior to the sighting I would walk outside on the ranch. I would look into the sky and say to myself &quot;I know they&apos;re coming, I know they&apos;re coming...&quot; over and over again. After a few days of this I looked straight up into the stars and was only moderately surprised to see one very bright (like Venus) &quot;star&quot; slowly move toward another that was about 3-5 degrees of arc away from the first. When the first &quot;star&quot; reached the other &quot;star&quot; the moving one simply dissapeared into the other. Three nights later I awoke in bed and was drawn to look for where the bright orange light was comming from. I sat up in bed to see about a 15 foot wide circle or sphere of orange light moving slowly from left to right behind some big eucalyptus trees which were on the far side of a horse corral. The object was less than 100 feet away. I could see a, possibly, solid core with a glowing corona around the edge. I thought I should yell for my Mother who was only 20 feet away and in the same room as I. I did not yell; instead I had a very strong urge to grab the 110 Kodak Instamatic camera on my window sill. My next thought was &quot;No, I don&apos;t want to scare &apos;them&apos; away.&quot; As the light slowly moved down and to the right, behind some large bushes, I yelled &quot;Mother!!! U.F.O.&quot; She sat up in bed just in time to see the light but not the &apos;craft.&apos; The next day, at school, I told my friends. They asked me to draw pictures. I drew pictures of the &apos;craft&apos; changing shape, moving toward me and prepairing to land. I told my friends that I then yelled for my Mother and &apos;it&apos; flew away. The reason I mention about my &apos;lying&apos; about what I saw was that 14 years later I went to a hypnotist. I was not seeing the hypnotist for any reason at all related to the U.F.O. In the hypnosis session I began to see my childhood drawings in photographic form. I was not in deep hypnosis so I clearly remember the images, much to my surprise. Only later in life did I learn how children sometimes tend to draw their suppressed memories. I have done very little more significant investigation into my sighting. The date of the sighting IS APPROXIMATE but it &apos;feels&apos; very accurate. The true reason I picked that date is the 1/9/78 4:30 AM Thousand Oaks sighting listed in this same list. Thousand Oaks is only about 15 miles from Chatsworth. I strongly feel that we may have both seen the same craft. I do know that the year is correct and that the day of month is approximate.", "LIGHT THE SIZE OF SILVER DOLLAR AT ARM&apos;S LENGTH SEEN HOVERING JUST ABOVE HIGHWAY. RAPIDLY CHANGING COLORS FROM WHITE-RED-BLUE-GREEN-ORANGE AT RATE OF CA. 5 PER SEC.AT 2:58AM, APRIL 10, I OBSERVED A LIGHT, THE SIZE OF A SILVER DOLLAR HELD AT ARM&apos;S LENGTH, AND ABOUT 1/10 THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE FULL SUN, HOVERING JUST ABOVE HWY 60 ABOUT 10 MILES EAST OF THE VERY LARGE RADIOTELECOPE ARRAY (VLRA).

Again there was a light, this time accompanied by two more lights in a triangular formation.  i called my fiance over and the lights vanished.  About five minutes later my fiance saw a light outside followed by a bright flash of light like cloud to cloud lightening. Taking my dog outside again around 11 pm the lights were still around.  This time it was a red light hovering above the interstate.  This interstate runs to Nasville so runs from west to east.  This light turned a blue colour and rapidly moved back in my direction.  I believe that that would be a southerly direction.  This blue light hovered above a field across the street from my apartmernt complex.  My dog for some reason then raised the hair on his back, put his tail between his legs as if in a defensive posture.  He then turned and made for the apartment. Over about the next hour my dog remained on the balcony staring at the sky.  The lights flickered on and off for a second at one point but i cannot confirm if the two are related. 12:30 my fiance took the dog out for the last time before bed.  She saw what she describes as three headlights, bright cigar shaped lights, hovering almost directly over the apartment building.  The lights were bright. It is there that this light remained for the duration of her time outside, about five minutes. None of these lights made any noise whatsoever.  The movemnents of the lights were precise and accurate almost like they were flying looking for or at something.  the movements were so exact that my fiance, who is a skeptic of ufo&apos;s, could not identify the lights as either a plane nor a helicopter.  I, not being a skeptic, understand the meaning of &quot;ufo&quot; cannot identify the craft under my knowledge as being a helicopter or a aeroplane.  The movemnts were too exact and noiseless.", "Witness sees orange fireball w/ long yellow tail streak parallel to horizon.Witness was sitting on her porch at approximately midnight, looking to the southwest across the city.

I was about 11 yrs. old gazing at the stars above on a clear night when I saw 2 bright lights that were the same size as the stars I had been watching, suddenly shoot across the sky parallel to one another coming to a complete stop imediatley. It&apos;s difficult to guess how fast they were moving but if I were to do so I would have to say more than 600mph.They sat in possition for maybe 3sec. Before they flew off in two different dirrections one due south and the other due west at the exact same moment. They were gone just as fast as they arrived into my view.

I was observing a Tennesse Air National Guard C-141 transport. It was westbound, and then started to turn right (North). From behind the C-141, but very distant appearing, I saw a very small, but bright point of light. It would remind one of Venus, in the early evening, well before dark. It was hard to maintain visual contact while driving, so I pulled off the road to try to re-acquire it, but had no luck. No motion was observed, no other lights etc... The sky was crystal clear, no clouds at all. No other observers. We are so close to Arkansas, just across the Mississippi River, that the object had to be over Arkansas. My impression was of a large object, very high and very far away. It wasn&apos;t Venus, Mars, Jupiter or Vega, which is very bright. It was too far North to be any of those. The general direction was approximately 290 degrees true. I am ex-USAF and ex-USN, an amatuer astronomer, have been around the world and been exposed to many types of aircraft.

It appeared as Venus might in the daylight, but definitely before evening. A small point, it would have easily been missed by most people. This was a day after a severe rain/thunderstorm that created tornados. The sky was crystal clear. No other observers.

There was no noticable noise. Suddenly a new light pulsed once slowly and then shone. This light was three times the size of the others and in the middle of the formation. It was also lighter on the outside than the inside. The object sped away at speed???? Perhaps it was moving at speed anyway.

I noticed that northbound Washington Road was blocked by a road-closed sign (stating that the road was closed 3/4ths of a mile ahead), the orange kind that are used when construction is taking place.  As I waited for eastbound SR 41 traffic to clear in order to make my right turn, I looked past the road closed sign and to the north toward the point where dump trucks and a (presumably) construction crew was gathered.  In the sky above them was an object that I at first thought was a blimp.  It was metallic or silver in color, looked to be the correct length of a blimp at that distance, but was not tall enough in my estimation to actually be a blimp.  This was in the middle of the afternoon and the sky was perfectly clear.  The object seemed to be floating or hovering over the construction site, at maybe about twice the level of the nearby treetops.  I just sat there for about 1 minute, trying to justify and identify what I was looking at.  I dismissed the blimp idea, and then wondered if this was some sort of weather balloon or something.  I might point out that the location of this object was in a rural setting not far from a small city.  I thought that the folks at the road construction site HAD to see this thing!  I briefly considered driving around the road closed sign, to the construction site as to get a better look, but I convinced myself that I should go ahead and run the errand that I had set out to do and that if when I came back by it was still there then I&apos;d try to investigate.  When I came back by the same area approximately 30-35 minutes later, I could no longer see the object.  A couple of hours later the road closed sign was gone and I drove down northbound Washington road to the point of construction.  It looked like they had been working on grading the roadside ditches and there was nothing that looked out of the ordinary. I&apos;m afraid to make inquires about this locally, since I&apos;ve observed that people that admit that they see UFOs are treated like nutcases.  I&apos;d really like to know if there was a blimp in the area or if that was some sort of weather ballon.  I&apos;d also like to know if the construction crew noticed it overhead.

The craft, which was approximately 30-50 feet across, widened from the narrow edges towards the middle.  As we were looking down on the disk, we could see a dome on top which appeared to have view ports or windows of some sort.  There were also green, red and white lights encircling the perimeter of the craft.  There also appeared to be a smaller dome on the bottom of the craft. The craft then began moving in a slow zigzag pattern back and forth over Fairfax for about a minute.  It then took off faster than I have ever seen anything move.  It shot straight up and was moving so fast that it seemed to leave a trail of light images behind it that then disappeared.  All of this occured with no sound by the craft at all. We immediately phoned Hamilton Air Force Base to check if they had possibly seen this craft on radar.  We finally got through to the tower at the base and they stated they had not picked up the unknown craft on radar.

Over the years I have observed northern lights, meteors, satellites and all kinds of commercial and private aircraft.  Rarely have I seen anything out of the usual until the evening of Tue. May 27, 1997.  Because of engineering studies at university I haven&apos;t had time until now to send in this report. What got me interested in getting in touch with the UFO Center was hearing Peter Davenport on the Coast-to-Coast AM radio program on Sat. Feb. 20, 1999 at 1:30 am EST.  I wasn&apos;t aware of the UFO reporting center website until that morning.  He had mentioned that some people had reported seeing a large diamond shaped object.  This is something like what I saw. I spotted a brightly lit yellowish orange four-sided diamond shaped object over Welland, Ontario, Canada.  It had well defined edges with the light being more concentrated near its edges.  It approached from the northwest below the Big Dipper at 11:05 pm EDT with no sound.  Its size was about a thumbnail&apos;s width at arm&apos;s length.  In view for about 15 seconds, it moved across the sky in a straight line and disappeared below the southeast horizon. An estimated altitude was 40,000 feet which gives an approximate width (using trigonometry) of 800 feet across its beam.  In addition, this object moved with its larger interior angles being front to back. I again saw the same object (at least it appeared the same) a week later on Tue. June 3, 1997 at 11:50 pm EDT over Welland and its behaviour was the same as that described above. This eerie looking object was certainly something different as it was too large for a satellite, shuttle-craft or the Mir station, and it was moving extremely fast for its estimated height above ground.  It also didn&apos;t have the characteristic port and starboard red and green lights nor the flashing white or red strobe lights associated with known aircraft. I hope that this information will be of interest to you and that it can be used in collaboration with other reported similar sightings.", "w shape with lights on its side ,i thought it was a migratotry bird  or a stealt flying in the night but it could not be a bird because it has lights", "I was watching shuttle flight STS96 on the morning of June 4-5th via sat dish.After passinf FL going out to sea. two objects moved into view then hovered,a third object joined then a bunch of smaller objects movedin from every direction. this went on for about 10 min.I have been watching shuttle flts for over 10 years.I know all the air to ground lingo and shuttle systems, water dumps,ice, fuel venting ect. I was also lucky enough to have taped the STS80 shoot out live. I went to a brief by Richard C. Hoagland re STS80. What I saw looked exactly the same as the STS80 film! This event took place on orbit 124, MET 07,21,00,14  GMT of 155,07,50. (time hacks via nasa disp) This is the closest time hack poss. The event takes place during the 10 min or so b-4. Shuttle STS96 passes Fl starts going out to sea. About 100 to 200 miles out to sea two objects appear on the low light cameras. they move then goto hover, then a third moves in and hovers with them.I believe these to be large. The camera zoom/ dist to target seems to be the same as STS80 they appeared to be the same size and brightness. a min or two later hand fulls of smaller less bright objects move in from all directions. There is a lightning storm going on and several of the small ones seem to dart in and out of the lightning! Some of the smaller objects appear to move really close to the larger  craft. the small ones are moving very fast . In and out of the picture in no more that 2 pause frames on vcr. I have this event on tape and will be willing to send you a copy if you wish. too many things going on at the same time to type here.((NUFORC:  Tape was received.  It was viewed by approximately 45 people at the monthly meeting for June, and everyone seemed to find the objects to be quite interesting.  NUFORC will apply some analysis and attempt to establish what the objects might be, or cannot be.))", "While relieving and sailor at 3:30 am. We were looking at a full moon. We noticed this very bright star that appeared to be aout 6&quot; from the moon. This very whites blue light all of a sudden started jumping around as though it was one of those little black water bugs that you see in streams. This thing finally just when up and out of site. We never told any one about this because of what we would encounter from our superiors.Looked like a very bright star. Could make 90 and 180 Degree turns. Looked as thought it was jumping around the moon. We heard no noise. It  would leave a trail like a sprinkler that you light on the 4th of July. Never seen ant thing like this ever again. I trully believe this was a UFO&gt;", "I was at a party, there was at least 20 people outside when 5 light`s came out of the north east. I thought they might be helicopters untill the light`s got closer. When they were really close i noticed that there was no sound. The light`s at this point looked like they were trying to form a circle formation then broke up and became a line again. Next the light`s got right over the house and hovered in one spot for about 8 min...then the light`s started to leave going up, at such a high alttitude that they disappeared within minutes. About 5 minutes later, I looked up again and saw just one light that hovered for 2 minutes then left in the same fashion as the others.I was at a party that was being held outside a friends house when this happend. There was at least 20 other people who saw the same thing that night.  My boyfriend and i were outside no longer then 10 minutes, when I looked up into the sky and saw these lights coming towards us.  At first, i thokught they might just be helicopters, but as the light`s got closer, i noticed there was no sound.  At this time, i asked my boyfriend to take a look into the sky to look at these lights.  The lights started out as a straight line, but as they got closer they looked as if they were trying to form a circle formation.  The whole time this was occurring, they seemed to be getting closer.  This formation also seemed as though it were floating downwards.  At this point, the lights hovered there at least 8 minutes.  After this...they just seemed to take off.....they reached such a high alttitude that you could see them disappear within mimutes.  In other word`s....they didn`t faze out like a flare would.  You could still see them for awhile,they went straight up...until they were no longer visible to the human eye.  It was not like an airplane that travels north, south, east or west...the light`s went straight up and then disapeared.  After about 5 more minutes, i looked up, and much to my surprise, i saw a new light.  This light was one light by itself.  It hovered for about 2 minutes and then ascended like the other lights did previously.  That same night i called the burbank airport police, to find out if they had witnessed anything unsual, and they said they had seen nothing out of the ordinary, ubt gave me the number to a UFO Hotline.  I called the Hotline the next day, and they gave me the number, of the Section Director for Mufon, a mutual UFO Network.  I had a meeting with this man a few day`s later.  At this meeting, i discoverd that there had been other sightings in california that same weekend.  The sad thing of this whole story is this....i only knew one of the people at this party, my boyfriend.  I had just! moved to california not too long before this happend.  The party was thrown by a girl i had just met a week after i moved out here.  i know longer know how to reach her.  One last thing....the time that this happend, there was infact an airplane that flew by this thing.  Th airplane was not as high as these light`s, but was very close to the lights.", "Sphere-shaped flashing lights around our tent.  When we got out, they were gone.  One did come into the tent and I got to see it very close up (approx. 1 foot away from my face.).  Completely the most unexplainable event of my life.This happened on the ground, not in space.  They were more like just abnormal lifeforms of some kind- not space crafts.  Approximately 6 sphere-shaped lights around the size of softballs.  The lights were different colours- 1 blue, 1 orange/red, 2 white, 2 yellow.  The spheres of light would appear and then dissapear (flashing-like).  I was very close to one of them and the light did not dissapear to any source, it was there and then would be gone after its flash.  At times they would flash as fast as a fast strobe light.  They also moved around as they flashed.  The best thing I could compare them to is glow bugs, except much brighter, much more faster flashing at times, and no source of light. If you have heard anything like this before or if you have any kind of information that you could tell me about this, please email me and let me know. If you would like me to go into the details more I will do that too.", "On a fall evening, after returning from a scout meeting I witnessed a object perform some extreemly unusual aerial feats, at at least plane flying level(low flying) along with 2 other witnesses, before vanishing from sight in a south-eastern direction.On the evening approx.6:00 pm Mid October(the 17th to my best recollection), 1986 in Bartlesville, OK. Myself, at the time 9 years old and my father(((deleted))at the time employed by ((company deleted))) stopped offlocal station(what brand of station I do not recall)on the way home from a scout meeting. As we were filling up, the attendant pointed out somthing unusual in the sky, at first could not see it but as I looked up in front of me facing a northern sky I saw a orangish-red colored object/craft. It stood out aainst the sky, it was shapped like a stretched nerf-football, almost ovular, but with cuved top and botton wich came to faded ends and surrounded by a arorea of light. At first the craft was in a vertical positon, and proceeded to move down very slowly at a relatively high altitude(I&apos;d dare a guess of 2-6 thousand feet up) then the craft, well,I guess the word is flipped or rotated into a horizontal postion in place, maintaing the same saucer/ovular shape. It then proceeded to very slowly move across the sky towards the north/east but in a line right across just as it had gone in a line staright down. Then suddenly it bolted of the east and was gone. The sky was relatively well lit as it was fall in that part of the country, and this whole event we witnessed for about 10 minutes. I have no idea how long the craft had been in the area or of other sightings. It made no noise, but all 3 of us concured it was like nothing we had ever seen. At first we thought it might be the exausht fire form a hot air ballon or some other plane, but when it did those manuevers, I knew of nothing and still do not that could do that. When it took off it bolted, I mean....just slightly slower than you can blink, so it went from crusing to that in nothing flat. I drew a picture when I got home, but do not have the original, both I and my  father told my mother about it upon arrival home. That is most of what I can recall of the event, although my father,myself,and the gas attendent are sure we saw some sort of craft-unlike anything I have seen. I have no idea what it was to this day. I have since moved(since 1989)back to where my parents are both originally from to California, and have lived in Redondo Beach for the past ten years.", "bright orange light steady from south to north30 seconds later same thing from west to east no noise no sonic boom.appeared to be well above normal incoming sfo flights.i was a crew chief on USAF jet fighters at Mcchord AFB     duringthe cuban missle crisis- I know a jet aircraft when I see one", "driving back from wv around 2am feeling very sleepy,i rolled windows down and radio up to stay awake..i seen a lightahead on left side as a looked closer(unuselly bright)i moved very fast past drivers door then around car and off to left...it was bright white and faster then then my eye....but it paused on left for sec.,cause i stopped in middle of road then it shot off very fast...about 1-2miles down i seen sign&quot;scotts air force base&quot;???????im 26yr fluid processer for federal mogel on business trip when sighting happened!", "Gigantic pulsating blue-green ball of light rose up over a ridge, hovered and then rose straight up at high velocity until out of sightWhile walking down a dark logging road with a friend at 4:30am in a rugged area of Snohomish county WA one summer night, we noticed a dim light high above on a ridge.  We thought at first that there was a car up there, but then became confused because of the strange way the light was acting. It kept growing stronger over a period of about 15 seconds.  We then thought maybe it was a helicopter, but there was a noise. Not even a noise really. I&apos;ve only been able to describe it as more of a vibration operating outside the range of human hearing. It seemed to have the properties of a very low cycle oscillation and a very high oscillation at once. It was very eerie. Anyway, as the light grew brighter (around 15 seconds elapsed so far) This gigantic blue-green ball appeared over the ridge. It seemed to shimmer and pulsate a blue-green light.  It was very bright and light up the valley(mountainous logging type area) we were in. It made the hair on the back of my neck stand up and tears well up in my eyes. It was clearly a gigantic glowing sphere. It hovered there for around a minute, it was about 1-2 miles and it wa huge. I&apos;m guessing at least 1/4 mile across. I mean, it was ridiculous. It lit up the entire area like day. After standing there in complete and utter awe of of this thing for around a minute saying things like, &quot;holy ((deleted))!&quot;, my friend and I began to run down the road in the direction of the sphere. Believe it or not, we were yelling,&quot;take us with you!&quot;. We got about 50 yards and the mammoth sphere started to rise straight upwards.  Its speed seem to increase at an exponential rate (slowly, then faster and faster). The time from the begining of it&apos;s accent until it was completly out of sight(on a partly cloudy night) was about 3-4 seconds. It moved very very fast the last second or so. It was very dis-appointing. For a moment we both thought we could make it up that ridge. I think I was in some variation of shock. It wasn&apos;t until the sun came up that I could really see how big the ridge was that it came over and the surrounding area. It was then that I concluded that it must have been about 1/4 mile wide. I was 19 when this happened, 29 now working at microsoft. :( This event has been on my mind for a long time, I think about it often. I went to alta-vista this evening and typed &quot;blue-green ball&quot;, and voila! here I am! Please take note that the date is really sometime in the summer of &apos;90", "I was looking off my balcony towards the east of Seattle by Issaqual and Renton, Wa.  at some airplanes flying in the distance by the power lines and out of the corner of my eye saw a round light appear out of nowhere about 500 yards or so above the hill I was looking by!!  It seemed like it would be very big because the diameter of the light I saw was big!  It appeared and I turned to focus on it and right when I began to focus in on it very good, it dropped straight down at a very fast rate and dissappeared behind the hill!  No explosion surprisingly!  That&apos;s all for now!See brief description.", "I saw some kind of craft about the size of a foot-ball field for about 10 seconds before it disappeared before my eyes. It was moving very slowly as if trying to hide in the clouds. I have drawn a picture that closely resembles it.The craft was light gray in color with port-hole like indentations slightly embeded into the edge but not windows or lights. The object was not bright at all. It was very dim and gray almost the same color as the clouds. The craft seemed to be trying to hide in the clouds.", "Not a UFO sighting but a mutilation report, head of mammal (elk?) spotted at wayside with precision skull cuts.I was driving west on I-90 and stopped off at the rest area just short of the Columbia.  At the edge of the parking area was what looked to be the head of an elk.  Little or no decomposition, flies present.  The top of the skull was removed by what on casual observation looked like 2 laser precise cuts exactly perpendicular from each other. No brain present.  Given the rather public and dramatic location, my first instinct was to think it was some kind of prank or satanic ritual.  But this layman considers the cuts (if produced by humans) could only occur with a high powered laser or a circular bone saw moved either by a precise lathe or someone with exceedingly steady hands.  Quite alot of trouble and expense for the job.  Laser perhaps not likely, as there was no burn marks on the bone. I didn&apos;t enjoy the sight nor the smell, so I made some mental notes and drove off.", "I just arrived home. It was about 7-7:30 PM. I was taking some items out of my van. I was facing north, stand at the back of my van. I looked up at the sky to see the stars. The  moon was full and to my right at a 2 O&apos;clock position. I did a double take, some the stars seem to be moving. I heald onto the van door and leaned back so I could look directly over head. There was about 24 points of light, the same as a star moving east to west directly over head. There were no flashing light on white light. They were in no pattern. They were speratic in the sky. They were moving at the same speed. Seemed to faster than a airplan. It no more than 5 min. or less to cross the sky.", "We saw a silver disc not moving at all at about 7,000 feet (estimate) and watched it for about 3 min.

The morming of the 24th. my wife and her sister and I drove up to the Phoenix area to visit a friend in Glendale. I had not seen him in 3 years since he moved to Arizona. We were in the back yard sitting by the pool and I was admiring the clear blue sky when I noticed the disc shaped object. We all saw it just hanging there and we all saw it leave at an incredible rate of speed. The next morning back in Tucson we also saw a missle test from White Sands that failed. The news had been broad casting info on the test so we got up at 4:00 am to watch, just thought I would throw that in even though it has nothing to do with the disc sighting.

White in color. No sound.as described above", "single very bright light green colored fireball traverses 40 degrees of the sky on south, downward-slanted trajectory, moved quite fast, but slower than meteors.  Unusual shade of green.  Object below fairly high broken overcast.At 0631 Hrs PST today, as I was traveling south on I-5 (in the Shoreline area), I observed a single very bright light green colored object traverse about 40 degrees of the sky.  The object  became visible to me as it came out from behind the roof of my car and hence became visible through the windshield.  It was traveling southward at what appeared to be a straight, downward course.  A rough estimate would be 20-30 deg below the horizontal. This clear very bight object moved quite fast, but slower than meteors I&apos;ve observed in the past.  neither have I seen anything quite this shade of green, although I have seen green fireballs or meteors before.  A fairly high broken overcast was made obvious by the Moon, and I believe this green object to have been below that overcast.  I did observe the normal air traffic in the sky such as airliners approaching Sea-Tac and traffic helicopter, etc.  These all were below the overcast.  When the green light from the object went out, it went out as often described: &quot;like a lightbulb being turned off.&quot; The things that distinguish this sighting in my mind are the clarity and exceptional brightness of the light from this object, the fact that it did not appear as a &apos;streak&apos; as other meteors I have seen did, but appeared as a clear, very bright object  (no discernable diameter), and that it seemingly was quite close tot he ground, - a couple of thousand feet at the most I would guess, (based on the cloud cover) and the sense was that it was quite lower than that.  And that it did not &quot;smear&quot; in my vision, but remained a clear single source of light with no trail, and that it moved at a speed that I preceived to be faster than aircraft, but slower than other meteors I&apos;ve observed. While I expect that what I saw was a meteor, and believe what I saw to be within the normal range of behaviors for such objects, it was nonetheless an unusual sight.", "nighttime sighting of a glowing green sphere passing above us as we emerged from the mountain tunnel.We were driving out of the Likelike tunnel on the Kaneohe side of the island and as we were coming down the mountain, a bright glowing lime green shaped sphere was passing over and above us. It was about the size of a Volkswagon bug, and it was approximately 100-200 yards above us. It didn&apos;t streak past us, but it did seem to be moving fast.  Then it just went out, like someone turned the light on it out.  I&apos;m pretty sure that other motorists must have also seen this.  It was hard to miss.", "I am a 59 year old self employeed female. Yesterday right before a severe thunderstorm coming out of the SW and headed toward the NE I was watching the cloud formations and a dark triangler shaped silhouette appeared just above the lower level of clouds. There were not details to be seen, it was more like looking up at a shadow! There was no sound. It appeared solid, maybe 25 to 30 feet wide at the base and maybe 50 feet long. It was moving directly east, not with the storm but across it.", "Rapidly moving lights in westerly direction, then disappearing.I observed 2 reddish colored lights in the sky, at about 70 degree angle, moving west.  The lights appeared to be at a high altitude.  They were moving at the same rate of speed, but one light was slightly ahead of the other.  Initially, it appeared as if there were two shooting stars moving beside each other, but whatever it or they were was moving slower than any shooting star I have observed yet much too fast to be an aircraft.  As I watched, both lights disappeared simultaneously, yet the travel path was still clear - in other words, if it were an airplane, it would have continued to have been observable.  It all occurred within about 10 seconds.  I can say that I have never seen anything like it before.", "saw craft over Wasach Mts. Shape of an egg. Desended behind Mts.

Event lasted nearly 5 minutes. Two minutes later, as I was still traveling south, directly in front of me at aprox. 45 degrees and aprox. 2000 feet up I witnessed an intense flash of light that sent off rays extending in all directions with the brightness of an arc welder.

We had been apprised of the upcoming launch, but had forgotten about the notification.))Orange light ascending, two pieces separating, then flying horizontally, very visible shock wave.At 0240 local time, in Andrade, CA (Where the California, Arizona, and Mexican borders meet) I saw an orange light rising in the western sky(about 290 degrees)leaving a trail of the same color.  At first it appeared to be a firework or flare.  But as I continued to watch, the light did not descend.  Instead it began to move horizontally to the south.  At this point I grabbed my binoculars, and I could see that in addition to the brightest object there were two dimmer objects with fading orange tails which had apparently separated from the main object, and were decelerating, descending, and dimming.  I assume they were boosters of some sort.  I continued to watch the brightest object, which now had what appeared to be a very prominent shock wave originating in front of it.  After maybe 30 seconds, the shock wave suddenly got much bigger, then dissipated as the object continued southbound.  The object seemed to accelerate at this point.  I watched the object until it was obscured by a nearby mountain.  The object never changed color, and once it began moving horizontally never seemed to change direction, and from my perspective did not appear to be climbing or descending.  I would estimate that it was visible for two or three minutes.  By the color, I believe that the glow must have been from friction with the atmosphere.  While I would guess that the object was of Earthly origin since it appeared to have take off from somewhere in California, it certainly was not any type of conventional aircraft I have ever heard of.  There was simply no reference for me to be able to estimate distance, speed, or altitude, but it was about 25 degrees above the horizon.  I don&apos;t know from how far away a shock wave - if that&apos;s what it was - would be visible with 7 power binoculars, but perhaps that would help estimate a rough maximum distance.  I am assuming that whatever it was must have taken off from Vandenburg AFB. But if that was the case, and it stayed over the Pacific (which it mst have, or it would have been in Mex! ican airspace) it would have been at least 150 miles away from me.

The airborne object(s) remained in one position for about 5 minutes then apparently rotated on center axis about 30-degrees clockwise, and remained there for about 10 minutes.  There were about 12 to 14 lights in all, and they appeared to be associated with one single object.  One set of lights, 2 to 3 in number, located on the left-side view-point rotated separately from the rest of the lights.  At approximately 19:00 the lights went out.

As an adult, the military has taught me to take on all challenges and to accept no fear, accomplish the mission. I am in my late forties and have done it all and seen it all.  Now before I die and leave this earth some day, somebody has to know this one little thing. I was about 7 and was in bed and the bright light flashed outside, so bright, the walls glowed. I covered up for a moment. Stuck my head out of the blanket and there was two things, big heads, large plate black eyes, slight glow looking dead at me. I hid in the blankets terrified for about 5 minutes, peaked out...they had their face right in my face. I have seen a lot of death and destruction in my military career, more than you can ever imagine, but this one childhood experience with this unknown thing lurking around my bedroom is the most frightening.", "An orb of orange/yellow light that pulsated or dimmed then brightened period of about a secondDriving to work at about 4:30am on 4/27/99 I noticed a strange light quite a distance ahead of me.  At first I thought it was commercial aircraft, but I soon realized that it was not because it was a single orb of orange/yellow light that pulsated and remained stationary.  I knew it wasn&apos;t a copter because copters have more than one light and they don&apos;t pulsate. I continued looking at this thing and soon approached it, but it still did not move and continued to pulsate.  This event probably occurred in about 5 minutes time since I was traveling at about 40 mph. I continued to look back after I passed it, and it continued its strange behavior.", "Large yellow orange fireball gliding across the sky ejected a small fireball straight down beneath it.Early November I witnessed an object gliding across the night sky moving SE across Mesa, AZ. It appeared to be a yellow orange fireball with a medium tail trailing behind moving faster than an aircraft going away from me.  The angle from horizon to overhead was 70 degrees when I spotted it. As it moved towards the horizon and got farther away, what appeared to be another very small round fireball was ejected straight down beneath this object and appeared to burn up and tnen disappeared as it separated a distance below the larger object.  The larger object continued on its path for a few minutes until at about 20 degrees from the horizon it suddenly disappeared.  It instantly vanished as quick as you could snap your fingers.  The object made no movements other than a straight glide across the sky and was bright making it clearly visible.  As I am involved with astronomy I am certain it was not a meteor, comet or a satellite burning up in the atmosphere because those objects move rapidly through it and the burn rate is quite quick.  A comet that close would have caused destruction as this object was in the lower level of the atmosphere.  Since the object made no sound at all which it would have that close it was not a meteor. Additionally the object moved too slow for a meteor or comet or satellite. It was not an aircraft in trouble because the object moved too fast with no sound. The shape was definitely a compact ball! I have checked various professional astronomy resources and have received no explanations as yet. The object appeared to be too low to have skipped off or grazed the atmosphere and then back out into space.

(location viewed ontwo following nights, clear sky - Bright Moon and Venus)  The object sighteddid not appear to be a celestial object - as there were 6 distinct lights(blue and red) that rotated in a fixed position around a central point.  At2200hrs CST - Venus appears @ 40 degrees in the northwest sky relative tothe position of my initial sighting out the back window of our house.  Theobject was about 20 degrees further north of Venus&apos;, and at 80 degreesheight.My husband is a private pilot and he was UNABLE to see the object at hisworkplace that is 10 miles north of my position.  Given that the colors ofthe object were &quot;blue and red&quot; - my husbands initial thought was that thesemight be position lights as those found on aircraft.  During the sighting,he asked me to describe several things while I looked at the object; anystobe lights, rotating beacons, visible appendages, angular or velocitymovements, the direction of rotation of the objects lights, whether afuselage was visible, the depth of colored lights, their intensity, andwhether I could hear a source of propulsion.  I talked with him on the phoneas I watched the object along with my children.   I am certain that this wasnot a celestial body or swamp gas.There was an atmospheric event in the form of a severe thunderstorm withtops at flight level 55 about 30 miles to the north of Pflugerville at thetime of the sighting.   (my husband,((name deleted)), is is writing this for me -again - asking me questions)By the way - on a light note.  My four year old daughter, ((name deleted)), isconvinced that the object sighted was the &quot;magic school bus&quot; of PBS fame.She thinks that &quot;they&quot; were studying the stars.I am in Oregon for the next few days visiting family, having flown up hereThursay (5/27) morning.You can reach me at 541-((deleted)).If you call us there, you can speak with four witnesses - myself (34), myson ((deleted))(deleted), my son ((deleted)) (age deleted), and my daughter ((name deleted)) (age deleted)).

Saw craft through binoculars. Speed near Mach 3-4. Craft seemed to self-illuminate. Daylight.I was sitting outside my studio in the sun reading a magazine. After a while I put it aside and leaned back looking at the blue sky with some great clouds moving around in no particular direction. I wore Vuarnet Skilynx sunglasses which has a deep yellow filter that enhances the sky beautifully. Half an hour later I discovered two dark objects floating upwards on the distant sky to the north. I brought out my binoculars (Bushnell 10x50 wide angle, 341 ft at 1000 yrds) and could see two sets of three black dots that seemed to &quot;dance&quot; upwards on the sky. Figured in the end that these must have been some kind of balloons. As I was following these objects with my binoculars there was suddenly something that streaked across my field of vision. Something bright. I quickly followed the &quot;thing&quot; with my binoculars and managed to keep my eye on it for 7-8 seconds. It looked like some sort of silver colored self-illuminated craft that was shaped like a wedge, and it had darker flowing lines running along the ... fuselage. Front to back. The front end was pointed and the rear was somewhat rounded. It looked like a formstudy from design school. Furthermore it had no visible wings. Nor did it give any exhaust. There was no sound from the craft. The color was silvery and shiny - even with the sun behind it. It lacked normal shadows. The speed I can only estimate to Mach 3-4. Maybe somewhat faster. It flew in a straight line from north to south. Its altitude was around 10.000 to 15.000 feet. It eventually went behind some clouds, but did not come out on the other side. My location was 1/2 mile north of Atlanta Waterworks on Antone Street, and the event took place west of me. I have also submitted a recreation of the event in a photo-digital format to the UFO Reporting Center.", "while looking toward the east we noticed a bright starand upon further examination we noticed that it changed colors from red to green and back to bright light.we also looked at this object with binoculars but were unable to figure out what we had seen. it was still present at 2100 hrs when we went to bed.((NUFORC Note:  Possible twinkling star.))", "A &quot;UFO&quot; was erratically flying in the sky circling an object, when it shot a light and destroyed the object.I was walking to the pool area, and I had bug repellent on.  I sat down in a chair, and looked up.  I was looking at the stars, but two stars imparticular.  At first, I thought it was an airplane, but it was moving so erratically, that no airplane could move like that.  I just watched it circle this one star, and then, I saw a faint yellow flash out of the circling (not circled) &quot;UFO&quot;, and there was a clear enough flash that it lit up a portion of the sky, and the circled &quot;star&quot; disappeared.  Then I saw a blue vortex-ish shape near the remaining &quot;UFO&quot;, and I saw the &quot;UFO&quot; head toward the &quot;vortex&quot; and it too disappeared with the &quot;vortex&quot;.", "three points of light in the shape of triangle slowly moved across the sky.starting 20 degrees over the northwest horizon, three points of light in an equilateral triangle. the slowly moved in formation towards the zenith, with stars visible in the middle of the triangle. the three lights were steady, no blinking. after reaching the zenith, they slowly faded out. total duration maybe 5-7 minutes. i was a technician at the williams college astronomical observatory, two other technicians saw the event.", "four points of bright white light flying erraticly from east to westMe and my brother were catfishing on the fox river just before a storm was pushing in when I looked to the north I noticed four bright white lights flying erraticly(not in a strait line ,kind of up down left right) we had dark clouds as a backdrop so they seemed realy bright.there are trees on both sides of the river so the sighting didnt last long and the objects were too far away to distinguish any shape. Im no aviation  expert or anything but they didnt fly like or appear like any aircraft Ive ever seen. I was  kind of hopeing someone else may have contacted you with the same sighting to confirm it", "me and my freinds were looking to the north and i seen it and told them to turn around and look and they looked back and saw it and they saw this light it was comin down at a angle it looked almost like a comet but it was to close to the earth for it to be a comet or it we thought it may of been space debreea very bright light with a tail behind it the tail was white the ball it self had a little bit of red and green in it", "I was in bed and I saw this bright light outside! Turned out to be a UFO!It was a chevron-shaped craft and had glowing patterns like lizard shapes in green light .  It was right outside my window!!  Then I stuck my head out the window and it flew away FAST!!!!!!", "A red &amp; green light streaked across the sky, south of Osuna, from East to West then dissappeared.I work swing shift and often go out onto the patio for my breaks.  I often observe the sky.  This time I was looking to the south past our building (the patio is on the northwest corner of the building) and saw something streak across the sky.  I first noticed it when it was &quot;above&quot; the building, it streaked out into the open &quot;to the west of the building&quot; and dissappeared.  It moved and dissappeared like a meteor but it was red in front and green in back.  It was totally silent.  I don&apos;t know how far away it really was but our building is two stories high and the patio is aproximately 75feet deep.  I know it wasn&apos;t a plane, helicopter, or owl.  I&apos;d think it was a shooting star except for the colors.  I knew it was something unusual so I noted the time.", "Iwas abducted around age 7 or 8. They came will I WAS Asleep. they look into my room from the hall. They took me to a room. I think they placed an implant behind my left ear and brung me back home.On this night of this abduction I was only 7 or 8 yrs old. The reason I have not said any thing for so long I have tryed to put this off as a bad dream. But the more research I done the more I would remember about my own abduction. It happened on a school night I was asleep in my room. We had old wood floors in our house that would squeek when you walk across it. And while I was sleeping that is what I heard. was the floor squeeking. I look at the door to my bedroom and (saw what I believe now where 2 gray ailen&apos;s)looking at me. I yelled for my dad.  And he found nothing or no one around and informed me if I woke him up anymore I was in deep trouble. Well they came back and stood looking at me from the hallway. I was so scared, I can not remember anytime in my life being so scared. They took me to a room with a table. Look like an operation room. I assume this is on their ship. I don&apos;t recall seeing a ship. But they took me to this operating room. There were three ailens there. One looked like a doctor or the one in charge. he was a littel taller than the others. It look like he had an assitant. And their was an ailen tring to calm me down. I was in a hysteria of fear. I was crying and screaming for my dad. And the ailen that was trying to calm me down just look at the others as if it didn&apos;t know what to do. Shortly after this a person came out that look like my dad and I calm down. But I was still very scared. They rolled me onto my right side and did something behind my left ear. I believe it could be an implant behind my ear. As soon as the operation was over they brung me back to my bedroom and the person that look like my dad told me &quot;don&apos;t play with that behind your ear untill you get up in the morning&quot;. I have not had any contacts scince. No any other memories of any such activity. I hope this helps. I hated it happening to me and I hope it dosen&quot;t happen to anyone else. But I know it dose. thats why I finaly said something.", "Three low,silent craft hovering,looping over each other,flaring huge,bright,then fly head-on near-collision course.VideotapedDriving on Lake Avenue in Stillwater I and another witness saw a brightly lit silent craft hovering, then moving very slowly just over the trees. I pulled my car over and began videotaping. It was lit from underneath, an intense yellow-orange solid light, round or oval, and with a smaller light above sometimes visible revealing a dark unlit mass above the light.                                                   I drove a little further to get a view unobstructed by the bare tree branches,then drove again to get closer. I knew I was close to Flike Road where I had videotaped a dramatic sighting on December 18th,and it was a safer road to stop on,so I sped there.                            Just as I turned the corner we saw the craft heading slowly away from us,and loop directly over another similar craft. The higher craft&apos;s bright light showed more clearly an unlit upper section of the craft that passed beneath. This maneuver brought them dangerously close to each other,and the lower craft&apos;s altitude was less than fifty feet, the other not much higher. The one craft was so low, lower than the tops of trees it passed behind, I thought it may have been on the ground, or possibly coming up from the nearby Hudson River. I pulled a little closer. One craft seemed to change into a flat triangle with multiple warm lights and traveled more quickly, moving off to the west. I believe that these craft can sit upright to hover and move very slowly, like a rocket does when lifting off. Instead of a rocket engine it seems to be balanced over a glowing globe which could be its source of lift or propulsion. I think these craft can lower themselves from upright to a horizontal attitude, which reveals them to be triangular or near triangular with a slightly rounded back end. They travel faster in a more direct line in this position. However, it&apos;s the nose of the triangle that seems to be the bright round light, which leads me to think that when they sit upright (or at least at a 45 degree angle) t! hey may be sitting on the nose rather than the back end. As the one passed behind the trees there was a second smaller light visible above the main light but at an angle, resembling a tipped cone or party hat drifting slowly sideways. It could also be sitting upright on its nose but with the third point unlit or unseen from my vantage point. Then, a third craft rose up from the trees to the right, across a field. It seemed triangular, brightly lit underneath, casting a diffuse beam of light before it. It traveled east towards the remaining craft and as they got closer they, too, looped one over the other. It was a strange, silent aerobatic maneuver, but graceful. To see it performed twice, minutes apart, and involving three different craft, was startling. The craft were all drifting to the south, so I drove to follow, losing sight of them for a few minutes.I pause the tape. When I turned the corner onto George Thompson Road I saw one hovering over a cornfield and began filming again. As soon as I turned on my hazard lights and got out of the car it bagan to flare incredibly brightly, like a yellow-orange flame with an aura around it, like it was burning, on the videotape it seems more white than it did to the naked eye. It also seemed to get much bigger,as large as the moon, and totally round. It was larger and brighter than anything I&apos;ve ever seen in the night sky besides a full moon. It may have come quite close to us, and I&apos;m a little concerned about that, I&apos;ve heard accounts of UFO witnesses being affected by radiation. To some that may sound a little far-fetched, but I guarantee you&apos;d feel the same if you were there with us. After a minute it started to move away from us, and then was clearly a flat triangular craft. As I continued filming it travel west over Route 67, we saw a second tria! ngle come into view going east. They were on a collision course,one was higher than the other and they even adjusted their altitudes to head right for one another, nose to nose. I expected one to veer off as they got closer but they didn&apos;t,they came closer than the width of either craft, literally feet from colliding head-on. We both thought they had collided until they passed each other. It was unbelievable, and I was thrilled to have this, any of this really, on videotape.Then the east bound craft turned around to follow the other and they flew out of our sight. I have sent a copy of this tape to Mr. Davenport and the NUFORC in Seattle.", "2 lights on the left and 4 lights on the right. all golden in color and same intensity heading at 330`.I go outside and let the dog do it&apos;s thing and look up and see these lights going overhead, quietly. Then as I keep looking at them, I notice a color of golden lights. I have always seen strobs and green and red, but, never just one color no matter how high in the sky. Ok, the altitude probably was about 2000 or 3000 but that as they passed me they split as 2 lights to the left and 4 on the right and keeping the same altitude they seemed to just pass at the same speed into the distance. Because it was black in the sky I could not see craft or size of object. Just the lights. They probably were on the rear of the craft and wing trails. Seeing many aircraft coming to wilmington international airport this was a first for me. I also see a lot of aircraft possibly going up the coast to camp legune nc. In this day and time I don&apos;t know if this is some kind of US aircraft of ufo. I just haven&apos;t heard you or Art or anyone speak of any kind of craft with only Gold lights. Thank You and I will try and send you other info.", "Traveling in a pick up truck, we saw a bright glowing green disk fly over us.  It made the engine &amp; electrical of the truck stop immediately as it flew overhead.  After it passed over us the truck started back up.We were on vacation, late at night, in the desert between Albuquerque and Arizona, headed west on the highway.  From the north a large round disk flew over us, not very high.  The whole thing was lit up with a weird green color (like phosphurescent).  We looked out at it, and as it passed over us the truck stopped all by itself.  It would not start again until the disk had passed over.  I think the whole thing took about five minutes, because it was moving slowly.  We saw one disk.  There was four of us.  At that time I was 14, my brother was 8.  My father and mother were with us.", "2 sightings of apparently the same triangular object, moving above tree level at a very slow rate of speed with only a dull humMy boss and I were working late painting the interior of a house. I stepped outside for a cigarette and heard a strange dull humming. For a second I thought it might have been the sub pump in the basement kicking on, but then I realized the sound was coming from above the trees. I looked up and thought I saw a large commercial aircraft (at least the size of a 737) in trouble (because it was so low). Then I realized I should have heard much more noise than I did, and that it seemed to be moving below &quot;stall speed&quot; for a craft this size. It looked like a equilateral triangle with three white lights at each acute angle. I watched it glide overhead and leave. About an hour and a half later, when my boss and I went to get in his car and leave, I heard the noise again. He asked me, &quot;what the hell is that&quot; and just like in a bad alien flick I said, &quot;they&apos;re back!&quot; Whoever &quot;they&quot; were, I don&apos;t know. But the object passed right over our heads, which I guessed was only 120 ft. in the air. It looked like a solid black or dark triangle. Another unsubstantiated sighting (or a folie a deux) to some, a mind-bender for me and my boss.", "As a student of astronomy, this writer witnessed ufo&apos;s performing astounding aerial maneuvers. Silent propulsion. Technical performance could NOT be duplicated by anything flying today. Also witnessed by two adult relatives. Clear, cloudless skies. No obstructions. No reflections. Not birds. Not insects. Glowing &quot;metallic&quot; discs or spheres.While working with star maps in by own backyard, in the summer of 1950, when I was 9 years old, I noticed a glowing object approaching at moderate speed, high altitude, from the west. It got my attention because it was completely silent. As I watched, the object (a warm colored sphere or disc seen from the bottom) was about to cross my zenith when it came to a complete and abrupt stop. There was no time between when it was moving and when it stopped. As there was no sound, I knew I wasn&apos;t seeing high altitude helicopters. And there were no silent &apos;copters back then! I was exteremely mistified as to what I was seeing. I would estimate the altitude to be anywhere from 15 to 30,000 feet. As I watched, another object of the same exact size and colr approached the first, coming from the east, at exactly 180 degrees. When the second object reached my zenith, it too came to a complete and abrupt stop. Both objects hung there in complete silence for moments. I would estimate that the distance between them was approximately twenty diameters (twenty craft diameters). I have no way of estimating the craft dimensions as there was no reference whatsoever for comparison. I can only use my sixth sense. As I continued to watch, the two objects began traveling in a small, tight circle, orbiting one another. First slowly, but quickly accelerating. I was alarmed and called for my parents. My father and my grandmother came out. I pointed the objects out. They had no idea what they were seeing. By this time, the objects were moving so fast that they appeared as a hard-edged glowing ring in the sky! We watched with our jaws dropping. Moments later, the two objects slowed and came to a stop again, hovering in the same place they started. Moments later, one object moved off to the west, and the other to the east. They disappeared into the horizon. Neither made a sound. They flew in mechanically straight lines, not wavering or drifting, but with absolute perfection one could &quot;feel.&quot; The incident lasted several minutes. We checked the news reports for days afterward but never saw anything. Many yaers later, in a publication similar to Project Blue Book, I came across a reference to a similar sighting by two brothers in Ohio. They described the spinning/orbitting objects as looking like &quot;Two bright dots on the edge of a spinning record. But what I saw was spinning not at 33 or 45 or even 78 rpm - more like 400 rpm. These were not insects or birds. This was not a meteorological phenomenon. As a young student of astronomy I knew the difference between a celestial object and a manufactured object. I was aware of news reports of &quot;flying saucers&quot; in those days, but had never heard of Roswell, though this was a mere few years later. I consider myself to be a rational, scientifically-minded individual, perhaps even more so as a child.", "UFO with single bright flashing light flew very fast and very low over horizon .When looking out of an upstairs window as it was just begiining to get dark, my father and I noticed a cigar shaped object with a single flashing light at it&apos;s center, moving quickly in an Easterly direction across a barren horizon to the North - East (?) of the house.  At first we assumed it to be a vehicleuntil we realised that it was actually slighty above the ground and that there was no road below anyway.  It quicly moved out of view.  I would estimate we were viewing the object from about three miles away, and from that distance it appeared to be roughly two inches long .", "I was in my driveway and I happened to look up and I saw a bright ball of light pass overhead , very low. It first made me think of a comet but it had no tail following it and it stopped in mid flight and blinked out, then it reappeared and got really bright (Venus was is the sky behind me, so I know it wasn&apos;t it,but it looked like it) it moved slowly across the sky, very low ! It moved slowly up and it was kind of blinking and as I watched it went out completely. I never looked away or even blinked my eyes!! It was not a plane changing directions or anything that I have ever seen before. It made me uncomfortable enough that as soon as it disappeared  I felt scared and ran into my house.the object I saw was a ball of light with a fog or haze around it , it seemed to fly silently and low to the ground, it had no tail or trail behind it. It stopped , hovered and then blinked out only to reappear in the same spot where it stayed still and became brighter than it had been at first then it moved very slow sort of blinking , bright to almost out, then after about 10 seconds it blinked out completely. It was the size of  a Basketball when it first flew over me then when it blinked out and came back it was the size of Venus, only it no longer had the haze around it.", "i was out cuting the grass and on the lawnmorer and looked up and saw 2 sphere&apos;s race across the sky. i cant explane it but they where as big as a house.they where gone within 2 min. of me seeing them.the objects where bright a bright silver and did&apos;nt leave a trail.please reply back if you have herd of this before. i have been seeing ufo&apos;s for 8 years now.", "we were driving north on hwy 101 from san luis obispo to atascadero, when from the west came a &quot;ufo&quot; traveling east, passing over the hwy approximatly three tellaphone lengths off the ground.

I never heard anything back after that, they probably just got a nice laugh about it, Oh well, It did happen.i did in the last box. full description in last box", "It was late at night, and I was up to my usual again, listening to Art Bell, looking for things in the sky. I had &quot;One of those feelings&quot; and was hoping to see something. I got my binoculars just in case. At exactly midnight, I spotted a very slow moving starlike object moving beside the planet in the sky, probably Venus. It was not blinking, too slow for a shooting star, wasn&apos;t traveling in a elliptical path, so it was unidentifiable. It moved down the sky for about 20 seconds before fading out of view. It was white in color. At 12:14, I see another starlike object in the sky, this one is more blue with the same characteristics as the last object. It moved at a 5 degree slope in the sky upward very slowly (slightly west) for about 1 and 1/2 minutes before stopping, and headed straight east at a 90 degree from its last position before moving out of view behind the clouds. 22 minutes later, it was back again for about 20 seconds and headed straight up before fading out of view again.I would have had witnesses, had my step-dad not been called to work 15 minutes before. My mom had also just laid back down to go back to sleep, and I had just got off of the phone with my girlfriend. If my mom wasn&apos;t permanentely disabled I would have got her up to see em&apos;, but I didn&apos;t want to wake her. I would have had physical evidence if a regular 35mm camera could take good pictures of the night sky, but I couldn&apos;t even see the planet that was out in the view lenses. So I decided since this is the second sighting I&apos;ve had this year alone (last was on March 3, I think I reported it to you) I am going to buy a video camera as to prove that I am not having hallucinations nor am I crazy. Also, this was the second time this year I asked my Father and Creator Yahweh for a sign from the sky and I got one. There is indeed a spiritual connection there.....", "4:45am while going to work had the camera with me noticed a very bright and pulsateing object headed strait for me this all happened in about no more then 30 sec. but I did catch the last 5 sec. on film that Im sending you.

I was video Tapeing a paper machine rebuild where I worked at the time. This was the reason  I had my vidio camera with me. As I was going to work that early morning. It was crystal clear and about 4:45 am. I was walking out my door with my vidio camera in the case. From my doorway looking straite west  ruffly 5 mile there is a large hill we call Irma hill, known for the small villiage on the west side of the hill. From my location I had  a very excellent view to the western horizon with the hill slightly outlineing the it, the horizen.. As I was closing the door to lock it I noticed a very bright shineing object directly over  Irma hill coming directly towards me. It was round and very bright and pulsating. I knew right away it was not a star, planet, or plane. When I   When I was younger I was into Astronmany, had my own telescope and farmilier with the nightly skies. It was much more brighter then the planet venius at its brightess point and at its dimmest point of pulsastion hardly visiable. I stared in almost disbelife ruffly 3 or 4 seconds, then reliseing I had my vidio camera with me I quicly as possible bent down and opend the case grabbing  my camera and pulling lens cover off also turning the power on I would estimate this took no more the 7 to 8 seconds being very familiar with my camera. I looked towards Irma hill where I observed the objedt but no longer could see it anymore I quickly looked straite up over me and spotted the object moving very fast in a easterly direction. I brought the camera up and foud it in my view finder and caught it on tape as it went away from me and disapeared. I stood there in complete disbelife asking myself what the hell was that...It took no more then 25 to 30 seconds from the time ! I spotted in the western horixon to disaphere at about a 35 diagree angle in the eastern horizon. When it was straite overhead before I could get the camera on it, the brightness was almost shiney and crome like. there  was absoluity no noice from the object. There was no wind and it was one of them mornings it was perfectly dead quite. The only thing you could here was early morning robbins. Ive had this tape all this time and over the years showed a few friends no one else has realy seen it yet.

The siting was unusual enough that I expected a huge noise and/or the entire town of Centerville,WA to explode upon impact .Instead the thing vanished...I assume that I saw one hell of a meteor(and as you are aware ,we had a spectacular meteor siting about a month ago here...)or a saucer crash .I would love to know if anyone else was lucky enough to see what I saw.My horses were compelled enough to stop eating their alfalfa and look behind them at the light that the object threw.

The UFO flew 500ft. under a Fed Ex MD11 wide body jet descending to land on glide path.  The Fed Ex MD11 was flying just under 200mph to south.  UFO traveling same speed to north east.  Could not be an aircraft banking or a mylar type balloon due to shape and size viz. 1/3 to 1/2 the size of the MD11.  Also, UFO did not behave as a balloon or kite i.e flapping, waving or oscillaing in wind.  UFO flew straight, level trajectory at approx. 1,000ft. and disappeared above a tree line to the north east.  As UFO passed by and the angle changed, I could see that it was definitely spherical but disk-shaped.  Also, the brilliance of the reflection did not change as the angle to sight changed.

I live in Arkansas and traffic at the time of night is virtually non-existent. I happened to glance up at the horizon and saw 3 lights. I thought that my eyes were playing tricks on me because it looked like the object was hovering over the interstate. I sped up from about 65 mph to 75 mph and realized that indeed the object was hovering, well not exactly hovering because it kept up with me. I got to the point that it was directly overhead of me, about lined up with the tree line. Then it sped up and curved off into a field and begin to sink lower and lower until it was concealed by the trees. The object was in the shape of a triangel with lights at all three points. At the tip of the triangle there was a red light and then 2 white lights on both sides of the base. I was able to see its shape once it had moved on to the field and it was flat. A flat triangular object. This shocked me. I reported it to the sheriffs office and I probably should have reported it to the air traffic controller but didn&apos;t think about it until later. I also saw several other triangular looking objects in the sky but I wasn&apos;t sure if these were the same type of craft because they were furthur in the distant and looked to be a lot bigger than the first. The first was very small and very, very close to the ground. The others were higher up and looked to be much larger but the same shape. Thanks", "It was short and brief..it was a sphere I saw and what got me the most was the color...it was like an electric blue colored sphere. There one minute, clear as anything... then gone the next right in front of my view. It was about 300 ft. away but I&apos;m guessing... I remember it was close.It was about 11:30 at night,around there...and two of my friends and I were in this little gazebo just talking and hanging out. I remember my friend was sitting next to me and she was looking at my other friend sitting across from she and I...I had briefly looked up in front of me before turning to her and that&apos;s when I saw this sphere like shape ap in the sky. It wasn&apos;t too far away but it was close enough for me to see that it was an electric blue color- that color I can&apos;t forget cause it was bright for that one brief minute and then it was gone...At first I thought maybe it was a meteorite,and I&apos;m not ruling that out, but it was slightly bigger than  what I&apos;ve seen when we&apos;ve had meteorite showers around here...", "One large white orange to gold roundish, Looked like incoming meteor at first then slowed and did a slow complete circle up and around and down again!! Stoped and waffled alittle and was joined by 6 or so smaller orbs of light..on every 1/2 sec or so just above each other in a sequence..blinked slowly on and off then moved slow in formation one after another to tthe right and changed shape and then faded slowly .I was walking my daughter home in the early evening....as we approched the long drive in to her mothers apartment complex we saw what looked like a meteor..very large and beautiful if a bit slow. I thought .. a comet?? But it was goldish and throwing a long orangish trail of sparks...then it did a slow upward swirl and I just about lost it...We had to move 30 ft or so with our view blocked by trees untill we reached the driveway where we saw it again and this confimed that it was quite distant and not a kite or somethig close by. Two other people shouted...Can you see it?? What the heck is it??? We hurred up to join them looking about 15 degrees about the SE horizon into 98% darkend sky. The object was waffleing to and fro fading in and out geting larger and then smaller. It is hard to say how large but I would estimate at least fifty feet or so in diameter.. maybe much larger. It was whitish to gold..mostly gold or amber. after about 30 sec or so just above the first object a smaller by 1/5 or so light appeared just for a sec followed by another just above it and then another and another...about 6 in all additional smaller lights. It was compleatly in sinc one after another in a stack above the large object. They then twinkled a little and moved one at a time of to the right each one further than the previous changing shape near the end of travel into a kind of oblong fluidlike blob and slowly fading out. This was I guess 2min or so and they twinkeled and swirlled around and took off...fading as they went. We saw the strobes of approaching aircraft(conventional) moving in from the west...and that was it.", "The object flew directly overhead, from south to north.

Both were green in color.They seemed to be conected at a certain length and i knew that by the speed it was going and its altitude it was pretty big.I was about to go to sleep when I saw this object fliying at a slow speed. I was curius because it seemed to be an airplane going at a low altitude so i went outside to see if it was going to land nearby. Once I was outside I noticed the object wasnt at a low altitude and that it was bigger than I had thought. I called my brother and sister. The object seemed to have two lights on each end and it was going at a north-eastern direction. It was at about the altitude of a normal cloud. The light on the left was blinking every second and the light on the right  was just on. They were both green lights.", "ufo was a triangle, approx. 100 Yds each side, approx. 50 feet thick. 1st view from side..several minutes..2nd/3rd view underneath 15 minutes.I was 30 Years old with wife and 2 step brothers, a step sister and their neighbor. My name is Dave Oblad, an electronics Engineer. My wife was 28, also Wendel (15yrs), Darcy (13Yrs), Karl (9Yrs) and a friend of the family (15yrs). The kids where spending the weekend with us. We had gone out for burgers about 6:30Pm. I saw a cigar shaped object on the north east horizon. Thought it was smoke but was too straight and perfect. After a bit, it became evident that it was moving towards Hacienda Heights. I decided to go see what it was. We left the burger place and went to fullerton road, north of La Habra that goes over the heights. We had lost sight of the object within minutes of heading towards it, the ufo having passed into the heights. When we got into the heights, the sun had set and we cruised the roads looking for it. We were about to give up and head home when we came around a bend and it was nearly overhead. I stopped the car and we got out. It was about 100 feet over head. At first I thought it was a big hang glider. We could not see any detail, but the shape was high lighted against the overcast sky, the clouds were lighted from underneath via the city lights of orange county and pomona. The size became apparent when we thought it would crash into a tree and instead passed behind and well over the tree. There was 2 white lights at the rear wing tips and a dull red light at the front center, but not so close to the front tip as the whites on wings. It made ZERO noise and I estimate it&apos;s speed to be about 10 mph. It was going against the mild wind heading west. It passed over the top of a hill, so we jumped back into the car and followed the road around the hill, turned right onto a westward street where we saw it again. The road didn&apos;t stay under it, so we got out again and watched as it slowly headed for Los Angles over the Hacienda heights. Before flying over any city, it BANKED right and headed north. We couldn&apos;t see it after it went into some hills just east of LA. From the heights we can see most of orange county and a lot of LA. I thought at the time we had seen a very strange shaped blimp. I supported the idea that it was some kind of USA experimental blimp/wing glider with very quiet muffled engines. My main reason is that it BANKED and was taking advantage of normal airflight via wings and banking. Most ufo&apos;s we had heard about never seemed to care about air or gravity etc. Anyway...It was a UFO because we had never seen anything like it before or since..until recently on the news. I am a VET, Engineer and Programmer with an IQ of 154. No mistake in what we saw. We went back home and called the police. They said no one else had reported it and that they would take care if it (what ever that means). So we see each other on occasion and we still don&apos;t know exactly what it was. End Report. ((name deleted))", "This was the second time within 10 days that these &quot;Fire-Cigars&quot; was seen above Malmoe city. The first time (on the 20th of November 98) a 12 year old kid &amp; his friend videofilmed it, and it was shown on both Swedish &amp; Danish TV.This event took place in my hometown, Malmoe Sweden on the 1st of December 1998. I was on my way to a friend and the time was 15:50. I sat down in my car and as I drove out of our driveway I saw something strange in the sky wich I have never seen before, so I stopped and got out of the car. There wasn&acute;t a cloud in the sky so it was hard NOT TO SEE!!! There were 3 cigar shaped &quot;fire-tails&quot; moving slowly and for all that I could hear, silently across the sky above Malmoe. Travelling slowly and tilting to the side, travelling across &quot;oresund&quot; (the sea between Sweden &amp; Denmark) and then vanishing from my sight above Copenhagen, Denmark after approximatly 20 minutes. The distance between me &amp; the UFO&acute;s Was at the closest, 3km. They travelled in a pack of 3, but there was approximatly a couple of 100 meters between them at all times. As this was wintertime the sun was descending at this time, and the sky was coulored red &amp; orange as usual, but these three objects had a different &quot;fire&quot; coulor wich stood out in the sky. This event took place near 2 major airports. Usually there are lot&acute;s of air traffic around and above Malmoe/Copenhagen, but during this event there were no airplanes in the air as far as I could see. On the sighting on the 20th of November 1998, the TV-station contacted the airport &amp; the police, and neighter of them could explain the sighting. I ordered and recived a copy of the TV-intervju with the video of the event on the 20th of Nov, after my own sighting and its great fotage. The adress &amp; name of the TV-station follows: TV((information deleted)).", "I SAW 4 SPHERE CRAFTS CLOSE TO TUSTIN HOSPITAL. 3 WERE CLOSE TO THE GROUND,1 WAS HIGH IN THE AIR.

WHEN THE OTHER 3 TOOK OFF, THEY ALL WERE GONE. THE WHOLE TIME THERE WAS NO SOUND AT ALL. THIS ALL TOOK ABOUT FIVE MINUTES.", "Oval shaped craft travelling e-w n/w, NO clearance or blinking lights seemed to be illuminated from inside. The color was ivory or yellowish with dark spots that appeared to be portholes(??).My wife and I were standing outside looking up and to the south when I noticed an odd oval illuminated flying object travelling east to west or n/west, it was moving slightly faster than what one would expect of say a commercial airliner. The object started to pass &quot;behind&quot; the tree in our front yard and we both ran out front. Within 3 seconds we were out front clear of the tree but the object had completely disappeared?!No sign or trace, there were many aircraft, stars were CLEARLY visable and it was/is a VERY clear night. There was NO mistaking that this object was NOT a commercial or military aircraft of any type. The closest thing in shape and size would be a &quot;blimp&quot; but it was moving too fast and it completely disappeared, plus the fact that it had no clearance or blinking lights lights. The object was also totally w/o sound, my wife said she heard it but the sound I think she heard was a passing car...I think??", "((NUFORC Note:  We have other dramatic reports on file about this incident.  At least 7 vehicles stopped on I-25 to look at an object estimated to be &quot;as long as a football field.  One teenager is reported to us to have been so upset by the event, that he was taken to a hospital emergency room for treatment.  A senior engineer at JPL in Pasadena, CA, was witness to this event, as well.The object was reported by the press to be a &quot;meteorite.&quot;  We believe this to be a severely flawed conclusion.))Thought it was a plane coming FROM the SE (moving NNW), it moved at a very regular plane-like speed.  Felt it might have been a military or civilian plane coming to a smooth CRASH.  But it was apparent it was a BIG plane and going too fast to make such a maneuveur without hitting I-25.  There is only a small airport in SFE and it was not headed there. Pulled over on I-25, fearing it was going to cross our path.  It was HUGE, rectangular, like a LADDER on it&apos;s side: two parallel rows of white lights connected by &quot;rungs&quot; of white lights. It then stopped and SHOT perpendicular to itself at an AMAZING SPEED.After a day of shopping, I was returning from Albuquerque to Santa Fe driving my vehicle at the time, a Toyota 4-Runner (with a moonroof, which I NEVER had to look through for any of these events), on I-25 north when at approximately 8p.m., we were approaching Cerrillos Rd. exit in Santa Fe.  It was already very dark outside.  The person I was with suddenly said, &quot;WOW, look at that star&quot;. From the windshield, I saw a &quot;falling star&quot; shoot high in the sky falling in a SOUTHERNLY direction. I&apos;ve seen MANY shooting stars and continued driving. A moment later, my passenger asked, &quot;Is there an airport around here?&quot;  I said SFE Airport which we had already sort of passed. A few seconds later, the passenger said, &quot;Is that a plane?  Look at that plane...&quot;  I ignored this for a moment because I was watching traffic (which was moderately heavy for 8 p.m.) and I wasn&apos;t going to look at everything flying in the sky (seeing airplanes in the clear NM sky is a usual event).  But again, the person said, &quot;WOW..look at that plane...is that an airplane?&quot;  I looked to my right past the passenger and out that window.  I was completely amazed. I said, &quot;If that&apos;s a plane, it&apos;s a 747!!&quot;.  Coming from the SE, from the Manzano/Ortiz/Sandia mountains (they layer atop each other from that perspective) at about a 30 degree (?) trajectory angle from the ground  (it was NEVER above the mountain range) was an incoming &quot;craft&quot; looking very plane-like, regulated, controlled, smooth.  It was &quot;landing&quot; at this very regular pace which looked like a perfect landing BUT there is no airport and it was coming in WAY too fast. It was coming right toward I-25. (Note: I-25 is a N/S interstate but as the road passes through Santa Fe, it &quot;hooks&quot; and at certain points one is moving more in an E/W direction). At no time did it occur to either of us that it was a meteor. This was NOT the shooting star we&apos;d seen a moment earlier.  It was a unit, again looking like a plane coming in for a too-fast landing. It would have been a great landing if it had another 2000 ft to go (which it did not).  Personally, I thought we were seeing a military craft BUT the TWA 800 accident had recently occurred and I thought, &quot;Who&apos;s really ever expecting a plane crash?&quot; (Alb. Internat&apos;l Airport is about 55 miles south and I thought, it could be crashing to/from there).  I looked to the traffic travelling SOUTH (opposing traffic). We were approaching the St. Francis Dr. exit/entrance now (divided by a wide grassy median)and cars were STOPPING in the opposing direction -- the direction looking toward this oncoming &quot;craft&quot;. That&apos;s when I got this strange chill and pictured us getting slammed by this &quot;crashing&quot; plane.  Out of FEAR rather than voyeurism, I pulled off onto the shoulder, fully expecting this &quot;plane&quot; to cross I-25 or crash into it.  Several cars behind me also pulled off at this same moment.  As we sat there looking out the passenger side window, it came in CLOSE and was maybe a quarter mile (?) from the highway and looked to be just above treetops/houses!  It was ENORMOUS!  It was a very geometric object consisting of white lights laid out in a rectangular format looking like a LADDER laid upon one side.  Two long rows (one above the other) of white lights connected by &quot;rungs&quot; of white lights at regular intervals.  I was not aware of any other color light. The lights just sort of existed -- did NOT radiate or illuminate anything above/below/around themselves. If one stuck out their arm, this &quot;craft&quot; seemed the visual length of a twirling baton.  But it was a quarter mile off the road! There was utter SILENCE. It made absolutely no noise at any point during this entire sighting.  Then as we watched it in amazement, it just STOPPED and &quot;hovered&quot; for a MICRO-second and then SHOT 90 degrees, perpendicular to itself off to the EAST.  It was STARTLING. We were expecting it to crash but it instead did this!   And although I HATE to use the term, it SHOT at &quot;warp-speed&quot;.  I have NEVER seen ANYTHING move so FAST,so silently or so strangely in all my life. We were speechless. We sat there for a moment and I looked at the dashboard clock.  It read exactly 8:05 p.m. Shaken, we resumed driving, having to wait for other cars that had pulled over to re-enter the lanes before us.  We could NOT believe it.  We wondered where it could have possible gone -- it did NOT seem to have crossed I-25 at all but had SHOT into/over? the short foothills of the Sangre De Cristos. We had another 15 miles to drive to my home and could NOT figure out WHERE such a thing COULD have even gone (other than INTO a foothill).  It was a VERY disturbing experience.  Not really thrilling or exhilirating. It was frightening.  As we got in at 8:25, I immediately called my sister in Chicago.  Then we watched the 10 pm local news and it was the lead story on all the stations. But they were &quot;wondering&quot; what it was &quot;What was in the sky tonight...was it a meteor...some say it WASN&apos;T!&quot; So,  I called one of the stations simply to tell them what we&apos;d experienced and got the &quot;Oh, interesting...&quot; routine. It was all over the papers over the following days -- some people describing what we&apos;d seen; others saying it was a falling star. I wondered how one man in our neighborhoof saw this meteorite &quot;event&quot; which ALL global observatories had failed to detect!! Then in the days that followed, a physicist at Sandia Nat&apos;l Labs was quoted in the papers as saying that what a person had described as it&apos;s movements (not my account but the same), it could not have been a meteorite but was perhaps a retrievable satellite or other &quot;craft&quot;.  NO agency/observatory ANYWHERE tracked a meteor that evening.  So I called this physicist who is an &quot;expert&quot; in meteorite behavior.  We spoke for 30 minutes. He said NO meteorites were seen and wished he&apos;d seen what we saw. We discussed how meteorites behave, how they break up and are like fire lights, etc...most, of course, disintegate before ever entering the atmosphere. They DO NOT stop, hover or switch directions! I asked, &quot;Why would no one be concerned even if it were &apos;only&apos; a satellite -- what happened to the warnings ala SKYLAB in the 70&apos;s...what if it had been a MISSILE???&quot; In this part of the globe, with GREAT celestial visibility and a large military presence, it oddly seemed NOT to intrique any officials! In Los Angeles, CA, it was seen an HOUR later (even accounting for Daylight Savings)!!  UCLA offered a reward to anyone who could find a piece of it...because they felt it was NOT a meteorite. A month later (?), the  Sandia Lab physicist I had spoken with was quoted in the papers as saying it was a ricocheting metorite traveling at 186,000mph. For a guy who never saw or recorded it, he had a THEORY! (How it would take so long to get to L.A. is unexplained, of course).  It was said that the meteroite landed in Moriarity, NM!!  This is 50 miles SOUTH of Santa Fe (the &quot;craft moved NORTH, THEN last I saw, ENE.  No fragments were ever found in Moriarity. But then a physicist at Los Alamos Nat&apos;l Labs immediately refuted the Sandia physicist&apos;s sudden theory saying that for 40 years, he was an expert in ricocheting meteorites and would NOT have missed one -- they come along every 10,000+ years and are IMPOSSIBLE to miss because they are so powerful and LARGE. They enter earth&apos;s atmosphere and then &quot;ricochet&quot; back into space to again immediately re-enter the atmosphere because they are powerhouse meteors!! The person who was with me during this sighting does NOT wish to be identified at this time but would likely answer questions off-the-record.", "My friend and I were sitting outside talking when she noticed a large object moving in the sky, there were clouds and we were able to see the shape of the craft very well.It was moving along the Spokane river in the Post Falls area, we live a very short distance from the river. We could see that it was following the river because of the direction that it was moving in. It was black and had white lights, with a red outline around the whole ship. It was very quite and graceful. We watched it has it moved up stream from us, I would say it got with in 100 yards of us. At it&apos;s closest point! We then observed the ship come to a complete stop and then suddenly take off straight out in to space.  I mean straight up! We never saw it again. It was just gone that fast. We have seen a lot of things in Idaho, I think this state is very high in it&apos;s sightings.", "we saw a circular craft with large windows or lights in a mist slowly moving near us.The discussion at the dinner table was about the metiour shower of the previous night. I saw 25 of them. I drive after midnight Mon. thru Fri.and I was waiting for these nights to view the Leonids. After dinner my wife,43, my daughter, 10, and I,41, went out on our backyard deck at 19:50 central time to try to see at least one. We were looking east,the skies were completely clear. We could see planes very high in the sky. Our view to the open sky was about 55&apos;. suddenly in the south section of our view a round craft with large square windows or lights glided in a northen direction, in some sort of mist. It lasted 15 seconds. We all agree it was no more than 300-500 yards from us no sound! The mist and lights put out a light pinkish glow.", "I saw a large triangular craft with multicolored lights on the outside.  I estimate the size between 150-250 feet across.  There was no sound and the craft accelerated away at a rapid speed (no sound either!).  I&apos;m a skeptic but this really scared me.I had just finished work and decided to drive out to the local Air National Guard base here in Terre Haute.  It was about 1:15 am.  Sometimes, the guard runs night practice and when I can&apos;t sleep I will go watch the planes take off and land.  There were no planes this night, but I parked on a small country road not too far from the runway.  I got out of my car and looked up to see if I could see anything circling the airport.  It was silent and I almost fell to the ground because a large triangular craft was approaching from behind me (to the east).  It was completely silent and about 150-250 feet across with blue, red and white lights that appeared to go all the way around the craft.  I estimate the elevation was no more than 1000-1500 feet from the ground.  It was simply hovering and within about 10-15 seconds, it left toward the western sky at a tremendous speed (faster than the fighter jets I am used to watching).  What was strangest is that the craft made NO sound.  I am a skeptic and quite frankly I do not believe in UFO&apos;s, but having no idea what this craft is, I would have to call it a UFO.  I am a Ph.D. scientist here at a local university (I do NOT want my name divulged as I am sure to be ridiculed).  I simply cannot imagine the technology behind this craft. I am reporting this to you for your information and do not wish to have my privacy invaded.  This is a small town and the University is not that big either so I hope you can understand my wish for anonymity.", "((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We have assigned a date so that the report sorts to 1990.  PD))Oval shaped craft emitting white light as if scanning the ground.Two good friends to mine reported to me that while biking they had seen a object hovering over the highway from the vantage point of a bridge.  They claimed to have observed this object for several minutes before it started to move toward them.  Upon the realization that this object was approaching they raced off on their bicycles and observed the object scanning the ground with a white light as if looking for them. They noticed the craft to have been oval and emitted no sound except for a slight humming.  They sped away and notified me over the telephone at which time I observed the craft from my home at a distance of a couple miles.  At this time it was dark and the object shown as a white light hovering in the sky.  It eventually sped off after several minutes.", "while traveling home from Seattle I stopped at the rest area a Teddy R. Park and saw something that I didn&apos;t need to see.I was on my way home from Seattle and stopped at the Teddy R. National Park in North Dakota at 10:00 pm I was standing next to my truck and saw what I believed to be a star on the horizon. It was red and glowing like a dwarf but then it changed colors to a blueish white and back to red again and then it moved to the side at a speed which I have never seen an aircraft , including my navy days working with av8b herriers and helicopters of all sorts,achieve I then noticed a dull light eminate from the craft and I felt like I was seeing in negatives. Four times very rythmic it flashed and my eyes saw in negative. It moved again at about the same speed and distance, approxametly 200 yards or so, and then I saw the light again and my eyes flashed in negatives it moved again same speed and distance and then lowered into the badlands behind a butte.

It moved slowly acrossed the sky then it just zipped away.My neighbors and I were talking to each other.  I was in the backyard and they were in the alley right beside my house when I noticed something in the sky.  It was about as long as half of a normal sized toothpick and it was silvery white.

Through a windowed door, I observed a light about the brillance of a bright star through the branches of a tree.  As I watched, it began to dip and sway as if in a pendulam (sp?) fashion, seemingly tightly controlled.  After about thirty seconds, it stop and formed into an extremely brilliant arrowhead.  /&#x5C; (closest approximation I can make).  It was completely illuminated white along the edges leading to the point, but dark along the other edge.  Even so, I sensed that it was a complete triangle shape.  It also appeared to have a faint white line of light straight down its middle leading to just before the edges of the object.  I stepped a couple steps to my left to my living room window.  By the time I had the object in view again, it had turned on its side to a &lt; as if following my movement.  At this time, I lose track of about two hours of time.  The next thing I remember is looking back up at a normal star.  From the right, two fast moving I assume at this point planes approached.  From my vantage it appeared as though one was on top of the other as in like a colon : but spaced out a lot more. The top plane actually transvered directly through the light of the star I had observed.  For a split second, they were as one.  This was the only observation I had and no more oddities have occured.", "I saw a u.f.o. and It was greay and had colorful lights and they changed colors.All of the sudden, my dogs outside started barking and I heard a strange buzzing noise.  I looked out my bedroom window and I saw an object flying overhead.  It was in the shape of a circle.  It was very large, and gray, and there were lights outside of it, in a ring, that changed colors.  It went overhead once very fast, and then passed again very slowly.", "It was hovering in one spot about 100 ft off the ground, it was triangled with the brightest white lights I have ever saw, when the space craft started putting beams to the ground thats when we all left, it never made a noise.

It was about 1/4mile away and about 500ft in altitude.  We observed it through open windows in our car.  The weather was clear and sunny and we watched it fly over several local hills for a little less than a minute until it passed behind a larger hill and we could no longer see it.  It was coming from the south and headed toward the north and was moving slowly (about 90mph-although it was hard to gauge accurate speed), and it was completely silent.  We heard no noise whatsoever, which is what surprised us the most. Being as that it was so low we thought we should be able to hear it.  Our backgrounds:  I work in the computer industry and the other adult witness works in construction metals salesmanagement.  We are both in our mid-30&apos;s. We are making no claim that this was any type of extraterrestrial craft, only that it was unidentifiable, flying and an object.", "At approx. 9:40 pm 5/3/99, I was looking to the NW. sky, when I saw a  perfect isocolese triangle with a large dimmly lit , amber light on each corner.

It was smaller than a jetliner but bigger than a commuterjet,flying at around 1500 feet at a high rate of speed(300mph?)NO sound at all! The object turned west and was gone as fast as it appeared.The sky was clear with a few scattered clouds,visibility was great.It was as if the object moved through the air effortlessly without friction.The info for this space is as above in the brief description, because it was a brief encounter.

I looked up and saw a large thing up in the sky.  It was just hanging there and moving slowly over the house.  I just watched it for about 2 or 3 minutes until I got bored watching it.  It was rather retanglar in shape and there were lights all over it but I do not remember seeing anything definite in form.  I don&apos;t remember the shape very well because it was so many years ago.  I didn&apos;t tell anyone because I didn&apos;t want to be picked on.  I was only 14 or 15 years old.", "UFO sighting over open pit uranium mine.The summer of 1971, I was working the night shift for Conoco Oil Co. at an open pit uranium mine west of Karnes City Tx.   I was one of 6 people operating Caterpillar 657B earth movers. We were down to about 210 feet deep when this incident happened.   It was about 11:10 PM , just after shift change we were getting ready to crank our machines, when the 85 acre pit lit up as if it was daylight.  The light was so bright that I had to squint because it hurt my eyes.  I remember hearing a high pitched hissing noise and the hair on my arms stood on end.  I was so scared, I fell to the ground and started praying.  I remember trying to look up, but the light was so bright I couldn&apos;t.  After about 2 minutes, the light started getting dimmer and I could finally look up at it. What I saw amazed me.  The object was round and the bright light was coming from the center of the bottom of the UFO.  Around the perimeter of the craft was hundreds of penlight size light beams that alternated in all colors of the spectrum.  Now I know they were laser beams.  The UFO was rising up slowly at first and then went straight up out of sight in about 10 seconds.  I was crying and shaking and so was everyone else.  The other shift workers thought we were crazy when we told them what had happened.  But we got the last laugh.  This is how we proved it actually happened. There is a vein of uranium ore that runs from George West Texas to almost Texarkana Texas.  When determining where to place a mine, the following steps are accomplished:  (1) A geologist with a geiger counter flies over the area and finds the highest radiation reading.  (2) Drilling trucks are sent out and core samples are drilled to determine the highest concentration of uranium ore. These core samples are drilled in a grid pattern and every core sample is given a tracking number and logged in showing the concentration and amount of uranium present. (3) The open pit mine is then laid out according to these core samples. When this UFO incident happened, we were about 2 feet away from a layer of hard rock called the &quot;tap rock&quot; that laid directly on top of the uranium ore.   The uranium ore varied in depth from 6 to 18 inches and had about the same brown color as low grade coal.    Two days after this incident, the tap rock was removed to expose the uranium ore.  We were astounded to find that the uranium ore was now a chalky white substance that had NO radioactivity at all!  There was a 250 foot diameter circle of this chalky material in the center of the pit. Outside of the circle, the uranium ore was still as potent as before the incident.  Core samples don&apos;t lie.  This chalky material was uranium before this incident. Many a night I have laid in my bed thinking about what happened.  I think the UFO needed the uranium for some reason.", "Early morning driving to work a beautiful bright green colored sphere moving very fast crossed my path about one quarter mile in front of me.Every morning i would drive to Los Angeles to work this one morning i Saw a Bright colored Green Sphere passing from my left to my right, also this would be from south to north, it was about one quarter mile in front of me , it was low to the ground say two hundread feet above the ground it followed the contour of the earth, i saw it travel about twenty miles, it went over the San Bernardino mountains,it made no sound, thats not the best part...... when i arrived at work i was overheard talking about it, and another person i work with saw the same thing, only eighty miles away!!!! this was for real and i am glad i saw it, it was a lime green ball of fire....", "I would like the person to know who submitted on 5/24/99 from Bainbridge Island that he/she was awaken by  up with 3 people in his/her bedroom and touched them slightly on the crease of their neck and now has a thyroid problem, that that too happened to me.

Looking through the fluid the stars behind it were greatly magnified.I was on a long flight back to Los Angeles on Pan Am&apos;s Clipper Class 747. We took the polar route over Canada, Seattle, and the Pacific coast. Looking out the window, I could see the stars shining brightly in the pre-dawn skies.  I could even see what I initially thought was the planet Jupiter glowing orange in the distance.  I then began to think that it could not be Jupiter, because it was not in this part of the sky.  It must be something else.  Sure enough, the object was moving along side of the plane.  A big orange ball!.  Judging from the time remaining for us to land, we were somewhere over Seattle.   The object was moving from right to left and then right again.  I then saw beneath it a stream of fluid along its path.  Looking through the fluid, I could see the stars behind it were greatly magnified. After about ten minutes of this, I decided to try and take a picture of this object.  But since I had only a cheap instamatic camera and it was night, I knew that the picture would not come out.  But I too k the picture anyway. Soon thereafter, the object came straight towards our plane and I could sense the plane turning aggressively as if to avoid something. The object disappeared behind the plane&apos;s tail and I never saw it again.", "Two very bright star like lights that at first were stationary then moving closer to each other, then one moving off very fast and coming close enough to be seen as a bright glowing object very low and close.Friday evening, my boyfriend (S.), his son (L.)and myself were at Lake Roosevelt for a week-end of camping and boating.  We went to bed around 9:30pm but did not go to sleep because of the heat.  We noticed what seemed to be a very bright star that was stationary but then it seemed to move a bit so it kept our attention.  Before long there was another point of light moving around the first one, coming closer and then moving away from it.  My boyfriend, S., and I kind of blew it off as airplanes or something since we were not that far from Phoenix but L. continued to watch.  I had closed my eyes when I became aware of a relatively bright light (not really much brighter that if a car was passing by our campsite)at the same time L. started yelling for us to look.  I opened my eyes in time to see an object going over the campground.  It wasn&apos;t that close but you could clearly see it (kind of like if you were on the ground and the GoodYear Blimp was overhead).  I&apos;m not really good at distances so I don&apos;t know how high it was but like I said you could see it clearly.  It looked as if it was glowing from the inside out instead of being illuminated by an outside source.  It almost had a peachy glow to it but it did have some exterior white lights fore and aft.  I am guessing that it was circular in shape but it was like we were seeing it it profile which made it appear more cigar shaped with an extra small dome shape on the top.  It moved rather slowly at first then it just seemed to streak away.  L. told us that it was the second star like object that had moved over us and then disappeared.

Very bright lights, I could easily see a distinct &gt; shape.I live in a great place for star gazing far away from any city lights. I don&apos;t smoke in the house so I sit on the steps out front and look at the stars. Approx. 3 weeks ago I was watching a very bright star when it started to MOVE! I opened the door and excitedly asked my roommate to get my binoculars. We observed the object for approx. 5 minutes until it dipped down below the tree line. Last night the same thing happened and we were laughing about our UFO, wondering what was so interesting in that same area to bring it back. We both called it a UFO simply because we could not identify it. That observation was only for a little over a minute.  BUT, tonight as we were both having the pre-sleep cigarette, I noticed movement to my right, not in the same location as before but close, it was huge and moving very quickly off to the side of the house. We both could see the shape very clearly, but retrieved the binoculars again for a better look. V shaped with 2 white lights on each end and one white light in the middle.  The sound was an odd low hum. Surprising to me because on the other two occasions I had not been aware of any sound. (Possibly because it was not as close previously as it was tonight? I don&apos;t know.) There was a reddish glow coming from somewhere on the craft but I could not pinpoint it due to the intensity of the whites. We watched it pass by the side of the house and back beyond the trees.  Duration? I&apos;m not sure, possibly a minute, I was too overwhelmed to have any real feeling for how long I watched it.

There were 7 people total but 4 of them left before the event took place. We live just outside the Phoenix metro area near the Superstition Mountains. It is fairly dark at our location and is good for stargazing. I am an amateur astronomer and a professional musician. I very often observe several satellites crossing overhead during the early evening after sunset and have become familiar with their appearance in relation to the stars around them. At approx. 2:30 am I was lying down in a lounge chair looking at the sky directly overhead. My wife and a friend were inside the house. I then saw three points of light appear out of nowhere directly above me at what I believe to be the same altitude as the satellites I regularly observe. The lights were bluish white in color and steady with no flashing or flickering. They were in a precise triangular formation. It is difficult to estimate the size of the formation except to say that they would fit within the shape of a fist held at arms length. When they first appeared they were stationary for a few seconds but then started moving toward the northeast of my location at the same speed as some of the satellites which move very quickly across the sky. The triangle was equilateral in shape, all sides being the same length. After it started to move I immediateley checked to see if it was a solid object or three separate objects. Since I could see stars behind the formation as it moved, I have to assume that they were separate objects. The triangle was pointed in the direction in which it was moving and stayed in tight formation as it moved. About 20 sec. into the event my wife and a friend came back outside and I pointed out the formation to them. They also observed the formation and watched it as is moved to the northeast and disappeared over the horizon which took another 15 sec. or so. In my opinion, the two most significant things about this event were; &gt;first&lt; They appeared out of nowhere as if someone had clicked on a light switch. I have no doubt that this took place because I was looking directly at the position when they appeared. There was nothing there except the stars before they appeared. &gt;second&lt; They moved very quickly across the sky very similar to the satellites which I have observed. My wife thought it could be a formation of military jets in formation. But I have observed jets at high altitude in the past and they definitely do not move as fast as these objects did. After the event happened, I tried posting a report on the Skywatch Int&apos;l discussion page but was unsuccessful due to the fact that I wasn&apos;t officially subscribed. I have since posted this report on the CSETI discussion page of which I am a member. It wasn&apos;t until this morning that I realized that I could report this to NUFORC. I should also like to mention that just prior to the event I was trying out some of the CSETI contact methods. I can&apos;t say for sure whether this initiated the event but thought that it should be mentioned. I am convinced that what I and my wife and friend observed was at the very least unusual and worthy of reporting. - ((name deleted))", "While driving on Route 1&amp;9 in Elizabeth Near Newark Airport I was looking at an airplane that was taking off on an upward incline. At this time I spotted a white silvery oval shape that appeared to shoot out at a downward angle from the bottom of the plane.

This was the same direction that I was facing. Then I saw a whiteish silveryish oval craft coming at a downward angle it looked as if it was something that fell off of the plane at first. The light turned green and I was in the middle of lots of traffic so I managed to pull my pick up truck up onto the curb and on to the grass. I stopped and continued to watch as the object fell then stopped in mid-air. It stayed put for a few seconds as the plane flew farther away. Then the object began to rise straight up and a few more seconds later it took off at an incredible rate of speed that was just breath taking. It shot up into the clouds and after that point I could no longer see the object but I stayed there looking up as many cars passed by looking at me as a sat there dazed staring up at the sky.

I was 13 years old and living in Springfield, Ohio. At approximately 9 p.m., I was in an urban shopping mall parking lot, sitting on the trunk of my father&apos;s car while he and my brother finished shopping inside. There was dense low cloud cover, perhaps at 1,000 feet altitude. I was tossing a toy up in the air and catching it ... once, twice. But on the third toss, as I watched the toy, my eyes drifted away to the most incredible sight I have ever seen. Three enormous white lights -- each about the size of a cup saucer -- silently hung in the sky. They were above the blanket of clouds, so they were diffused. Together, they formed an even more enormous equilateral triangle. If the lights were the endpoints of a single triangular object, each side would roughly equal the length of an American football field. I blinked, looked down and closed my eyes, then looked back up again. The lights remained directly overhead. The lights just hovered there, motionless, for about a minute. Then, in unison, they began to rotate in a slow counter-clockwise pattern. Simultaneously, they began moving north at about 30-40 mph. There was no engine or rotor noise of any kind. Beyond the extraordinary silence, the motion itself was bizarre: There seemed to be no acceleration. The motion was instantaneous and fluid. (Imagine having a VCR set on &quot;Pause,&quot; then pressing &quot;Play&quot; to watch something move.) Within a couple of minutes, the lights had moved over a nearby hill and out of view. In a mix of shock, fear, and excitement, I immediately ran back into the shopping mall to find my father and brother. I told them what I had seen and demanded that we get in the car and drive north, to see if we could find the lights. They humored me, but we saw nothing. I knew they probably thought I was crazy, but I didn&apos;t care. As far as I know, there were no other witnesses around the shopping mall. But I never bothered to check. Also, my father -- who happened to be a prominent city politician -- had friends at the local municipal airport, which also served as an Air National Guard base. At my request, he phoned the control tower to find out if there had been any unusual air traffic that night. There wasn&apos;t. I was completely perplexed, and remain so to this day.

I continued to track the object from west to east for approximately 20 seconds.  I lost sight of the object while attempting to view it with the naked eye.

Then the second one came from the South and they circled each other for a few minutes.  Then one flew off back to the South and the other stayed in place for a few minutes then flew slowly to the west.

I was way off course...and stopped at the intersection of Highway 90, which became Texas Highway 54, and I-10.  I stopped to get coffee before making the decision of staying on the main highway or the short-cut.  I encountered three people outside the cafe who suggested I not take Texas Route 54.  I decided to take this route since it would cut many hours off of my journey...so I could get to the slopes the next day. The road was isolated...I saw no traffic or animals...it was flat...and teh sky was incredibly clear...I noticed to the left in the sky, that one of the &quot;stars&quot; was moving...it seemed to flit back and forth in the sky...I thought I was imagining things...but I had made myself agree not to stop on the road, let alone at night for no reason...since I am female and traveling alone.  I then felt heat on my face, from the object in the sky.  In the distance on this flat road I could see head lights...it was a sort of reassuring thing that I was not alone...the head lights did not seem to get any closer...I realize there are optical illusions on flat roads...I&apos;ve lived in Texas too long.

Almost immediately I saw that there were 2 other lights travelling in formation with the first - 2 in front, slightly offset, and one in the rear, about 3 times the distance between the first two.  Longest distance between them, about 1 inch at arm&apos;s length.  They were first seen a bit SSW, quickly moved to almost directly overhead, then faded out in the NNE.  They followed the plane of the Milky Way, which was clearly. Length of time I had them in view, approximately 5 minutes - I gave thought to getting my wife up but soon realized there was probably not enough time.  It was 4am when I went in the house immediately after losing sight of them.   In size and speed they appeared to be sattelites - if there had been only one that is what I would have assumed.  Even so, my thought when I saw the first light was that the color of it was a bit  red/orange-ish for what I had been used to seeing as a sattelite.  I thought it was interesting but then when I saw the 2 others, the color difference became quite noticable against the background of stars in the sky.

The skies were clear except for the wispy clouds under the contrail. At 17:35, I was scanning the skies for more contrails and pointed my binoculars almost straight up towards the east -- directly over The Colony. I could not believe what I was seeing! There were 15-20 silver spheres spread out across the sky reflecting the sun to my back! The spheres would disappear and reappear moving slowly into different patterns. I would guess these were at least at an altitude of 20-30,000 feet but that is very hard to tell. I could not make them out without binoculars. These soon disappeared and I noticed a larger white craft hovering overhead a little to my east. I focused my binoculars and watched this object for quite a while overhead then continued watching it as it slowly moved toward the area of the contrail to the northeast. It was white, reflecting the sun and appeared to have a red glow emanating from behind it at times. It then hovered again near a wisp of &quot;contrail cloud&quot; and soon after was joined one at a time by 5 spheres. These spheres (maybe 1/8 the size of the craft) slowly moved around the craft -- with very smooth and graceful moves -- as the craft moved toward the northwest. At this point they were about 6-8 miles away I would estimate and traveling slowly at about 20,000 feet. Suddenly more objects appeared around the larger craft a few at a time until there were at least 9-15 in various formations above it and to its sides. They all went out of view or disappeared at 18:35. Within 5 minutes, two large military helicopters flew overhead flying from the northeast-- the general direction of the objects.

I thought to myself, why on earth would an object be hovering over a huge watertower within an eighth of a mile of a university. I could not actually see the shape of the craft because it was pitch black night. However, since the lights were triangularly spaced apart, I assume that the craft itself was triangular.

A few seconds later this same green ball fell down out of my line of vision.  I jumped up to see if the ball would hit the water, but could see nothing.  It had either not entered the water, or did so before I could stand to see over the back of the couch. This sighting was over the Green Bay of Lake Michigan.

This was on July 1st. Around 15:00. Looked away for a second and it was gone.Went on vacation in Florence, Or.  My son and I were going down to the beach when I looked up and saw a bright cigar shape craft.  I thought that it was going to land on the beach.  It had contrails zig zagging behind it.  I looked up and it was the brightest looking craft.  I knew it was&apos;nt a airplane right away.  In fact I thought that they were going to land and talk to people.  I have never seen one that close up.  I swear I only looked away for a second and it was just gone.  I thought when we got to the beach that people would be flipping out, but no one seemed to even have seen it.  Once again, I look like the crazy one.", "On busy Wilshire Blvd. I looked up between tall buildings, saw &quot;Top Hat&quot; shaped craft stationary between buildings.  There were portholes where a &quot;hat band&quot; might be.  No noise, no movement.  I looked for people on the street so I could point it out.  No one was around.  I was waiting for a bus.  It arrived.  I got on and left.I walked to the corner of Wilshire Blvd. and Westgate Avenue in West Los Angeles to catch a bus.  It was about July 23, 1997, 12:30 pm.  While waiting, I looked up at the tall buildings to my left (east)and saw a craft hovering between two buildings.  It was shaped like a top hat, and had portholes where a hat band might be.  It did not move,it did not make noise.  There was a lot of automobile traffic on the blvd., but I saw no pedestrians on the street so I could point it out to them. I knew for sure that people in the high rises around would and could see it if they looked.  I gazed at it the whole time until the bus came. When the bus came, I got on the bus and left. What amazed me about the encounter was that I was not startled, not afraid, not shaken at all.  I felt a kind of communication as if they were saying, &quot;We see you.&quot;  And I was saying, &quot;Yes, and I see you too.&quot; In a way it was comforting.  Almost like being watched over. Several nights later I had a dream that I was caught up into a &quot;round room&quot; with windows all around.  I could see the skyline of West Los Angeles.  I was there with my sister and my two nieces.  Each of us had an instructor/guide/teacher.  Each of us were totally in thrall and occupied intensely with what each teacher was saying that we hardly acknowledged each other.  My teacher was beautiful.  He had shoulder- length blonde hair, about 32 years old, with a bare chest.  He was loving, gentle and kind.  As I sat mesmerized in his teaching, I found myself wanting to embrace him.  His skin was so beautiful.  It smelled wonderful too.  (I can still remember the fragrance)  He gently and laughingly distracted me from this lustful pursuit and refocused my attention on his teaching. I felt that this visit was a &quot;check-up&quot; to see how we were all doing. It was more a spiritual and mystical and metaphysical exam, not a physical one.  After each of us were through with our private lessons, my guide went to the front of the &quot;room&quot; and at a board or screen was teaching us all.  It was a lesson about time.  In essence what I remember him saying was that there was no such thing as time, but that it was a concept that we earthlings/encarnates agree upon believing in for the &quot;time being.&quot; After all the lessons, the &quot;room&quot; started spinning and we lifted up and away, and I looked down and recognized Los Angeles, Beverly Hills, the Hollywood Hills and the San Bernardino mountains in the distance to the east.  I felt as though it was just a &quot;joy ride&quot; for us &quot;kids,&quot; as a &quot;reward.&quot; I choose not to submit my name or any personal information.

I saw it move up (it got smaller and smaller) until it disappeared.The time is approximate; it was between 22:00 and 23:00. My brother saw it first, he was out having a cigarette on the deck. He called me and his wife, I came to see. The house where we were is about 2 miles East of the former Rockliffe Air Base. The object was moving South to North, and then began moving upwards very fast. It started off near the moon (from our point of view), then passed a bright star (maybe Venus), then continued North, until it started moving more upwards, when the light got smaller and smaller and then it disappeared. It was at about a 75 degree angle when I looked into the sky, from the horizon, then it became closer to 90 degrees (almost overhead) when it disappeared. It lasted only a couple of minutes. From my point of view, it was very high up; the ball of bright white light was about the size of the large star/planet we saw it pass). There were no sounds coming from the object, and the light was steady the whole time; not flashing.

They flew over the district at fantastic speed, and I hurried out the backyard to investigate. To my amazment, above my neighbours house were two egg-shaped looking craft. They were red at first, and then orange the moment after. I hurried into the house, where I awoke my son.

We were star gazing around 11:30 at night when a very bright light from the west caught our attention at the same time.  The brightness was comparable to that of burning magnesium which seemed to create a glow our halo around it.  It was very high up.  The &quot;glow&quot; lasted for about 10 seconds as it moved slowly to the north.  The light dimmed and started to accelerate, moving in a straight line for another 10 seconds or so.  All of the sudden it seemed to &quot;turn on a dime&quot; (about a 45&apos; angle) and started moving faster and getting dimmer (barley visable). This lasted about another 80 seconds when it grew very bright like it had previously and then it was gone. What this was we really had no idea.  Our first thought was that it was a satelite reflecting light from the sun. However that doesn&apos;t explain the sudden change in course.  It was much to far away to get any more details.

After watching this light for more than half an hour it suddenly moved to the south (towards me) until it appeared to be about the size of a nickel at arms length and began to glow very brightly.

It first appeared coming up behind Stone Mountain, (GA) on the southwest side. At first I thought it was a balloon, at some distance because balloons land / take off at a nearby airport. Then the object went up quickly and then changed elevation quickly. When it moved north, it did not move like an airplane or helicopter. It had a smooth but varied motion. Almost a looping type motion. Then it went west, coming directly overhead, with tremendous velocity and gaining altitude until out of site. My wife also saw the object. We were at the Stone Mountain laser show. Everybody was watching the show. I would be interested if you had any other reports.

It was MUCH brighter than the stars, but not close enough that I could make out a shape, but the lights it gave off suggested a sphere shape.  I don&apos;t know for sure what it was, but I have no better guess than a space craft.

After sighting, my wife called hotline", "black,three circular lights on bottom,cut corners,While fishing on milliman road,I saw the Black Triangle with cut corners,three lights on the corners,moving east at 30mph.It was 900 yards high,it&apos;s dimensions are,1000 yards on three sides,100 yards wide,cut corners,making VERY LITTLE SOUND.That caught my attention. It came back in March of 1999 ,thus this report.", "I saw a sphere flying north east.  It was going fast then slowed down.  blinked twice and let off a smaller sphere.I was sitting in my hot tub out side on the night of July 18th around 10:30.  I was looking up at the stars when I noticed a shooting star traveling very fast.  It then began to slow down.  I realized that it was not a shooting star, but a spherical craft with a slight glow.  it continued to slow down untill it stopped.  A light on it blinked twice and a smaller sphere flew out of it.  The larger object then flew away at an incredible speed, taking only a couple seconds leave the atmosphere.  Meanwhile the smaller sphere began to descend.  I quickly got out of the tub, ran inside and got some binoculars.  I found it again and got a better view.  It also was a sphere, it had a slight blue glow and it flew in a slow, unsteady fasion.  I watched it untill it went past the tree line.  It was pretty scary.", "An object shot across the sky, came to a stop, continued on and burned out.  Looked just like a shooting start except that it stopped.A freind and I were looking at the big dipper before our paper routes at about 5:00 - 6:00 A.M. I think this was in December but I&apos;m not sure. I&apos;m not sure of the year.  The year would have to have been between 1980 and 1983.  As we were looking at the Big Dipper, an object streaked across the Big Dipper going toward the horizon.  I believe the direction was North East.  The object looked just like a shooting star in every respect except for the fact that it came to a complete stop for a fraction of a second, then continued once again going just as fast as a shooting star, then it seemed to burn out the same as you would expect from a shooting star.  The object was white in color and went in a straight line.  There didn&apos;t seem to be any noticable acceleration after it stopped and started again.  It just appeared out of nowhere just like a shooting star allready moving very fast, But then it came to a complete stop for a fraction of a second and then continued seemingly without any acceration at the same rate of speed it was traveling before it stopped.", "Seen I triangle going from west to eastAt 11:20 pm I was on my back deck laying on my hammock and when I looked to the west I saw a 3 lights in a triangle shape with on light in the middle blinking a redish color. I know it was not a plane becouse there was no head lights on it at all. There was no sound it flew right over my house and then just vanished into then air. It lasted about 35 to 40 secds. I dont know where it whent. It was about 500ft above ground and I could see from the lights on it that it was a black triangle.((NUFORC Note:  The lighting pattern described by the witness is consistent with both commercial airliners, as well as with the many, peculiar triangular shaped objects reported to our Center.  For more information on triangular craft, please see other reports listed under &quot;triangle.&quot;))", "Multiple lights on sequencial nightsOn july 26th of this year,Iwas standing on my deck facing west and I noticed a light about 45 degrees above the horizon,roughly as bright as an aircraft beacon at 5 miles,orange in color,traveling faster than an aircraft but slower than a meteor but with no visible tail and in a straight line following a south to north trajectory.At arms length the light appeared to travel roughly 24&quot;and simply &apos;blinked out&apos;I stayed on the deck for 2hours more without seeing anything I would consider anomalous,(a satellite and a few meteors)However the light I had seen piqued My interest ENOUGH to send Me out on the deck every night since the 26th of July.I have been witness to a cornicopia of  different lights I have never really seen before in My star gazing.There was a white light that showed characteristics of the orange light except for direction of travel and that the light flashed before it went out,and again,no visable trail,and the pulsed lights that would flash quite brightly in stationary, single and double flashes.these are bright flashes,and could not be mistaken with Venereal shimmering.I&apos;ve sighted 9 of these lights in in 7 days", "Slow moving triangle shaped craft with big white lights and a red pulsating light in the center flew about 300 feet over my car.My girlfriend and I were driving back north to Canada on Interstate 91, at about 11:40 PM halfway between Hartford CT and Springfield MA when we observed a cluster of lights thiking it was a plane or helicopter due to the fact that Bradley Airport was 4 miles west of us but as it got closer the weird configuration of lights mind boggled us but it was heading westward and lost sight of it, then another one appeared on the east heading right toward us, as it got closer we knew this was no conventional craft, it slowly flew over our heads at about 300 feet soundless with 7 big white lights in a V formation (the lights did not light the ground) and 3 small flickering lights on the tip of the triangle which would be the front end and a small pulsating red light dead center of the craft, the craft itself was very dark (could not make out the actual body) it was also heading westward following the first. We stopped and watched it disappear in the horizon. The question we have to ask our selves is what would we gain or loose if the government finally told the public about the now famous Roswell crash, the alien abductions and the ongoing ufo activity. Logically speaking, if this craft would be government made, wouldn&apos;t it be most top secret (area 51), and if it was, what was it doing flying between large cities, woudn&apos;t these test be dangerous for the general public, if they were safe wouldn&apos;t we profit from it by improving today&apos;s latest planes and if they were from another country, wouldn&apos;t the army have intercepted this illigal alien threatening our country. The most logical answer would be that somekind of being is flying far more technologically advanced craft of anything we have on earth. Obviously we can&apos;t catch one or catch up to it, they abduct people and we haven&apos;t the slight idea how to stop them, if they crash, we steal their technology. Isn&apos;t that evolution for which humans thrives? I think we are ready to know the truth, the real truth!!", "Extremely bright spherical object about 40 degrees above the east-northeast horizon, about the size of a dime in the night sky.  Extremely bright central object, about 5x Venus as sets, spherical to oblong shape.  Surrounded by translucent, well-defined, glowing sphere.  No movement or sound. At end of observation, rotated in place and vanished (but more like it &quot;folded&quot; into the sky).Occupation of Observer: Casual evening walk Place of Observation: in the sky above our street, about 40 degrees above the eastern horizon (slightly east northeast) Distance of object from observer: about the altitude of a high-flying airplane (jet) Time in Sight: about 30 seconds total Speed: not moving (see description below) Direction of Flight: not moving (see description below) Tactics (unsual Motion): rotated in place then vanished (see description below) Sound: none apparent Size: total about the size of a dime in the night sky (see description below) Color: extremely bright white center surrounded by translucent &quot;glow&quot; (see description below) Shape: roughly spherical center surrounded by very sharply defined spherical &quot;glow&quot; (see description below) Odor Detected: none Apparent Construction: na Exhaust Trails: sort of an &quot;afterglow&quot; after object vanished, but more like motion in the atmosphere (see description below) Weather Conditions: clear, no moon (young crescent, already set), no clouds, warm (but comfortable), relatively dry Effect on Clouds: na Sketches or Photographs: sketch Manner of Disappearance: rotated in place but more like &quot;folding&quot; into sky and vanished with afterglow (see description below) Additional Notes and Comments: Let me say that I am a skeptic -- not necessarily about extraterrestrial life but about the possibility of &quot;them&quot; finding &quot;us&quot; or vice versa given distances, relativity, etc.).  This was such a vivid experience that felt compelled to report it in the hopes that someone else had a similar experience.  I noticed the object when I turned to walk back to our home (I was with our 2 cats; the object was too distant and noiseless, therefore they were not disturbed).  The object may have been in place longer than my observation.  The entire object was about the size of a dime, in total, in the night sky.  Center was large (about 5x the magnitude of Venus as it sets), bright, roundish to oblong object.  This central object was surrounded by a sharply defined spherical &quot;glow&quot;.  This &quot;glow&quot; was extremely clear and distinctive against the dark sky.  It was as if there was a very fine line of bright light around the spherical glow, but it was more evident above the central object than below it.  The entire thing was a round shape like a ball with about 2/3 of it the &quot;glow&quot; (translucent) and 1/3 the extremely bright central object.  I got a really good look at the object for several seconds because it was not moving.  Then, it was as if it rotated in place and vanished (more like it &quot;folded&quot; into the sky).  I felt that I could see sort of an afterglow but it was more like the atmosphere was moving (perfectly cloudless night, so this motion seemd to be in the atmosphere itself; I am less clear about this portion of the siting).  Honestly, in all of my life I have never, ever seen anything like this.  I regret I had no witness (at least with me) since my husband, who usually accompanies me on our evening walks, was not present.  The entire experience was absolutely vivid (I can recall it as if on video-tape).  In other useful information: I am well educated in the natural sciences (biology/geology); final degree is Ph.D., social science; I was an airplane pilot for many years so am familiar with atmospheric phenomena.  I ! was perfectly alert, on no medication.  On April 11, I witnessed in roughly the same quadrant of the sky at about the same time in the evening an object that I would explain as a meteor, only at a much lower altitude and much larger in magnification than a typical meteor, so that it was unusual in that expect.  The &quot;meteor&quot; was low enough and large enough for me to clearly see an orange-red hot core and the cinder trail.  I noticed it from just about overhead in our driveway and watched as it moved steadily across the entire remainder of the sky down toward the northeastern horizon.  While this was also a vivid observation, and it has been on my mind, it is &quot;explainable&quot; and I do not believe that it biased my observation last evening in any way.  I do hope that if anyone else reports a similar experience to the one I had last evening in Texas that I will hear about it (checked box for return contact by investigator).  I would like to know how to obtain any information on events that may have been in my area (weather balloons, high altitude explosions, satellites, etc.).", "I saw a boomarang shaped object. It was gliding across the sky.It was 12:45am,4/14/99. I was on the roof of The University of Texas Medical school building.In the Texas Medical Center. It was a partly cloudy night, I was looking up and I saw this object gliding thru the sky, right over head. It was going from southeast to northwest. It was in the sky about half the height of an airliner at 35,000 ft. It wasn&apos;t going very fast. At first I thought it was a sea gull. It looked to be some kind of aircraft. It looked like those  movies I saw on those old flying wings on the Discovery channel. As I watched it,it just glided across the sky. It was gray in color with no other markings. The strangest thing is, it had no lights or sound. It just sailed across the sky. One more very strange thing, about 3-5 minutes later, after I was still shaking my head, a shooting star(or something),very fast, came out of the northest and went in the same direction of this object. That object looked to just burn out.", "Looking at Venus with scope and spotted a black sphere moving through the field of view very quickly.I had just set up my Meade Polaris 4.5 reflecting telescope to look at Venus and after I aquired the planet and found focus I noticed a small spherical craft moving through the bottom of my field of view so I tracked the object which was pitch black for almost a full minute and it was moving so quickly I had to use my hands to move the scope as the tracking controls were to slow to follow.I had a 36times eyepiece in the scope and it required no change in focus in the eyepiece its size was double the size of a BB.I was totally circular and I do wish I would have been able to use a higher power eyepiece to see if there was any surface detail but at the speed it was moving Iit would have been impossible to keep it in such a narrow field of view.I was moving from the Northeast to the Southwest.I am also a Ham radio operator and a storm spotter callsign N0VMY and I have seen many strange things dealing with weather and aircraft but this was a textbook UFO.", "((NUFORC Note:  The time is compatible with the launch of two &quot;Black Brant V&quot; missiles out of the U. S. Navy facility at Wallops Island.  However, the trimethylaluminum is reported to have burned with a &quot;pearly white&quot; color, not red.  Please see other reports for this date and time.))Orange cigar shaped light about one thousand feet in the sky. Disappeared and then came returned about five minutes later.As we were visiting my boyfriends&apos; parents house.  His mother and I were parking the car.  She looked through the windshield and saw a large bright orange cigar shaped object travelling from northwest to southeast, about five hundred feet in the sky.  It silently accellerated straight up into the sky then disappeared within a minute.  My boyfriend came home five minutes later and was told this story.  In disbelief (but curious) he went outside.My boyfriend observed a white cloud like formation of a sideways &quot;s&quot; shape above our house. He then yelled back to us to come outside.  We witnessed the object travelling southeast at tremendous speed. At approx. 100 feet the object appeared to be cigar shaped.  The craft appeared silvery gray leaving a trail of orange light.  As the craft accelerated the orange light extended to four times the length of the craft, maintaining the crafts width throughout the sighting. The ship appeared leaving the orange light behind it travelling about 30 miles upward.  It came to a sudden halt. A split second later a small white light appeared growing to the size of the moon.  The light expanded growing about fifty times its original size.  It then disappeared, leaving a backward &quot;C&quot; shape formation with the white light in the middle of the &quot;C&quot; fading. Knowing this is the 4th of July, there was NO FIREWORK ACTIVITY going on in this small town.", "Two Star-like lights seen in East SacramentoMy family and I had gone to a local video store to rent some movies. There was a long check-out line, so my husband took our daughter with him on a short errand. As he left, he told me that he would pick me up outside the store after I checked out. When I got through the line, I went outside to wait for my husband. I didn&apos;t see him immediately, so I just stood, looking around as I waited. I looked up at the sky and noticed two bright star-like lights travelling upward high up over the parking lot. Each of them had a single white contrail that trailed behind them as they soared upward. I thought they were a jet at first,but I couldn&apos;t see a body around them. Then I noticed they were flying sort of &quot;neck-and-neck&quot; as though they were racing each other. After I had been staring up at the sky for a few moments, I could see the security guard looking up as well. I don&apos;t really know what he thought, but he appeared to be looking in the same direction as I. When my husband drove up, I told him what I saw. I told him to park in a parking space and look. Unfortunately, by then all that was visible was a jet, which was flying in a different direction. Unlike the lights, I could see the white body of the jet airplane as it flew by. By that time,the lights were gone. My husband insisted that what I saw was the jet. He said, &quot;Anything that leaves a contrail is a jet.&quot; I just thought I&apos;d bring this to your attention, in case someone saw something similiar.", "Distinctly triangular object, appeared to be transluscent but glowing orange, like an ember (hundreds if not thousands of small pin pricks of yellowish and orangish lights moving sequentially and linearly, some brighter than others, but not flashing per se, though there was a distinct pulsating appearance to the lights). Appeared hot, again like a burning coal in a fire. No noise whatsoever. Trajectory towards the north. Size and speed hard to judge against a perfectly starlit sky, but estimated that it was 20-50 m wide at the triangular base, provided that it was 200-500 m above ground as I estimated. Could have have been much larger if higher. I saw it directly overhead, until it disppeared over a small hill. Maybe 10-12 seconds in total, so it appeared to be sub-sonic.I&apos;m a professional field biologist and a so-called &quot;highly trained observer.&quot; I also grew up on CDN airforce bases, so am intimately familiar with aircraft of all shapes and sizes. At the time of the sighting reported, I had NO IDEA what I had seen. 15 years later, I could be convinced that this was an early test of the stealth fighter/bomber, given the similarity in its configuration (delta-winged, triangular shaped with unknown &quot;stealth&quot; capacities). I have no tangible evidence proving this sighting. I did report it to my wife, who happened to be in the outhouse at the time (even as I as personally shittin bricks!), and missed the whole thing. As as quasi-professional artist, I painted a full colour picture of the object about 6 months after the sighting, based upon a sketch I did a day or two later. It took me a long time to get my head around this (and I&apos;m still not sure that I have); I was quite excited about what I had seen, but also quite numbed by it, especially since I didn&apos;t have any corroborating evidence. It was like witnessing a traffic accident, where everything seems sort of like a dream, and yet is burned into the memory receptors permanently, but you&apos;re still not entirely sure that it was you who witnessed what you saw. It&apos;s like the brain doesn&apos;t quite recognize the input it&apos;s recieving as being valid somehow, and then you start to doubt your own eyes. If you guys are seriously interested in records and scientific follow ups, I can scan an image of my painting and send it to you for your research and historic files (not monetary gain on either side). My email address is attached.", "Was with friend, hitchhiking from New Hampshire to Illinois. Police kicked us off of the highway and we wound up on back roads and in Tiffen Valley Ohio. In late evening, my friend and I had weird (not bad) feeling that there was a third person. We were walking along the farms and were very freaked out. We sat down to rest and watched 3 objects in the sky. They were like orange or yellow ( i am slightly color blind). We were not even talking to each other. We watched the show and the three objects zipped around. Then one or more &quot;flashed&quot; us. We both thought that the flash was in our minds and not real. Thats the best way I can explain it. We then continued walking for a few hours. We finally got off the road into some woods and slept. We both awoke quickly as if we were fighting. We both had severe pain behind our left ears. There was no blood or other evidence of a reason for the pain. When we ran out to the road, we already forgot why we awoke so fast and we were really freaked. We knew something happened but were afraid to ever question it again. I never had until now. Let me know what you think. It has bothered me for over 20 years. thanksThe first description is pretty complete. I am checking that an investigator can contact me but please do it through e-mail as I prefer the utmost confidentiality.", "My mother called me out of the house to see a small light moving across the sky.  I later saw another such object and my mother told me their were seven all together.I went inside my house to play Sega after playing &quot;capture the flag&quot; with my sisters.  I went back out when my mother called, and followed her finger to a small, reddish object moving South.  We continued to watch the object until it fadded away.  I then went inside to call the UFO reporting center.  Then I went outside and saw another object moving East.  The UFO center called  back and my mother, her friend&apos;s daughter, and my two sisters came in after me and said that their had been a total of seven UFOs, all of which faded in and out and had a reddish glow.", "First I saw small white lights from a distance, then a big creamy colored light up close.I was up late up night because I couldn&apos;t sleep. Hoping to fall asleep, I began gazing out the window, up at the stars. Then I noticed small white lights dashing in all directions arcoss the sky.I&apos;d say there were about five of them.I watched them for awhile, wondering what they were. Then as half-way as a joke, I went to get the most powerful flash-light I could find. Then I returned to the window, and then started flashing the light towards them. They seemed to respond, flashing back as flashed. I even flashed the light in a sequence,once every two seconds, and they repeated it back to me. Right after that, a large,oval-shaped,creamy-white light,with a haze of the same color all around it, flashed right behind a tree about twenty feet away from the window.It looked like it was hovering, didn&apos;t land, but just stayed there for a second.It only did this once. I was so scared, I put the light out, pulled down the shades, and tried to find a different way to get to sleep. The next night, I had a friend stay the night with me. I&apos;d told her about it, and we wanted to see if they would appear again. Again,the smaller lights appeared, and We both saw them. And we tried flashing them with the flash-light, but the large oval light never showed itself to us, or me again.", "It was in the afternoon just before sunset at 20 Steiner St SF CA I saw above me and there was one other person who was with me on the same back porch a very bright light hovering above us. It felt as if we were being observed, at first I thought it was a star, but it didn&apos;t twinkle or flicker. Then after watching it for a few minutes and commenting on it, it began to move in what was a zig zag pattern upward in to the sky and then all of a sudden it disappeared and what was left as it disappeared was a silowette of a oval like shape as a faint outline before it completey dissappeared from site. It moves very fast in a ziz zag pattern or zzzzzz pattern. The color was a white light.", "A silent, triangular shaped object with a faint reddish light in each of its 3 corners flew directly over me.The time was 10:45pm cst, I had just let the dog outside before I was going to go to bed when I decided to step outside with him to do a little star gazing. I was sitting in a patio chair w/my head leaned back against the house facing east. It was no more then 5 minuets when I noticed a silent object moving across the sky. My first thought was that it was a large bird, only because of its size &amp; the fact that it was silent. I immediately realized this was no bird, it had a translucent appearance. I say it appeared translucent not because it was see through but because the object was so faint that it was not that easy to see. After watching it for about 4 seconds it started to go out of sight over the house. So I jumped out of my chair, took a few steps away from the house &amp; faced south, never taking my eyes off the object. It was then that I got a real good look at the object. It was a silent moving, triangular shaped object with a faint reddish light in each of its 3 corners. It was moving in a straight line north to south, just west of do south to be exact. The speed of the object was about twice the speed that the average satellite moves across the sky. The size of the object was about the size of my thumb nail at arms lenght or a little smaller then the triangle in the constellation Lyra to be exact. The height of the object I can only guess at. I would say that it was at about the height that an average airplane would fly at, not a jet but a smaller prop airplane. I discribed it as being 1 object w/3 faint lights but for all I know it may have been 3 or more seperate objects grouped together. I discribed it as 1 object because it never changed its shape, size, speed or direction. The object seemed to be on a precise course, was in no hurry to get where it was going &amp; was definitely trying to go undeteced. I feel very lucky to have seen this object, it was not bright enough to see out of the corner of your eye like you can do with a shooting star or a satellite, most of the stars in the sky where ! brighter then the object. You had to be in the right place at the right time &amp; looking in the right direction to see this object. I am &amp; for over 30 years have been a backyard astronomer. I have always had a fascination for the night sky. As a boy I spent many weekends &amp; summers in the remote north woods of Wisconsin learning the night sky. I know more about the stars &amp; planets then the average person so there is no mistaking what I saw, the only question I have is, what did I see?", "NUFORC Note:  This sighting occurred at the same time that two &quot;Black Brant V&quot; experiments were launched by missile out of the U. S. Navy Wallops Island, VA, Flight Test Facility.  We believe that the brilliant display of the chemical released (trimethylaluminum) in the ionisphere almost certainly is what these observers witnessed.))6 of us were in a boat in the dark and looking at the stars, we noticed what appeared to be like a vapor trail that was way up in the sky.  The moon had not come up yet and the sky was dark except for the stars. The original trail ended with double swirl and then within several mins another trail started and made a wide circle that seemed to be like a coil spring looking down from the end.  When you see a shooting star it usually is going across the sky, this seemed to be coming down but at great distance away, which gave it a real different prespective.6 of us were on 2 boats, one was broken down and we were towing it home, we were in the back bay off of Knotts Island, below Norfolk, near Virginia Beach, on the inside of the outerbanks. We noticed what at first appeared to be a similar trail that a jet plane would leave except that it was totally dark, the moon hadn&apos;t come up yet and the sky was clear and dark.  We all watched and assumed that it was some type of large meteor making an entry to the earth&apos;s atmosphere.  About 5 mins after the first trail appeared a second one started which lasted longer than the first, they both covered a large section of the sky for as high up as they were.  It was almost as if they were high enough up in the sky for the moon light to shine on the trails but the moon wasn&apos;t visable to us yet.  The trails had a funny spiral to them, covered a large area of the sky and didn&apos;t look normal.  The second trail acutally was in the same area as the first and they intersected, once the end of the trail happened the object that was making the trail got brighter and then it seemed to end.  We watched the trails disapate for the next 40mins.

It was a little larger than the other stars, and bright yellow, it was the movement and color that caught my eye. It dropped to a point in front of me, and about 45 deg from the horizon, stopped, then apparently divided into 4 sections (as it was just a point of light, i say apparently), then each section made a bit of an s-curve away from each other, and departed in 4 different directions, roughly 90 deg from each other.

A flash lit up the yard. An intense periodic flash of light occurred about every 5 seconds as it passed overhead. I saw no object, heard no sound, and there were no green or red lights. I have no idea what I saw.At 10 PM I went out to the back porch to put back the mat that I had rinsed out earlier in the day. As I carried the mat from the line to the porch I noticed a flash which made the trees and yard apparent - kind of like it does when there is lighting, but it was perfectly clear and I could see the stars. After another flash which I did not see directly happened again I walked around the corner of the house where the porch light wasn&apos;t shining and looked up and waited. I saw about 8 more flashes directly, each flash occurring at about 2 palm widths apart. At first I thought it had to be something in orbit but nothing I&apos;ve seen glints like that. This was an intense flash of light on the landscape. I never thought it was any aircraft since there was no sound or other lights usually seen on wing tips or the tail. Could it have been a lightning bug? I thought no since they usually leave a yellowish trail of light. This was a high intensity flash. I don&apos;t know what I saw.

After a short time, it just vanished.  The next night, the night of this report, my wife saw it again.  By the time I got my binoculars, it was gone.  She went for a walk and on her way back, she saw it again, but this time it was closer and appeared to light up a soybean field behind our house.  SHe ran home and just as she got to the window to knock and tell me about it, it vanished.  It doesn&apos;t seem to move much, just hover, then quickly fade away.We have seen these &quot;fireballs&quot; several times over the past year.  Until last night, they were always to the south of us and sometimes in pairs.  Each time, they would seem to hover for a short period of time, then fade out. Last night (08-15) we were in our back yard and saw a large (or close) one east from our place hovering above the grain elevator.  After 30-60 seconds, it faded out and we never saw it return.

One time before, my wife got a decent look at one with the binoculars and she said that it appeared to have lights going around in a circular motion. Tonight, my wife went to walk our dog and she saw it again.  She knocked on the window to tell me that it was back.  I ran out to get the binoculars and when I got back there (in the back yard), it was gone.  She left for her walk, and on her way back, she looked over and it was back.  She ran to the house and just as she was getting ready to knock on the window again, she looked up and it was gone.

The light was stationary for about one minute and then the size of the light reduced to the size of a typical running light then slowly traveled along the coast going North.  It then stopped and turned into a white light of the same size and remained stationary for about for about 30 seconds, while stationary the white light grew in size to about the size of a fify cent piece.

It resembled the brightness of a planet on a clear night but slightly brighter and larger than venus. Its light appeared to pulse a bit more than i have seen in stars or planets in varing atmospheric conditions so i stared at it for just over a minute.

As the trail ceased the brightness of the object faded the object appeared much smaller but continued on into space until i no longer could see it, not beyond the horizon just due to its distance.

The first time I saw the object I believed it was a star or a plane then I looked closer and noticed it was neither. The more I watched it the more I noticed it changed colors and moved very rapidly in a small area. About 45 minutes later another craft appeared in the same area as the other one. It circled around the other one and then flew off very fast in a southernly direction. Two days later I noticed it again and I woke up my mom to come and look at it. When we were looking at it a type of strobe light flashed across our yard only. The next day it appeared again and this time I showed my sister also. This time we noticed the colors that were present on the craft. The colors were red, green, and white. Two days later it appeared again and this time my mom, dad, sister and I all witnessed multiple crafts, up to eight of them all looking like the first but, a lot further away.

It&apos;s a flatter sphere shaped object with white lights on top and bottom, it has a green light in the middle and a red light rotates around the whole object. Up till this day the object appears regularly and I think no one else has noticed it because, it can be mistaken for a star, but stars don&apos;t move.

It was so brilliantly bright that I called to my mother to come and see it too before it disappeared. It looked like a moving flash of light. The object itself was not flashing; it was a constant, extremely bright, white light, which I&apos;ve never seen anything like. If I had to describe it further, I would say that it reminded me of a clear Christmas tree light, laying on its side (that is, horizontally) - only a thousand times more bright. The shape of the object - other than its eliptical bias (it was NOT round) - we couldn&apos;t determine because the &quot;rays&quot; shone out from the center of the light, extending away from it, obscuring its actual shape. I can&apos;t emphasize enough what a BRIGHT, large light it was. It&apos;s difficult to estimate its distance, but it seemed to be moving at the approximate height of a helicopter a fair distance away. It remained at a constant altitude from the time I first saw it to when it crossed behind the trees out of our field of vision. It made no discernible sound. The window faces to the north and the object passed from the west to the east. For maybe 10 - 15 seconds or so it disappeared behind some trees, but it emerged again (where one would have expected it to) and continued moving to the right. The whole thing lasted approximately 45 seconds. If one would have been directly underneath it, I suspect it would have lit up the ground below, it was so bright; it was like a huge, moving star against the dark clouds - we had had a thunderstorm earlier and the sky was still very dark.

We pulled off the road and watched it through binoculars for approx. 20 minutes.  It is difficult to say how far away it was from us but we could see it quite clearly with the binoculars.  It was approx. 1500 above the ground and it was hovering (horizontally).  It moved rotationally but not laterally. It was egg shaped, white, shiny, almost translucent.  It had no seams and no openings of any kind (no doors or windows). There were four sleek &quot;fins&quot; at one end, which could be legs if the egg were sitting on the ground (vertically).  We tried to rationalize what it could be and consequently did not take a picture.  (I did make a sketch of it but unfortunately threw it out after arriving home.)

About a half a second later it flashed like it exploded.((NUFORC Note:  For video footage of the event, captured by the Sandia National Laboratory sky camera in Albuquerque, please see the following URL:  http://www.cs.sandia.gov/SEL/apps/energy/meteor.htm  PD))", "I went outside to call my cat approximately between 10 or 10:30 at night, and looking up at the stars as I often do a fireball colored object wa traveling north to south as I was looking east.

Seeing the object on an aproximately 90%angle&apos; with the cat in my arms, I was praising God for His beautiful creation of the stars. Still watching the object, a search-light went out from the object to the ground! Then I thought maybe it was a plane, perhaps turning for the airport, but it stayed on course. Then I thought it might be a helicopter....THEN the long bright white light turned right over on me!!!...then the search-light turned off and the light orange object was still on its course, heading south. ! came into the house and told my husband to hurry up and see this and i was already gone.

It was eye-level but the funny thing was it looked like it was just floating there or suspended .  I looked again and it was gone.  It was metallic in color-silvery and was not real high up which surprised me.I had been to town which  is 7 miles from my house.  The time was approximately !:30 in the afternoon.  I have a habit of watching the clouds and sky ( even when driving) I look up and am a very observant person.  Something caught my eye on my left and when I shifted my eyes to the left to see what it was i saw a metallic object-shiny - it looked like a sphere with a circular  something around the outside. The top was definitely a dome shape.  I pulled over and tried to find it again but it was gone.  The thing about it that was strange was the fact that when I first looked at it from the window of my car- it was at eye level and it seemed to be effortlessly kind of floating  along it was going in the direction of  almost direct East.  I was on Highway 50 West going West.  I also thought it strange that it was so low in altitude. There was no exhaust or anything but it was just kind of gliding along effortlessly. The size of the object was about the size of my fist at arms length. I do not know how to measure altitude but I am 4 11 and sitting in a small make car (1991 Subaru Justy) and it was eye level.", "Light grey flattened ball, about the size of a muskmelon, with no propellors, fins, wings, lights, markings, holes, depressions, dents, sharp edges, exhaust, smoke, or apparatus attached to it.  The light grey color was matte, with no gloss, glow, shine or flashing.  The object was flying straight and true with no wiggling, wavering, shaking, etc. at about 65 mph when first seen.  It appeared to have heat waves coming off the front and sides of it.  It did not appear to be spinning.  Because of my viewing angle at different times I could easily see the back, bottom, left and right sides of the object.  If it had a noise I did not hear it.  On Sunday, July 25, 1999 at 11:35 a.m. I was driving west on Highway D about 1 mile west of Honey Creek, Walworth County, SE Wisconsin, and I saw the object to the NW and it was about 35 yd from the highway, it was about 50 ft above the ground, about 50 to 60 yds distance from me.  Its flight path followed the road I was driving.  When I drove faster to get closer to it, it flew faster.  I accelerated to 75 mph, then 80 mph to keep it in sight and it was outpacing me.  After about 50 seconds of following it, it made a left turn (heading south) to cross the road in front of me.  At that point I was a little closer and I saw its profile and it looked the same in appearance.  When it reached the south side of the road it made a right turn and headed west along the road again, about the same height off the ground and distance from the road.  Again, it had the same appearance.  I saw trees ahead that were going to block my vision and I sped up to 85 mph.  It was still outpacing me.  I did not see it for about 2 seconds when it was behind those trees.  When I drove beyond the trees, it was gone.  I searched everywhere and could not see it again.  I parked on the shoulder of the road and again searched everywhere and could not see it.

It remained visible in the same part of the sky for approximately half an hour, at which time the original observer left.  Two other witnesses - family members - saw the unusual motion of the first object.Notes on an unusual occurrence in the night sky 16-17 Jun 1999. I stepped onto the patio at the back of the house for a smoke and was admiring the display of stars.  The sky was very clear ; it is often cloud covered to some degree here in Courtenay on Vancouver Island. I located Ursa Major to find Polaris, as I normally do, and found it with no problem.  I used the memory trick;d been taught in Navigator;s school; and followed the arc of the Big Dipper;s ;handle&amp;#8221; to Arcturus then tried to &amp;#8220;speed on to Spica&amp;#8221; but wasn&amp;#8217;t so sure it was visible.  A bright reddish planet was in the western sky &amp;#8211; I took it to be Mars, but it may have been Venus. Turning counterclockwise towards the south and then continuing to approximately south east, I spotted a fast moving object apparently at great altitude.  I immediately thought &amp;#8220;satellite&amp;#8221; and watched as it proceeded from southeast to northwest.  The object was marginally brighter than the stars around it and about the same diameter.  As I watched the &amp;#8220;satellite&amp;#8221; it stopped and began a counterclockwise rotation describing a circle perhaps the size of the tip of my finger held at arm&amp;#8217;s length.  It turned for about 3/4s of a circle, stopped and reversed direction &amp;#8211; moving clockwise for about half a circle. Thoroughly  fascinated,  I wanted to get some parametric data on the object&amp;#8217;s location.  I extended my right arm fully with my thumb and little finger spread as close to a straight line as I could get them.   To the left of the curious object was a star noticeably brighter than most of the others around it.  With my left eye closed and my thumb just touching the bright star the object was almost exactly a splayed hand spread away from, and in line with, the bright star.  To fix the azimuth I dropped my arm to about 45 degrees and noticed that with my thumb on the vertical middle member of the house&amp;#8217;s upstairs window my hand filled most of the gap between the house and a small tree in the neighbor&amp;#8217;s yard.  I noted where I was on the patio using the BBQ and a separation line in the concrete as references. I was approximately one pace away from the leg (on my left) on the back of the BBQ about a foot west from the line on the concrete.  I planned to come back later and attempt to get fairly accurate azimuth.  For the time being I estimated it to be about 130 degrees true with reference to Polaris.  Raising my arm back to the object I estimated its elevation at about 70 degrees (from the horizontal) . Trying to get more detail on the object I looked a few degrees to the right of it to use my peripheral vision.  Another quite faint object, reddish in color was moving somewhat erratically side to side below and slightly to the left of my first object.  It was proceeding towards the first object.  The first object appeared to be moving away from me, that is almost straight up, and it was getting dimmer.  I checked my watch and noted the time was 23:40 (Pacific Daylight Time).  When I looked back up I thought I saw faint reddish beams of light flash between the two objects.  They occurred rapidly &amp;#8211; there were perhaps 3 flashes.  Both objects continued to move away from me during the &amp;#8220;exchange&amp;#8221; for lack of a better word.  I stuck my head in the door and asked for somebody with good eyes to come have a look at something interesting. The family was watching a video at the time.  My wife joined me on patio and I used the bright star as a reference point to steer her line of sight toward the objects.  She saw the first one that again stopped and dipsy-doodled around some more.  It did not move far, but at that distance it must have had incredible acceleration. She watched for a while and commented on its unusual motion. The second object was all but invisible at this point.  I thought I perceived a vary faint golden ring, or halo,  flash around the first object a few times.  I again tried to use peripheral vision the get a better look, but it was so faint I thought I may have imagined it.  I saw this perhaps half a dozen times.  I mentioned it to her, but she did not seem to see it.  The diameter of the flash would be about the size of a looney (Canadian one dollar coin) held at arms length.  I thought maybe something was causing a reflection from my eyeglasses &amp;#8211; so I moved my head around slightly &amp;#8211; looking at stars near the object- but the only place the halo occurred was around the object, centered on it. My wife went back in the house and a few moments later I saw a meteorite sparkle from east to west overhead then wink out.  I was getting a little cold, so I went to get a jacket.  Shortly afterwards I saw an aircraft&amp;#8217;s red strobe and saw the red and green nav lights as it winged from south to northwest and I heard the jet engines,  faintly but clearly, as it passed to the west of me.  I noticed it was about 3 minutes after midnight.  Our eldest daughter came out and I located the object for her &amp;#8211; she was not sure she was looking at the right thing.  The object was now a little fainter than the surrounding stars and seemed to be continuing to move vertically away from us.  It jinked a little but not as much as before.  My neck was sore by now so I went in and scribbled a few notes to later record the event in detail.  This is the account of what we saw.  I have never seen such an amazing thing in the skies before. I am a 45 year old man still actively serving in the Canadian airforce as an Avionics technician with 29 years military service, holding the rank of Sergeant.  I got interested in astronomy &amp;#8211; primarily identifying constellations - while undergoing Air Navigator training in 1977.  I did not complete the Nav course, but using the stars as navigation aids is an interest I&amp;#8217;ve kept ever since.  I have the equivalent of a college diploma as an Electronics Engineering Technician.  I have been married to my original lovely wife for 23 years.  We have 2 daughters, 20 and 17, and share our home with Ollie the bone-head dog.  I have spent most of my career working on the flight line on fighter aircraft (CF-104s, CF-5s and CF-18s).  I was a Quality Assurance Rep at a defence contractor&amp;#8217;s plant for 5 years and have worked at 19 Wing Comox as the Avionics Shop supervisor for 4 and a half years.  I am a computer software power-user (my 4 Gig hard drive is full) and an avid flight simulator pilot.  I have about 20 hours back-seat time in CF-18 Hornets.  I have instructed courses in the military on Theory of Flight, Inertial navigation and Automatic Flight Controls .  I received two Suggestion Awards for designing/building technical improvements to the CF-18 and its ground Test Equipment. 1 I later measured the distance from my eye to my spread hand to be about 2 ft 3 inches (or about 70.3 cm).   My spread hand from thumb to tip of little finger is 9 inches.  Using this data it should be possible to compute the apparent distance of the object from the bright star. 2 I later approximated this angle and used a protractor to arrive at the 70 degrees elevation.", "((NUFORC Note:  The report is not inconsistent with many reports of celestial bodies that we receive routinely.))At first sight looked like star but kept moving almost in triangle upward motion.  Colors kept changing as it moved upward.  Am not sure exactly when it started but we noticed approxemitely 3-4 wks ago and was a lot further away.  It seems to be getting closer and brighter each night.  Also it seems as though there are smaller objects patroling around it as it moves.  I wish I could get a photo of it but I have tried several cameras, they seem to fade when I get camera.(See summary description)  Also 7/26/99 we were observing the object and disappeared completely.  Now it seemed to have done that the night before but it faded to look almost like a star, but there was still movement from and around the object.  Another detail was that I observed was that 7/26/99 around 23:00 hrs... there was a lot of activity around it more than usual.  At the very least there were 8 of them.  I am working mother of 2 children I am really concerned about all of this activity that is going on,  would like for someone to look into this.  Tried reporting to the proper authorities but was given the run around and directed to your website.  I called my local airport, police and journalism sources but was ignored. (ALSO IF YOUR ORG. WILL ATTEMPT TO CALL ME I AM HOME AFTER 6PM...I SURE HOPE WE CAN FIND OUT WHAT IT IS)", "Friends and self were at a high point in the hills of Hollywood, when strange beams of light flashed the parking area of a lookout point.Sitting in the parking lot of this lookout point, very bright beams of light covered the area. At first, they were flashed at eye level (from where the cars were parked, by the edge of the cliff). The first time, the flashes lasted about 15 secs (and a very strange type of humming/vibration noise was heard/felt when the beams of light were first displayed). The second time, the beams lasted longer. The humming/vibration was only heard/felt when the beams of light were displayed. In other words, when the lights were not beaming, no noise or vibrations were felt/seen. Then, about 2 minutes later, the beams came from directly above, like if the object was directly above us. When it was in front of us, we could not clearly make out the shape of it...the closest object would be a deformed shaped egg. When it was above us, the beams of light, lite up the whole parking area. Before any of this took place, there was no noticeable air traffic in the area. Helicopters are fairly easy to distinguish...and I can honestly say that it was not a helicpoter or anything close to it. There was a total of about 5 or 6 cars in the lot where this took place. The area, generally, is a lookout/makeout point....so it was not odd that there were this many people out at 2:00 in the morning.", "I saw a light streak that I thought was a shooting star except upon further attention it was the wrong color and too thick of a trail.

By the time the image of the triangle appeared in my eye it was gone.  The length of the trail was the length of ones hand if you held it at arms length against the sky.  My first impression of what I saw was that I was seeing the underbelly of a plane or something of that sort, but then when I processed the whole event I realized that it couldn&apos;t have been a plane that close to the land with that configuration and there wouldn&apos;t be a chance to have the underbelly lit like it was.", "Lathorp near Mantica 2:34am Sun 6/20/99 driving W on 205 two mi before city limit of Tracy, approx 1200 ft S of 205 FWY I noted a single glowing white global fireball size of a Union 76 gas station ball descending &amp; burning up in atmosphere downwards free-falling in an scythe blade arc pattern from left to right &amp; disappearing behind hills; clear sky, stars very visible, no moonAt approx 2:34 am on Sunday 6/20/99 I was driving West on the 205 in Lathorp near Mantica in Stanislaus County towards Tracy Calif with a passenger who also witnessed the bright glow of a solid object resembling a glowing white fireball free falling to the earth in an scythe/arc like pattern from left to right as it free fell while evidently in the process of disintegrating in the atmosphere. Object was a firey white globe the size of a Union 76 gas station advertising ball and diminished in size and brightness as it fell a vertical distance some 1000 feet, and disappeared behind the hills south of the 205 FWY, 2 miles east of the Tracy city limits. The evening was perfectly clear and still, no moon visible, many bright stars visible; very little traffic on the FWY at the time except a large McDonald&apos;s Restaurant supply 18 wheeler vehicle who must have also witnessed the event. There were no colours visible either inside or outside of the (single) object, and no impact was noted (assumed to have burned up before hitting ground); no noise noted, although my driver window was all the way down at the time of the sighting. Did not resemble the normal traverse of a bollide meteor, but seemed rather to be some sort of wreckage free falling from space and distintegrating due to contact with earth atmosphere. Did not seem to be intelligently operated, but in a kind of free fall as it disintegrated. No parts of the object seem to fly off, nor were there any sparks of any kind noticed at any time during the event which lasted a total of 5 (five) seconds in duration. Eyes of both driver and passenger were on the general area of the event prior to the event occurring, nor did either of us turn away during any part of its fall but our attention remained fixed on the object. Only one alcoholic beverage was imbibed by driver and passenger that night, approximately 4 hours prior to the event, and both driver and passenger were of &quot;clear minds&quot; and were fully awake and alert both prior and after the event. No other objec! ts were noted accompanying the object which seemed to have appeared out of nowhere, probably gradually gaining brightness as it fell to earth before disintegrating. Only a slight trail was noticed which quickly evaporated. The trail was a pure white with no colours noted. No camera was available for imprinting the image on light sensitive film as it fell.

(THE FHP HAS ONLY BLUE ON THIER LIGHT BARS, WHERE THE LOCAL POLICE HAS RED WHITE AND BLUE. THE WRECKERS USE A YELLOW LIGHT.)

THE VEHICLES WERE TRAVELING AT A RATE OF SPEED, THAT I GUESSED AT 75 TO 80 MPH. I THEN PASSED THE VEHICLES IN THE AREA OF BLANDING BLVD, WHICH IS AN AREA THAT IS WELL LIGHTED. THE SEMI WAS PULLING AN EXTENDED LOW BOY TYPE FLAT BED TRAILER WITH AN UNKNOWN CRAFT ON THE BACK OF IT. THE FRONT HALF OF IT WAS COVERED WITH A TARP THAT WAS LOOSLEY TIED AND WAS FLAPING LOUDLY AT THE TRAILING ENDS.

I FELT THAT THIS CRAFT WAS BEING HAULED AT NIGHT TO CONCEAL WHAT IT WAS. AND THAT THE TARP THROWN OVER THE FRONT OF IT WAS AN AFTER THOUGHT. THE TWIN RINGS APPEARED TO BE SOME TYPE OF PORT, AND APPEARED TO BE ON THE REAR END OF THE CRAFT. I DID NOT SEE ANY BLACKENING AROUND THESE REAR PORTS.

I was facing north, toward Grizzly Peak. There was no sound, no flashing lights as on aircraft wings, the path was not exactly straight, but somewhat wobbly; it was slow, not fast like a meteor; and at the east end of the valley it disappeared as if it had gone behind a cloud, however, it didn&apos;t reappear. At some points in its trajectory it looked blurry. It was too low to be a satellite; it was a constant white light as it drifted from the left of my visual field to my right, as a planet&apos;s light is constant because it is reflected light.

Started moving along road for about 3 minAt first thought it was a helicopter until the three lights I saw were rotating at a rate which a helicopter could not spin and move in one direction.  Slowed down as it got closer and could see a triangle shape wider than it was tall.  The rotating was independent of forward travel as in as it went faster or slower the rotation seemed to be constant.  TAs it turned around and went back the way it came from three helicopters appeared from Fort Bragg direction, one black helicopter and two attack copters, it was dark could not tell what kind.  This gave the final info for me that it was not heli&apos;s, because you could tell the difference.  I turned around and went home which is only about 5 miles from this point.  Got my wife to come outside and bring her telescope, we could not see it again, but the night was filled with the sound of auto cannon fire and machine gun fire.

I took one friend home then the other stayed the night.  I oke up about 3:30am Thursday morning, and felt strange (really hard to explain) and couldnt fall back to sleep so I walked down to the lake to see if I could catch any meteors left from the shower a week back.  As I was laying there (on the cement of the spillway/dam) a light caught my eye across the other side of the lake.  A bluish white light about he size of a basketball zoomed (I say that because it went really fast) over a couple of feet above the water, kinda slowed toward the center, then sped into the trees on the oppisite side.  It had a bright reflection that actually seemed brighter than the object itself and there was no sound at all.  Actually I dont even remember hearing the crickets or splash of water.

My husband and I thought it was a small plane or helicopter until it got close and low to our car.  It then followed us down the road for several miles until we got to our house - then flew off and disappeared.  The craft made no sound and had three large glowing center lights on the bottom.  You could barely see the shape of the craft behind the bright lights but it looked triangular.  The light did not shine onto the car or street.  There was no wind.  Afterward, the Atlanta Journal reported several sightings of this craft around the city during the same week.  My husband remembers the lights to be white in color and I remember them to be muted red, orange, and yellow.  I am curious as to why we have different perceptions about such a memorable sight.  We were extremely frightened because no matter what speed we were going, it hovered directly above us.  We looked out the windows and even stopped to get a better look at one point.  It stopped when we stopped, then continued to follow us when we drove ahead.", "The object was observed by myself and my wife while we were traveling west on I-40.We were traveling west on I-40. When we reached the junction where the high desert decends to the low desert we observed to our right (N.W.) an Oval object hovering in the sky approximately 1/2 mile from us. We were decending from the high desert plateau. I estimate our elevation when we first saw the UFO was approx. 3500&apos; and the UFO was about level with us but hovering over the low desert.  Our view of it when we first saw it was at eye level. It appeared when we first saw it to be Oval and reflecting the sunlight.  We did not see any identifying marks on the object.

A father and son were driving south from Montrose Colorado early one morning to go to work in a Uranium mine in the town of Uravan, Colorado. The son was trying to sleep in the back seat and the father was driving the car. About 20 miles south of town the father saw an odd and brillant light coming from the west over a ridge. (This highway was two lane and in a deep valley the entire distance.) He continued driving wondering what the light could be as the Sun rises on the opposite side of the valley and a plane couldn&apos;t be a light source of this intensity. He drove for a short time longer and at that point the Light broke from behind the mountain and was of such an intensity as to be uncomfortable to look it. He stopped the car and brought it to the attention of his son who had already noticed the light. They got out of the car and paused in total wonder and stark fear as to what this thing could be. It didn&apos;t fit anything they had ever experienced or heard of. At this point other cars had stopped in both lanes of traffic as others became involuntary witnesses to its sheer power. They described the thing as being (roughly oval shaped) of an intense Blueish hue, much like a welder arc but no definite form could be made from it as the light was so bright, sharp images were impossible to see. It filled the entire valley with its light, making the landscape and surrounding hills totally visable. It traveled without sound and at a very slow pace in a West to East direction. Proceeding across the valley and eventually was obscured to vision by the ridge opposite of its entry. They said it was very large and low over the mountain but never gave an estimate as to size. As it escaped from direct view its glow was seen for many minutes as it lazily departed the area. They were both left with a feeling of absolute astonishment to have seen something so unearthly but glad that others had shared this experience. The motorist all spoke for a few moments and had no conclusions as to what it could have been. This father and son only worked at Uravan for a short time after this event but were always unnerved to drive that stretch of road (in darkness or daylight from that point on) dreading a second encounter with this &quot;Thing&quot;.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.  PD))", "((NUFORC Note:  The description is somewhat descriptive of the flash seen from Iridium satellites.  That type of satellite, which is seen frequently from the ground, has flat, highly reflective surfaces, which, if oriented just right to an observer on the ground, can cause a very bright flash in the night-time sky.  NUFORC receives many such reports, but we can only guess.))while stargazing on a moonless night in a rural area both myself and father-in-law observed an intense white-light almost blinding.

Living in the country and sitting out at night we often see meteorites and satelites in the heavens. This was not a meteor !!!! When this object was first viewed it was like looking at a welders torch and was about the size of a dime if held at arms length, it seemed to light up the sky.", "I was standing outside when I saw a light in the distance.  It was very far away, headed in a NE direction.  It was moving very slowly.  At first I thought it was a plane, but when it got closer I wasn&apos;t sure.  I got my binoculars and looked, but it didn&apos;t look like a plane.  After about a minute of watching it with the binoculars, it suddenly disappeared.  I quickly put down the binoculars and saw that it had quickly picked up speed and was now almost out of view.The craft was a flying triangle.  It had seven lights on it that I could see.  It was flying at about normal altitude for a plane.  The lights were a light blue color.  When the craft made its rapid speed increase, the lights became red.  There was only the one object and all it did was fly in a straight line.  When I first saw it, it was moving very slowly.  About half a minute after it had passed over my house, its speed increased so much that it was beyond the horizon in a few seconds.", "((name deleted)), a local reporter for ch.13 tv. news in Las Vegas, videotaped two objects, seen by many, above the new Venetian hotel in Las Vegas, sun. evening.

In zooming in there was some blurring, and distortion, but still a very valuable and interesting piece of video. You can see a definite white light in the middle, with some red and green light coming through, looking at each frame, there does appear to be a contrail of some sort.

I have no clue how fast or big it was but it was amazing.  It was red, yellow, black, and orange.  It went behind a cloud for a few seconds then came back out.

The object was west of me.  It caught my eye as it passed very quickly from cloud to sky.  It didn&apos;t make any sound as far as I could tell, given that I can hear every other aircraft that passes anywhere near, since we&apos;re pretty much under the Sea-Tac and Olympia airport approach flight paths.  No lights were visible from my angle, anyway.  It&apos;s a wonder I noticed it at all given its speed and the dimness of the light.  The speed is what really stood out, and probably what made me notice it.  It was either very small and flying very, very low, or much larger and flying very, very fast.  I think the latter is more probable since I saw it over housetops and trees and it appeared to be some distance away.", "A cloud appeared in the sky, huge, oval in shape, emitting the most amazing magnetic field, shooting lightening out in short spikes around it, sideways, and a light show too.At about 5:30 pm, I noticed this cloud in the sky ahead of me. It was of an odd shape, oval, and huge.  It started emitting spurts of electricity/ lightening. There was no thunder at all.  No rain.  Just, this amazing storm cloud that looked like something out of the philadelphia experiment or close encounters.  The lightening shot out in spurts, sideways. I&apos;ve never seen anything like it before. Then I realized that there was a light show blinking behind the cloud, too. I saw there, mouth open, and in awe, until I finally realized, that blinking was in a pattern. My aunt and I were in agreement, it might sound crazy, but there was no doubt in our mind that it was a mother ship, cloaked. I say this because we pulled over at one point, to watch.  We looked at the clock as we pulled over.  In what we thought was about twenty minutes, we started driving again.  I looked at the clock and realized that it was an hour and twenty minutes. Meanwhile, my husband, in Nevada, has a vision of me on a space ship, with dark eyed aliens getting an exam of sorts on an invisible table where they can move my arms and they just stay, hanging in the air, and my legs, etc. Is that too weird? The light show lasted for about 7 and a half hours. My husband pinpoints his vision at the exact time where we lost an hour. We have had several things happen since this.  When the light show quit, the sky went dark and there was no lightening in the distance. The whole thing just quit, remarkably, after my aunt said, okay, that&apos;s about enough of that.

Daylight.Hovering.15-20 feet long.At about 8:20 PM while driving westbound from Snoqualmie Pass on I-90 I looked out my driver&apos;s side window and noticed an object above and to the side of my vehicle. I estimate that it was about 300-400 feet above the terrain and I was no more than 1000 feet away. What I saw was a solid object which seemed to be a rectangular box-like configuration or maybe a diamond shape, I can&apos;t be to sure of the detail as I only was able to view it for about 10 seconds. It did not seem to be moving but I could not be sure, as I was going at highway speed in its direction. I would estimate its size to be 15-20 feet long and was a dark color with no lights although it was not black as some highlights were visible. It was not a simple rectangle but seemed to have some features on it. I watched it for a few seconds before I realized that it was not an aircraft and then I looked for overhanging power lines or cables or some means of suspension but there were none. At that point it became obvious to me that this was not anything like I had ever seen and it began to dawn on me that I was witnessing something quite out of the ordinary. Unfortunately, within 10 seconds I could not see it anymore as I had passed it by. I strained to see it in my rear view mirror but I could not see it again. I did not pull over because of heavy traffic. It took a few seconds to process what I saw because it was so hard to believe what I was seeing. It seemed so ordinary yet an object (a box, no less) just doesn&apos;t hover in mid air, but there it was. I tried to tell my wife what I was seeing but she could not see it from her side of the car. This was a daylight sighting, although the sun was already below the horizon there was still plenty of light. I am very familiar with aircraft and have never made a sighting like this before. I know what I saw but I don&apos;t know what I was looking at. I am at a loss to explain what this was. I don&apos;t have the slightest idea what I saw.

When we pulled up i got out of the car, and i looked up in the sky because something caught my attention.  When i looked up i saw a star like object swurving around, in an irregular pattern so it was not a meteor, comet, astroid or plane. Then of all the sudden an American aircraft appeared, i do not know if it was a commercial, or an army because it did look like a commercial but i swear i saw a side-winder missle on it. Then the cylinder shaped object appeared.

On Friday July 23 at 2.am, 6 of us walked outside to see a bright light in the eastern sky.  It was moving in a sporadic manner, as a fire fly would,although its light never died out.  At first its distance appeared to be up at the level of the trees, hence, the metaphor with the fire fly.  As we walked closer to it, we realized it was way up in the sky, at the distance an airplane might fly.  Its light was brighter than any star or planet and it emitted 3 major points of light. That is to say that it had an overall glow but it appeared to the squinted eye as three rays. The size of its light was at least 10 times bigger than any star.  The light continued to move in different directions although the movement was subtle, in that it did not cover large portions of the sky.  If you were to hold a ruler straight out it was moving within an area of two square inches.  However, we watched it for a good 45 minutes and it had changed its position in the sky by at least a foot.  Its movement was jagged in that it kind of oscillated back and forth but gained overall movement in one direction.  At certain times it moved steadily and there was one period of time where it moved in circular or elliptical fashion in a somewhat more energetic and less regular manner.

It was a very clear night, no cloud to speak of. There was no sound. I am a social worker and work with adolescent sex offenders.

PD))", "I was taking photo&apos;s of Contrails with my Digital camera, taking pictures facing north, east and then to the south when I captured the UFO.This is from an interview I had  on 5/28/99.... 5/28/99 Phoenix, Arizona -- At 10 AM on Friday, May 7, 1999, 48-year-old man was experimenting with his new Kodak DC-200 digital camera in front of his Phoenix, Arizona home. He was puzzled by the number of contrails, some in X-shapes, and aimed the camera sequentially moving around the sky. He did not realize until he went to his computer to download the digital images that he had captured unidentified aerial craft in one frame identified as Dcp00102, shown below. The frame Dcp00101 which preceded it by only a couple of seconds is also shown below. Not only are the objects unidentified, but there is another mystery: why aren&apos;t the objects visible in frame Dcp00101? Here is the man, a Phoenix salesman, describing his first hand experience that morning: Phoenix, Arizona: &quot;I&apos;ve been kind of interested in the contrails and been taking pictures of them for the last several months. And so, I looked up into the sky and the sky was just full of contrails that morning, including an X which - I&apos;ve seen a lot of contrails up there, but not an X every single time. So, I was taking pictures starting from the north and then turning clockwise and I probably took about six to eight pictures and wound up kind of facing to the south, southwest, with my last picture. And about an hour later, I went to the computer and downloaded them into the computer and I was looking at them to see if there was anything I would like to put on my web page. I&apos;ve put most of the of the contrails I&apos;ve taken on my web page. As I went through them starting with the first picture heading towards the last picture, they were pretty much typical with the contrail in there and what I had expected to be seeing. And then I got to the last picture, or next to last (turns out it was last), and I saw something in that picture and it was definitely unexpected. WHAT DID YOU SEE? When I first looked at this, it looked almost like a round, metallic ball in the sky. I kind of focused in over the roof of my next door neighbor&apos;s house and just outside one of the clouds up there and fairly close to one of the contrails, there was this round, metallic, ball-looking thing. And then right next to that, fairly close to it, there was a dark spot on the film. And as I zoomed in on it, I could still see what appeared to be kind of a round metallic object up there, but then the two dark spots - or actually, the dark spot - looked like TWO dark spots. It looked to me as if it could be a couple of military jets. They were dark in color whatever they were. They were kind of in the shape of an aircraft. AND IN YOUR PHOTO WHICH I&apos;M LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW, THEY ARE QUITE CLOSE. AND WHAT PUZZLES ME - YOU WERE TAKING PHOTOGRAPHS WITH THIS NEW CAMERA, SO YOU WERE CONCENTRATING ON THE NEW CAMERA. BUT DID YOU NOT HEAR THE SOUND OF JETS? No. no. One other thing I was going to mention - there was another photo I took, I think it was the one just before this that has that same cloud in it. It&apos;s just slightly moved from that location. But, in that picture there was nothing other than that same cloud. You could see the form of it. You can tell it&apos;s the same cloud. AND WHAT TIME PERIOD DO YOU THINK IS BETWEEN THE TWO PHOTOS? Oh, it was just a couple of seconds. About the time it takes for the camera to regenerate to the next shot. I THINK THAT&apos;S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO SHOW THAT WHATEVER HAPPENED IN THE SECOND PHOTOGRAPH DID NOT SEEM TO BE IN THE FIRST PHOTOGRAPH TWO SECONDS BEFORE. Right. AND THAT WOULD MAKE BOTH OBJECTS, THE BLACK AND THE ROUND OBJECT, ANOMALOUS. Yes. HAVE YOU EVER SEEN ANYTHING ANOMALOUS IN THE SKIES BEFORE THIS PHOTOGRAPH ON MAY 7TH OF THESE UNUSUAL OBJECTS IN THE CONTRAILS? PHOENIX LIGHTS, March 13, 1997: Well, yes, as a matter of fact on March 13, 1997, when what came through here they are now calling the &quot;Phoenix Lights.&quot; I was a witness to that also. TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED. OK. I was going to a friend&apos;s house. It was just a little after dark, probably somewhere between 8 and 8:30 in the evening. So, it was fairly dark out at that time of year. And I pulled up in front of his house and was just turning the car off, just about to get out and I looked out my driver&apos;s side window and I saw four lights in the sky. Maybe about 3,000 to 4,000 feet up in the air. And they were just huge, bright lights. They appeared to be maybe a couple of miles from where I was. But what was unusual about it was that they were in the shape of a diamond - like with one light at the top and one at each side and one at the bottom. So, I kept looking trying to figure out, &apos;What is this?&apos; Because I had never seen anything like this before. And I noticed they were coming straight down out of the sky. They were all coming down at the same time, so it wasn&apos;t like they were individual objects. They appeared to be all moving at the same rate of speed which was actually fairly slow. LIKE FOUR LIGHTS ON SOME SORT OF A LARGE OBJECT THAT WAS THE SHAPE OF A DIAMOND? Right. OR AT LEAST THE LIGHTS WERE IN THE CONFIGURATION OF A DIAMOND ON A LARGE OBJECT? Right. More like that actually. And so I was trying to figure out in my mind, &apos;What is this?&apos; and what came to mind was that it might be a commercial jetliner in a nose dive headed toward the ground. But then I thought that can&apos;t be because it was moving too slow. And I just didn&apos;t know what it was. And as it continued down, I kept thinking I was going to see this gigantic ball of flames burst up when it hits the ground. Then it just kind of disappeared behind the house across the street from where I was. Then I couldn&apos;t see it any longer. Then this turned out to be the Phoenix Lights. As the story goes, they came from outside of Phoenix from the north headed down through Phoenix and kind of turned and headed out towards the Tucson area. And there&apos;s just been people all over the city and state who have seen these. And evidently, that&apos;s what I saw.&quot;", "I witnessed 2 unusual and unidentifiable light sources in the sky above Denver. It was an unseasonably warm September evening, no clouds, no wind.I was leaving my sister&apos;s apartment and speaking to the manager. 2 bright white lights caught my attention to the north-west, approx. the distance of an approaching aircraft. The lights seemed to &quot;turn&quot; as if in a sweeping gesture, and &quot;crossed&quot; each other in what appeared to be a figure eight. They stopped, one making a sharp move &quot;downward&quot;, the other repeated the move back up. The lights &quot;crossed each other again and &quot;disappeared&quot; in one move towards the N.E. I turned to the manager, who also witnessed the lights, and we were both dumbstruck. Although we are quite close to the airport, I believe that the maneuvers displayed by this light would be impossible for any commercial plane, or helicopter. The lights were steady, unlike the movement of a searchlight on a helicopter, or headlight on an aircraft. These lights were dancing, almost playing with each other. The apartment manager was approx. 38-42 years old, wearing glasses. I was 26 years old, no eyewear. I was a retail manager. Neither of us were drinking or smoking, both of us were clear-headed and completely lucid at the time of the event.", "A large circular orange light which moved to the north, then south, north again the up until it dissapeared.My name is ((name deleted)). On the early morning of  07/18/99 at about 4:10am I was on a dark rural road very near my home when I noticed a lighted object from my drivers side window (See house.jpg).  My first thought was that someone was launching a hot air balloon from the back of a house. The object I saw was clearly very near to the ground because I could easily see the outline or black silhouette of the roof of the house in front of the object. The weather was warm and visibility was good. There was overcast and you could not see any stars nor the moon. I was heading North East on a street called North Iris Lane when I noticed this well lit orange circle of light from behind a house which was no more than 300 yards away from my vantage point. Again, my first thought was a hot air balloon and the glow from someone filling it with hot air. I kept looking out my drivers side window but as I drove I lost sight of the object as my sight was now obscured by homes and trees to my left. When I reached the stop sign about 150 yards from where I first noticed the object, I made a left turn and saw that the object was no longer at ground level but now was clearly in the sky and heading in a North West direction. I never leave the house without my digital camera and when I turned the corner I stopped my car and grabbed it. The camera I used was an Olympus D-400 Digital Zoom camera. It took a few seconds to open the lens cover, when I looked through the viewfinder I feared that the light from the street lamp in front of me would not allow for a good shot. I therefore waited till the object was just above the lamp post and took a picture (see pic1.jpg). I waited all of an additional 3 seconds and took another picture pointing in the same direction (see pic2.jpg). The object I saw was not bright, the best way to describe it was if you&apos;ve seen Close Encounters of the Third Kind, the blue light that followed the space ships except that this light was a dull orange in color instead of blue. After I took two pictures I s! aw the object stop moving up and to the North and changed directions to up and South. It stopped about 3 seconds later then started to head back North and to the West. About 3 seconds later the object just starting heading straight up at a consistent rate of speed. Rather than just stand there I got back in truck made a right turn into our town home complex and stopped my car in front of my house. When I got out I could still see the object still heading up and getting farther away. I went inside grabbed my wife out of bed and insisted she come outside NOW! When we got outside I pointed to the sky and said &quot;look do you see that?&quot; she said yes and asked what it was. At this point it looked like a very bright star and was very far away. We both stood there for the next 5 to 10 seconds and watched as it passed through the overcast. It got smaller and smaller when finally we could no longer see it. We both looked around and you could not see any stars in the sky. I pulled my car into my driveway and immediately called the Escondido Police Department. The woman who answered the phone listened , chuckled and told me to call an 800 number. When I did, I got a recording for the TV show &quot;Unsolved Mystery&apos;s&quot;. I called her back, gave her a sarcastic thanks and asked her to take my name and number in the event anyone else reported anything. I went out this morning during daylight and took a couple of pictures from the road where I first saw the object behind a house (house.jpg). Using PhotoShop I made a orange circle which represents the size and color of what I first thought was a hot air balloon (house-ufo.jpg). I also took a couple of pictures of where the object was just above the lamp post on the street adjacent to my home (see pic1-day.jpg).  Again using PhotoShop I made a circle to show you the size and color of the object prior to it moving South, then NW and up (pic1-day-ufo.jpg). On a side note my wife had mentioned that our neighbor had approached her only 2 or 3 days before and asked her if she had seen anything strange in the skies. I have given our neighbor your number and she said she would call you as apparently she claims to have seen a UFO as well. My apologies for such a long winded description but I get excited every time I think about what I saw. I am very open minded and would be stupid to think that we are alone in the universe. However I have never really believed in us being visited by something outside of our planet. In other words I was a true skeptic until last night. I have gone over the encounter many times in my head and cannot find any reasonable explanation for what I saw. Now man made object that I&apos;m aware of could do what I saw this thing do. In the event you are wondering let me answer a few questions that others have asked me. There was no sound at all. This orange circle was consistent in color and did not change. There were no other colors present and there was no blinking. It was not a blinding bright but rather a dull fiery orange. I saw no background objects (no spaceships or anything like that) I do not do drugs. Thanks for allowing me to share this incident. I do not care what others think since I know what I saw and that is all that matters to me. You have my full permission to use what I have just written and make available my email address should anyone want to contact me.", "slow moving, low altitude saucer heading N by NW, moving in a straight line, very steady.  The disk seemed to be round but would at times appear flat as well, no larger than a nickel held at arms length, but still under the clouds.My wife and I were eating our customary lunch on the road after purchasing the food from Maruta, a Japanese grocery in the George town district.  We sat on a curb between Maruta and a Seafirst Bank, next to an on Ramp for I-5 a routine we&apos;ve gone through several times in the past. One of the attractions ofcourse is the planes landing at King County Airport. After most of the meal I was looking up at the sky watching another plane come in when I noticed a dust spot on a cloud.  I kept watching it to figure out what it was.  Not being able to determine it, I asked my wife what she thought. She insisted it was a bird, but after careful scrutiny, realized it was round and had no movement as a bird might make, such as wings.  Also, at this point we had been watching it a couple of minutes and it was moving in a straight line, no doubts.  No bird can move that straight. We discussed wether or not it was a plane, of which there was one in the sky to compare with and decided no. Aside from the shape, there was absolutely no sound emanating from the object.  A balloon, maybe, but at times it seemed flat and not round, as if it were a CD slowly spinning.  LET ME POINT OUT THAT THIS ANALAGY IS NOT ACCURATE&lt; IT IN NO WAY SEEMED LIKE A SPINNING OBJECT. That merely describes the transition between the round appearance and the flat. While watching, it appeared once my eyes adjusted to the sky&apos;s light, that the disk was not black as first appeared but rather a charcoal grey, my wife however maintains that it was black. As it slowly moved towards a cloud, one with shape, not the usual cloudy Seattle sky, I started telling my wife it was a UFO.  She kept saying no, there is some explanation and was remaining very calm. I however was trying to get her to follow the UFO as it was moving by us. She threw away our trash, and started the car, we headed West on Bailey from Maruta&apos;s parking lot, the North on Corson Ave, but saw nothing, it was gone. I spent the next fifteen minutes trying to determine the time and direction of the sighting since we had neither a watch or map with us.  I think the information given here is accurate and correct.  Please call me for any other info you may need.  I will be checking the web sight regularly for further occurances by others. Thank you, ((name deleted))r", "On the morning of approximately August 08, 1998 I along with a friend were fishing at the mouth of the Puyallup River where it empties into Commencement Bay. The sky was partly sunny, the sun had broken through the clouds when a fast moving shadow, as if something was passing between us and the sky, but without the sound one would expect to hear from a plane or aircraft flying over.  I looked out from underneath the boat canopy and saw a translucent object somewhat oval/diamond shaped that refracted the light as in having the appearance of reflecting the surrounding sky.  It was in the open sky and traveling from north to south for approximately one minute, before dissapearing into the clouds. I would calculate the speed as near 300 miles per hour. I am convinced that this object is not one of ours, having lived here my entire life and having seen all aircraft types in the McCord Airforce Base area. I would say the the object was cloaked. The closest thing to the appearance of this object I have ever witnessed was the visual immagery used to create the creature in the movie &quot;Predator&quot;.", "Cigar shaped object,  reflective silver/white in color seen moving silently through the sky.The craft was observed by myself, a Psychiatric/Mental Health nurse and my friend, a Computer Digital Imager. I am 48 yrs. old, and my friend is 51. We were in the yard working in the garden. My friend saw the object first and called my attention to it. The day had been warm and sunny, with no clouds. There had been some air traffic earlier, just a couple of small planes. The air space above our home is not in the flight path of the local airport. We were not able to determine distance of the craft.  It was moving slower than a passenger jet, but faster than a small plane. We were both struck by the fact that the crat was completely silent, had no wings, no tail fin, no contrail. Atmospheric displacement noted extending around craft, rather sphere like in shape. The sky was clear, no clouds.", "A bright, steady light traversed the sky over my area from SSW to ENE. It appeared to be at great altitude be cause the light seemed to be entirely reflected light.  It was visible for approximately 2 minutes.I am a disabled veteran who served in the United States Air Force for 8 years.  I have been an avid aircraft enthusiast since a small boy. I am 42 years old. On the night of this sighting, I was out closing up my workshop for the night. It was very clear out with no moon or clouds.  I was facing south while walking into the house.  I always like to look at the stars and happened to notice a bright one straight up to the south. It was gold in color with the same brightness as Venus after sunset. It was then that I notice that it was moving to the east-northeast at a rapid speed. The light was constant and bright, no flicker.  As it traversed across my fied of vision it went behind the top floor of my home.  I ran around to the front yard and continued to follow its path across the sky.  By now it was to the east of me and it suddenly gave off a bright flash of reflected light as from a mirror. It then started to decrease in brightness as it disappeared over the Sierra Nevada Mountains.  I note that the light remained steady as I viewed it from its aft end. No afterburners, or other lights were seen.  I have seen the same kind of light twice before only traveling from due west to due east in the predawn hours.", "I observed a green,circular light travel across my field of view while near a potato field at night.At the time of my sighting, I was a two-year veteran of the USAF.  My home of Caribou, Maine, at the time, was home to Loring AFB, a Strategic Air Command base.  I have since retired from the Air Force after 21.5 years.  The area is extremely rural and remote, Caribou being the largest city in northern Maine.  I had returned home on leave and was out on a date.  We parked near some railroad tracks and had a view of the horizon, as created by hilly potato field.  The sun was down but you could make out the horizon line.  I saw a circular light approximately the size of a dime held at arms length, travel across my field of vision, above the horizon line.  It was green, hazy on the edges and traveled across my field of view and disappeared below the horizon in 5 to 10 seconds.  Being familiar with aircraft and having seen numerous meteorites in the area, I determined that it could not have been either.  It moved to slow to be a meteorite and had no characteristic lights that would mark it as an aircraft.  No sound was heard.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.  PD))", "At 04:00 hours flying NE to SW, two white egg shape objects, flashing off and on.At 04:00 hours, I woke up to a flash of white light over our mountain top, about three seconds later I saw another flash, then I saw a egg shape white object fly over the mountain coming from the NE flying to the SW. After a second or two, another object with the same description followed behind and to the side of the first object.  I saw the white light that seem to make up the objects flash on and off for about six seconds.((NUFORC Note:  One of several reports from same source in Grants Pass.  PD))", "Witnessed two light sorces while campingWe were camping in Northern Washoe, watching the stars and pointing out satelites.  I turned to look at the Big Dipper when I saw an incredibly bright pure white light - when I told our buddies to look, it faded away, then suddenly it flashed on again, it did this a couple times, while traveling slowly by the dipper&apos;s edge.  Then we saw another object off to the right of the orignial, completely still, that gave off an blinding bright flash, three times.  It was so unbelievably bright, we just stood there completely dumbfounded! The original object, now faded, then gave one last flash, which appeared to be triangular in shape. They both then just seemed to fade away.  After about 10 minutes later, we saw one of the objects moving from North to South, giving two flashes then dissapeaing again.  In comparison to several satelites we watched that night, these were bigger and much brighter.  They moved slowly, and seemed to have stopped.  The flashes  were uncomparable to anything I have ever seen.", "high speed vehicles traveling north by northwest, spanning the horizon in seconds.I drive a truck in the state of Ohio the same route everynight. at first I thought it was a glare of other vehicles through the winshield, but it happened everynight for about 2weeks back in 1998 I knew it was no glare.

I have seen the same vehicles starting last week again. only on one night did I spot two of them running  together at a much slower rate but faster than any airplane that i have ever seen fly. The lights on the two together was a constant light moving across the sky. The lights on the much faster flying objects either was the exhaust or the friction of the air because I would see them only when they were about to cross in front, I would catch the glow then you could see them until they disappeared only to be a second or two after they cross infront. I even stopped one night at the location to see if they would cross and they did with no noise, not even after they were gone. no sonic boom or anything( the crickets still chriped as it flew over)approx heading was about a 230-240 degree northwest. no shape could be seen, the lights was a constant white light.

It sped much faster than any aircraft I have ever seen, appearing from the southwest and racing in ascending path toward the north (it appeared at approximately 30-35 degrees off the horizon, and climbed to approximately 50-55 degrees).  Then, about two seconds later, it simply vanished.  It didn&apos;t diminish in size, or fade, or slow down.  It was just gone, leaving no trace behind.  In terms of how close it was to me, I can only estimate.  I am five miles from Dulles Airport, in a flight path for that airport, and this object was between me and Dulles.  I&apos;d say it was no more than a mile from where I stood, probably closer than that, and no more than 5000 feet in altitude, and probably less than that.  Its actual size I estimate to be about that of a passenger jet (a Boeing 727 or thereabouts). The sky was crystal clear that night.  In fact, it was probably the clearest sky we&apos;ve had here all year.  Many stars were visible that are not, usually.  I was on my balcony at the time of the sighting, and I spend a lot of time there, sky-watching.  I&apos;m very familiar  with the kinds of aircraft that usually swarm about this area, and watch them all, in order to become familiar enough with them that I won&apos;t be fooled by one into thinking I&apos;ve seen a genuine UFO when it is, in fact, an airplane.  The object I saw on this night went incomprehensibly fast, and was absolutely without sound, and I know it was not any kind of conventional aircraft.  The fact that it was ascending indicates it was not a meteorite, and I learned later that an Iridium flare traveled the same route as my object, but three minutes AFTER I saw the object.  Having gotten the URL to a website which gives times of Iridium flare flyovers, I went out to see one the next night, and I did see one, and can say with certainty that what I saw on June 22nd was NOT an Iridium flare.  I just do not know what it was. One other detail about the object: it was the brightest white light I have ever seen, and it had a pale blue rim that blended into the white light.  The overall effect was of a &quot;bluish-white&quot; light.", "Spherical craft hovered over baseball stadium, made series of rapid manuevers, then flew away extremely fast. Rotating disc appeared, approached slowly then disappeared.On July 10th at the baseball stadium in San Diego, I saw a UFO during the game. I am a telepath and a clairvoyant, so when I heard the message to &quot;look up; you I might see a UFO&quot;, the only reason I hesitated was because I didn&apos;t want to look silly staring up at the sky while everybody else was looking at the game. I heard an airplane overhead, so that gave me a good excuse to look up. I looked above the plane and saw what appeared to be a white sphere. At this point I removed my sunglasses and put on my prescription sunglasses so that I could see clearly and they are not as dark. At first, I thought it must be a balloon except it remained stationary. Fortunately, three balloons were then released, so I then had the opportunity to compare the shape and movement of the balloons with the perfectly stationary, perfectly round sphere. My boyfriend was sitting directly in front of me. I discreetly asked him to look at the object and tell me what he thought it was. He said it was probably a balloon. I said I didn&apos;t think so and asked him to observe it for a while. About two minutes later he said, adamantly, &quot;That is NOT a balloon! It flashed!&quot; There was a girl sitting next to us. She asked what we were looking at. I told her it was a UFO, so then she began to observe its behavior, also. The UFO then disappeared for about a minute. It then reappeared, but it was now a little closer. About a minute later, it disappear again. It then reappeared, again. I decided to communicate with. I told them that I loved them and would they please come closer and prove to me that it was actually an extraterrestrial spacecraft. What followed next was truly incredible for me. It made a series of 90 degree angles and zigzags in rapid succession, ending with an exit to the left at an incredibly high rate of speed. It took my breath away. About a minute later, I observed another craft appear in the area from which the first one exited. This one had a flatter or disc-like shape as it moved toward me. It was extremely bright and sparkly, and rotated like a mirrored disco ball. It was absolutely gorgeous. After about two minutes, it just blinked out and did not reappear any more. I quickly called a UFO investigator on my cel phone so that I could have a record of the time.", "Large cigar shaped craft seen stationary at high altitude.

One of my Uncles suddenly said &quot;what the heck is that&quot; and pointed up to the NW. There was a dark, red cigar shaped object that appeared motionless in the sky. It seemed to be at very high altitude, perhaps spanning an inch at arms length, but I had the impression that it was very large.

Aprox 15 minutes later, 3 objects of the same intensity shot across the sky from E to W in a &quot;V&quot; formation right through the big dipper.  The 3 objects were initially traveling in an consistant pattern, then the objects &quot;arched&quot; around each other - almost making circles around each other, but still going straight W.  They were traveling much too fast to be commercial aircraft at a speed seemingly half that of a shooting star, but with movements much more sophistocated than a shooting star.  Both the events were witnessed by  two of us for several seconds before they disappeared - quickly fading out. Both observers were sober, and both observe the stars on  a regular basis.   We stayed outside for another hour hoping to see a recurrance, or another event.  We did see numerous shooting stars and satellites also that night.

I have never associated these fires with anything other than dry brush until April of this year.  As we were returning home my fiancee and I noticed a rather large fire that was in the shape of a near perfect rectangle roughly a quarter of a mile high, with a smaller circular fire off to the right of the rectangle.  Standing on Shore Rd. in Brooklyn you could clearly see the red rotating lights from the fire engines on scene but the location must have been a challenge as there is aparently no access to the area, the land on either side of the bridge is a very steep grade that does not allow any vehicle parking much less a fire engine and there is a great disance between the water and the portion of the hill that was on fire. We agreed with two other people wathcing the fire from Shore Rd. that it was peculiar place and time of year for a spontaneous brush fire and that it must have been intentionally set. But by whom? Unless a passenger on a passing ship was able to throw a huge molotov cocktail a distance of approx. 7500 feet it was difficult to imagine how this could have been accomplished.  My fiancee suggested that it may have been set by a ufo during takeoff. Given all that occurred, that sounded more plausible than any other explanation.  I was not aware of the numerous sighting in that particular area of Brooklyn until I read other reports listed in this database. Perhaps this occurrence was related.", "On this date I was driving,(I am a Trucker) north on U.S. 395 between Pasco and Ritzville Wa at about 10:30 pm when I saw an orange ball I thought at first was a meteor but it traveled to slow to be one, but I remember me and my son watching one a few years back in Idaho where I live and everyone said it was a meteor, so I thought nothing of it until last night I heard the Indian man talking about the Orange sphere over in Washington state and if im not wrong it was about the same time I saw that thing in our skies, any way thats what I saw. It was probably about 20 feet across but I couldnt be sure it was going from east to west and it had a long blue&#x5C;orange streak behind it. and it went behind the hills to the northwest of my position that would be about 26 miles south of I-90 on U S 395.A huge Orangish Ball, Drifting across the sky from east to west Landing behind some hills.", "Hovering teardrop type shape with vertical &quot;smokestack&quot; coming out of top,  Driving west on I-80, witnessed it dissapear.While driving west on I80 at about 0720 I saw a strange shape hovering to the southwest it was somewhat teardrop shaped although it was more like an old coffee pot. It had a vertical &quot;smokestack&quot; coming out of the top of it that was white. The body alternated dark on the top which sloped to a point like a roof, the middle was white with vertical sides and the bottom was dark and rounded like a bowl.  I estimate it&apos;s size at 100 feet tall and 60 feet wide.  It hovered, rising and settling verticaly and drifting to the southwest.  I was watching when it disappeared the first time. It darkened like a shadow fell across it and then their was a blur of sideways motion and it was gone.  I continued to search the sky for it as I continued west on I-80 and as I topped a hill there it was hanging in the sky again where before there was nothing.  I continued watching it rise and settle as it drifted to the west.  It seemed to be parrelleling the Interstate.

If our surmise is incorrect, we will change the date back to 15MR97 at a future date.))Airline pilot views Phoenix lights from Interstate 10, while driving to work.I have recently discovered your site and have enjoyed perusing it&apos;s contents. I read with some interest your report on the &quot;Phoenix Lights&quot; as I was a witness to their passage on the night in question. I am a pilot with one of the major carriers here in the valley and I live in the South Mountain area. On that night I was on my way to work and traveling north along interstate 10 at approximately 8:15 PM. The lights first appeared to me to be over the airport in a wide formation and traveling in a southerly direction, roughly over the interstate. There is no question that they were anomalous, they got my attention immediately, and I was concerned enough about distractedly weaving into other traffic while observing them, that I pulled off the interstate to watch them go overhead. Where my account seems to differ from the accounts of other witnesses is that I perceived the lights to be individual objects, five in all, traveling in a roughly triangular formation. As they passed overhead, I took note of a particularly bright star and noted that the star was never obscured by any solid object as the lights passed it. When the lights were directly overhead, they appeared to be comprised of two lights per object, the bright light in the direction of motion and a much fainter light immediately behind it. There was no variation in the color of the lights and no blinking or twinkling. It was very difficult to judge the altitude of the objects, as they were never more than pinpoints of light moving very slowly; if I had to guess, I would say they were at very high altitude. I know this is at odds with some of the more dramatic reports of a gigantic dark object, but I am certain that I am not mistaken. Being a pilot, I am a trained observer of lighted airborne objects and, while these lights were indeed strange, there is no doubt in my mind that they were individual objects and not the running lights on some single large object.", "((NUFORC Note:  The time indicated may be somewhat flawed, but that is only a guess.

Saw the first one move from approx north to south and approximately 30 seconds later, second glow moved accross the sky in nearly the same pattern.  About 30 seconds later, the same glow moved across the sky in a east to west motion.  From horizon to horizon, the event lasted less than 10 sec.  I know it was not a star, sattelite, meteor, plane or firework.  I am not a staunch believer in aliens although I think it ridiculous to dismiss the notion of other life forms.  Please explain my sighting!!!", "Moving light,decending,turned on large flood light,silent,light faded out and object pulled back and proceeded upwards very high at a steep angle.  We were enjoying a backyard campfire at the time.I own a carpet cleaning business in meadville, Pa.  My son who was visiting with his family for the holiday has a degree in marketing and works in that field.  I first observed the light moving across and downward.  It was the magnitude of a large star.  The light was constant and consistent as it moved.  I brought it to the attention of my son.  At that moment the object appeared to turn downward and grew very bright .  I could only describe it as a super flood light. It hovered there for a few seconds and the light dimmed down and almost out as if it were turned down by a rheostat switch.  The object pulled back out and upward at a sharp angle.  Ot had a dim light and went out. We disussed the possibilities and concluded that what we saw was intelligently maneuvered and the light was artificial.", "We where at a drive in movie, it was my family and my fiance.  My mother first noted the objects.  Due to her recent outpatient surgery and her consumption of pain medication we ignored her when she first told us about the lights.  About ten minutes into the first movie I noticed small lights maneuvering strangely in the sky.  I quickly asked everyone else if they saw it too. To my astonishment they had been watching it for a while.  The objects where very fast and made pinpoint turns. Sometimes they flew in formations, sometimes they flew irradically.  They almost seemed to be chacing each other sometimes. Then other times they would be completely stationary.  They looked almost like fireflies.  Thats what I dismissed them as at first.  But then when a small cloud flew over i noticed that they where far above it. They seemed to be in space. I think this because at times they would fly in a large circle moving away from me and then back towards me.  When they flew to the backside of the circle they would dissapear, then a second later they would reapear on the opposite side.  Finally after about an hour of these acrobatics another craft appeared.  It was the same as the others and it approached them from the center of the sky.  When it came close to them they all stopped moving.  They remained motionless untill the other craft joined them. Then one by one they quickly streeked out of sight.", "Bright orange light traveling North-West.My wife and I had just gone to bed at about 11:45 P.M.  Within a few minutes my mother rushed in and knocked on our bedroom door.  She said there was a large orange light outside and to come look.  She had gone outside to try to find Saturn with binoculars when she saw the light.  When I got outside,  I saw it almost direcly overhead, slightly South of my house.  It was moving slowly towards the North-West,  and looked like a single,  very bright orange light.  I looked through the binoculars and could see that it was actually several lights.  It looked like it was wedge shaped on the leading edge,  with some more lights behind the wedge,  perhaps a total of 10-12 lights.  I only looked through the binoculars for a second or two and immediately went in to get the camcorder.  Unfortunately,  the recorded image was poor, and I ran out of tape after only about 30 seconds.  I never got to see it again to get more detail,  my last sighting was through the camera.  It appeared to head off about 10-15 miles from the house,  at which time lights started dropping from the object.  It faded from view shortly after that.  The total time it was visible was at most 5 minutes.  Both my wife, and my mother said they could see some structure above the lights when they viewed it in the binoculars.  They said it looked like it was some sort of fabric material,  similar to a balloon.  There was no basket under it, and it never made a sound or the typical glow of a hot air balloon.  None of us thought it could be a hot air balloon,  but maybe some other type of balloon such as a weather balloon.  Altho I don&apos;t know why it would have the lights on it that we all saw or why it would have been launched so late at night.", "cigar shaped bright blue light shot across the sky and a trail followedi was taking my brother to work on 107th ave heading north by 64th street,when we saw a cigar shaped blueish green thing shot across the sky it was a obvious thing it could of not been unnoticed it had a trail that followed it it was heading in a north east direction and dissapeared.", "These five objects were about 300 to 600 feet above the ground, may 1/4 mile from us.These objects were not moving at first, appeared to have a blue color.

I was driving west and the evening star was almost directly in front of me at 1 o&amp;#8217;clock. The object also appeared to be between my location (Moses Lake) and the Cascade Mountains. Appearance=Clearly spherical, not self-illuminated though much brighter than the evening star. Actions=Stationary, though the color/shadow changes indicated it was possibly rotating. Setting=Evening, the sun was going down but not yet behind the mountains.  It was still clearly daylight.  In the west was the evening star I have become accustomed to at about 1 o&amp;#8217;clock.  A mountain range was in the background to the west.  The sun was to my right about 20-40 degrees. Description=I had noticed a bright evening star in early July and concluded it was probably Mars so I was in the habit of observing the stars when I was out each evening. On July 25, as I was driving home through the state of WA I noticed what I thought was a second bright star in the West while I approached the Moses Lake area. I noticed that this new &quot;star&quot; was larger (3X) than the star I had concluded was Mars and instead of being of uniform luminescence it changed appearance as though I were seeing shadows and other visual effects as objects shift in position and the sun reflects from them differently. I did not think much of this since I have basically considered the odds of my seeing a UFO as approaching 7 sigma however I noticed that as my car came up out of the Moses lake area (the highway is somewhat lower as you pass through the city) the object was completely gone. So, in a matter of 30 - 60 seconds the object disappeared.  Clearly, if this were a star (especially considering how bright it was) this would not be the case. It was also clearly spherical which would largely eliminate conventional craft. I was able to observe the object for only a couple minutes before I dropped down into Moses Lake.

I remember because it was the first day of the St. Mary&apos;s University Oyster bake, which kicks off Fiesta Week in San Antonio. My (ex)girlfriend and I had been near my parent&apos;s office.  She was with me while I was surveilling a claimant at an apartment complex off of Loop 410.  At the time, I was working as an investigator for the family business.  I worked on insurance cases:  worker&apos;s comp and auto liability. We had left the complex and were at my parent&apos;s office, which was nearby:  ((address deleted)) Executive Center.  We&apos;d planned for me to pickup a van there.  I&apos;d drive it over to my parents&apos; house and name deleted))(my girlfriend) would follow in my car.  While in the parking lot, we noticed a weird looking object in the sky west of us, in the direction of my parents&apos; place.  The object was silver-gray and metallic.  It was shaped like a conical disc seen in profile.  It seemed very big. We got into the vehicles after wondering about it briefly.  Since we were going in the same direction as the house (the house is about 1.5 miles from the office, &quot;as the crow flies&quot;, but about 2 miles away after all the twists in the road.) I decided to keep my eye on the &quot;thing.&quot;  So did ((name deleted)), as it turned out.  All the way home, the thing didn&apos;t seem to move.  That is, it seemed stationary.  And as we got closer to the house, we could see more of it, as if we were getting closer and closer to being under it.  The thing looked to be as high in the air as it was far away from the office.  At arms length, I&apos;d say it would be about the size of a silver dollar, maybe bigger. By the time we got to the house, we were underneath it.  Diane had parked behind me.  I got out of the car to look up at the &quot;thing&quot;.  I could see the underside, and there were structures there, but the underside seemed &quot;hazy&quot;.  Blurred.  And I had the odd feeling that I was forgetting what the underside looked like even while I was looking directly at it.  Weird. Now, the whole time I was driving home, I kept telling myself to stop, go to my car (which Diane was following me in) and grab my damn camera.  It&apos;s crazy, but for some reason I almost &quot;couldn&apos;t.&quot;  Very strange.  So, when we arrived at the house, I parked and ran back to my car.  Diane was staring up through the windshield at it.  I tried to get her attention, then looked back up and the thing was gone!  I was a little pissed!  Diane was still staring, at nothing now.  When I snapped her out of it, she said that after we parked the thing flashed a light &quot;at&quot; her and was gone. I never heard any more about it.  The house is at an intersection on a major boulevard (Wurzbach) and is very near the medical center. There were lots of other cars around, tooling along Wurzbach.  I expected to hear that someone else had seen the thing, but I never heard anything about it. Oh, when I mention &quot;haze or aura&quot; below, it only applies to the underside of the &quot;thing&quot;, which was otherwise clear and sharp. In my opinion, the thing was somewhat elegant in design.", "3 objects moving slowly, in perfect unicent. thay then speed up, and vanished, as a air plane was coming into air space3 light, in a triangle formation, 2 above 1, flying very slow, thay were moving so perfect with one another, speed wise. thay then sped up and vanished as a jet plane was ciming into the air space.", "Saw hovering near ground on side of highway huge saucer shape UFO.My friend was driving me home from my sister&apos;s house, late, around midnight. The road was not lit in that area, and my friend had an old car,and was driving carefully,concentrating on the road. I saw some lights to my right, and looked out the window. At that time I didn&apos;t &quot;believe&quot; in UFO&apos;s. I couldn&apos;t believe what I was seeing. It was something so enormous, as large as a very long city block, or maybe larger. Much longer than high. It had lights around the edge, red and yellow. I remember tilting my head sideways and trying to tell myself &quot;it&apos;s a radio tower that fell down&quot;, but it wasn&apos;t. While all this is going on in my head, my thoughts raced to form the right type question to ask my friend. I didn&apos;t want to tell him what I thought I saw, I wanted to hear him say what HE saw. So I said &quot;Frank, do you see anything over there?&quot; He looked out the window and said &quot;Holy shit, it&apos;s a flying saucer, we&apos;re getting the hell out of here!&quot; And that old Plymouth Valiant was floored and still, it took time to pass this object. It was on Rt 23 near a tall water managment or processing building of some type.

I didn&apos;t know about missing time then, and don&apos;t think there was any missing time in retrospect, but I can&apos;t be sure.

Object was orange/red glow.At approx. 2 am 8/20/99 I was on my deck with view of Renton Valley.  Above Valley Medical Center I saw an oragnge/red object (approx. 100-200 yrds in length).  My distance from object approx. 1/2 mile.  It hovered in that position for approx. 1-2 minutes.  Object then began moving to SW accross the Renton/Kent Valley, above Demoines hill.  Object appeared to maintain altitude.  The object appeared to nearly crest the horizon from my vantage when it began approaching Renton again.  It continued back towards me across the valley in the same path it had taken on its departure.  It continued until it was somewhere above the vacinity of the Valley Medical Center.  The object hovered for approx 1-2 minutes again. The object began moving and departed towards the SW again, but this time disappeared over the horizon.  It did not reappear.  I took several pictures of the item, however the negatives came back without exposure.  The object did not appear to have any exterior lighting and did not make any sound.  It appeared to just glow.", "Bright silent lights above lakeWe were out boating on the Lake after dark and to the North appeared a bright, silent light at approx. 3000 feet high. We didn&apos;t notice it arrive but while we watched another joined it slowly from the west. They hung together in the sky about 200 feet apart, for about a minute- then the one on the right zoomed off to the east at about 100mph- it hesitated after a short while and then dissapeared into the horizon. The other then moved off to the west again at a similar rate. All this took place in total silence. A helicopter or plane would have made some noise. There were no roads on the hillside behind the objects so it couldn&apos;t have been reflections from car headlights. The movement away of the objects seemed to coincide with how long they were stared at. ie when we looked at them they moved and they rested when we looked elsewhere. The best way to describe the objects was like two bright light bulbs in a pitch black room. These were definitely NOT stars. I would like to add that before this I was a sceptic. I am a fairly sane university graduate aged 27 (22 at the time) and no, we had not been drinking!

My husband noticed through our bedroom window, what he first thought was an airplane, but after watching it for a moment, he realized it wasn&apos;t moving.  He then told me to come and look at this object. I also observed what I first thought was an airplane.  This object had white lights, with flashing green and red lights.  We noticed that this object didn&apos;t change its position in the sky, but seemed to be floating in the same place.  We ran and got binoculars and were able to see that this object was triangular in shape with rows of white lights, with red and green lights at the bottom.  We decided to go out in our backyard to see if we could get a better look.  By the time we got outside, the object had moved farther away from us, so we couldn&apos;t make out it&apos;s shape anymore with binoculars-but it was still in the same position in the sky-it just seemed to be farther up or away.  We continued to  look at this object for about 10 more minutes and observed that it continued to move farther and farther away in the sky, so all that could really be seen was the white light. The total time we watched this object was about 20 to 25 minutes.  It was in the sky at a northeast position seemingly above Mt Timpanogos.  Since that first sighting, we have seen the object at least 4 or 5 more nights, in the same location, at the same time of night.

He was working on his bicycle and had to go out to the barn for a tool. He came back a couple minutes later and said I should come out and &apos;check out these lights&apos;. I went out and was astonished by the brilliance of these blinking lights visible in the northern sky in a gap between a bunch of fir trees. (My house was about 7 miles north of town.) I went to get a pair of binoculars and my jaw truly dropped to the ground: I saw a disc-shaped object, like the lid of a sauce pan, metallic or silvery-grey in color. The lights (red and blueish-green) were not blinking after all, but were circling the edge of the disc. They seemed to blink when looking with the naked eye only because the lights disappeared behind the object - which was itself not bright enough to be visible to the naked eye - and reappeared as they circled again to the front. My ex and I took turns watching through the binoculars. He made the comment that it looked like &quot;a wheel within a wheel&quot;. The object bobbed like a cork in a standing wave of water but stayed in roughly same spot the entire time we watched it (well over an hour)! Through the binoculars, it appeared to be about the size of a pencil eraser at arm&apos;s length; with the naked eye it was somewhat larger than the size of a bright star or planet. I guessed it was about 2 or 3 miles away. It looked like it was hovering over an area called Prater Mountain - or, possibly, Blue Lake at the foot of Prater. (Two weeks later we heard that a neighbor saw a ufo around the same time, also near Prater.) After a while, my ex went to bed but I watched it until it disappeared. It didn&apos;t zip away, like so many ufos are reported to do; it seemed to gradually get smaller until it resembled a star. (However, I was scanning the sky from time to time, so it might have vamoosed when I was looking elsewhere.) I saw it again (or something similar) the next night: I was keeping my eye on a &quot;bright star&quot; off in the North when suddenly it zoomed straight towards me.! I was ready to run back to the house and hide under the bed! It stopped farther away, however - I would guess a distance of 8 miles or so (through the binoculars it looked like blinking red and blue lights rotating in a tight circle, and the object itself was not discernable). My sister and brother-in-law had arrived on a visit from California earlier that day. I woke them up and when my sister saw it she remarked that &quot;it&apos;s definitely something, all right - I wonder if the government is experimenting with new aircraft.&quot; This should have been the ultimate confirmation for me, as my sister is a die-hard skeptic! (though I don&apos;t think the government can make something that behaves as that thing did...) As the days went by, I began to convince myself that what we saw could have been some sort of atmospheric disturbance. But then, we heard of someone else in the neighborhood who saw it, and a few weeks later, mufon or some other organization posted flyers asking people to let them know if they had seen something during that period. And finally, around Feb or Mar of the following year, there was a video on some tv show supposedly showing a ufo down along the Spokane River between Coeur d&apos;Alene and Post Falls. I didn&apos;t see it but heard the video was taken during the spring of &apos;94, just a few weeks before our sighting. My conclusion: either the guv, mufon, and other nameless entities/individuals were conspiring together to inflame my latent paranoia(!), or... we really SAW something extraordinary!

It started like a sharp pencle lead drawing a line across the sky, and the streak became a little widerer as it crossed the sky.  The streak was a dull orange in color, and there was no flash of light like a meteor would produce.  It traveled from a south by south-east toward the north by north-west in two seconds.  It seemed to disappear into the north sky, but a few seconds later I realized the tail was the only thing that disappeared.  The object had come to a complete stop, and the object was dropping toward me position.  It dropped until it was four time size of Mars, or about the size of a 22-cal bullet.

Simultaneously, there was a blue flash in the east that lighted up the whole horizon.  I do not believe any of the events were connected, but they may tie to a time line.  I doused my flashlight and watched the N traveling object until it disappeared over the N horizon.  It became more indistinct as it traveled N due to the lights from White Rock, B.C.  It moved rapidly in a zig-zag fashion for a brief period (2-3 seconds) then straightened out in a northerly route.  Could have been a polar route satellite except for the deviations in path.", "One Hovering craft...Multi-colored lights...Possible USAF persuit!My father and I were traveling down a County road (1801) seven miles east of Mineola. We looked up in the sky in an (45o angle) open field to see a circular object with multi-colored lights on it! We stopped the car and turned off the engine. We didn&apos;t hear a sound from the object. It then started moving west slowly. My father and I then witnessed the object all of a sudden go the opposite direction toward the east. There was no banking/turning for this maneuver! We then saw it speeding up toward the east, a sound was then comming from the sky as we witnessed two jets going very fast, pass overhead. They were not commercial or private aircraft...and there isn&apos;t a military base around here for hundreds of miles. They couldn&apos;t keep up with the object and it left them in it&apos;s wake very quickly. My father has seen other strange hapenings over the years in that area...we own some land out there where this happened. My father and I are well respected members of the community.

(i am a mechanic for a major airline and work at dulles. i live 17 miles from the airport and am located at the southern approach to dulles).i then noticed that the light had dissapeared. then about 30 seconds later the reapeared again in the same spot. i then ran in to get my video camera and started taping the event.the craft just hovered very low and in the same spot for a time. i zoomed in on the object and i could see that it was not totally spherical. i could see that the top had a &quot;w&quot; shape to and the bottom had a triangle shape to it. i continued to tape the craft and noticed small jet aircraft circling the object. they were not commercial airliners on approach for sure. the object seemed to be moving awat from me but it never lost altitude from my position. during all the taping the craft dissapeared and reapeared about 3 times and never moved.the jet aircraft kept circling this for the whole time. the craft finally dissapeared and i never saw it again for the rest of the night.", "I stepped outside because I heard a noise.  It turned out to be nothing. As I was heading back inside to go to bed, I heard a plane overhead, and as usual for me, I looked up.  I watched the plane for a few seconds, then noticed something moving within my view.  I watched what I thought was a shooting star.  It was moving perpendicular to the direction the plane was moving (the plane was moving S/SW toward the Northern Kentucky / Greater Cincinnati Airport; the &quot;shooting star was moving East).  Then when the plane was just about out of my line of sight, the object burst into a huge flash of light, then dimmed about 10 seconds later.  by this time I knew it wasn&apos;t a shooting star because it was moving incredibly slow.  When the flash died down, instead of fading out completely, it made a 90 degree turn, to the same direction the plane was headed.  For the next 8 or so minutes it remained the size of a regular (stationary) star in the sky, then it slowly faded away. I know this sounds very strange, and I still have a hard time believing it myself.  I got less than 2 hours of sleep that night because I was up thinking about what I saw.   The next day at work, I called two local radio stations to find out if anything unusual in the sky had been reported the night before.  Both said that there hadn&apos;t. Then I called a local tv news station and asked the same question.  they said no too.  (i have witnesses to these calls). I hope that this story is believed by who ever reads it, because it is true.

The three of us were off to the side, having a private conversation.  I looked up at the partly cloudy sky, and in a clearing almost directly above us, I saw five bright triangles moving quickly to the south.  I pointed them out to my two friends, who also saw them before they dissapeared from sight.  They appeared to me to be about the size of air superiority fighters (F-15&apos;s) at a very high altitude.  They flew in a formation close to a single file line, with a slight curve.  The back object would speed up to take the lead position.  As soon as it did, the new rear object would do the same, and so forth.  They appeared to have the maneuverability of small birds, such as sparrows.", "Silver basketball size sphere chases eagle.A small (basketball size) silver sphere appeared just beyond a pair of bald eagles I was observing through binoculars.  The sphere appeared to purposely single out the smaller female eagle and begand to close in on her. She obviously became agitated and broke off from the male and circled trying to lose her pursuer which followed her every move until she had completed a complete circle, the sphere then broke off the engagement and disappeared behind trees to the west as she went east and resumed her position with her mate. They then disappeared behind the hills behind my house. I had thought that perhaps the object may have been a silver coated helium party balloon, however, after reading about the Washington State Elk incident, and having just observed a real balloon floating over my house, I realize that in now way was this sphere a balloon. I now light floating objects can be caught up in the &quot;wake&quot; of a plane and sucked along a ways, but this sphere did not behave in the manner the real balloon I just saw behaved. Since this episode, I have seen video on TV of objects similar to this in Mexico City following airplanes. By the way, the balloon I saw bounced erratically and the string was easily visible with binoculars.  This sphere had no string and flew smoothly. No sound was audible.

It was night time and I was star gazing as I usually do when I saw this ball of fire heading straight for Earth.  I was beside myself with excitement and I told my friend who was driving to stop the truck. I watched this thing as it was approaching and then it stopped dead in its tracks and just hovered there, a great glowing ball of fire. It was pulsating, then it split into two spheres of fire.  They started to move like the shape of an atom inbetween each other, so fast, I couldn&apos;t move, all I could do was watch this most amazing thing that I have ever experienced.  After I don&apos;t know for how long they formed together as one and landed on the ground.  This happened when I was 17, and I am know 33.  Something didn&apos;t occur to me until later, there were other people there, those who had stopped just like we did, but I was the first one there, they were after.  We all just got into our vehicles and drove away completely mesmerized by what we had just seen. The driver is a Cherokee Indian and very supersticious, it freaked her out.  Me, the electricity that I feel everytime that  I releay my account is of a readable measure.  The other passanger in the truck with us was freaked out too, and she too will never forget what we saw.  Because the object was glowing, after much analysis of my oberservation I have come to conclude that I think there were mountains in the back.  That is why I think it might be on the mountain range that I named above.   I know that we were into Az about 45 minutes to an hour when it happened.  When I found this website, I got out my Atlas and estimated my approximate location.The object was a ball of fire that was falling straight to earth that split into two balls of fire that  then started to move at an amazing speed within each other like the shape of an atom without the middle one. The color was a ball of fire.  I think that I could see mountains in the backround.", "Large cylindrical object steadily crossed the sky in the light of the moon.It did NOT display FAA blinking light.Two of us were 10 miles east of Salida,CO at a rest area, lying flat on our backs atop a picnic table at a rest area watching the sky.

The object was a brilliant white/blue light in the shape of a circle. 2. It moved slowly at first, as it moved futher away it did an erratic pattern of movement, the movement was like a child scribbling on paper, I describe it like this because you could see the entire outline of its movements &quot;a light trail&quot; behind it, all of this within a second or two. It then moved out of sight in a straight line in less than a second. The object only left a trail of light during it&apos;s erratic movement.

Then they began to glide across the sky.I was attending a church concert and service on Sunday, June 6, 1999 with a couple of my girlfriends.  Around approximately 7pm, I just happened to look up in the sky for no apparent reason.  I saw what I believed to be a star in the eastern sky.  I then saw another and, then, one more.  I thought maybe I was seeing part of the Big Dipper or some other constellation.  I, then, remember thinking it was awful light out for me to be able to see stars. The weather was calm, very little wind.  It had been very warm that day and as the sun set, it got cooler.  There was not a cloud in the sky.  I was sitting facing the east.  I felt the sun setting on my back.  I was at the John Ansen Ford Amphitheatre in Hollywood, CA.  It sits off the 101 freeway up in the hills.  A large cross marks a hill nearby.  A large hill or small mountain scales up behind the stage. I looked up and saw the objects above the mountain.  The first one began to move towards us (WNW) and, then the second and third followed close behind.  I turned to my girlfriend and told her to look at them.  She thought they were balloons.  But then, the first one began to hover.  The second and third kept moving.  I could no longer see the third as I believe one of the lighting structures for the stage was blocking my view.  I told her there was no way they could be balloons because how could one just stay still and the other keep moving.  Then, the first one, which was stationary, started back in the opposite direction.  It was moving a little more swiflty than before but never very fast.  It was moving ESE. Then, the second kept moving WNW and the third came back into my line of vision.  It was following close behind.  The second one kept going until I couldn&apos;t see it for the structure of the building and the hills that surrounded.  The third one, then hovered in the same place that the first one had.  I, then, proceeded to show my other girlfriend who thought they were birds or stars.  I told her that birds don&apos;t go that high plus they don&apos;t hover in one place and that stars don&apos;t move.  She no longer paid attention to them as she was more interested in the concert.  She told me to stop looking at them but I didn&apos;t. Then, all of a sudden, the first one came back moving as swiftly as it did when it left.  It came back from the same direction it had disappeared to.  Once again, it was travelling WNW.  It passed by the third one (which was still hovering) very closely.  Then, the second one came back into view and they all started back in the ESE direction.  I, then, began to return more of my attention to the concert and every so often I would look up to see if they were still there.  Eventually, I looked up and I could no longer see them.  I don&apos;t know where they went after that point. The whole event lasted for approximately 20 minutes.  I couldn&apos;t believe my eyes.  I probably wouldn&apos;t have believed it if my friends would not have seen them also.  They looked just like moving stars.  They were graceful and smooth, almost entrancing.  I am just a 24 year old secretary.  I have never been interested in UFO&apos;s as a study.  Yet, I have always believed.  Now, I know.  I saw them with my own two eyes.

I was a Police Officer on duty (now retired) with a partner in the car besides me when I looked into the nighttime sky and saw this hugh shape with lights spaced intermittently crossing the dark sky. No noise was heard and it was not like the shape of anything I had ever seen (flying) before. It seemed to have taken up the whole sky. Upon seeing this thing I brought it to my partners attention and when he witnessed it his spoken words were &quot;oh man, don&apos;t get me involved with this&quot;. After little thought (realizing there would be many jokes and ridicule aimed at me) I radioed HQ&apos;s and told them my sightings. They asked my location and I told them same. They came back with a reply that they had gotten many other phonecalls from the same area seeing the same thing. They (HQ&apos;s) then said they had called the Westchester County Airport and was advised it was the Air Force. To this day I dont believe that. Not being involved with Airplanes or anything as such I know I have never seen anything like this object flying in the air or anything close to it in shape. It seemed to be the size of a football field. It seemed to have taken up the whole sky. Believing in what I saw I made an official Police Report on same.

It closed without a sound, which made all three of us so very uncomfortable.  We then heard a military jet streaking across the sky at very low altitude.  It appeared out of no where.  We were all so stunned, we couldnt move for 10 minutes.  We were afraid to move.  If someone was to ask me what it reminded me of, it reminded me of the worm hole on Deep Space Nine.

I am also an ex-MUFON investigator in Minn. (resigned when i moved out of state). I was watching the night sky which was crystal clear, moon was a sliver, and low on the horizon. Stars were very clear and bright. I noticed that there was a extremely bright red non-flashing point-source of light that had 6 fast flashing (~6 flashes/sec.) red strobe-like lights on it&apos;s front and two slower flashing red lights on it&apos;s back end coming over the southern horizon and moving directly north at a modest rate of speed ( it took perhaps 2 minutes to traverse horizon to horizon). The flashing red lights were strobe like point-sources (not diffused at all)..similar to the light from a red LED wtih a clear cap. It was at approximately 10,000 ft.

The UFO made sharp turnes in the sky.At first we saw it in the range of 25 km, it looked like a very big star and very bright. Then we realized that if you look with out blinking you would be able to see it move in small cirlces.The UFO was flying East-South. Every time a passeger plane flue by it the UFO seems to freez in one place. The UFO had some blue laser light above the craft and it looked like an anttena. From the leftside of the craft it had a short bright red beam. The UFO wasn&apos;t flying smoothly, it kind of moved liked a kite (back,forward,up and down). The blue light anttena started moving under the UFO and began moving higher until the light around it started to fade away.", "((NUFORC Note:  This is the only report we have on file which suggests any kind of positive correlation between the presence of a UFO and a propensity of fish to strike a lure.

Quiet, fast moving, heading northwest.If the moon is a basketball, this would be a tennis ball in size. I saw it over the roof af the neighboring building, traveling faster than any plane, silently. It was very bright, with a mix of red, green and regular bright white light. I have never seen anything like this, and it is embedded in my memory.  I was born and raised in Seattle, raised a family, and ten years ago moved to Maui, where I habe worked for the historic organization here, doing research. I have excellent eyesight!

I called the airport but was laughed at and I but it out of my mind for a number of years until 1995 when I finaly went to the police, I was interviewed by the Lt. as well as some one from your office.. I believe this was before you came to take over. Any way.. to stream line this.. it was a black object with a big red light on top that went slowly on and off while it moved.. when hovering it would cease all together and rotate a black and white checker board center while tilting left and right.. then it would level out and stop rotating the center and the red light would come on again. It did this for a long time.. this even has traumatized me and my mother for years. My mother is very religious.. she saw it first. My dad is retired Military but he wasn&apos;t home.. anyway I can draw images and maps if you are more intersted with this.. you may still have the recording from 1995.

She noticed a bright, star-like object moving from the south of us, below the Big Dipper.  It appeared the size of a large planet, and was bright white. It was about at a 60 degree elevation, and moving very quickly across the sky above us, moving at toward the NE from the SW direction.  It maintained a straight path to about midhorizon, when it appeared to zip and zag, to our utter amazement. By this time, a couple of minutes, it had moved across nearly 60% of the visible sky (which was crystal clear).  We then saw it slow down, and begin a 90 degree turn, taking it toward the NE (toward Durango direction).  As it went into that direction, it appeared to brighten and dim slowly, at one point flashing beams from it.  Then as it neared about 30 degrees from our point of view, it disappeared.  In size it would be taken as a planet or star.  It appeared to be very high.  It left no tail or trace of its path.", "Formation of lights observed over Three mile Island area.

We witnessed this in  York, Pa about 20 miles away. The lights were extremely bright and one would go off at the end of the rqw only to be replaced by one turning on at the begining of the row. The light seemed to hopscotch on and off. The lights also all went off and reappeared about 10 miles east of the original sighting. York County Controll was notified and the local police did respond (with much ridicule).

I turned and looked up and was shocked at what I had seen. It was a very bright ball. The best way to describe the size was to extend my arm from my body and open my finger and thumb the size of a &frac12; Dollar. I have seen several meteors and shooting stars. This was NNOT one. This ball of light was a very bright blue. It looked like a spark of electricity from a wall outlet. It also illuminated the sky about 1/4 mile around the object as it was traveling. It was also flickering. It happened so quickly, and went out of view across the street behind the neighbors tree.

We observed two big orange spheres that appeared out of no where over Pottstown, high above the the airport. We had a very expensive Canon 35mm camera, and right when I focused on the spheres to take the shot, they disappeared. We watched for them to come back, but no luck. On 7/7 and 7/8, we went sky-surfing again, and about 10pm, we saw the spheres again, but very much higher and very bright. Again, we wanted to snap a picture, and they &quot;blinked out&quot;.

The object was mostly white, with some blue and possibly red. It moved up and down in a zig zag pattern, changing colors. I wondered to myself,&quot;What the heck is that?&quot; I opended my window and watched it glide in its zig zag pattern. It had a tail which would delay and &quot;chase&quot; the object as it moved.

Then changed to a play jack shape with clustered balls in center and at end of each spoke.I was sitting in my bedroom and typing a letter.  Looking out the window, I observed what I first thought was a plane in trouble . . . seemed to be falling downward.  Soon afterward, the object changed and took the shape of a game jack, having golden balls clustered around the center and at the end of each spoke.  I watched as some of the balls left the object and started floating off.  I got excited and went downstairs to alert my husband and get my binoculars.  We went outside and noticed that two neighbors were also observing the object.   They also thought, at first, that it was a plane in trouble.  Soon more neighbors came outside and joined us in viewing the object.  By this time, almost all of the golden balls had separated from the main object and were floating around the sky.  Remember, this sighting was in broad daylight on a rather sunny afternoon.  Some of the neighbors commented that we were merely looking at a cluster of balloons.  However that explanation was not possible since the spoke object flew in and out of the round golden balls like a &apos;mother hen&apos;, seemingly arranging them in patterns.  The whole group was moving slowily to the south.   While watching this, we saw a commercial airliner going from north to south and though high up, it was lower than the objects.  We counted the balls and came up with an approximate number of 34.  A strange mood came over all of us and the group broke up, returning to our homes without much comment.  It seemed as if we did not want to have further discussion on the sighting.   Several of us had binoculars and the objects just looked like bright golden spheres   The jack object was not as brilliant.", "I was driving east on hwy 12, there were a few light clouds in the sky, I saw an ovoid shaped object at about 5-7000 ft.

My husband and I were looking for meteors, and we both saw it.  We were on our deck in the back yard.  It was completely silent and moved slowly from northeast to southwest.  I thought it was electromagnetic because all the hairs on my arms stood straight up like with static electricity from a balloon.  It was spooky.  I thought about running in the house, but I couldn&apos;t stop watching it.   It drifted along rather slowly and then stopped, tilted so that the lights appeared to line up, and blinked out.  I saw a red light at each corner of the object, but my husband saw a white light at each corner.

One of them started out as a bright light hovering to going up just above the tree line and it turned off the light and there was a red light blinking, one was a sphere and it had lights around the middle of it . I have lived in a mile radius of this sighting all my life and have always seen weird things and other people I know have seen the same.

Six months ago, I purchased a scanner to add some photographs to my web site.  As I was looking for pictures to scan in from my photo album, I noticed something unusual in one of the pictures.  There appeared to be some sort of speck in the sky above the Pyramid of the Sun. Under magnification, the speck appears to be some sort of disk-shaped object.

We lost sight of it as trees obscured our view, and we had to make a left hand turn.  This is a very busy highway, and there was no chance to pull over to try to take a picture. My friend recalls it as being crescent-shaped; my impression was of a slim rectangle.  I am retired; she is a high school science teacher; we are are both college graduates.

Sure enough as we passed from the access road....sitting side by side completely stopped  were sitting those two trucks.  It looked like they just stopped next to each other, completely lined up.  I find that so unbelievable that two trucks just ran out of gas.   It just seems too fishy. Also, while we were waiting we saw a huge shooting star!   Not like a small streak the size of the stars like we usually see; but a large golden shooting light across the sky.

We had been delayed because of the night time paving that was taking place along the highway between Selma and Cave Juntion. I pull the four door sedan into the Dairy Queen in Cave Juntion and we all went inside. After getting our ice creams we got back into the car and before I started to pull out of the drive way of the Dairy Queen and making a left turn onto the highway I noticed some lights up on the hills that were about two miles away as the crow flies. Teasing my wife I said &quot;Look a UFO&quot;. As I continued to look at the object it apeared to me that it was a large house and I commented that &quot;that was a neat place to have a house&quot; since it was at the very top of the hills and looking down into the Illinois Valley directly above Cave Juntion, Or. I remember thinking how big the house was because of what I though were large  picture windows with light coming out of them.  The object was huge. It appeared to be made of equally narrow bars of light and amber colored bars that were not illuminated. Equal in size and spacing in a horzontial line. Suddenly the object began to rotate counter clock wise in a very smooth fashion, much like a merry go round -not fast. The object then began moving north in a horizontal direction and I instantly knew that it was a UFO. At this point I was stopped in the middle of the Highway though no cars were coming and we were in the middle of town. So I took my eyes off of the object and pulled the car across the street. I did not see what took place next but wife saw the object and it began to stretch out and develope a mist around it, and then just disapperaed while it was still traveling in the same direction. My two daughters who were in the back of the car did not see the event. Of course my wife and I were in shock. We continued to head south on Hwy 199 into California. I had a deep sence that we would see the object again, so I instructed them to keep looking for the object. The area is very hilling and forest on the Coast range in southern Oregon and into Northern California. After traveling for about 15 miles just after the check stop at the Calif. boarder you climb a hill that takes you through a tunnel. As we were approaching the tunnel my wife, and two daughters saw a blue fire ball approach the car at great speed before it banked away. I was driving, and did not hear or see it. I turned around to catch a glimps of it, but it was gone. My question is why did it come after us as their impression of it was that it was behaving in a agressive manner?

Sterling exits and were already past the Montgomery Clark County line. We turned back towards Mt. Sterling on I-64. At the next overpass we saw a large metallic saucer shaped craft hovering about twenty-five feet above the embankment to the right of the overpass.We left Morehead, where we lived before dark and headed towards Mt. Sterling on I-64, which is about 35 miles away. We were driving leisurely and talking, and stopped at the Owensville / Frenchburg exit in Bath County to get a soft drink. We got back on the interstate, still talking, at almost sunset. It was a warm fall day and we were riding with the windows down, having a great time just enjoying the ride. Somehow we must have driven right by both Mt. Sterling exits, but neither of us has ever had any memory of it. All we know for sure is it was dark outside and when we realized quite suddenly that the terrain didn&apos;t seem right and we started looking at the mile markers and figured out we were about fifteen miles past Mt. Sterling. We couldn&apos;t figure out how we had missed not one, but both exits...but had no choice except to turn around and go back. We were just inside Clark County at that point and got off at the next exit we saw, which is a rural exit on to U.S. 60, and turned around heading back into Montgomery County on I-64 towards Mt. Sterling once more. We were still perplexed about how we had gotten there when we came to the first overpass. There was a large metallic saucer with what I&apos;ve always thought of as multi-colored &quot;running lights&quot; on it and portals visible. The saucer made no sound we were aware of and didn&apos;t disturb the surrounding treetops and other vegetation as it hovered in mid air about twenty-five feet above the embankment to the right of the overpass. We both stared and I slowed down and started pulling off the highway, coming almost to a full stop in front of the craft before my friend freaked out and yelled &quot;hit the gas&quot;. That snapped me out of my stupor and I did as I was told, hit the gas and pulled back out onto the highway. We arrived in Mt. Sterling much later than we anticipated, even considering the fact we had gone fifteen miles out of our way, which accounts for an extra half hour traveling time, but we were never sure how much time, if any, we did loose. Since then ! I have realized if we hadn&apos;t been headed for Mt. Sterling and had been going on to Winchester or Lexington, we would never have taken note of the fact we didn&apos;t see the two Mt. Sterling exits and we also would not have turned around in Clark County to turn back towards Mt. Sterling, so we would not have seen the saucer hovering over that overpass because it would not have been visible from the other side of the interstate (we didn&apos;t notice it as we went by the first time as we traveled the other way ... and that must have been about where we were when we realized we missed Mt. Sterling).

We thought maybe we would see some of those meteors from the Perseid shower, but instead we seen an object that appeared to change from a bright green to a dimmer blueish green and then suddenly changed to 3 seperate lights that stayed in a triangle formation and after a few seconds rejoined to become one object again. We watched this object(s) for I&apos;d say about 5 minutes. The object(s) made absolutely no sound. We have many aircraft fly over, since Japan Airlines trains their pilots here and we also have alot of military traffic and the occasional life flight chopper, all of which however make lots of noise and the blinking lights of those aircraft are unmistakable. As to what those silent lights in the nightsky could have been - your guess is as good as mine! Did you get any other reports about this from our area?", "craft was seen hovering 100ft above the ground at the southeast corner of Powers and Platte at 9PM on 6/28/99 for about 20 seconds north of airport.I am a truck driver very familiar with this area. I was driving north on Powers Blvd about to turn left or east on Platte Ave.  I saw a very large craft that was either moving very slow or hovering.  I new I was by the airport and at first thought it was an aircraft.  Howerver, it was to large, moving to slow or not at all and like nothing I have ever seen. It looked like an ace of spades flying horizontaly with the pointy end forward.  Depth perseption of the craft was dificult to determine.  It appeared that you could see through some parts of the forward section and into parts of the middle section and the back seemed solid.  It was dark and I would say the craft was black. There were lights on the three points of the spade and interior lights that seemed to give the craft 3 decks at its thickest point.  Again, depth perception was unusual as the interior lights were not on what would normally be considered the hull, but rather within the craft. When I realized what I was looking at I was frightened, completed my turn on to Platte Ave. and sped off.  A co-worker was following me and when we arrived at the terminal he was going to say nothing.  I asked him &quot;did you see that?&quot;  He said &quot;Oh the triangle?&quot;  We walked to the west side of the terminal where we could see the corner where we had seen the triangle.  There was a small plane in a tight circular bank around the area we had seen the triangle.  We assumed the piolt had seen the craft also and was checking out the area further. I am 45 years old, have a bachalor&apos;s degree and have never seen anything like this before.  One other thing we were only about 100 yards away from it at most!  We also both saw the same thing.", "very clear night, came from west to east directly above trees across street from where I was standing, it stopped twice as it traveled east(total travel distance from time I saw it was about one city block), on it&apos;s second stop it was directly in front of me across street, it then flew directly toward me and over our house. On its second stop, is when I stood at the edge of the porch and looked directly at it(I felt it must have known I was looking at it-becuase it stopped). Very bright white fuzzy light, no sound and very very quick. I immediatly had goose bumps all over my body. I can recall this in my mind to this day.Description of object: round, bright white fuzzy light. Noiseless, flew horizontally, across top of trees, stopped twice then turned and flew over our house.

I thought nothiing of it until the &quot;plane&quot; made a 90 degree turn and begin to rise straight into the air. I watched until it entered another cloud which, after the craft entered, had a inter-lighning flash. I waited for the &quot;plane&quot; to emerge but it never did.Appeared to be a plane.

I alerted the others to it.  My sister saw it,  but my fiance could not make it out.(She wasn&apos;t wearing her glasses.)  It was about 6-10 miles away at about 20 ft. above the treeline.(From my perspective.)  We turned right on Wapato St. and I continued watching it.  Then we turned right on 70th St. and pulled into our driveway.  I continued watching it and it suddenly appeared to fall straight down.  The entire time the sun would occasionaly glint very brightly off it.  I have never seen something moving,  stop on a dime and fall straight down.  It fell for about 5 seconds,  and then flew away downward at a 45 degree angle,  headed due east and was lost from sight behind a hill.

There were scattered clouds here and there that were moving rather briskly across the sky at the time. We stood there for a while and some passers-by saw us looking and looked up as well wondering what it was we were looking at. About a minute or so after that it started to slowly move from its 10 o&apos;clock position ( from our POV ) across the sky to about 2 o&apos;clock ( against the wind ) where a small cloud was, like some others in the sky, moving briskly. Well, it entered into or behind the small cloud and the cloud just continued moving. I expected to see this object emerge from behind the cloud but it didn&apos;t although we stood there for a while until the cloud passed out of sight. The sun was low to our backs during this sighting. This was the first and only time I have clearly seen anything like this. We never reported it ( to whom??) but it is significant in that it was just a day or so before the &quot;Great New England Blackout&quot; so my approximate date of sighting can be narrowed further. I don&apos;t remember the exact day of the blackout. I think it was a week or so after that Life Magazine came out with their famous &quot; Week of the Flying Saucers &quot; issue. So there you have my, until now, unreported sighting fo your records for whatever its worth.

PD))", "translucent craft changing shape and silentMy son and myself were at a local high school football game, approx mid october 1998.  It was partly cloudy and a cool night, there was some smoke from a barbeque coming over the stadium.  We were sitting mid-field when a silent object moving approx. 40-50 mph went overhead.  I sighted the object at the 30 yard line and followed it about have a mile past the stadium.  The strange thing is it appeared to be triangular yet not. It seemed to rotate and change shape and appeared to be approx 60 feet wide and 200 feet off the ground.  Its as though you could see right through it, but it still had a discernable shape. My son who was 11 at the time, looked over at me and said &quot;dad did you see that?&quot;.  I told him I did. I then asked my brother-in-law if he had seen anything. He hadn&apos;t.

Other objects continued on course til out of sight.  Not orbiting as they did not appear in two hours.  Not reported.  Family gathering, ages ranging from 10 to 50 (approximately).", "As an 9 year old child I saw a dumbbell shaped object hovering in daytime at approx. 5000 feet.The only part of this event I am not certain of is the exact time, or even the year.  I was probably 8, 9, or 10 years old when it happened, unfortunately no adults were present for me to contact and ask the year, and the only other witness was even younger than I was.  But the rest of it I remember with exceptional clarity. I was standing in the parking lot of George&apos;s Majestic Lounge (a live music bar) with my cousin, who is a couple of years younger than me.  Our parents were inside listening to music that we had no interest in, and, as our town used to be more or less completely crime free, we were allowed to play outside, as long as we didn&apos;t wander off. It was afternoon, about 2 hours before sunset, and the moon was visible and nearly full in the day sky.  For whatever reason I looked up into the sky, probably at the moon.  However, while looking up I noticed in the north sky, and slightly west, was a wierd object.  It was following the same path that commuter prop planes used in that era to reach our local airport (though it was flying higher than they do at that point in their approach), at first I thought it might be some kind of wierd helicopter.  As I stared at it, it quickly became apparent that it didn&apos;t look like any kind of flying object I&apos;d ever seen. The object is best described as beeing basically shaped like a dumbell.  Each end, front and back, was a cube, the cubes were connected by a rectangular arm.  Unlike a dumbbell, the arm did not extend passed the ends of the cubes.  The object had no visible lights (it was daytime though, so I wouldn&apos;t have seen any but the brightest lights).  The object was high enough in the sky that its total length appeared equal to half the diameter of the full moon.  The object was uniformly grey.  I have always had very good vision and was able to see a certain amount of detail; the cubes had smooth, featureless faces (at least the ones visible at my angle), but the arm appeared to be of a skeletal, framework construction.  The object also emitted no sounds or trails.  When I was watching it it moved considerably slower than an aircraft at a similar height. I watched, entranced, for several minutes, probably about 3 to 5.  My cousin must have noticed I was staring at something because when I finally became aware that maybe I should point it out to her, I saw she was already looking at it too.  I told her to get my mom, and she refused.  So I told her to watch it, and I went to get my mom and dad.  My parents were not eager to go outside to see &quot;the weird flying thing in the sky&quot;, and so we didn&apos;t go out for what seemed an eternity to me, but was probably only about 5 to 10 minutes.  Of course the object was gone.  My counsin said it had continued along its north to south course, but had moved faster and faster until it was gone, she said it hadn&apos;t dissapeared over the horizon (all paraphrased of course), but had gone up into the sky until she couldn&apos;t see it any longer somewhere in the southwest quadrant of the sky. For years afterwards I drew pictures of the object, on school papers, on the phone notepad, in books, etc.  I&apos;ve never seen it since, nor have I ever heard of any sightings even remotely similar.  I remember some years later, still before I was in my teens (I am now 27, in 1999), that I heard about skylab, and it&apos;s plumet to earth; at that point I just assumed that what I had seen was skylab.  But now I&apos;m pretty sure I&apos;ll never have any idea of what the object really was.", "I woke up and saw it hovering noiseless over the neighbors horses and the highway. I awoke the whole familyI was a young teen, and awoke in the middle of the night and looked out my window.  It was noiseless.  it was right above the highway only about 50 feet up.  The neighbors horses were running and rearing.  I awoke everyone in the house so that they could see it.  I was sure glad that it was still there.  My family acted so srange.  They were mad for being awoken. Everyone got extemely tired and went back to bed.  I stayed up and watched it for as long as I could.  I fell asleep at the window.  I woke up before daylight and it was gone.  Years later as an adult it haunts me.  I saw the neighbor lady one time while taking the kids to visit my mom.  I risked humiliation by telling her that I saw it. She lit up like a switch and told me that I was not crazy.((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.  We have assigned an arbitrary time and date so that the report sorts to the summer of 1978.  PD))", "Dim light floating around then separating.  Glowing bright like lightning, and getting dimmer and farther away.  Coming back at a fast rate and disapearing.  This all elapsed in a 5 minute range.

I was at my home out in the country almost falling asleep in my room.  My sister came down stairs (which she rarely does), knocked on my door telling me to come up stairs fast and look at this &quot;thing&quot; in the sky.  I got up and not really beliving in this whole space craft thing,  I was kinda interested.  I ran into the living room and looked out the bay windows and saw nothing.  Then she started calling me from the kitchen.  I ran into the kitchen and looked out the side window.  In the distance there was an object floating around the city.  I just thought it was a plane getting ready to land.  But dont planes have differn&apos;t colours flikering off the back wings? This was a really bright white light flikering really fast in a solid outburst.  My sister said that it went really bright, almost like when lightning flashes.  All of a sudden it started coming back towards our home.  It hovard around our area for a while (ruffly 2mins).  The night was all overcast and the clouds were very low.  This object was below them, so it would have to be about 2000-4000 ft above ground.  The object was getting brighter and brighter, almost lighting up the sky around itself.  Started moving really fast South West and getting brighter and then it felt like it went behind some trees.  It was completely gone.  Since then nothing has happend.", "Silvery craft looking like a Boeing 777 shape sized craft w/no discernable wings or tail (except a small vertical stabiler, looked like it was masking itself as an aircraft, It&apos; speed, was behaving normally, except it&apos;s yaw. It was slide slipping like a blimb with NO noise as you would expect a blimp to do in the wind.It was 18:00 (6 P.M.), on 7/13/99 at Owens Beach in the Point Defiance Park in Tacoma, WA. The sky was clear blue with NO clouds whatsoever. It was late afternoon and my 2 year old son and I were looking at aircraft leaving and approaching Sea-Tac airport. From Owens Beach, airplanes appear to be approximately 5,000 feet in altitude and about 1 to 5 miles away depending on which aircraft we were looking at on a particular moment. All the commercial craft had that late afternoon reflectivity that makes them really stand out against the blue sky. ALL the airplanes we saw had visible control surfaces on them and made the usual jet &apos;noise&apos;. All, that is, EXCEPT this one. I was looking over my right shoulder. From the South East, coming about the direction of Ruston Way, here in Tacoma, was what I thought to be a Boeing 777. But, it had no discernable wings that I could see. It appeared to be then approximately 3,000 to 5,000 feet in altitude and about 3 miles away, (about the width of my thumb at arms length). I then listened for any jet &apos;noise&apos;, there were none. Then I looked at the tail. The only tail visible was a shorter than usually vertical stabilizer. A little background is due here; I am always looking at aircraft in the sky (I have had a love for them and have been doing so for many years now). The reason I bring this up is to relay to you that I know how they should look, sound, and behave, dependant on the conditions and time of day. Back to what happened; The craft is heading almost overhead now and I can still see NO wings or horizontal stabilizers. There is still NO noise either! It is now about the size of a half-dollar at arm&apos;s length. The aircraft is now heading from over head, due north, to the southern tip of Vashon Island. Now I am really concentrating on the physical behavior of the craft as it heads due north from my position. Let&apos;s see; 1) Still NO noise 2) NO Wings 3) NO horizontal stabilizer 4) Shorter than normal vertical stabilizer 5) The fuselage shape is correct for a Boeing 777. Blunt nose and a tail that comes to a point, (NOT fat like a blimp, or even the shape of a 747 would be) 6) Speed looks right (much too fast for a blimp) approximately 300-400 mph 7) Consistent forward momentum 8) Pitch is flat, (a little too flat, NOT climbing OR descending) 9) Wait a minute, it&apos;s the yaw... That isn&apos;t right... What I noticed about the yaw is this; What ANY aircraft does in a turn is bank. This didn&apos;t. It would yaw (turn) 30-40 degrees to the left in a smooth motion taking about 5 to 10 seconds to do so WITHOUT banking! The vertical stabilizer is still completely vertical. Then it would turn forward (due north, FOLLOWING it&apos;s forward momentum direction) in the same 5-10 second period. Then it would turn right, the same 30-40 degrees at the same 5-10 second period. All turning id done WITHOUT modifying its forward momentum&apos;s direction. I have observed a lot of aircraft in my lifetime and NEVER seen anything like this. It was behaving like whoever was controlling this craft was being as inconspicuous as possible and controlling it so it would &apos;blend-in&apos; with the other commercial aircraft in the area. One final thing about the commercial flight path for this date was that this was the only commercial &apos;looking&apos; craft that was NOT in the same flight corridor. All the commercial aircraft I saw this day from Owens Beach were traversing from the N.E. to the S. W. (or visa versa). This craft game from the S.E., headed almost overhead, and then headed due North from me.", "On hwy 43 we pulled over to see what dozens of people were looking at.At approx. 22:00 hrs. on a Sun.nite late August of 1973 my girlfriend and I , while driving back to St.Louis from a campout at Clearwater Lake spotted litterally dozens of people standing outside there parked cars and staring into the sky.This was during the &quot;flap&quot; in S.E.Mo. that lasted more than 6 months .

August 28th) when my husband tried to draw my attention to what he thought was a satellite travelling across the darkening sky. The sky was clear, with no haze or clouds to speak of. I had trouble locating the object initially, but he persisted until I saw it too. It was a small yellow light, not unlike a distant star, but was moving steadily across the sky on what appeared to be a satellite orbit path. However, seconds after I laid eyes on it, we both watched in amazement as it suddenly stopped dead in it&apos;s tracks. Almost instantly, it changed direction 180%, back-tracking on it&apos;s orginal path. About three seconds into its new path, it flashed very brightly, at LEAST 10 times as bright as it had been originally, and moved rapidly upward in an arching path, fading from our vision within four or five seconds. It did not re-appear in the next 5 minutes, and we came in to report it somewhere, which I guess has turned out to be here!
