["White sphere follows driverMy grandmother was on her way to work following her routine route, and as she pulled out onto a road, she saw a bright white sphere about 1,000 feet in the sky. As she drove down the road she grew uneasy, and didn&apos;t know what to think. She felt compelled to stop the car and look at it further. As she drove, she noticed the white sphere was following her, and came about only 100 feet from her car. Every time she looked into her rear view mirror, she noticed the sphere was getting closer. She made it to work on time, and as she left her car to walk into the building where she worked, the sphere was still there. She noticed the sphere had a haze around it. She reported no Missing Time situation, and she heard no sound from the sphere.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "Driving East on Woodmen Road we (spouse and myself) saw a silver light.

The vehicles were about 100 feet high.  These objects were moving east at a velocity of 10 mph.  There were six of these objects and were all traveling together.  Some of these objects were moving erratically left and right but were all staying pretty much in formation.  Two teenager ran towards us from the left in excitement screaming what the hell are those!!?!  My brother and I did not say anything for abut twenty seconds as we were in awe.  I then told them that they looked like green glowing eggs, and one of the kids said, they are definitely not airplanes, not helicopters, their not even making any noise.  A blonde girl around 22 joined us and began watching them as well.  She was speechless.  Then a car pulled up and a 30 year old woman asked what we were looking at, we said we have no idea.  Six green egg shaped objects just flew over our heads and you can still see them right next to the tree on the left.  She said, *I See them,&quot; and her son said I see them too!!!!  We stood there for another 3 or 4 minutes until they just disappeared.  Ten minutes later, my brother and I saw another object fly quickly over our heads but this one was flashing a blue light.  We saw its outline as it passed overhead between us and the white cumulus clouds above.  The object was black and shaped like a disk with a very bright blue flashing light underneath.  It continued towards the east for about 400 meters then made a sharp left turn and disappeared.  That is all I can say, that is what we perceived.  Can you tell me what it was?

A witness called today from Ontario to make a report of a sighting he and his wife had witnessed. The husband and wife had just got back from their son&apos;s ball game, his son had caught a ride home with his friends. When the couple arrived home and were going about their business, they noticed none of the telephones were working in the house. The fellow wanted to contact the phone company, but of course couldn&apos;t. He wondered if the phone in the barn might be working so he headed outside and was on his way to the barn, looking up through the Pine trees and across the highway when he saw an extremely bright white light. The witness said it was so bright that he could not even look at it without placing his hand up in front of him. At the point where he first noticed it, the light was approx: a kilometer away coming from the west and his neighbors farm. The witness mentioned to me that after he first spotted it the first thing that popped into his head was &quot;camera&quot;. Although due to being fascinated with the object he soon forgot about the camera. He ran back up from the barn area and banged on his home&apos;s door to catch his wife&apos;s attention. When she ask what was going on, he said to her, &apos;you have to come out and see this&quot;. He explained that he is not a man who gets rattled very easy, but what he had witnessed did shake it up a lot. When the object came up close to his property it was not traveling very fast at all and had four bright white lights at the front of it and one red light in the middle, or center of the craft. He also said as bright as the lights were, they did not illuminate any of the surrounding area. He and his wife both thought it looked like a boomerang in shape. Also the fellow said it looked as if something was sticking out of the front of it. As the object left their property moving into the distance they lost sighting of the bright lights, but they did say the lights which were at the front of the craft were still lighting up the front end of it. (HBCC UFO Note: The witness said when he first saw it he thought it was landing lights on a large jet aircraft. He also wondered if it was going to crash due to it being at such a low altitude and no airport close by). There was also sound heard coming from the object. A very low rumbling sound to it, like a throbbing sound. As he pointed out, that if it was a normal aircraft and being as low as it was. The sound would have knocked his socks off due to it being very loud. But it wasn&apos;t like this at all. The object itself was dark or blackish in color. The fellow gave a &quot;guess&quot; at what the size may have been, using his home as reference of 74 feet long. He figured the distance between the first light to the second may have been roughly 70 feet in distance. So between the first light and the last the approx: distance would have been just over 200 feet. This would have been how wide the object was, or appeared to be. Hopefully the other witnesses across the lake will talk with me over what they saw, which was the same object. Thank you to the witness for the report.

We have agreed the size comparable to a single dwelling house. The knoll is about one kilometer away as the crow fly&apos;s. We watched it for about one half hour. As an after thought the white light had a shadow line (my last report) which was not in the piece that broke away but remained in the curling end. I was thinking of a description. if I put a dot on a flashlight lens and then blew smoke in the ray the light behaved something like that. It swirled around the shadow line.

Having lived under busy commercial air routes for my entire life, and being an amateur aircraft expert, I readily identified the object as not being commercial air traffic.  The object was traveling in an Eastern direction, coming from the West.  Suddenly the object stopped.  It started to move again, but on a different course.  The object was soon almost directly overhead.   As the object was overhead, it rapidly flew in circles, zig-zag patterns, and hovered.  I noticed there was a sort of hazy halo around the light, and that it left a slight hazt trail as it moved.  After a few minutes of said displays, the object started moving rapidly North.  Suddenly reversing directions, the object began traveling Southward.  It was at this time that I noticed the object was not one white light, but three distinct lights composing one object, or very tight formation.  The lights were colored green, red, and white.  These are the colors used on commercial aircraft, but the did not appear in the correct configuration to be such an aircraft.  As the object sped Southward toward the horizen, it stopped briefly.  At this time, the object split into three different white lights in a triangle formation.

The object was about 1/8th of an inch wide at arm&apos;s length.  My best guess is that it was flying at at altitude of about 10,000 to 15,000 feet, with a speed of perhaps 200 to 300 MPH -- similar to a jet.  It was elongated to the left and right sides with no fuselage.  I watched it for a few seconds to try and determine what it was, and decided to ask my client if I could call her back in a few minutes.

I also have a strong background in abstract and applied mathematics and physics and I have actively maintained and advanced my scientific side.

There was moderate rain and wind at the moment and the road condition was wet but not flooded.  The sky was overcast with a thick, dark gray and relatively low blanket of rain clouds as one would expect of a hurricane.  However, I had neither seen lightening nor heard thunder during the entire day. Later as I returned home, I looked carefully at all the wires and poles in that area. There were no transformers to be seen and the wires all looked unremarkably intact.  The area where this occurred is developed on one side with office buildings and has woods and high grass on the other for a space extending about 1/3 of a mile to I-64.In a cursory search, I saw nothing in the area to suggest a meteor had fallen.  I did not see any evidence of aircraft in the area.  Furthermore, it would have been extremently hazardous for aircraft of any sort to fly through Hurricane Isabel.

There was no wind and the water was dead calm. I started casting for a while, and after about 15 minutes I snagged my lure on a rock in the water. I tried getting it loose, but it wasn&apos;t working so just as I reached out to cut my line, something caught my eye above the trees on the opposite shoreline (which was about 1/4 mile away). I saw a bright bluish-white light rise up from the treeline very slowly for about 15 seconds. I just stood there looking at it in awe. If I had to guess at the size of it, I&apos;d say it was as big as a bus, but I couldn&apos;t exactly tell the shape because of the blue glow around it. As it got further above the treeline, it stopped moving and just hovered for a few seconds. I yelled at my buddies, but they were too far away and busy talking around the fire. I kept my eyes on the light the whole time. It then started moving horizontally at about the same speed it had risen previously. It probably moved horizontally an eigth of a mile when all of the sudden, it shot off into the sky and out of sight faster than anything I&apos;d ever seen move before in my life. The object made no sound/noise at all. I just dropped my fishing rod and ran back to camp, shaking and hardly able to spit out a sentence.

While standing on the beach (very dark) at Golden Beach Campground with my father, (we were viewing shooting stars and had on a different visit witnessed a very bright flare, or flash from a iridium satellite, now defunct) we were able to see a airplane with lights making repeated large oblong circles over the mountains.  The plane was south of the lake, in the general direction of Sagamore, or Cedar River Flow to Moose River Plains, but probably was only a few miles from Raquette Lake. This activity made us very curious and we watched very closely as the plane continued the loops.  Finally, a similar plane entered from the east and closed the distance on the initial plane.  The second plane was now trailing the first one by a very short distance and was following an identical pattern.  This remained the situation for quite a while, only now they flew off into the distance. (Subsequent conversations and internet searches have led me to believe that they were military planes that were practicing refueling maneuvers over the desolate and isolated Adirondack Park)  An hour or so later, one of the planes flew extremely low over the the main street of the campground (and it contiued west over the lake) as I stood in the street between campsite 13 and 18 and the plane did not appear again.((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.

Another curious fact is that there was no sound associated with the movement of the craft.", "u.f.o. seen over mountain home ar.i was working at 9th. and collage citgo gas station,looking east, the day had broken clouds,but had a lager amount of blue sky,then i was looking up at the clouds and the blue sky.i then saw a silver cigar shaped u.f.o. flying from south to the east going behind each cloud, there was about 15 to 20 miles in between each cloud ,and then without turning around it went back to the south again, it then moved again without turning around, it moved back to the east.but,moved only about half way,then it stopped and went straight up about 12 miles then came down again, then as i watched it, it moved behind this one cloud, there was about 10 miles between this cloud and the others , i then watched the cloud disipate and the u.f.o. did not come out of the cloud,but it was gone.(it was about 150 ft to 250 ft long)", "appearing in north-northeast sky a lighted object alternating white strobe with green and red, perhaps blue.  Stationary, absolutely.  Logic would suggest hoving helicopter but seems too high above the horizon to be one.  So what else?  Stationary weather balloon?

Over 50 whitnesses!!, at fooball game.It was at my varsity football game, when i was standing at the sidlines when i see something out of the corner of my eye, a light.  Now this had to was very bright to see because of the fooball game lights.  Its was a light that was flashing, i didnt think much of it until it split into 3 sepret lights then disopeard and reapered in the same spot but in a cross.  Then it happened again in a different place.  There where about 50 whitnesses sense it was at a foot ball game.  That night i did some research about local sightings and on this sight i found a 2 year old report of the same thing that happened hear in Onawa!!! i coundn&apos;t beleive it!  all i can say is that theres something freaky goin on here! lol", "lights over Seattlemy friend and I were standing in the backyard in Ballard smoking cigarettes. my friend pointed to the sky. I saw three yellow lights hovering for a second or two, then shoot south over downtown Seattle at a high rate of speed.((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))", "three starlights forming a triangular shape, slowly moving across night sky.whilst observing constallations in the clear night sky, i noticed what looked to be three stars moving slowly in formation from a south-west to north east direction.They looked like a right angled triangle, and only changed formation slightly as their light faded moving towards the north eastern sky. There were no flashing lights. They just looked like a constallation of three stars slowly traversing the sky.They did not wobble; there was no sound.I have seen many known phenomonon in the night sky,i have great knowledge of astromony, but have never experienced a sighting such as this.((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness may have observed what are thought to be three U. S. Navy &quot;NOSS&quot; surveillance satellites.  PD))", "Bright light low on the horizon with eratic flight path and speeds.I saw a light straight ahead while driving down Rt. 49.  It did not blink and did not leave any trails.  It was small and bright and at first I thought it was a plane.  It appeared to &quot;be right&quot; with the apparent height, brightness, and speed.  But it appeared to be going from S to N and so I thought it strange that I saw no blinking lights.  It then began to speed up.  (All of this took place in probably less than 90 degrees of sky and for the most part was at or below about 45 degrees.  I&apos;m no scientist or astronomer, but have made these guestimates by thinking back and &quot;slicing&quot; the sky into pie pieces.)  Within a few seconds of it speeding up to the point where I thought no plane could go that fast, be seen, and not make a noise, it began a gradual, then steep sloping pattern. By this time I had pulled into a parking lot to a gas station/store that was very busy.  I had also convinced myself that it must be a meteor.  The way it changed speeds still confounded me, but the sharp downward turn that was almost a straight decent down reminded me of a falling star.  I still saw no wavering of the light and as much as I tried to see lights blinking, there were none.  If I had to compare it&apos;s brightness to a star I would say Regulus, but smaller in size.  It then began to slow down as it decended.  It made a swooping turn very low in the sky and then went back the way it came at at slower rate than when I had first noticed it.  There were some trees very low down and to the left which made it hard to see it much beyond the point I had first noticed it.  Even though I had probably made a nuisance of myself by pulling in slowing to the parking lot and parking at the edge near the road, no one seemed to pay any heed to what I was looking at.  All of this probably lasted no longer than a minute.  I was in the store a couple minutes and while I was standing in line I looked at the clock at it said 8:00 exactly.((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION WITH WITNESS))i wish to fix information that i screwed up.  i don&apos;t know what i was thinking when i posted it *sorry*  the date was actually 9/27/03 and since it was a few minutes before 8 i guess that would make the time actually 19:55?  i didn&apos;t know how else to fix it it but to use this form!((END))((NUFORC Note:  Time above amended to 19:55 hrs.

He and his fianc&eacute;e were on their way home, which is in the Thronhill area of Terrace when they spotted a strange object hovering high in the sky. The couple were driving along Crumb Road and looked up just over the trees and high up underneath the clouds they saw the object. He described it as being rather flat, dark gray in color and it sat stationary for approx: one minute before it disappeared. They both saw a number of lights on it, the fellow said he thought there were 5 lights, and his fianc&eacute;e thought there were 6. All the lights were white in color and the witness said they looked like the headlights on a vehicle. The witness believe the lights were running around the object but was hard to say for sure. His fianc&eacute;e thought at first it may have been a plane, but they soon ruled that out because it sat in the same position for such a long time. &quot;It did not move&quot;. After I asked a number of questions, the witnesses said the object would have been shaped more like a disk in shape. It was rather long, but not a lot of height to it. I asked the witness if he might give me some kind of idea of the size of the craft. As we know this is not an easy thing to do. The man turned to his fianc&eacute;e and asked, both said they thought it may have been around one and a half thumbs wide. This was a guess at how long this object may have been. No sound was heard, mainly because the couple were in their vehicle and they may have not heard anything due to the altitude the craft was at. They also reported that the sun was not shinning off it, in other words no reflection off the object. The couple said after the object disappeared they drove to the airport just to have a look to see if any planes were around the area, he told me there was nothing in the air.

The object appeared to be round in shape and moved with no sound whatsoever. There were no trail marks to indicate that it might be an aircraft.The object gave off a metallic white-blue color. After I observed the object for about 15 seconds it just disappeared.", "I wish I had known about this reporting system sooner, so that the explanation I am about to give would be fresher in my mind. Nevertheless, I remember it well enough; its not exactly something I will ever forget..... It was a bright, sunny, beautiful day, not a cloud in the sky. I was in the car in the back seat, on the right side. Several people were in the car with me, we were driving down the street, maybe 40 or 45 mph. I looked up and suddendly saw a small, round, metallic object hovering silently above the tree line. It didn&apos;t seem like it was more than 500 ft in the air. The UFO was reflecting the sun violently, the top of it was very bright. There was no jet streak. Also, it might have been spinning, but it was difficult to tell. The really interesting part is the fact that I had no urge to tell the other people in the car. For some reason I got this weird sense of calmness, like I somehow knew that the beings on board meant me no harm. So I just stared at this thing for maybe a minute or two, trying to figure it out as it contunued to hover in the air. I was also in the process of reading a book about UFO conspiracy, so the experience was especially surreal, since it was on my mind. The most outstanding part of the experience was when it left. When it departed, it did so in a path that was directly away from me, moving in a staight line. So, from my perspective, it appeared to get smaller and smaller, at a very high rate of speed. Very very high rate of speed. The craft literally blasted off into the atmosphere and out into space in a matter of seconds, and still, making no noise at all. It still left me with that state of calmness, and I hesitated to tell the others who were in the car. I still havn&apos;t told them, they probably won&apos;t believe me. I honestly believe that the beings on the craft knew that I saw them, and somehow made a telepathic connection with my subconcious mind, which calmed me, preventing me from feeling scared. The fact that it went away DIRECTLY from my point of view, in a staight line, I feel, supports this, since the chances of that happening coincidentally are very slim.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "((NUFORC Note:  We suspect twinkling stars may have been the cause of the sighting.  PD))Strobing &quot;stars&quot;???For about a year or so, I have started to notice objects in sky that look like stars, but they don&apos;t &quot;twinkle&quot; like other stars, and they don&apos;t have a steady glow like planets.  These &quot;stars&quot; have a very refined, sharp light, not soft like stars. The lights have a very sharp contrast like a strobe light or laser light.  With the naked eye, one can tell that these objects oscillate between red, white, and blue colors.  With binoculars, I noticed that it APPEARS that the blue light is a steady glow in the upper left and upper right &quot;corners&quot; of the object.  The red light appears to be a steady glow in the lower right &quot;corner&quot; and the white seems to be flashing from the center. (NOTE: it&apos;s very difficult get binoculars in a steady enough position to view these things clearly.  I need a telescope) In the past couple of weeks, I have taken a notice to just how many there really are.  I see 4 of these stars in the Northeastern sky, spread pretty far apart, I see 3 in the Northwestern sky in a triangular pattern, and 3 in the Southwestern sky, in a straight line.I don&apos;t think these objects are geosynchronous satellites, because they are staionary like other stars.  Thier referenced positions change with the rotation of the Earth.  Because of where they are positioned, they never pass overhead with the planet&apos;s rotations, and all of them stay somewhat close to the horizon.If these are satellites, why would they have visible lights on them? I have a friend in Charlotte, who is 30 miles south of me, is able to see these objects.  My wife and my parents have seen them, as well.I would love to know how many other stargazers have noticed this, and if anyone has a good explanation, because right now, I really don&apos;t think these are stars.", "The silent object was the largest thing I have ever seen above the ground.Huge craft (at least football field size).  No sound.  It had colored lights that did not seem to be lighting up the surrounding area.  It was gliding very slowly about 100 feet above the trees behind our house.  Both my son and I witnessed the event in different parts of the house but did not discuss it for years.  I could not see the shape from the angle I saw it.  &quot;My thoughts at the time were, wow!!! that&apos;s big.  I can&apos;t do anything about that&quot; so I went back to bed.  It was surreal to me.  I was somewhat relieved when people started to report similar sightings many years later.  It wasn&apos;t what I had heard being reported at the time - not saucer shaped etc.  I am a school teacher and my son was about 8 at the time.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was the 24th and I saw for the second time in a year an unusual black void in the sky above my home on Cape Cod.There were  no stars within the black phenomena even though it was a particularly starry evening. It was as if there was a jet black blob that changed shape from an oblong to a kidney shape up above. My dogs were trembling as if there was a thunder storm in progress. It was the strangest thing I had ever seen and to see 2 similar occurences in the same year that effected my dogs the same way each time was really weird. OK!! Now it&apos;s getting creepy because less than an hour ago I saw it again.This time it was moving very fast as it crossed the horizon.

This time it stuck out like a sore thumb against the clouded sky. The object was traveling Southwest and was moving at a fair clip, which is totally different from the way I observed it the last 2 times, when it was barely moving at all. This is a strange thing and I would love to know what it is.

November 17th 1997, I was watching the Leonids meteor shower on Caldesi Island near Clearwater Beach. When I saw 2 glowing, amber-colored lights to the west out over the Gulf. I pointed them out to my friends but they all just dismissed them as being planes. Until one craft started to get closer.One stayed behind, and the other started approaching the shore, where I was standing.It seemed to just glide right to me. I was so excited that I said to my friends, &quot;this is definitely a UFO&quot;. After I had said this they all took notice and became very scared. It did not take long for the four of them to take off running towards the pier.The craft was about 500 ft offshore when it sent down some kind of light beam that lit up a boat that was anchored right in front of me.But the light only lit in a cylinder and no light anywhere but the tube of light! I was not the least bit worried for some reason.Once the light beam went off, the entire craft was no longer lit the orange-reddish glow that it was before. It looked as if it was reflecting it&apos;s surroundings.I could see the water and the sky&apos;s reflection on the craft.It hovered above me and I remember feeling as if I was reporting to headquarters, so to speak. My head was tilted back all the way I was looking up at this object telling whoever everything about myself. I have no idea why I was doing this. I was mesmerized. Then I felt like I was given a telepathic message or picture of them.It was 2 beings that were facing each other. They were very tall and dark. My memory of this picture is not very clear. I know I thought they seemed to be some kind of reptilian creature. I really can&apos;t say for sure if they were dark green or black, if they had scales or what. But I do know they had just introduced themselves to me.This introduction must have taken some time.My friends had already reached the pier which was very far from where I was. It was about a half an hour to walk that distance. After the encounter ended the craft just headed over the neighborhood, with no sound at all, it was lurking over certain houses, and I decided I needed to follow it. I ran back to where my friends were. Clearwater Police Officers were at the pier, they had also seen this object. They were all discussing what it could be when I showed up. I convinced a friend to come with me, and we followed this thing from Clearwater all the way to Tampa. It was so bizarre. When we were leaving the beach, watching this thing in the sky, was very eerie. It was as if time had stopped for me, like everything changed. My whole world had changed forever. There was not a cloud in the sky and we both followed it to the Courtney Campbell Causeway. Once we were side by side, it started to created a cloud or fog around it, so it became impossible to see it. After about 10 minutes the entire sky was just fog.So we ended the chase. Even though I still wanted to try to find it.I have had several more encounters with EBE crafts.Two years ago I went to Sedona, Arizona and I saw many in the sky at night. These were blue-ish lights that zipped around really fast, but went right back to where they initially were. I saw them every night for 2 weeks while I was there.Also in Gulf Breeze and Panama City I have seen interesting lights that hover around like bugs, buzzing back and forth. I go to Gulf Breeze every so often to watch them, but I would rather be with a group! Than to just be by myself...I do not want to be afraid of these things. But I really would really like to know what they are.Most people do not want to talk about this type of thing with me. They will either think you are crazy for talking about it, or they just don&apos;t believe you. So I hope to know more as to what they are and why they are here, and what they want.If I can find some sort of group or research team in this area it would be wonderful. Could you tell me what web sites if any, or meetings, when and where, that would be great!

ON 09/08/03.ON SEPTEMBER 8, 2003 AT 23:05, WHILE WATCHING MARS FROM MY SECOND-FLOOR SOUTH WINDOW, I OBSERVED A BRIGHTLY LIT OBJECT IN THE SKY JUST ABOVE THE TREELINE SOUTH OF MY HOUSE IN BEDMINSTER AND ABOVE BRIDGEWATER TOWNSHIP.  THE OBJECT SUDDENDLY APPEARED IN MY VIEW AND MOVED SLOWLY FROM EAST TO WEST FOR ABOUT 10 SECONDS BEFORE DISAPPEARING.  THE HORIZONTAL OBJECT WAS A FLATTENED OVAL, AND SEEMED TO HAVE TWO STORIES OF NUMEROUS WINDOWS OR LIGHTS.  THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE THE WIDTH AND A QUARTER WIDER THAN THE MOON ON SEPTEMBER 8.  IMMEDIATELY AFTER SEEING THE OBJECT, I MADE A SKETCH OF THE POSITION OF WHAT I HAD SEEN.  AT 23:35, I TELEPHONED THE BEDMINSTER TOWNSHIP POLICE TO REPORT WHAT I HAD SEEN AND ASKED IF ANYONE ELSE HAS REPORTED SEEING THIS OBJECT.  THE ANSWER WAS NO.

I HAVE NEVER WITNESSED ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE.", "Lights appear over football game in Northwest RenoAt a high school football game in Reno I was watching a game with a few friends, with the up coming air races there were a lot of planes out I saw a set of lights that I assumed was a plane.  They were a little brighter than a regular plane but I had written it off as being a low flying plane.  Within the first few seconds they grew to be as bright as a set of headlights.  Whenever I looked up from the game I could see that they were still there and they had turned slightly and had a bright gree light behind it and every once in a while a light would randomly blink.  I could tell the intensity of the lights because the street lights of the library just above the field were very dull compared to the set above.  The lights disappeared three minutes later and then they reappeared and disappeard for about another half hour.  A friend of mine also saw the lights right before they disappeared.  I was just wondering if anyone else in Northwest Reno had seen something similar.", "At 11:55 pm on August 30th, ten people who were gathered around a campfire in northern Minnesota witnessed a triangular shaped craft that was subsequently chased by multiple military aircraft.  The craft&apos;s &apos;wingspread&apos; was an apparent two inches at arm&apos;s length.  It had four white lights in a diamond shape at the front, an apparent one quarter inch in size at arm&apos;s length, and two solid red lights on each of the apparent leading edges.  None of the lights blinked and all were very bright.  We heard the craft coming over the trees at the water&apos;s edge before we saw it, so it was apparently flying very slowly.  All were in awe upon seeing it, as it was flying much too slowly to be a &apos;standard&apos; aircraft, the lights were very bright and distinct, and yet it was apparently high the sky.  The sound it made was that of a very high flying commercial jet.  It was flying west to east, directly toward Duluth, Mn. Prior to seeing this craft, two of the witnesses had been watching two apparent military aircraft in the distance north of the lake, flying east.  After the craft passed overhead, these two military craft were seen flying very fast southeast to intercept the unindentified craft.  No sound was heard from the military craft, which suggests they were at high altitude, and one of the witnesses, formerly in the military, stated that they were flying above mach speed.  They covered ground VERY quickly.  They then intercepted the unidentified craft several miles away and then flew next to it, while two more military aircraft appeared from the south and also flanked the craft, as it disappeared into the distance.  All of the military craft were much smaller than the object, which dwarfed them.  From this, it was estimated that the size of the object was approximately one thousand feet from wing tip to wing tip. Thirty minutes later, at 12:30am, several military craft were seen coming from the east, circled the area, and then joined with a group of aircraft following the exact path of the first object, and attempting to fly in the same triangular pattern, apparently in a attempt to show that the first object was only a military excercise. Again at 1:34am, two more military aircraft circled the area, this time close enough that through a binoculars they could be identified as fighter jets (the lights on these aircraft made structure visible), and again they joined with a formation of other aircraft flying the exact path of the original object, and in a triagle formation. All witnesses thought this situation had an element of high strangeness about it.  In one hour and thirty five minutes, twenty six aircraft were observed, including the original object.  It is believed that twenty five of the aircraft were &apos;normal&apos; military craft.  The witnesses have been in this area during the summer for many, many years, and have never seen this number of aircraft, either during the day or at night, and hardly ever have seen military aircraft of any kind flying overhead.  We are not on a normal commercial route and seldom see commercial craft overhead.  It could be that the first two military craft flew in from Minot Air Force base in Minot North Dakota, although this is only speculation. We were able to video tape portions of the encounter, although we did not get the object on tape as it first went overhead, as we needed to send someone through the dark and into the cabin to retrieve the camera, thus the quality of the video is not very good. This was the first sighting of any kind for the vast majority of the witnesses.  I&apos;m the only person who has ever seen a UFO, having made a report to MUFON several years ago.  Only one of the witnesses had been drinking alcohol, and that only beer.", "The object was seen over my house it was silverish gray and seem to just hover in place for 10 mins.I&apos;m placing this report because it was the first ufo i have ever seen and it was quite interesting. I have not seen any more ufo&apos;s since but it was my first experience and it was &quot;unbelievable&quot;. Me and my mother and aunt were standing outside having a conversation. For some reason I looked up into the sky on our back porch. Looking up with the side of the gutters on our house as a frame in my vision, I saw a silver grayish round object suspended in the sky not moving at all. I pointed it out to my mother and aunt they both said they had no idea what it was. Then i went in the house to get some binoculars. I came back out to the porch and when I looked up to where the the object was before but it had vanished. I was mad. Because this was my first ufo and it didn&apos;t last very long.

Impressed the hell out of us. WE WANT 1This night was the last night of archery hunting season for Oregon. Myself and my friend of twenty years took our time coming down off the mountain. We stopped at a privately owned piece of property towards the bottom to bugle (call) elk that are frequently in the area just for fun. It was dark by this time. My friend bugled a couple of times out of the passenger seat and something caught my eye. I don&apos;t know how to explain why , it just didn&apos;t move right it seemed to zig-zag in a way that was so smooth and precise that you wouldn&apos;t notice easily. The objects view was blocked by a tree for a couple of seconds when I told my friend to check it out when it appeared again and let me know if it was zig-zagging. He confirmed it and we both grabbed binoculars and exited the vehicle. The object was a light-blue panel of light emitted in a almost fog like way but the panel itself was clearly defined. We were not able to see any shadows or parts of the object that you would assume would have to be above the panel. It zig-zagged from the west to the east for about a 45 degree amount of sky and I can&apos;t tell you if it stopped but I noticed a twinkle off to the side and what appeared to be below the object. The object then went up and it did it QUICKLY! There was never a sound or a streak trailer or anything. We are positive that the light didn&apos;t just go out, it went away from earth at a speed that just does not make sense. We stood in awe talking about it for 5-10 minutes when the first of 6 or seven jets or planes showed up. They had red bue strobes and seemed to be patroling the same airspace the light was in only minutes before. We do not have any airforce for a few hundred miles but they seemed to come from both the southeast and northwest. We did not notice the speed of the light until we saw how slowly the jets/planes movement across the sky was in comparison. Altitude looked relatively the same. We are not sure but the jets/planes seemed to slowly gain altitude and take up positions surroundi! ng the area very high up. This was all seen in a matter of 1-1 1/2 hours. Baker county is very near the 45 parallel.((ADDENDUM FROM SAME WITNESS, SUBMITTED JANUARY 15, 2005))Lessons learnedI am your 9/28/03 eastern oregon submitter. I Just wanted to drop a few thoughts on the subject after honestly having faced the fact that there are no rules or limits. I have spent a great deal of time &quot;looking up&quot; over the past year and will continue to &quot;sleep under the stars&quot; every once in a while but I refuse to let what I have seen absorb so much of my life. I have since had a cowardly object &quot;look my way&quot; on two seperate occassions. My opinion is that these objects move in a friction-less pathway(vacuum?)that is somehow created in an open environment.

I looked up and saw a bright green, almost flourescent in color, fireball descending down from the sky and knew from the size of it it was to large to be a falling star.  It lasted for 10 to 15 seconds before it vanished, not vaporized or breaking apart but just vanished.  The more I sit here and think of the occurence the more I realize that it was not going at an incredible speed such as a falling star shooting into the atmoshphere, but more of a constant speed, then accelerated for 1 or 2 seconds then to only disapear. .  The fire from the rear of it looked as if fire does on the back of a jet thrusting forward or faster, this is the only way I can think of to describe it. Also if it helps I was off of Gulf Beach Hwy near Perdido Key and it looked as if it were descending down towards the intercoastal waterway. It was the size of possibly 2 softballs put together. I plan to try to draw an illustration of the object and send it in if I am able to reproduce the same image on paper. I can only hope that my description helps in any way and to wish that I knew what it was that I saw.  I know it is an experience that I will never forget. Be it a meteorite or an unidentified flying object, I truly believe that we are not alone nor have we ever been.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and she sounded to us to be quite credible, and to be a good observer.

And then a few nights ago my neighbors called me and said they were watching the green fireballs in the sky and they were so excited to see them. It was 2 from my understanding. I was going into surgery the next morning and have not talked to them since but I am sure they would call, I am going to call them and give them the hotline number and her husband was in the military here in Pensacola so he would know more about the latitude and longitude than I would.

We were on highway 97 heading south.  The sun was shining bright that day and there were only a few high clouds.  About a mile north of the city, there are a few hills and valleys.  As we came down a hill, I noticed an object floating about a hundred feet from the ground.I assumed it was one of the Goodyear Mini-blimps that they have for sports events.  My first thought seemed reasonable, that it was flying somewhere for a big sports event, I had seen one fly over my house in 1985, so it was not a big surprise to see it.But two things caught my attention immediately.  First, it was a little skinny for a blimp and secondly, it seemed to be flashing a bright spotlight.  I laughed and pointed it to my friend in the passenger seat.  I had to watch the road, so I looked away for a second to drive, as we passed a tree.I became concerned because my friend&apos;s jaw was wide open, and he had a look of total blankness.  He was able to get a really good look at the object.  As we passed the tree I suddenly realized it was no blimp.There was no GOODYEAR written on the side, no propellers, no tail fins, no flashing signs.  What I thought was the harsh reflection of the sun on the skin of a balloon was in fact, a bright light coming from beneath a large (100&apos;) metallic cigar shaped craft.It was only about 100 or 150 yards from the road.  It was barely above tree top level.  I had assumed I would get a good look at it as we continued down the highway.  The object continued to hover for a second, then vanished into a shadowy streak, climbing altitude and disappearing over the road.The whole event lasted about 5 seconds.  The craft made no sounds.  A few hundred yards down the road, we saw a family bar-b-que outside, but they were totally oblivious to the sighting.  There were no other cars on the road, so it seems there were only two witnesses.My friend got a much better look at the craft then I did.  He told me later that there were beams of light shooting out from underneath it.  I can remember being hit with the light, which was very bright.  Because the sun was starting to set on the other side of the road, to my right,my thought was that an unlucky reflection was hitting me in the eye.What I didn&apos;t see, that the passenger did, was that as we came down the hill, two beams of light (like search lights) poured out from the craft and pointed at the car. The light was very bright, but annoyed me to look away. Very quickly, I began to have difficulty remembering the shape of the craft and what it was doing.  A couple of days later, I had forgotten about the lights and was forgetting the shape.  The only thing that was clear to me was what went on in my mind.  I remember what I was thinking just as clearly today as then (8 years later).  I have trouble remembering what I SAW.  That&apos;s odd.Fortunately my friend remembers it all.  He doesn&apos;t talk about it much, I don&apos;t think he&apos;ll ever say more about it.  We have all the details locked in our memories between us.UFOs are pretty common here in Missouri.  There was a sighting this morning (Sept. 19, 2003) outside of Carthage MO (64836)- but I didn&apos;t see it- so I can&apos;t report it.  Four cars saw it, maybe someone else will.((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  We will invite the witness to submit a second report about the apparent sighting in Carthage.  PD))", "10:30pm i was taking my garbage to the dumpster outside when i looked at the stars. They were bright and beautiful. Then i saw a bright moving star (light) moving very fast to the right.. it stopped then made a very sharp turn straight up.

It continued going straight up then slowed down then sped off fast again to the left this time.", "Saw an eerie blue/white lighting up of the entire western section of the sky above Los Angeles.Driving west at 1:15am on September 13, we observed an enormous lighting up of the sky above Los Angeles. It was a huge flash of a blue/white glow and scared all of us riding in the car. It was so enormous and so sudden and so bright that all of us thought that a nuclear device had gone off. We were situated just a few miles east of downtown on the 10 Freeway looking toward the west so that whatever it was could have originated from the ocean. We called a few local radio stations at the time, but no one knew what we were talking about. Do you know what that was? So as to reinforce my credibility, let me tell you that no one in our party had been drinking and we are all over 50 years old, my husband is a management consultant and I am a lawyer. We were returning from the Los Angeles County Fair in Pomona (east of Los Angeles - the flask we saw was in the west and covered the entire westerly sky).This was very disturbing - what with the current political situation, everyone&apos;s first thought was of some kind of terrorism. But, it seems clear that this was not the case and it must have been some kind of natural phenomenon or maybe. . . .Please advise. It&apos;s driving us all nuts to know that we witnessed something extraordinary and not to be able to find out what it was.Thank you, ((name deleted))", "An eractic object with three bright white lights traveling with traffic over I-5 in the middle of CaliforniaMy wife, my parents and I were driving down I-5 towards LA in heavy traffic traveling about 65 miles per hour.  Ahead of us the traffic started slowing down.  All of a sudden three lights popped over the field to the east of us and swooped overhead.  We were all looking at this object (I say an object because the lights seemed fixed to something but we couldn&apos;t see any structure - once I thought I saw a long pole-like boom heading to one of the lights, but I can&apos;t be sure) as we, it and the rest of the traffic moved south at 45-50 miles per hour.  It bounced up and down, looked like it landed in a field to the west of us, then zoomed back over the interstate. At first I thought it was a crop duster, although it was very dark to be spraying.  But the object didn&apos;t follow any field pattern I know of, nor did I see any cloud of pesticide ejected from the object which I believe would leave a haze that would fog the lights from the farm houses in the distance.  Those lights stayed crystal clear.  Also, the object would speed up ahead of us then return along the interstate.  My wife thought it might be a small plane or ultrlight in distress, but the object didn&apos;t have any colored wing lights, just three very intense white beams one of which disappeared every so often (I think the bulk of the object blocked the far light at these times, but I have no special reason to think so). The object stayed around the highway for a few minutes, then rushed off to the east.  It seemed to have set down in a field about 1/4 mile behind us.  As I was in the backseat, I kept watching it wondering what it might be. It appear once more well behind our car and moved west over the interstate a minute or so later.  We were well away from it; I could only see the lights as dots. None of us heard any noise although we could easily hear car engines and crickets (as we discovered later) while moving at speed.  The radio wasn&apos;t on.  When I asked what size they thought the object was, three of us felt the craft couldn&apos;t have been more than 20 feet long (my wife and mother compared it to the size of a large car).  My father thought it was relatively large. (As an amateur astronomer, I know that appearent dimensions get funny at night.  So I gave my parents a test to help them visualize the size of the object (my wife already knows this test).  I asked them to compare the object to the full moon.  Then I asked them which coin is roughly the size of the full moon when held at arm&apos;s length.  My mom thought the object was much larger than the full moon, say about 8 to ten disks wide, and correctly said a dime is roughly the disk of the moon.  My father didn&apos;t give me an estimation, but incorrectly believed a quarter matches the appearent diameter of the moon.)  We figured the object never went very high above us and estimated the closest approach to be about 500 feet to the west and less than 100 feet above from the appearent height of the power lines running along the highway and the height of the crops it disappeared into. My wife and I are teachers (she&apos;s a pre-school teacher and head after-school teacher; I&apos;m a middle school science and math teacher).  My mother just retired from teaching 5th grade for 37 years.  My dad retired from brokering steel.

When I looked up at the side of the house, I noticed a round object moving across the sky at a high rate of speed.  I looked up to watch the sphere, which was a silver/gray color. At first I thought it was perhaps a balloon.  It moved so quickly overhead that I had to turn around to try to follow it. When I turned around, I lost sight of the object and was not able to locate it again.  There was no sound.  The sky was clear, with no clouds.  I still thought that it might be some kind of a balloon, but I checked the directions and discovered that the object had traveled from east to west.  I have never seen anything like this before personally, but it appeared to be the same type of object I once saw on TV which had appeared over Mexico City.", "object moved from one point to another so fast that it looked liked there were two of themit was silver , the shape of a silver dollar.

PD))", "On Thursday, September 18th/03 (shortly after 7PM I think) I witnessed a white spherical object moving in roughly an east to west direction over Kamloops.  It was not yet dark. I estimate the circumference of the object at about 3/4 of the size of a dime held at arms length.I was sitting on my balcony in (deleted by HBCC UFO) facing east and south watching a thick lower cloud cover get fiercely blown - roughly from west to east (possibly southwest to northeast?).  We had very strong winds that afternoon and evening. The sky was not fully overcast and there were two levels of cloud cover.  The upper cloud layer was much less dense, more dispersed, and did not move nearly as rapidly as the lower cloud cover. As I looked up between, say, +/-35 degrees to the horizon I saw a perfectly round very white object come into my view moving slowly in a straight line roughly east to west (possibly northeast to southwest) above the lower cloud cover (at roughly the same level as the upper cloud cover).  In any event it appeared to be moving in the direction opposite to the wind. I observed this object between 30 seconds to 60 seconds.  Towards the end of the sighting the object appeared to smoothly turn away from me slightly as it moved into clouds in the upper cloud layer where I could no longer see it.  It did not reemerge that I could see. I cannot estimate the size of this object.  I am not particularly good at distances and my only real frames of reference are the two layers of cloud cover.  I don&apos;t know the elevations. I believe it shifted direction slightly because it appeared to reduce somewhat in size before it entered the upper clouds - as if it had turned away and was receding into the distance. I won&apos;t hazard a guess at the size of the object but I will stand on the fact that it was white, perfectly round, and it moved against the direction of the lower cloud cover.

From what I was told there were a number of other witnesses who watched an object, orange in color move strangely in the sky. From the description I received I believe this sighting was of the planet Mars. A bunch of folks were observing the Moon and Mars in the Cranbrook, B.C. area. There were some clouds which moved in front of the Moon and the planet Mars, as the clouds moved out of the way before the next batch roll by all the witnesses observed a orange colored moving around the night sky, but where the light was located was in exactly the same position Mars was. I believe when everyone lost sight of the planet due to clouds, and then seeing it again as the clouds passed by, it gave the illusion of the planet moving, or an object as reported to me. Also due to the length of time the light was seen, my conclusion after talking with the witness is that everyone was watching the planet Mars.

The artist, James Taylor, had just returned from intermission and was beginning the first song of the second set when I looked upward to the stars. I noted the location of the North Star to the right of the stage, then looked over my right shoulder and noted the location of Mars. I then lay back in the grass and just watched the sky for several minutes while the artist performed. As I was looking upward, I observed a satellite rising from the Southeast, to the east of Mars location in the sky. According to the NASA Liftoff website, there were three satellites visible to the East from this zip code within this time frame: Cosmos 1340 from 20:32:34 pm to 20:45:16 pm, Lo 19 from 20:37:59 pm to 20:52:37 pm, and Cosmos 1674 from 20:40:32 pm to 20:54:04 pm. I only observed one of the above listed satellites and it rose from the left side, or East side, of Mars: the only satellite listed above that matched the trajectory of the satellite I observed is Lo 19. I am listing this information for the following reasons: I was not wearing a watch and have only an estimate of the actual time of the observation; The second object I observed from this location was on a similar trajectory and was approximately the same observable size. A few minutes after Lo 19 passed, I observed the second object, approaching from approximately the same area of the sky. It appeared to be approximately the same size as the first object I observed. Although it was red in color, I assumed it was another satellite. As it moved North across the sky, I noted the velocity of the object was considerably greater than the first object and I called my wife&amp;#8217;s attention to it. I pointed out the object to my wife and we both observed as it continued in a straight trajectory for approximately 2-3 seconds then turned right, to the east. It continued on to the east then began to turn randomly to the left and right, finally turning back toward the area where I had first observed it. It moved in a straight line for a few seconds then began turning randomly again, moving farther South East and disappearing on the night horizon. The object was red in color with a light aura or haze around it that extended out approximately twice the width of the object itself, becoming somewhat brighter at the edge, which created a &quot;ring&quot; effect around the object.  The object moved in what appeared to be perfectly straight lines with no observable arch. The turns were rapid and precise, never less than 90 degrees as I recall, and the object neither accelerated nor decelerated before, during or after each turn.", "Square object tumbling under cloud level in the Warwickshire, UK skiesWith striking similarity to the case reported on the 8/31/03 in Basingstoke, UK &apos;Cylinder...&apos; &apos;...that tumbled&apos;.  My partner and I watched on a hot, cloudy day, as a square object (kind of like a mortar board) tumbled (or flipped as I would have originally described it) along at a steady pace, slowly, under cloud level.  It appeared to be very small, and again, I can see the similarity to the Basingstoke sighting, as we at first thought it could be a &apos;balloon&apos;.  However, it flipped or rotated slowly and evenly, in a perfectly straight line for quite a distance until we couldn&apos;t see it.  If it were a balloon it would have changed course at least once, or showed some kind of alternate movement, but it didn&apos;t sway from its course once.  I tried to zoom in on it using the my camcorder, but alas, it was too small to get a good focus on.

We could&apos;nt figure out what it was, and all of a sudden it just veered straight up, i would say from the long distance it was from us, 1/2 a mile straight up, then it would go down.

I also had a small fire that I was tending to nearby, the remnants of an old tree that had fallen days earlier.  I was looking at the northwestern sky, noting that it was remarkably clear this evening.  I began to trace out the constellations of Hercules and Corona Borealis, when I noticed that within the adjacent constellation of Draco three previously motionless objects, that I had assumed where stars, began to spread apart in the sky!  These objects resembled stars in relative size, magnitude, and color; however, they spread apart, briefly, and began to travel in tandem across the sky!  I watched them travel across the sky in a triangular pattern until the three objects grew faint and disappeared.  I have seen satellites in orbit, they move faster across the sky.  I have never seen a satellite orbiting close to another.  Certainly, they would not grow faint and disappear.  I have seen high flying planes in the sky, as I live near an airport, however, I have never seen them fly this high or this close, nor did I see more than one light on any of these flying objects.  Their flight lasted 20-30 seconds by my best judgment, I knew immediately that I had seen something extraordinary.((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether  the witness may have observed the three satellites, which are thought to be part of the U. S. Navy &quot;NOSS&quot; system.   However, those satellites remain in the same apparent formation, and do not spread apart.

There was a huge cigar shaped object right above my car,it wwas bigger thween the cvar and i was going about 55 and the thing was going the same speed, when I looked up it had blue,red,white lights kind of look like out side lights It was huge,Ijust looked up there for a 22nd did not think nothing of it,then it was gone.

The sky was very clear tonight and the craft was in plain view.", "I was visited by an unexplained anamoly in the middle of the morning.It happened about 9 years ago. I had a visitation from something right-out of my ceiling in my den. It was very hot earlier in the day and right up to bed time.I went to bed about 11:oopm. My head was facing south away from the den windows. What I remember happened exactly as it did 9 years ago (because I can&apos;t forget this moment).I found myself standing up looking out the windows of my den which faces  my neighbors house approximately 6 feet away. It was 3:30am. All I could see was a blinding white light but it was&apos;nt making my eyes close. It just made me focus more intently.But when I asked myself why I was focusing so intently at this light just outside the window, my position changed. Suddenly I felt as if someone had picked me up with a giant hand and placed me on my back resting on the sofa.This was performed in one swift motion. I was now facing north.I was completely conscious and realized that this was&apos;nt a dream. Then I noticed what appeared to be a person in a white suit, wearing welders goggles.Then focusing more clearly I noticed that these goggles were fluctuating and changing shape from thick band to narrow band.I noticed it had three long fingers on each hand. It gave me the impression that it was puzzled with me because of its hand movements kept jockeying back and forth resting on the window it had made out of my ceiling and back to its face and then leaning on its long hand.It had no nose or mouth or ears. Suddenly this stopped when I said,&quot;what the hell is that?&quot;It got shocked and leaped up suddenly surprised like it was discovered.It stretched its long arm out to close the window. This seemed odd to have a long arm, only because the window was&apos;nt that big.The whole time I basically viewed a half a torso through this window.This has taken a long time to reconcile. when I tried to explain this through communication I have become intensely afraid of describing this, just as intensely afraid right after it happened.I called the F.B.I. not long after this happened but they tried to chalk it up to hallucinations or stress.((NUFORC Note:  Witness describes self as working in the legal industry.  PD))", "alien abductionI am a 19 year old from Culpeper, Virginia. I really didnt see an alien space craft but I was abducted. It all started when i was sleeping in my bedroom. I was sleeping on my bed when i rolled over onto my left side. I opened my eyes and saw this alien looking down on me. The alien was smoke (black) colored skin, had shiny, black reflective eyes. It was tall and slender. When I looked into the eyes of the alien, I immediately froze. I was defenseless and had no control over my body. I couldn&apos;t even move or speak. I tried to open my mouth and scream but I couldn&apos;t. The Alien overrided my neurological system, which made it difficult for me to move. The only thing that I could do was watch in horror. The Alien then lifted his/her hand and I suddenly saw a bright flash of light that last for about a second. I was then on what appeared to be the UFO. The room (inside the UFO) was really bright. I saw 3 other aliens. They had me on a hard bed which was made out of some type of smooth stone. I then watched them inject a needle that had 3 smaller needles around it, inside my right bicep. I didn&apos;t feel any pain but I was able to feel the coldness of the needle. After the injection, an alien came over to me, lifted his hand up and a bright flash of light fulfilled my eyes. I was then back in my house, laying on my bed. I got out of bed and went into the kitchen and turned on the light. There, I observed my right arm (bicep muscle) and I saw markings (red dots) where they had injected me with their needles. I saw one dot, about 3cm and 3 smaller dots (about 1cm) that surrounded the bigger dot. This was my encounter.", "Observed very large lighted object moving and then  hovering  above a hay  field.This encounter was one of two that I have had in my liftime, I am not a UFO watcher but have been convinced of something unusual happening around us. On the night of my sighting I was helping out with farm chores for a neighboring dairy farmer, this is a remote farming community where we frequently pitch in to help a neighbor. The farm owner and I had finished bringing the cattle into the barn to feed them prior to milking, as was customary we went to the house for a coffee and somthing to eat before we began milking. We went to a sitting room which has a bay window that looks out over a 30 acre hay field, beyond the field is a large tract of timberland encompassing several hundred acres, this timberland is uninhabited and has no roads. We had been sitting in the room just chatting when my friend asked if I could see the lights approaching over the tree tops, I had not but caught site of them immediatly. We mused that they must be a helicopter. The VT and NY National Guard would often run training missions in our area out of Burlington VT or Plattsburgh NY so that is what we assumed this was. We continued to watch the lights approach from over the timberland and as they came closer we could see that the light were very different from an approaching helicopter. The elivation was no more than 1500&apos; which initially led us to beleive we were seeing a chopper, with the lights just a few hundred feet away and moving slowly but steadily toward the hay field we went outside to get a better look. As we walked out the front door the first thing we noticed was that there was a loud hum and definite electrical poping coming from the electric line on the poles that ran along the roadway, I need to comment that this noise was alarmingly loud and was definitely coming from the utility lines, had I not been able to see the lines I would had guessed the insulators were arcing and bursting, but as we walked under the lines toward the hay field and the approaching lights we observed that the lines were mot! ionless and there was no arcing. We ended up standing side by side about 50 to 75&apos; into the field. The lights were at this time just above the tree tops and I would estimate 800&apos; feet to the South West. We could now hear what I would say was a droaning hum coming from the object, the noise would vary in pitch from low to high but in low tones. As the object approached the edge of the field it turned slightly to the right on a North Easterly course, we thought it would pass us on that course but as we stood there it entered the area of the field and then when it was 300 or 400&apos; feet away it turned again and came toward us. I did not mention that this was a clear night with stars visible, and that as this object got closer we were aware that it blocked out the sky in a large area, we guessed the the object was 200&apos; wide by 500&apos; or 600&apos; feet in length. This may sound odd but we had the impressionm that the object turned to observe us. It approached us to within 100&apos; and remained at what we agreed was about 1500 feet in elivation. What happened next was what convinsed us that this was a very unusual event, the object began to power down and became completly stationary, the engine noise was also completely gone. It did not move in any dirction whatsoever, however the lights remained on. We were both scared to the point of wanting to run but curiosity kept us in the field. The only noise was the crackling of the utility lines now behind us and out next to the road. The object was lighted. We were now looking nearly straight up at the object and as I recall we could see several lights on what to us was the front of the object, the lights were yellow, green, white, orange and blue. We could see the front and along the bottom of both sides of the object the light were arranged at intervals of several feet apart along what we observed as the edges of the object. We just stood and stared at this thing for 5 to 8 minutes, I remember us being really astonished by the fact that this thing was completly motionless and ! made absolutliy not audible noise. When it was ready to go it powered up and began to move on the same course that it had been on when we first observed it, no cars passed in the time that we were watching it. We had a clear view to the Northeast into Canada from where we stood and the object was headed slowly in that direction. My friend asked if we should call someone, I suggested that we call the Plattsburgh, NY Airforce Base and make a report. He went back to the house to make the call while I stayed outside to watch it move away. The utility lines continued to crackle and pop even when the object had moved to 8 or 10 miles away (the electricity and phone was not effected) I went back to the house after 10 minutes and found my friend on the phone, he said that he was speaking to a Lt Colonel from Plattburgh air base. He was on the phone for at least 30 minutes making a detailed report of the event, this colonel took the report seriously and was very patient asking many questions. I was asked to go out and look for the object 3 or 4 times as they were speaking. I did observe two jet aircraft fly over the farm but they were heading Easterly about 90 degrees to the object, the object was at least 30 miles to the north by this time but should have been visible to the pilots or picked up on radar. The base did disclose that the planes we observed were from the base and that they reported no unusual activity. When the phone call ended I asked my friend if he thought he had been taken seriously or just led on, he said that the colonel was sincerly interested in what was said and appeared to be writing word for word the conversation. It would be an understatement to say that this was a very unsettling experience. This fellow and I have never spoken to any one but our wives in regard to what we saw. I now live just 4 miles from the farm where this happened. I stopped to visit with this man last year, we had not spoken to each other of the event in 20 years! As we talked the conversation went back to that nigh! t, he admitted that this has had a lasting effect that to this day haunts him, he said that several times over the years he has heard the same noise at night we heard from the craft but does not go out to look. I was made curious by what happened and have used my curiosity as motivation to read all that I can on the subject. At the time of this occurance I was employed as a State Deputy Fish and Wildlife Officer, my friend was and is to this day a dairy farmer on this same farm. I know it likely seems odd to not report this for 21 years, but to be honest I felt that it was not going to be taken seriously and my friend will not to this day speak to anyone in regard to what happened. He does accept that I have chosen to make the report and may be willing at some point to weigh in with his account.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Sometimes stationary, sometimes moving in a horizontal path for a short duration. I am an ex-pilot and know aircraft movements, and aerial flare patterns, these lights were not aircraft related. Due to there frequency of occurance, I am thinking they are some type of atmospheric phenom., but noone has been able to explain them. The closest explanation I have come to is ball lightning, but they do not match the descriptions I&apos;ve read. These balls of light suddenly appear(like a flare) but there is no upward or downward movement, always horizontal.

It was low, it was big, it was motionless, and had alot of lights, and no sound.And it was right in front of me, I could hit it with a rock if i had one. I stopped my car and stood in the road and was trying to comprehend what I was seeing.

The sighting occurred at Rend Lake State Park located south of Mt. Vernon, IL. The sighting involved 3 adult witnesses and one child. The principal adult witness offered testimony to MUFON investigators regarding the incident. According to the witness, he and his wife and daughter along with their friend were attending July 4th festivities at Rend Lake State Park. They were located at the southern end of the North Marcum Recreation Area when they had their sighting. All of the witnesses were looking up into the sky in the direction of the lake dam to the South. The witnesses along with an estimated 200+ other people were anticipating the final skydive jump for the day, which was to soon take place. As their attention was focused on the approaching plane used by the skydivers, the witnesses noticed two luminous white objects in the same general portion of the sky. The two objects seemed to be traveling together. They were described as being round to elliptical in shape. The apparent size was estimated to be similar to a golf ball at arm&rsquo;s length. Actual size was estimated to be 11-30 feet. The objects reportedly moved in a straight line from the South/Southwest to the North/Northwest (and directly overhead) at a constant rate of speed that was estimated to be 500mph. The altitude of the objects was estimated to be 10,000 feet. However, the witnesses were not sure of this fact. No sound was heard and the objects left no trails. The witnesses all agreed that the objects were radiating a bright white light rather than simply reflecting sunlight. The color was described as &quot;intense white.&quot; They watched the objects until they disappeared behind the trees on the Northern horizon. The witnesses thought they seemed to be flying in the direction of Mt. Vernon, IL where the witnesses reside. Sighting duration was estimated to be 2-3 minutes. Despite all the other people that were present, the witnesses stated that no one else seemed to notice these objects. The witnesses even asked others if they had seen them after they flew out of sight. No one seemed to have seen the objects, since the witnesses said they received strange looks from those immediately around them when they asked.Weather conditions included clear sunny skies and wind speed averaging 9.5 mph out of the Southwest. This roughly corresponds with the direction of the mystery objects. Upon completing an interview with the principal witness, investigators drove to the Jefferson County and Franklin County Sheriffs&rsquo; offices, since Rend Lake is in both of these counties. Inquiries were made to see if any calls were received by their offices concerning UFO sightings at that designated time and location. Both offices stated that no such calls were received. A trip was then made to Rend Lake to see if some of the Park Rangers had known of any other UFO sightings on that day. After circling the entire lake including every campsite for more than two hours, a single Park Ranger was never found. This search was abandoned and an attempt was later made to email the Rend Lake Recreational Office to see if it would be possible to contact the skydiving group that made the jump that day. No reference was made to UFOs in the email. It was hoped that perhaps the skydivers or the pilot might have witnessed the event as well. Unfortunately, the email never received a reply. Therefore, the report must stand on the sole testimony of the witness and his family.

WAMy friend and I were heading home late one evening (from another one of her dreaded dog shows!)  We were driving east on the very outskirts of Ellensburg, WA.  We were chatting away, trying to pass the time since it was a long trip home.  It was an extremely clear (and slightly frigid) night.  We both noticed that off to our left, about 50 feet away, was a stationary, extremely bright, orange,  seemingly burning orb.  At that close proximity, it seemed to be about 3 feet across. It was very unnerving. Niether of us talked much of it for the duration of the ride home.  I think we were struggling to rationalize it. The oddest thing that sticks in my head today: Is that it was DEFINATELY dripping something. (I haven&apos;t found anyone online that has seen one &quot;dripping&quot;. (?) It was a thicker consistency than water it seemed.  It&apos;s hard for me to guesstimate how high off the ground it was, as the hwy/road we were driving on is elevated from the valley floor below.  But from the perpective of the level of the road, It could not have been more than 30 feet.  So Maybe it was 100&apos; of the ground?  Final note:  Oddly enough, when I was trying to research this phenominon at the local liabrary - I found a small book entitled &quot;Orange Light Theory&quot;!  The information was focused on the history of similar activity in that area dating back into the native american history.  It also noted that one of the more recent and documented cases were from volunteers that were at &quot;fire look out&quot; builings located on each end of the valley.  They both continuously kept tabs with each other via radio, on whether it was something for them to dispatch firefighters.  Or whether it was one of the stationary orange lights they were getting used to seeing.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I live in the cascades area of Renton and this plane, oddly was hovering over the Fairwood area of Renton for about twenty minutes.  I realized this was way too big and too low to be a plane, or helicopter.  It looked how a streetlight would but about 5,000 times bigger.  Streetlights aren&apos;t that high.  Planes aren&apos;t this low.  Helicopters hover, it was too big to be a helicopter.  So, I watched it for twenty minutes.  My jaw was open, mezmerized.  Realized I had no clue what was gong on.  I put the covers over my head.  I was really scared all of a sudden.  I called my husband.  The phone conversation lasted five minutes.

I was looking at the night shy though my night vision goggles and noticed lots more stars, planets, satallites, and other things. I was looking at a planet / star group and noticed a light appear from it and it was flying at a decent speed. The light did numorous figure-eight patterns while in flight. It also made a sharp u-turn twice. While I was looking at the object with my NVG&apos;s I decided to flash the infrared sensor at it.

It came from outside my bedroom window which overlooks the driveway; the window was open.  It lasted for just a couple of seconds once I awoke and seemed to fade out but at the same time a long drawn out buzzing started.  It was more similar to a musical note than a mechanical buzzing - the buzzing tone you hear from a tuning fork as it rings in your ears.  It was moving around outside and I thought perhaps a street sweeper was out there but there were no other noises, just the buzzing hum.  No engines, no radio, nothing else.  My dog was under the covers shivering which is very unlike her.  She is a terrier and usually has no fear; just growls or barks at all night noises.  I got up to look out the window but saw nothing on the ground or in the sky.  I still heard the odd humming noise that was moving around in the distance.  It would fade out and become louder.  It stopped for a couple of minutes and then started again and finally quit altogether. When I told my parents about it the next morning, my mother (a no-nonsense midwesterner) said she had seen some odd lights that night.  It was about midnight and she couldn&apos;t sleep so she went into the darkened living room.  She looked out the window which faces north and saw some lights in the far distance in the Northeast that were just over the horizon.  She went to get a glass of water and came back and they had not moved.  As she watched the lights, they moved a slight bit to the east and then back.  They moved very slowly and she thought she saw red &amp; green lights like the landing gear of a plane but when she got the binoculars, she noticed more colors of lights.

I would estimate that the lights were about 20 to 30 yards apart from one another.  The sequence occurred about five times for a period of about 10 seconds.  It was a moonless night with the only nearby town far in the distance.  The lights appeared to be less than two miles away and fairly near to the hilly horizon.  On this night the lights were brighter than Mars and about the same color of yellow.  We waited approximately 30 minutes and another event of the same phenomenon occurred in a distant location.

She thought it was odd that the object was departing at such a strange degree, keeping in mind that her first thoughts were of an aircraft.

At this point the lady pulled over to watch it. She said there was only one light on the craft which she described as being very lustrous as if one would look at a diamond. Also extremely bright ! As she and many others watched, the object moved side to side keeping at the same altitude and then it started to flash. The lady said if she had to put a shape to the object, it would have looked like a diamond. She rolled down her window as she watched. She wanted to hear if there was any sound coming from it. The lady also had turned her vehicle off, but no sound could be heard. The witness went on to say, there was not a sound in the area at all.

She was travelling alone and became quite frightened so decided to continue on her way. She left the area. The witness did contact the RCMP to see if others had made a report about the sighting but no one had come forwarded. I have already contacted the Airdrie Echo newspaper in search of any information they might have received.

There was one witness to this event which took place on September 3, 2003 at approx: 11:10 p.m. A lady had been outside and was making her way back into their home when she happened to glance up and saw a huge cylinder shaped craft flying very quickly, she claims it was really low. This witness told me that even with it being dark out, you couldn&apos;t miss seeing it. It was larger than any aircraft that she knew of, looking at it length wise. She said there were a large number of bright white lights on it. Her thoughts were maybe these were windows and they were running down the full length of the object. There were no wings noticed on the craft and when I asked more questions, she said it actually reminded her of a long tube. No sound was heard and the sighting lasted for approx: 5 seconds. At the time of the sighting her boyfriend was inside their home and he reported to his girlfriend that their cat went nuts when the object passed by. Of course he had not known about the craft until his girlfriend told him, and he mentioned about the cat at that time. Thank you to the witness for the report.

At 9:30 pm my brother (39) and I (33) and our two children were in the back yard looking for Mars as it is reported to be at it&apos;s closest to earth. We saw what appeared to be a star traveling from south to north. There were no flashing lights that would indicate that it was an aircraft. As it flew across the sky slowly and parallel to some stars we noticed that it then moved in a &quot;snake like&quot; manner, swinging left and right. I asked my brother if he had a camcorder to see if he could zoom in on it. He ran inside, I kept my eye on the object as it travelled north. He came out with his binoculars and we both took turns looking at the object. We did not see any flashing lights when viewed through the binoculars. This object looked like a star. The object, at arms length, was about two open hand widths to the right of the big dipper. Note: I have seen this same object about two weeks ago during the great black out across the eastern sea border. If anyone else has seen this, please let me know.((NUFORC Note:  We believe that a satellite in polar orbit would be the first possibility to be ruled out.  Satellites often are reported to exhibit deviations from their orbital path, but the cause is movement of the observer&apos;s eye, and perhaps other perceptual causes.  This is a guess on our part.

We were at Saltspring Island looking out over the water towards the sunrise. The sun hadn&apos;t risend yet but it was pretty light out. I noticed and light in the sky by some trees. It was definetley not moving like a plane or anything that i&apos;ve ever seen. It wasn&apos;t moving in a straight line like planes or helicopters do, it was wavering and bumbling along slightly and flying quite fast. I turned to me friend and asked her if that could be a plane and she said that it was moving way to fast to be a plane. I was just about to take a picture when it dissapeared behind some tree tops. Saltsping isn&apos;t a very populated island and I doubt that any planes or aircrafts would be flying about at that time.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

There is one flashing light in the back end, another white light in the top center wavering or moving in a circular motion on the crown.  There is an orange- redish color to it and also some blue in the light.  It had an upward tilt in the front of the craft.  It seemed to change shape as it went back and forth, or had an elongaded disk shape to it.((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the object might have been a blimp.

You suggest it was a blimp.  I&apos;m telling you it was not.  I was close enough and I watched it for well over an hour.

The octagons were like a black frame work. For a few seconds it hovers then moves away to the NW.  In the center was a trangular shape made of small black dots or blobs. As it hovered I could see the larger grid pattern hovering above the smaller square. The larger grid was more visable at this time.

This object also was chevron or boomberang shaped and was seen directly overhead.  A stealth bomber is more triangular shaped when viewed from above or below.  This object made no noise.  A stealth bomber still makes a little noise at minimal throttle and when the air is cold, sound travels further.  It was cold that evening.  We were very lucky we even spotted it.

We do not know if it was UFO related. Our family had gone to bed for the night, when my daughter entered my bedroom and expressed concerned over an outside &quot;light&quot; that was visible through the mini-blinds covering her bedroom window. I entered her room and without opening the blinds, could see what would best be described as a strobe-like light. The angle of my view would not allow me to see the actual source of the light. We could only see the strobe effect within the beam. The beam diffusion was such that the light source must have been coming from above the window. We watched it together for about a minute. Then we decided to go outside to find out what it may be. The time lapse to go from the bedroom to outside was no more than a minute. Once outside, we found nothing. No light source, nothing. We live in a rural area and our residence is situated higher than the road we live on so I can probably rule out any car source. There are no street lights in our area.

She did get to see them, saying that there were four lights configured so that they appeared to be the headlights of a car.A similar sighting was reported to NUFORC on August 31, also in Myrtle Beach. The NUFORC note suggested they could be landing lights. As a resident of Myrtle Beach, I can state that these lights were the wrong color and were stationary, whereas aircraft landing lights are a brilliant white and slowly move toward the airport.Our sighting was several days after that other one, and yet the similarity is striking.

I stopped and observed this object for a minute ot two, when it began a kind of undulating movement, its color becoming a more intense orange shade, and suddenly it disappeared,leaving two faint trails of smoke: one blue, one pink, forming two halves of a circle.  I realize that this sounds absurd, even to me at this time; especially the movement, which I likened to the movement of an inchworm.  But I know that I saw it.  I told my mother that evening, and she said that it was probably Eglin AFB doing some sort of testing.

He added that before the object changed from a ball of light into a strange craft, he noted that it started glistening and shinning brightly and then this is when it started taking on some kind of form of an unusual object. He reported no sound being heard, mind you he was in his vehicle at the time. I also asked if he might be able to determine the size of it, he said when it was in the distance it could have been approx: the size of his small fingers, fingernail. But when it headed in his direction and got very close,  in his words, &quot;it was huge.&quot;  The object did come to a complete stop as the man passed close by. It sat stationary as he drove some 2 kilometers doing around 20 kilometers an hour. Finally other drivers started honking their horns to get his attention to have him speed up.

It seemed strange though because it appeared to be veering off a straight line that a sattelite would travel. After watching for a minute I noticed more lights in a grouping and another grouping set apart from it. I thought that they might be spots in my eyes but I noticed that they would disappear behind some high thin strps of clouds. My next thought was that I was viewing commercial aircraft. I stepped under the soffit of my house and used the gutter as a staionary reference point and noticed that the lights moved in random directions and circular patterns. At one point two lights approached a couple of others and ended up reversing directions before they got too close together.I watched one light fly across the visible moon and was able to see it constantly as it passed.After watching for ten or more minutes I saw my neighbor come out of his house and asked him to look.

I was hunting with a group of friends outside of Beatty, Oregon, but what I saw did not happen over the city of Beatty.  It was a around 12:00 and two of my friends and myself were hunting in the Gearhart Mountains in Eastern Oregon.  It was late and we took my Ford Pickup out to spotlight (young kids). I had a rather bright light mounted atop my truck and we came to a clearing at the edge of the road that overlooked the basin below.  This is a remote area and there were no homes, lights, anything out there but desert at that time.  As we approached the overlook I noticed a bright light in the sky and it was traveling laterally.  We became rather nervous because this light resembled an airplane and we did not want to get in trouble for illegally hunting deer at night so I killed the headlights and turned the truck motor off.  We all got out of the truck and watched this light and as we watched the light very quickly turned a 90 degree right toward us then it stopped.  The light became very bright and we watched it for around 8 minus, could have been less.  No airplane does a perfect 90 degree turn on the fly and stops on the dime in mid air.  Finally, the object just took off very fast and disappeared.  It was gone.  It just flew or whatever directly away from us and we watched and it was gone.  We thought it best to leave so the three of us quickly got back into the truck and headed back to camp.  Here is the weird part.  The light was pacing us in a parallel fashion as we were driving the mountain roads.  We literally watched out the right side window and this damn light was flying seemed to be following us.  Never did the light come close enough for us so that we could get a good visual on this thing.  But at the point when we first spotted the light it did seem to be flying at a very high altitude.

We were fishing at the foot of the three mile bridge when my brother and his wife began arguing.  I was tired of hearing it, so I went and sat down on the seawall and cast my line.  I started staring at the sky and became fixed on what I thought was the north star... after they finished their fight, my brother came over to chew my ear off in his venting process.  Because the light was so bright, he also became fixed on it as we sat there talking... then, all of the sudden, at light speed it zipped up and away leaving that streak of light behind it.  I was still disbelieving what I saw when my brother asked &apos;did you see THAT?&apos;  I let him tell me, just to be sure that he had really seen it too.

I had traveled with a friend to Georgia to pick up her children.  Her ex-husband decided to come back with us, so we ended up with two vehicles. My friend and her ex were in the car ahead and I had the children with me.  I remember quite a cars on the highway with us.  I can&apos;t remember how, when, or why, but the next thing I remember is standing outside the car looking into the sky.  Everyone was standing outside their cars looking up.  There was a huge ship in the sky with lights on the underside. It would pulse red then bright white.  Four smaller ships emerged out of the larger.  The four smaller ships put on a performance I&apos;ll never forget.  They would fly at ubelivable speeds towards each other and just when you knew they were going to crash they would veer off into different directions, or just stop as they came together seemly as one and hoover then shoot off in different directions.  It is hard to describe in words the flying feats they performed.  It was as if they were performing for us.  I&apos;m not sure how long this went on but the next thing I remember is the larger ship hoovering just above the trees and people from the highway entering. The next memory is driving home (Orange, Texas) and one of the smaller ships following all the way.  From that time forward I have experienced many encounters, usually a small ship, sometimes white light, but usually red.

I was looking to the sky, it was mostly clear, some sparse clouds. I noticed this &quot;star&quot; that was quite bright I was looking at it for a moment and at that moment I had the impression it moved but since the Bus moved (it was a double decker bus I was sitting on the top floor by the window), I thought that was the bus moving, so I took my eyes of for a while. The bus then stops once again and I was getting quite irritated because I was going to Victoria Station to pick up my mother who were coming from the airport via train and I was a bit late. I wanted to be there before 21:30, so in my irritation I looked up (my eyes were turned to the window of the bus) while the bus was stopped and I actually see the start moving in a random fashion and it moves towards this cloud. As I look at it a bit amazed my outmost amazement only came when I notice this cigar shaped object near a cloud. At first I didn&apos;t want to believe what I was seeing, so I thought it was maybe a zeppelin, but then the shape was too slim to be one. The bus moved a few feet but I could still see it.The bus stooped again for a while and still in disbelief I look at it and I notice this strange myst around it, with some sort of faint glow and furthermore I could see the craft slowly disappearing in front of my eyes. I wanted to tell people in the bus &quot;Look!!!!&quot;, but then to tell them to look at what??? A UFO??? People would have took me for a kook. Its shape cylindrical and quite dark. I could see a slight seam running through the middle of it. It had two blinking lights, one red and one blue at each end. In my judgement it was a fairly big craft for the height of the clouds, maybe 30m-50m (I am European living in London). It is my second sighting of strange craft in the sky. My first one was not so amazing, it was a lopsided triangular dark craft with four static lights(red in the middle, blue, yellow, white) when I was young (about twelve). I havn&apos;t paid anymore attention to the subject since then. Now if the these craft don&apos;t belong to any government in this planet to whom do they belong?  I have reported this before but I never seen it anywhere not even on the site I have reported it too.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It is always located at 51 degrees north of my house, and does not move except for the rotation of the Earth.  I also took a look at my &quot;ufo&quot; through a telescope using a 5mm objective lense, and I concluded that the object is most definately a twinkling star.

A friend and myself were about to smoke a bowl of marijuana (no, we had not yet lit up..., that&apos;s why we were there, it was easy to view police coming.) when the whole sky, and the interior of our car lit up bright turqoise blue. Probably closer to the color of plasma that anything else I&apos;ve seen. I was in the passenger seat facing west, and somehow, I knew to thrust my head forward into the windsheild area an look straight up. Not an easy task in a volkswagon bug. There about 300 feet up was an unmarked bright blue sphere hovering motionless. I know it was 300 feet because it was in the cloud cover which was rather dense but still had enough patches to see the moon. (Almost full or full) From my perspective, it appeared to vanish. From my friends perspective, he saw it take off from the south...which was sometype of aerospace facility, now abandoned but still in place, 2003. Six other persons came racing down to the base of the cul-de-sac and exclaimed &quot;Did you see that thing fly by the moon?&quot; They said it had done so in about a half second. Pretty fast. We all sat around in shock for a while and then dispersed. We did not exchange names, I guess it&apos;s not the first thing that come to mind in such an &apos;alien&apos; situation. To be clear, I don&apos;t know what it was. It just wasn&apos;t of this world. Perhaps a UFO, angel, advanced being. It could have been anything. Although I did get flashbacks of having been onboard a craft of some type for several years after the event. The disappointing thing was that the next day, even though people in a sixty mile diameter had seen the sky over San Diego light up, the news claimed &quot; The strange light in the sky last night was a power station explosion.&quot; I&apos;ve never trusted the media since that night, and suggest you don&apos;t either.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "Series of rectangular burnt orange lights observed at approx 10 PM over Elkton, Va. and were observable from at least 40 miles away.I was returning home from my son&apos;s cub scout meeting in Reston, Virginia.  I departed the meeting at 8 PM and arrived in the Luray/Stanley area around 09:50 PM.  There was a full moon that might and it was cloudy.  I live in Stanley, Va and have to drive through Luray on Route 340 to get to my residence.  After I passed through Luray, I then have about 9 miles to drive to my home which equates to around ten minutes.  When I passed through Luray, the speed limit is posted to increase to 55 miles per hour.  I first noticed the strange lights as I was accelerating, and I thought to myself, &quot;that is strange, it must be a new residence on top one of the moutains in the area because I never noticed it before.&quot;   So I drove on and I intermittently kept glancing at these lights as they were very bright and large to be a residence.  These light kept getting my attention as I was nearing my home.  I have to turn left at the Hawksbill restaurant on Route 340 in order to get to my home. When I got to within 1.5 miles of my home, I suddenly realized that these lights were too high in the sky to be a residence on a mountaintop.  I slowed my car down to get a real good look at it.  My occupation requires me to pay attention to minute detail so my following decription of this object will be very accurate. This object was in the sky at a height of about 4,500 to 7,000 feet. (this is much higher than the surrounding mountains)  The appearance was rather strange in that I could not visually detect any outline. (no top, sides or bottom) What I did see was a series of rectangular shaped lights, emanating a burnt orange color.  The lights were not moving or spinning, just completely stationary.  The arrangement of these lights is what gave the indication of some type of craft.  The rectaglular shapes were of a very crisp appearance, in other words, the corners were very sharp.  Taking into consideration of their estimated altitude and how big they were, equates to this object being very large.  I am estimati! ng that the opject had to be at least two to three football fields in size. (600 to 900 yards)  The rectangular lights were all uniform in that the top was wider than the bottom, and the sides were the longest length.  This gave the appearance that the lights were either tapering at angle on the craft or thery were flat and were actually trapezoidal.  There were about 7 or 9 lights and the ones in the middle were much larger that the ones on each end.  This then equates to the lights giving the appearamce of being on the surface of craft and due to the sequential difference in the size of lights in the middle to the lights on each end, the craft then had the appearance of being triangular.  When I realized that I was now a witness to something highly unusual I raced home to get my camcorder, but when I came back out to take some video it was gone.  I have since did some backgound investigation on my own.  I checked the locals around the area and a few people did say that there was someting seen that night and it was directly over Elkton, Virginia.  Elkton is about 30 miles from Stanley and the direction of object I observed in relation to where Elkton is, matches up.  I then checked three local newspapers both in reading and phone calls and there was nothing reported.  I called the Elkton local police and the Elkton Sheriffs office and nothing was reported.  I wish to get anyone else whom was a witness to this event on the 10th of Sep at 10 PM over Elkton, Va that could be seen from a circular observable area estimated to have an approximate diameter of 50 miles. (This estimation of the viewing area results from my initial sighting occurring just south of Luray, Virginia.)", "High SPeed Cigar Shaped Object - Sky Turning  Brighter Than Noon for 1000 Miles For Over 20 SecsI still have the news footage talking about this night... was mentioned right after the discussion of the loss of the Mars Lander crashing into the surfice.  At 5:13 that moonless night was walking out to get the mail... was facing the S/W sky.  I saw the sky was lighting up on the holizon... was as bright as if an atomic bomb had hit Atlanta 400 miles away... the light came towards me, and looking up saw that that were 2 clouds over my head and they were so fully charged with electrical energy you could see plasma like activity on the clouds.  The light in the sky continued to get brighter and wider till the whole sky was illuminated.  As the intensity increased i was able to look around and saw street lights turning off, and could view objects far away as if were high noon.  The light was not coming from any one location... rather the whole sky was as if suspended in cloud to cloud lightening.  The intensity after 15 secs was so bright -- that it was actually brighter than high noon on a sunny day.  The light was odd... made everything appear the wrong color.  Some pine trees near me appeared blue.... a blue shit was wearing had a green tint.. was like a the lighting a &quot;black lite&quot; gives... all had that odd tint to it.  Well 15 secs after the lighting had built to a peek saw moving across the sky at a VERY high rate of speed a cigar shape object...  the object appeared like something out of a 1950s B grade movie.  It had a metalic look to it... like a needle on the end.  It looked cheaply made .. but the speed was one of the fastest objects ever seen cross the sky and am aware this could have distorted my perception of the shape.  From the back appeared to be sparks like a fake spaceship would release in a B grade movie.  I lost site as the objected entered clouds behind me.  The sky remained illuminated for another say 10 secs. You could see the light receeding behind the object and vanishing back into the edge of the N.E. sky line.  About 5 mins later 3 fighter craft passed over and ! was obvious they were following the object and they vanished in the same area of the sky as this object had vanished towards slighly before. The offical news report said the object was seen from Montgomery Al. to past Asheville N.C. by 1000&apos;s.  The offical news release went on to say that while hundreds of calls were made to police and sherrif&apos;s depts across the flight path, that it was believed to be a meterior. While i saw no signs of any course correction... and as fast as the object was moving realize i cannot swear to the appearance... what has struck me odd all this time was a few things:  1.  The amount of EM energy that it would take to produce this much lighting.2.  The lighting in the sky came BEFORE the object by at least 10 - 15 secs at the peek.3.  Watching the clouds... the plasma moving on the edges was so odd. 4.  The craft was actually the least amazing part of the siting. 5.  Aircraft do not chase meteriors. I wish i had been able to take EM / mag readings during the passover or gotten some video footage of the event.  If you are curious have the WLOS TV news coverage with some police officers talking about it on this night and how freaky it was. I asked and never got a reasonable explanation to why the lighting came so long before the ~whatever it was~ and just how much energy it would take to excite what i assume is the ionasphere during this siting to be so bright for such a duration over so wide an area as this was seen.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Peter Davenport requested that I re-send my report and have it posted on the 8/16/03 &quot;Three Dark Objects&quot; entry from Houston, Texas. Here is my report:  While enjoying a sunny afternoon in our backyard swimming pool in southeast Houston near Pasadena, others and I witnessed up to three unidentified, dark objects for a sustained amount of time. Our experience started in late afternoon (between 4:00 &amp; 5:00) when our neighbor&apos;s 10-year old daughter looked up in a mostly sunny and clear sky to see a dark, round-looking object. My 9-year old son, wife and I also saw the object. It was too far away to determine what it what. At first, I thought it to be a small cluster of balloons set adrift. But I noticed that it was stationary, which would seem unusual for free floating balloons at this altitude. Even after viewing the object with low-powered binoculars, I was unable to determine what it was. With my binoculars, though, I was able to notice that it was not completely round and had a irregular shape to it. Though the object was not moving, it swayed occasionally from side to side to show that portions of its body had a lighter color on it. During our sighting, a small-engined airplane flying at a low altitude of 200-300 feet went across our viewing area of the object. The mysterious object looked like it was far higher than the plane. After viewing the object being stationary for about ten minutes, it slowly moved across the sky, still unable to determine what it was. Once again, it stopped. Several minutes later, my neighbor&apos;s daughter pointed out two other dark objects stationed further away from us. They seemed to show the same characteristics of the first object. The latter two objects appeared to be miles apart from each other and eventually made slow movement toward us and the first object. Into 30 minutes of this usually sighting, the first object once again moved slowly across the sky and stopped. The three objects never got close to each other. In time, my attention returned to our backyard activities. 45 minutes after seeing the first object I looked up to the skies and could no longer locate the objects. My wife also has no explanation to what she saw that afternoon with us.", "While traveling home on a major highway in Boca Raton, FL, I saw a spaceship in the sky with a light coming out from the bottom.The spaceship was about twice the size of an airplane and was traveling at a height below the clouds.

I was walking my dog at approximately 10:30 PM (22:30 hours)in my back yard at my current residence - It was dark and had been for some time,I cannot be absolutely sure of the EXACT time of this sighting-but I do know that it was somewhat late in the mid to latter part of the evening,and a clear - or rarely sparsely cloudy night - as the stars were well visible.The exact meteorological conditions could-I suppose-be varified through the Nation Weather Service database.. As I was doing a bit of stargazing - to the northwest of my position at what I would guess would be a somewhat low altitude-I observed a phenomenon that appeared to be a large,bright green meteor like apparition - in scale,about the size of a qaurter at arms length from my perspective at line of sight.The object suddenly appeared,intensified,and then faded or &quot;blinked out&quot; within a time span that was a little less than a full second (0.7 to 0.9 seconds). The object had an appearance exactly similiar in nature to a bright green roman candle fireball falling to Earth,or a bright green rescue flare.The color was similiar to a slightly lighter shade of green than a green traffic signal,and remained mostly that color throughout the sighting.It was travelling at a speed that could be associated with the speed of a pyrotechnic effect like a flare or firework falling to earth. As the object traversed lower,it began to spit out orange sparks on it&apos;s contrailing end before completely fading out.It was traveling at an approximate trajectory inclination of 120 degrees travelling towards the ground(?) with the true horizon line representing 180 degrees as a reference. I deduced that it was NOT a firework or flare because it&apos;s origin was skyward and it was NOT fired initially from a ground source - also - there was absolutely NO sound associated with the object that might be similiar to the &quot;fizzle&quot;sound emitted by a flare-or any explosions or sounds one associates with fireworks. Admittedly-the object COULD have been a rather large meteor,but it&apos;s speed seemed too slow for me to say conclusively that it was for sure.THAT-and had it BEEN a meteor,then it would&apos;ve had to have been very large-as I have rarely seen meteors or shooting stars that approached that type of near object intensity. My impression after a bit was that a close orbit satellite had perhaps encountered problems and re-entered the atmosphere(which IS a valid possibility).I have worked in a metal shop-and am aware than certain alloys with specific chemical compositions CAN produce a green flame under high heat conditions from an arc welder similiar to the color I observed. The object startled me a little-as it seemed close in proximity to Trenton.If it had been a solid object falling to Earth-then I would roughly guess that it would have fallen to the ground within a radius of around fourty(40)or less - to sixty(60)miles from my position,although that could be an observation based upon natural conditions that could have produced the illusion of local closeness - had this indeed been a meteor. The light intensity from the object was appreciable-but it did not seem close enough to the ground to illuminate any type of ground structures or clutter.", "dim light making circle movement in sky above cloud this was viewed by myself and my wife and neighbours.", "((NUFORC Note:  A launch of a Titan 4 rocket from Cape Canaveral  was conducted at 00:29 hrs. on this date.

I took a second glance and noticed that it looked like nothing I have ever seen before in my life.  That&rsquo;s when I got concerned and started to pay close attention to it&rsquo;s details. It started off as a huge ball of light (almost blinding bright) with a rectangular shaped trial tapering off of it which fluctuated in length. It looked as if it had just taken off from somewhere to the west and was headed towards my direction and grew in size. Then this ball of light morphed into three separate lights forming the shape of a triangle which continued to flicker. All three of these lights had distinct coloration&rsquo;s to them the main most radiant light at the front/top of the triangle was a pale yellow color, the light on the left was a pale red color, and the light to the right  was a greenish blue color.  The shape of the lights were in the form of an acute triangle and just floated with such grace. I turned off my radio and it made no sound. As these three lights got closer they stopped flickering and a from appeared around the lights. The shape was of a triangle craft with the top peak cut off almost in half. The body was a gray color with a gray blue paneling around it. By this time it was hovering over the tree line and was the size of one and a half football fields.  Then as soon as I got a good look at it the ship gradually disappeared, starting a the rear two dimmer lights which faded away like streaks in the sky as if it was traveling at great speeds. The main light gradually diminished in size and raised in the sky as if it took off towards the south east until it fully disappeared. Every thing about this unidentified object was so geometric and precise in it&rsquo;s shape that it was breath taking. This sighting lasted for about three to five minutes and other motorists on the roads had pulled off to watch this s! trange appearance. Once I got home I called a friend of mine who lives in the Tampa area and told him about the sighting and he confirmed that some in his dorm told him five minutes before exactly what I had explained to him. So I defiantly know I was not the only person aware of this sighting in that area along with the other motorists on the road with me.Let me assure you that I had always felt neutral on the subject of UFOs until what I experienced tonight.

It was a very clear, hot day with no humidity or haze and only a few small, scattered clouds were visible. In the distance, I saw a helicopter and a small plane cross my field of vision (one heading north and one heading south); then I noticed two more &quot;objects&quot; in the same vacinity  that seemed too close to the others. As they continued heading in a westerly direction, I thought it was very odd that they were flying so close together, so I locked my gaze onto them. As they approached (flying directly toward me), I could see that they were not conventional aircraft; they were perfectly round, silver spheres and were highly reflective. From my perspective, they did not seem to be flying at a very high altitude, perhaps only a mile or so high and were moving relatively slow (no faster than a helicopter). As they passed directly overhead, my view of them was very clear. This is a heavily populated area; there were hundreds of people on the street shopping that day and not one other person was looking up, so I was left to assume that these craft were silent.

We watched till they traversed across the whole sky to the northern horizon. A note on my experience, I am ex USAF.  I have been in the aircraft industry for over 20 years professionally and still employed in the aircraft industry.  Am very familiar with all aircraft and flight dynamics.  I have studied flight since I was about 10 years old.  I know how aircraft act along with rotor craft.  This formation was way too high for that and NO sound was noted.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "A large white round object moving slowly across the sky and helicopters flying near the vicinity.My 8 yr. old son and I were working on my car at about 1:15 p.m. in the afternoon, when I heard two military helicopters flying overhead and they were making so much noise I kept looking at them. When they soon left I saw a round light moving slowly but not following the copters. It look like the sun but smaller, maybe the size of an airplane and I couldn&apos;t tell the distance it was.  It was a hazy color so anyone could look directly at it. I couldn&apos;t make out what it was. It wasn&apos;t a plane or not even a weather balloon. But I have a feeling the military was there keeping an eye on it.

I was on my balcony, facing south, looking up at the clouds, watching the searchlights.  I could see what I believe is Mars just above the tops of the clouds.  I noticed a pair of red lights (they could have been just about any color, I am color-blind) moving quickly across the underside of the clouds in a west-to-east direction, towards Sandia Mountain.  I first thought that it was someone with a powerful laser pointer having some fun - the lights moved in a jerky manner, as a light directed from the ground might, but I have tried to shine a laser pointer on the underside of a cloud at night before, and I realize that they are not powerful enough to do this at such a distance.  In any case, I was startled when the lights came to the edge of the cloud formation and did not disappear, as they would have if they were merely lights being shone on the bottom of the cloud by people below on the ground.  The lights instead continued on and quickly vanished over the top of Sandia Mountain.  I waited to see if the lights would return, but they did not.  I turned around and noticed my kitchen clock - it was nearly midnight, so I would put the time of my observation at around 11:55 P.M. Mountain Time.  It was only after the lights vanished that I realized that they had moved without making a sound.  With the low-hanging clouds tonight, if it had been military or civilian jets, they should have made a noise I could hear.  Also, I believe that jets have blinking lights - these were on steady and bright.  Also, jets tend to move in a straight line - these lights jerked back and forth, not a lot, but far more than a jet could do.  I have never made any kind of a report before, and this may mean nothing, but it was interesting.", "Silent,red and green arc shaped object going over trees from left to right,twice.Small round light in centerOn Sunday morning 8/31/03, I just got into my car and was about to start it up when through the corner of my eye I was distracted by a very colorful arc shaped, red and greenish blue light.I was facing South, the arc was to my right, (west).  It must have been a few streets over.It happened so quick but I remember this:  It looked as if it came up from the ground, on the left side of the trees, and went down to the right side.  Like up,over and down. I thought wow, what was that?  As I was thinking that exact thought, It happened again, in the same spot it started out.I do remember a small round blinking light, but I&apos;m not sure if it was in the center.  At first I thought of a helicopter, but it definately was not.It happened in a matter of seconds.

It hovered for quite some time making quick erattic movements from time to time (up, down, left,right - which ruled out it being a star, plane or helicopter) but overal stayed in the same location. Could not see visible shape, determine altitude or location over which it hovered - could have been Puyallup area.

My suspicion is that you may have been observing the very bright and colorful &quot;twinkling&quot; star in the western sky.  I have been admiring it, of late, too. The apparent movement of the object is a result, principally, of movement of the eye, not the star.  This type of movement is reported to us frequently. Please check that same are of the sky on the next clear night, and let us know whether you see the object, or not. Thank you very much for sharing the information with our Center! Dear Mr Davenport, ((RESPONSE))Thank you for getting back to me. The more I think about it the more I am getting convinced it must have been a star (though I&apos;ve never seen any star like it). It just didn&apos;t make sense to me why I would be able to see it for hours while most reports lasts a few minutes at most. If it hadn&apos;t looked like it was moving I probaply would have just thought of it as a really bright star - and your explanation on why it seemed to move makes sense. After reading up on some of the other reports on  the board, someone mentioned the sirius star which I think would&apos;ve been in that general area at that time.  I will try to look again - with a star map in hand this time! (it&apos;s been cloudy last couple of days as you probaply know :) ) and if I find out it was indeed just a star I will let you know so you can remove the report. Thanks for your time!

As our plane leveled off I looked outside of my window and saw what I believed at first to be a bright star, possibly Mars as it would flicker between white and red. About two minutes passed and I looked outside the window again and saw the same star at the same distance as i had seen it prior.  I put my glasses on to see if instead of a star it could be another plane also flying in the same direction as it seemed to be keeping the same pace with our plane. At that time the pilot had put on the seat belt light.  I didn&apos;t know why as there was no turbulence at this time.  i couldn&apos;t quite make out whether it was another plane or a star.  it wasn&apos;t above or below but ahead and to the left of the plane and eye level.  a few more minutes passed and suddenly the object seemed to make a sharp right as though it was about to fly in front of our plane.  At first i thought that maybe the plane had veered left that would account for this shape to seem as though it was going to the right, but i had been on airplanes numerous times to know how it feels when a plane veers left or right.

It had a sort of throbbing sonic sound to it. At first I thoght it was a ambulance or fire truck at first and I thought I wonder what is going on ,so I got up to see what was going on. When I first looked at it I was thinking what in the blakety blank is that! I remember saying again what in the heck is that! Then it hit me that it was a UFO! It was oblong like a cigar and ahad a soft glowing light at one end of it and a very bright pulsating light at the other end of it. You could acually here it like a pulsating throb.as I was watching it it started to turn real slow in a circular motion, I turned around real fast to wake up my husband and I told him hurry up and get up there is a UFO out here! He started to jump up and I was turning around to look back out the window and it was gone! There is noway that something that big got away that fast! My husband and I went outside to see if we could see anything. We were out there about ten minutes seeing nothing . We came back in the house and went back to bed.

They continued to do that back and forth for about two or three hoursor more because I fell asleep finally about one ,two o`clock in the morning.

What can cause so many residents in various communities from Kamloops through to the Okanagan and the Kootenays in British Columbia left scratching their heads, wondering what it was they all witnessed. Also many people became very frightened and ran into their homes. The answers to the questions I have been asked have been hard to come by, but we certainly know something extraordinary did take place on July 28, 2003 in the early morning hours. The story begins with a family who was camping at St. Marys Lake, which is located approximately 12 miles east of Kimberley, British Columbia, Canada. Around 12:45 a.m. the husband and wife decided to do some star gazing as the children were asleep and the night was warm and the sky clear and full of stars. As the couple stood looking into the night sky they observed a very bright, white light heading in a southeasterly direction. The moon sized light was witnessed flying low over top Bootleg Mountain and across the lake and at times it&apos;s speed did vary. As it slowed, then picking up speed once again the witnesses watched the light zig zag slightly and at times it seemed to wobble until it was out of sight. When they arrived back home from their camping trip they contacted the Kimberley RCMP detachment and spoke to a Cpl. Rod Carbonneau to enquire if others had reported seeing the object. Cpl. Rod Carbonneau said the detachment received no calls over this matter. The Cranbrook Airport was also contacted and asked if there were any aircraft in the area of the sighting .... but none were reported in the vicinity the object was observed. For the couple who watched this amazing sight on July 28, 2003 not many answers were fourth coming. A couple of area residents did telephone the folks who watched the event telling them what they also saw that night, and another did make a report to the local newspaper. From A Few Witnesses To a Flood Of Calls:  A report was made to Peter Davenport at the NUFORC in Seattle, Washington and then the sighting report was forwarded on to me here at HBCC UFO Research (Houston, British Columbia) for a follow-up investigation. What I did not realize at this time was just how large this one case was going to be. From a handful of witnesses the case exploded  into a major event  where I currently have 157 eye witnesses to something very mysterious. Two things happened in the early morning hours that Sunday, a large moon sized object was seen by many area residents, and what followed left many folks in communities such as Kamloops, Vernon, Kelowna, Kimberley, Cranbrook and as far as Jaffray, British Columbia scratching their heads wondering what it was they saw. A beam, or ray of white light was observed from Kamloops as far southeast as Jaffray, British Columbia. People who watched the strange and puzzling event said the white light looked as bright as a florescent tube and was arced from horizon to horizon as if one was viewing a rainbow. The beam of light sat almost stationary in this position for approximately an hour before dissipating. Almost everyone  who witnessed the beam of white light said they had never seen anything like this before. All said they have watched the northern lights many times, but they commented this was certainly not the northern lights. A Few Of The Eye Witness Accounts - The Light/Object (July 28, 2003)  A gentleman from Cranbrook, B.C. telephoned me and reported that he and his family were sitting outside and were discussing how bad the forest fires are throughout the southern interior when one of the family members spotted what they thought was a airplane with it&apos;s landing lights on and heading in their direction. As the bright white light drew closer to them, the size was growing rapidly and so was the brightness of the light. Before they knew it, the light/object was upon them. The family was so frightened due to the immense size of the light/object being almost at the edge of their property that the children ran into the house screaming. The mother followed closely behind. The father followed his wife and kids into the home, but stopped to take one last glance at whatever it was, and watched it make a 90 degree turn to the south. When I spoke to the dad he told me that they heard not a sound coming from it. Another report came from a lady who was with a group of people on their holiday at their cabin on one of the local Kimberley, B.C. lakes. She told me they were sitting outside on the deck when one of the guests pointed towards the northwest. Low over one of the mountains came a huge, extremely bright white light traveling slowly in a zig zag pattern heading to the southeast. As it got closer to the resort area, many people became uncomfortable due to how strange the object/light was acting. As it passed straight overhead not a sound was heard. Some of the folks who were there said it was like looking at a full moon on a clear night. It was that big. Two men in a pick-up truck traveling north along the highway just south of Wycliffe spotted the large bright object flying south. As they watched the large light/object close in on their location they pulled the truck over to the side of the highway,  and jumped out of the vehicle to get a better look. Due to it being so low, so bright, and passing directly over top of them the light from the object lit up the highway and surrounding area. Both men stood frozen in their tracks and speechless. Both fellows said it moved quickly in a straight line and made no unusual maneuvers. Again no sound was heard which is remarkable due to how close it was to these men, and all the other witnesses. The above is a small example of what folks saw that night. There are many more reports here of area residents reporting seeing the same thing.  A Few Of The Eye Witness Accounts - Beam Of Light (July 28, 2003)  One lady said what she saw was very strange, it didn&apos;t behave like the northern lights as she noted that the lights danced across the sky, or looked like a curtain of shimmering light. She wondered if the long dry hot weather may have something to do with what she was seeing. But her thoughts changed quickly as she watched the beam of light come from the northwest horizon and impaled itself on one of the local hills and that is where it ended, according to this witness. A party of four witnesses were out for a few days on one of the areas lakes just outside of Kimberley, B.C. Everyone was having a good time talking and having a few spirits. One of the men who was sitting on a camping chair had just poured himself a drink, when he looked up and said to the rest of the people he was with, &quot;do you see what I am seeing&quot;? Everyone replied, &quot;yes&quot;! The man who asked the question was so surprised at what he was looking at, he poured his drink onto the ground and thought he&apos;d had one to many that evening!   They all watched a beam of narrow bright white light run in an arc from horizon to horizon.First they wondered if it might have been a search light as it was so brigh but they soon ruled this out due to the miles and miles the light covered. Again all these witnesses said this event lasted for approximately one hour before it dissipated. Some three weeks after people saw the beam of light on July 28, 2003, I had calls from Kelowna and Kimberley British Columbia reporting that the beam of light was back in the night sky. Two Kelowna residents stood on the patio with phone in hand reporting what it was they were seeing. The exact white beam of light sat stationary running from horizon to horizon and was extremely bright. Four Kimberley residents stood outside watching the beam of light, they reported standing under a street lamp and even with brightness from the street light they could clearly see the beam of light sitting in the dark sky. Conclusions:  There is no doubt that something very unusual took place on Sunday, July 28, 2003 in the wee hours that morning. What folks saw in all these communities seems to be a mystery. But I have tried to come up with some reasonable answers for all the questions everyone had for me. Here is what I know:  157 witnesses watched an amazing event unfold on July 28, 2003  (early morning). Some observed the object and others observed the beam of light. (Exact numbers are broken down for how many saw the object or beam of light below. What I didn&apos;t say is how many saw both). 31 witnesses observed a huge, bright white low flying light/object.126 witnesses observed the reported beam of bright white light. The International Space Station passed over Kimberley, B.C., at 00:24 hrs. on July 27, 2003.A Fire Ball was observed flying in a southeasterly direction over the West Coast of Canada and the U.S.Most of the witnesses reported the light/object and beam of light running from the northwest to the southeast There would have been a lot of air traffic in some of these areas due to the fire fighting efforts to control the devastating forest fires which raged through some of these areas in the summer of 2003. Our hearts go out to the people who were effected. So, the questions that need an be answered are.... What was the strange, large, glowing bright object? Did the object cause the beam of light which sat stationary in the night sky for approximately an hour as the object traveled through the areas?  As for the object, this is certainly a mystery. After a lot of time speaking with witnesses, looking at data on astronomical events, checking on the flight paths, seeing if there were aircraft in these areas flying at the time of the sighting...... I have come up against a brick wall. I have not found any rational explanation for what people saw that night. Fireballs for example as far as I know do not make 90 degree turns to another direction. Also seeing that the object was so low, traveling rather slow in many of the reports and not making a sound. This again is certainly strange. Something else I found rather interesting, was the fact that reported sightings had dropped from my area here in the pacific northwest of British Columbia and reports of unusual crafts of every kind were now being seen and reported  by many people residing in the areas from Kamloops, the Okanagan straight through into the Kootenays. Almost every different shape, color and size have been reported to HBCC UFO Research. Did the over 800 forest fires attract visitors from above? I am sure we will never really know the answer to that question..... ?  The beam of white light ended up still being as baffling as the object. When reports started coming in I was sure what everyone was seeing was nothing more than the northern lights. But as the list of witnesses grew, and hearing their comments, I started wondering if there was a connection to these unknowns and the beam of white light. Out of the 126+ witnesses who observed the ray of light running across the night sky from horizon to horizon, only one report was filed saying they believed it to be nothing more than the northern lights. (which I report on below). Everyone else said they have never witnessed anything like in their lives. All said they have watched the northern lights on many occasions, and in their words &quot;this was not the northern lights&quot;.A radio station host put a question on air to the people in the area, asking &quot;has anyone seen strange lights in the night sky?&quot; I was told reports flooded in over this beam of light, and how everyone was left not knowing what it was they saw. To be fair to all sides, I placed below an email I received from a person who did have some knowledge in astronomy, weather phenomena and the northern lights. One thing I would like to point out, is that what the gentleman viewed was not on the day of this major event. The email came from a gentleman who, on the evening of July 26, 2003 and morning of July 27, 2003, stated that a sailing regatta was held by the Kelowna Yacht Club. Although the event discussed in the report above took place in the early morning hours of July 28, 2003, I thought the  report below was important due to how close all of the events were to one another. Plus I want to give both sides on this case.  Mr. Brian Vike Director HBCC UFO Research  Dear Mr. Vike,  Re: July 27, 2003  On the evening of July 26, 2003 and morning of July 27, a sailing regatta was held by the Kelowna Yacht Club.  It was an overnight race north up Okanagan Lake centered on 50 degrees N. Latitude and 121.5 degrees west.  The race commenced near the yacht club and the course was to be north up Okanagan Lake to Whisky Island and then returning to the Kelowna Yacht Club. The race was attended by perhaps 100 members of the KYC both as participants and safety patrol boats.I was one of the participants in this race in the 25 ft sailboat (name deleted by HBCC UFO Research) along with 2 other crew. The race continued for the entire night of the 26th and almost all of the boats were back into the Kelowna Yacht Club by 10 am of the morning of the 27 of July. The sky conditions for the night was perfectly clear and very calm without interference from the light of the moon or city lights.  After dusk a typical number of earth-orbiting satellites were observed.  Around 11:30 pm the first appearances of typical shifty northern lights were visible to the north and north-west and continued to be visible on and off until early morning light. At the peak of the night&apos;s darkness, a stable and continuous band of light was present overhead from horizon to horizon in the East/West direction. I  estimate the apparent width of the band of light to be about 10 degrees at the azimuth. No indication of colour was observed in this band, nor did I observe any detail or shadowing effects. This band of light was, however, unusual in it&apos;s stability of form and linearity of line. After this long and slow sailing event, some of the participants commented to me on the display of northern lights. Nothing that I observed that evening could be attributed to paranormal activity.   The display of light was interesting but certainly not out of the ordinary compared to many other displays that I have observed in my interest of amateur astronomy. On a side note, one of my duties was a weather observer/recorder in the Canadian arctic while on station on the Distant Early Warning Line in 1967 and 1968 and was privileged to observe many spectacular light shows at that time.  I am convinced that we observed nothing more or less than the Aurora Borealis and a few earth-bound satellites that night and I hope that my observations might shed some light on the matter. Kind regards, (Senders name and boat name deleted by HBCC UFO Research). What folks saw in the early morning hours on July 28, 2003 has left myself and a lot of other people in the UFO field without any solid answers to all of the questions. The one thing I know is that there was an event which took place that left so many residents and myself baffled. It would be nice to be able to supply answers for these mysteries, but all I am left with at this point is another unexplained case!  Also keep in mind that three days later two woman had a missing time experience in Kelowna, British Columbia and the green lights seen on this night were witnessed by others at different locations which backed up their incredible story. Their story can be read at: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/kelowna_missing_time.htm And please .. if you have any similar story to report.... regarding any missing time experience you may have encountered... I&apos;d love to hear from you.  Relevant contact numbers and information can be found at the end of this page. I would like to thank everyone who took the time to write or pick up the telephone to make a call reporting what it was they saw. All of this data is very helpful. I also would like to express my many thanks to the newspapers who ran an article on this event. The information provided readers with the relevant phone number, email address, fax number  etc.. and toll free number so that more of you hopefully will also make a report on anything strange you may have witnessed happening in the skies above. At the end of the day, there are more questions and answers. As time allows, I will be posting all of the reports I received over this case to my website. Take good care.

It was raining moderate to heavy.  I first noticed something unusual when the rain suddenly stopped hitting my windshield, then started back up after about 1/10th of a mile later.  The gap in rainfall lasted about 7-10 seconds.  It reminded me of how the rain suddenly stops for a brief second when you pass under a bridge during a storm.  I could also make out that the sky was darker than normal.  I pulled over (now back in the rain) and looked towards the West.  The clouds in the sky were picked up the ambient light from the streetlights, and against them I could see a much darker object, stationary, over Rt. 70.  I couldn&apos;t guage the exact size or shape, but my impression was that it was huge.  It seemed to drift towards the South, and then I couldn&apos;t discern it anymore.  There were no overpasses or bridges in the vicinity for me to pass under, and the trees did not overhang the highway.  There was no sound and no lights.", "Small disc shaped object dropped into view less than 40 feet away from observers.I know what time it was exactly because I had just watched our local AM Northwest television program. My 3 1/2 year old were sitting in our front room facing the picture window.  She was standing on the couch beside ne and I had my arm sort of around her.  A disk/saucer shaped object dropped straight down into our line of vision. It was in our neighbors yard, in front of their house about 4 feet above the ground. That image is pretty much burned into my brain and I can still clearly recall what I saw that day.The object was not more than about 5 feet across  and about 2 1/2 to 3 feet deep.  It was a sort of mottled green camoflauge color and had what looked like writing on the side. Except the stick figure lettering looked like Egyptian/Arabic/Russian type of script. The object hung in place for a couple of minutes and then it moved straight up past the window frame where I could see it. I was so stunned that the time seemed to creep by, but I&apos;m sure the incident was not more than two minutes. I could not believe what I had seen. It seemed impossible. I immediately turned to my daughter and asked her if she had seen anything and she said  she saw an upside down turtle shell.  She got the shape right.  The lower side was slightly more curved than the top side.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "Unidentified lightsMy wife and I noticed a blink star in the sky.  With a pair of binoculars, we were able to tell that the object was changing colors rapidly from red to blue to white and perhaps some other colors.  The object was stationary and never moved for close to an hour.  We scanned the sky and noticed at least four other such objects, also rapidly changing colors.  These were moving across the sky and changing directions several times.  At one point, two of the moving objects approached the third stationary obejct in a approximate triangle formation and then veered off again.  We are both white-collar professionals.  We don&apos;t buy into the whole UFO-thing easily, ut we do not have a rationale explanation for what we saw.((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that a twinkling star would be the first possibility to be ruled out.

My window was rolled down.  I turned to look just as this brilliant green light entered the clouds to my east at maybe a mile away and 2000&apos; elevation.  The moon was bright through high haze, with lower level stagnant nimbostratus remnant clouds spaced by miles.  The surroundings were illuminated quite well, but the object lit up a considerable parcel of the cloud it went into in bright green light. Object seemed to be going down into the cloud at a 15-degree angle.  A second after the light was gone it seemed like the object had gone down, judging from the angle of entry and speed.  It covered at least a mile in less than half a second - speed of sound speed, but there was no sound. Too, from the time I left Maple Valley, to the sighting, then to Enumclaw, I easily passed a dozen law enforcement officers from various jurisdictions.  Some were parked (singles and doubles), some driving (saw three in a row coming around one corner)- an alarming degree of activity for that confined stretch/area.", "the objects moved at great speed but silently and quite low.they were clearly visiblewe saw two triangle shaped crafts which moved silently &amp; at great speed over our roof.they were clearly triangular in shape with greenishwhite lights at the three corners &amp; a bright red circular light at the center.their movement can be described as if they were propelled forward in spurts similar to the underwater movement of jellyfish.though this is the first time we saw the triangular crafts from close quarters ,we have sighted different objects at a greater distance,sometimes like avery fast moving reddish white stars, once a bright silvery band,once a circular shape with bright light below in an inverted bowllike end.", "Commercial looking airline, pin wheeling in place.I saw in the sky on a broken cloudy day a commercial airline shape, just pin wheeling in the sky, not moving forward nor backwards, just pin wheeling in a slow circle in place.

Amazing!!!", "((NUFORC Note:  There is a vivid &quot;twinkling&quot; star in the western sky during the early evening, currently, although that would not explain the formation of lights the observer apparently witnessed later during the sighting.  PD))V shaped Formation  over Newport, AR.I was travelling west on AR Route 14 towards Newport, US Route 67 interchange was about 5 miles away, traffic was light.   I noticed a light that was changing in color from red to blue to yellow to green and back to red.  At first, I thought it was an aerial applicator, but drove past 2 other aerial applicator aerodromes on AR Route 14 back towards Harrisburg, AR where the planes were grounded.  Perhaps this was an aerial applicator heading home, but then again on a Thursday night?  Then I saw another light changing colors in the same sequence as the first.   The lights were moving parrallel from North to South and were now both south of AR Route 14.  I turned on to the on ramp to go south to Little Rock, AR on  US Route 67.  Then I realized that there was formation of these flashing lights moving to the south.  There was a total of 7 lights, placed the thumb of my Right hand over the central light, approximately  1 foot measured from the light formation.  As I travelled south on US Route 67 towards Little Rock, AR the formation kept going and suddenlly a shooting star greenish in color shoots in front of me.  Then out of nowhere another greenish shooting star comes from the SW.  The formation has picked speed and noticed that these lights were at a higher altitude.  Then all of the sudden they were gone.", "this object appeared to be off the coast of los angeles, from where we were standing it was for sure over the ocean, it was a very clear morning the bright red ,yellow oval shaped thing seemed to change colors,it was very low to the horizon,the thing appeared to be dumping something into the ocean, it dropped four oval shapped thinggs that looked similar to itself but smaller it started to move slowly to the south then dissappeared for a second reappeared the left so fast i couldnt estimate the speed it turned a bluish color the faster it went we stood there and my co worker said it was agoverment ufo i say what we saw was a genuine ufo i also think we had a once in a lifetime sighting", "Stationary amber orbs of light fade out then reappear in the exact same spot.Well, I saw the peculiar amber orbs of light again tonight. This is probably the fifth time in about three years. It is the same every time. Amber lights in the southwest sky, past the Sierra Estrella Mountains, and in the direction of the Barry Goldwater Air Force Range. But I am guessing the lights are closer to the Phoenix area.It always occurs in the period between 9:00 to 10:30pm.Two or three stationary yellowish-orange lights appear-fade out-then reappear five minutes later in the same spot. In a previous sighting the lights appeared to blend or change colors also. If they are illumination flares, wouldn&apos;t they descend earthward? . Another report once estimated the location of the lights in the vicinity of Rainbow Valley. This would seem to be pretty much on target-but hard to say for sure. I once saw one of these lights at a much closer distance while piloting a single-engine light aircraft between Gila Bend and Yuma. I estimated the distance at 10 miles. This time it was more like an intensely bright fireball that faded and reappeared. I suppose it could be some type of experimental flare.Thanks", "Only showed up  in the picturesMy daughter and I was on a road trip to Chicago.There was a beautiful cloud in the sky so I wanted a picture of it,(it had a rainbow).I magnifyed my cam.4x,s to get closer.When I got home on the 6th of Sept.and downloaded them to my PC I was amazed to see what I saw.I will send the pic s to you but It couldent be dont on this site for some reason.But what I caught on the cam we did not see with the nacked eye.Contact me if you want the pic s.", "WHAT HAPPEND IN THOSE COUPLE OF HOURS WE CANT EXPLAINWE WERE COMING BACK FROM VISTING MY FATHER.WE LEFT FROM MY DADS AROUND 5P.M.,AS HE LIVES IN EAST TEXAS, 2HRS.FROM DALLAS.ALL I REMEMBER WAS THE END OF THE INNCIDENT,SEEING THE CIGAR SHAPED OBJECT HOOVERING ABOVE THE TREES,IT MADE NO NOISE AND SEVERAL DIFFERANT COLOR LIGHTS AROUND THE EDGE CLOSER TO THE BOTTOM SEEMED TO BE MOVING.MY HUSBAND WAS DRIVING,AS I HAD SPOTTED IT FIRST.I YELLED FOR HIM TO LOOK,THEN HE HUNG HIS HEAD WAY OUT THE WINDOW WHILE I HAD TO GRAB THE WHEEL SO WE WOULD NOT CRASH.I WANTED TO SEE MORE LIKE HE WAS,BUT TRYED TO WATCH THE ROAD AND LOOK.WE FOLLOWED THE OBJECT UNTIL WE CAME TO A BRIGHT INTERSECTION AND THE OBJECT TOOK OFF SO QUICK,WE STOPPED OUR CAR ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD JUST LOOKING AT EACH OTHER,I SAID NO ONE WILL EVER BELEIVE WHAT JUST HAPPEND.WE GOT HOME LOOKED AT THE TIME,BECAUSE IT WAS TOO DARK,AS WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN HOME RIGHT AT 7:PM,BUT IT WAS ALMOST 11:PM.WE BOTH ARGUE ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT OCCURED,AS HE REMEMBERS THE BEGINNING OF OUR JOURNEY AND I REMEMBER THE END.WE LOST TIME,WE DONT LIKE THAT AT ALL.WE WISH WE KNEW WHAT HAPPEND DURING ALL THAT LOST TIME,AND I NEVER FORGET ANYTHING.HE DID TELL ME WHEN THE OBJECT APPEARED HE LOOKED OVER AT ME AND I WAS JUST WAKING UP.I KNOW THAT ISNT TRUE BECAUSE HE IS A BAD DRIVER AND I WOULD NEVER FALL ASLEEP WHILE HE DROVE.WE KEEP DISAGREEING ABOUT ME BEING ASLEEP AND THE ROAD WE ENDED UP ON,17 MILES FROM WHERE WE WERE IN THE FIRST PLACE.I TOLD HIM THAT IF WE HAD SUCH A STRANGE ENCOUNTER THEN WHAT IF WE WERE (I DONT LIKE THIS WORD)ABDUCTED AND THEY(WHO EVER THEY ARE)FIXED IT SO WE BOTH WOULD NOT AGREE AND NEVER KNOW WHAT REALLY TOOK PLACE.SO NOW I KNOW WHAT HAPPEND TO ME EVEN THOUGH PARTS ARE MISSING AND HE KNOWS WHAT HAPPEND TO HIM.I WILL CONTINUE TO THINK ABOUT BOTH OUR PARTS AND MAYBE ONE DAY IT WILL ALL COME TO ME,OR HIM.NOW I WILL NOT LAUGH WHEN OTHERS SAY THEY ENCOUNTERED A U.F.O..I FELL MY MIND WAS VIOLATED BECAUSE THAT TIME WAS TAKEN FROM ME.I WONT TELL ANY ONE ,THEY WOULD LAUGH.I WILL REMEMBER ONE DAY.", "I saw a small white sphere cross the sky in  a straight lineI can&apos;t say this is the most interesting UFO sighting in history, but I still can&apos;t identify the little fella, so here it is: My friend and I were walking down Maple Street in New Orleans one overcast afternoon (it was more than a year ago and I can&apos;t remember the month at all, really). I looked up, probably to check for rain, and saw a white-looking sphere gliding overhead. I thought it was a balloon, or given the nasty weather, a weather balloon, but it was hard to get any sense of distance or scale; the sky was perfectly gray and overcast, and there was no noise. I called my friend&apos;s attention to it, and we may have asked a passer by for an opinion (I don&apos;t remember). Anyway, although I initially maintained it was a balloon, it flew in a perfectly straight line at a constant speed, all the way across the sky, which I wouldn&apos;t expect from something traveling on air currents. I&apos;m an engineer with lots of fluid dynamics experience, and I&apos;ve seen balloons get carried away in wind. If this sphere was entrained in an air current... well, I haven&apos;t seen anything like it. Eventually it disappeared over the horizon; not knowing how high it was, I can&apos;t estimate the speed, but it must have been fairly quick. Sadly, there&apos;s no abduction to report. If my friend and I were late to where we were going, it was our own fault, as usual.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "KITE SHAPED OBJECT CHANGED 3 COLORS AND JIGGED UP AND DOWN WHILE FLASHING, VERY, VERY BRIGHT.The object was shaped like a kite and was a very bright yellow at first. It was jumping up and down 3 or 4 times a second and flashing at the same rate. It was moving very slowly SW over the swamp towards the edge of Round lake. Very suddenly it jumped up 6 or 8 feet and turned a bright orange still jumping and flashing as before. At this time I grabbed my sister and told her to look at this, ((name deleted)), it just changed colors, what is it. She said it was a kite and I said no it&apos;s in the swamp. Who is going to fly a kite in the swamp! Just then it jumped up another 6 or 8 feet and changed to a hot rose pink color still jumping and flashing and still moving slowly SW, now over land and into the large trees that lined the lake. It went in between trees but kept it&apos;s SW direction untill it was lost from sight into the heavy forest. I would estimate the size of the object as 5 feet high and perhaps 3 feet wide. It was a clear bright day with a light easterly breeze.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Also, Rhinebeck, NY, I believe, is the site of an airport, where numerous antique aircraft are based.  However, the description the witness provides does not seem compatible with the sighting of any type of conventional aircraft, and in 1957, aircraft could not change their color.

The Shiny silver ball which I estimate the diamater to be 3-5 feet at about 2000-feet high. The object appeared to my sight as it left a persistant contrail it came from.  The sphere traveled about 100-feet from the contrail and then stopped and reversed direction back into the persistant contail.  The sphere was visible for approx. 5-seconds.  This was no aircraft or balloon nor anything eles in my minds rolodex.  This object moved with intent and purpose.", "Large mother ship sighting and smaller UFO chased by military fighters.While hunting in a very remote area of south Texas in a deer blind about 12 feet above the ground I noticed a circular light to my left in the late afternoon. I looked toward it very briefly as I was preparing to come down from the blind. In my mind I registered the light as the rising moon but then I thought to myself that the object was too big to be the moon, even if it was low in the sky. When I turned my head to look at the object again it was gone. I saw this light for a mere second or two. About fifteen minutes later my four buddies came for me in a pick-up truck. As we were looking at a wild boar that someone had shot I looked at the night sky and saw a very large array of white lights in a horizontal line low over the horizon that seemed to be at least a few miles away. The lights emitted no sound whatsoever. For this UFO to look so large to us and seem to be so far away seemed impossible. I can only describe it as being some type of mother ship and in fact reminded me of an aircraft carrier just floating over the horizon. All of us saw this object and were telling each other &quot;What the hell is that?&quot; As we watched this UFO for about a minute the lights would change from white to yellow. And they would turn off and on again each time in a different sequence and in alternating groups. Five on, two off, three on, all off, etc. Then suddenly a fog or smoke cloud appeared over the lights and they all went off. About four seconds later the same lights appeared much higher in the sky almost at forty five degrees to the horizon. Prior the lights were just above the horizon. It would seem impossible for such a large object to rise that high that fast. We all mentioned to each other in amazement how that could have happened. Within a few seconds the lights went completely off and it was gone. After a short time (about five minutes) we were on our way out of the ranch and heading to the highway. I kept looking at the sky hoping to see that ship again when suddenly I saw another smaller craft high overhead turning in a wide circle to my left. I could distinctly see the back of it and saw a diamond shaped light with lights inside of it that were in a horizontal line and turning on and off in sequence toward the center. This UFO was being chased by two military fighters! This was very easy to see in the night sky and I looked at this with binoculars. All my buddies saw this also. We just kept driving and I kept watching this awesome display until they faded out of sight. The jet fighters lingered in the area for a while circling in CAP (combat air patrol).((NUFORC Note:  Source of report elects to remain totally anonymous.  Date is approximate.  PD))", "&quot;tiny&quot; flying cylinder (not a drone, Predator, cruise missile, etc.) no wings/rudder/no exhaust/no propPREFACE:  I have two homes up here in the Mojave Desert, both aviation testing heavens for aviation buffs. One is Near China Lake and the other is on top of a hill in remote location just north of Edwards AFB (EAFB). The EAFB place is directly under a heavily used,  supersonic low altitude corridor so we see all the military&apos;&apos;s good stuff being tested and passing directly over our house 24 hours per day.  (B2, B1, F-117, F-22, JSF, NASA-Dryden stuff, Osprey, C-17 and many other test models.  So we here are battle hardened when it comes to &quot;UFO&quot; sightings and many folks just take them for granted due to the heavy activity out here of experimental stuff going on. Most of us &quot;literate&quot; residents of this area know our planes and the generalities and the specifics of sensitive and public projects going on at EAFB/China Lake, etc. because we work there or at Plant 42 (Palmdale) or at famous Mojave civilian airport. The stuff that goes on at these three locatations is cutting edge.  In fact, the lead British test pilot testing Lockheed&apos;s version of the F-22 Raptor was over at my home one day visiting and he said they use my EAFB-area house as a marker from the sky.  That explains why we get buzzed several times a day and why our drywall nails are popping out. With all that said, please advise that I know my planes, I have better than 2010 vision, have flown helicopters, am an amateur astronomer with a Celestron C-8 (with &quot;go to&quot;) and a Cave Optics 10&quot; Newtonian telescope. I have a wife that is a pilot (we are both scientists) and we have large personal photo archive of really tight shots of just about everything (declassified) that has passed by our house. Anyway, September 19 I was do my morning mountain bike ride on the I-58 frontage roads on the north side of Edwards AFB (which is west of Mojave). Three silver fighters (not white or black matte or grey) passed over headign north about 1000 feet AGL and about 10 feet off the wing of one of them was a grey flying cylinder about 4-6 feet long. It was NOT being towed and it was NOT a cruise missile, NOT a drone (I am familiar with them from NAWC Weapons-Point Magu), nor was it the Predator or Dark Star, etc. It had no visible exhaust, no rudder could be seen, no canards or winglets, and it flew around the fighters (from front to back to side, like a toddler hands around it&apos;s mother&apos;s legs). So it was not being towed. About 15 minutes later the three fighters returned (again heading in the same Northerly direction), but this time the little cylinder craft was gone.  . Problem 1: No fighter plane would (to my knowlecge) get that close to a flying missile or remotely controlled object. It was within 5 feet of the planes when parallel to them. Problem 2: I can&apos;t see how this was propelled. It obviously was not towed! And they were travelling 200-300 mph. A little slow for a missile. Besides there are no bombing ranges in this immediate area. They are all at China Lake (60 miles to the north). Problems 3: if it was remotely controlled how could it fly as such without some winglets and rudder. Of course I am aware of thrust vectoring, but this one had no exhaust. New propulsion technique?  Speculation: Since this was escorted, it was clearly military, and could be a source of similar UFO sightings and reports. For example, a friend saw a small, lone  flying tube/cigar around the canyons back in Sand Canyon in Tehachapi, CA (40 mis west of EAFB) with no visible propulsion system. Summary:  I wouldn&apos;t even bother to report this one, but I think it could be of interest to other parties who have seen something like this and other military craft and think of it as extraterrestrial.  The military has some pretty good stuff that is way ahead of the outdated Stealths. For comparison, BTW, two years ago in the winter I did see the very LARGE triangular, matte black craft early one very cloudy morning flying north out of Palmdale (Plant 42). While driving on I-14 west of Plant 42 airstrips I saw it lift up into the thick low clouds in thesky so fast I couldn&apos;t believe it!  I almost ran off the road. Clearly they wanted this thing up into the cloud cover ASAP.  NO, it was not the B-2 or tiny F-117, the large tankers, nor the C-117 (or others, which are common around here). It looked like about 2.5 times the size (or more) of the B-2 with slight upturn on the tips of the manta type wings.", "it looked like a missile but then it suddenly changed direction and sped toward the clear blue skyon the above date at the above time (approx) i saw a plume of smoke traveling on the horizon. At first i thought it was a plane so i thought nothing of it untill i looked back about 2 minutes later and saw it stop and suddenly start traveling verticaly in a perfect right angle monuver i told the other people in the car who were traveling with me and no one could explain it. The only thing i could liken it to was a missile launch but i dont think a conventional missile can move at that angle. The sky was clear blue so it could be seen easily. After a few miutes it suddenly stopped and then started again a little higher and after a minute it just sped upwards and disapeared.", "2 witnesses viewed 4 triangular objects over Orlando with white flashing lights &amp; a red light underneath in the upper atmosphere.On Wed. September 17th at aproximately 10:30 pm my wife and I began our nightly walk of our dog.  It was a particularly clear night and as we walked I was looking at Mars which was very clear and visible in the night sky.  At about 10:35 pm something caught my attention in the sky to the right of my view of Mars.  It was a flashing white light moving West to east, but it was so high up I thought it was a satelite (which can be seen from time to time on a clear night).  I stopped my wife so I can point the satelite out to her.  She finally focused in and saw the flashing light, however it wasn&apos;t the lights I was pointing to... she had discovered a second flashing light.  This one was stationary directly below our Mars view.  The first object was heading directly towards the second object.  The stationary object also had a red light underneath.  When the first object lined up directly over the stationary object the two then began to move.  The first object that had been going West to East now changed direction and moved in unison with the second object heading now in a south to north direction.  At that point I knew that this wasn&apos;t a satelite, because satelites don&apos;t make a 90 degree turn and change direction.  These objects were very high up in earths upper atmosphere.  We watched as these 2 objects moved northward and then in the distance we saw a third stationary object flashing...  and then a fourth.  The 2 new objects appeared to be stationary and the first 2 objects were heading directly towards them.  At this point we became very uneasy.  We tried to think of rational explanations to explain what we were seeing.  The first 2 objects now lined up with the 2 new objects and all 4 began to head nothwards.  It also became clear that the object my wife had spotted was substantially larger than the other 3 and it appeared by the flashing lights to be triangular with a red light underneathe.  The larger object also appeared to be riding point as it was slightly ahead of the others.  As th! ey began moving north the 3 other objects suddenly went black and only the larger object was visible.We debated that it might be some kind of Military project, however I doubt the military has anything that can hover in the upper atmosphere at a stand still, wait for the other objects to catch up and then proceed, and satelites certainly can&apos;t change direction or wait for other satelites to catch up to them and then move.  I consider ourselves to be a very normal American couple and not UFO enthusiasts.   We are rational people and we witnessed something that defies rational. If there was ever a doubt that there is something else out their we have now seen it with our own eyes.  My wife, a devout Christian, didn&apos;t want to see this.  It has been an upsetting encounter for her because it cannot be explained.  The entire encounter took approximately 10-15 minutes.", "The craft was shaped like the planet Saturn.  It was translucent, with thousands of orange lights flashing in random order.  It was huge.  It headed straight for us at first.  I thought we were being bombed.  I called 911 and the dispatcher was obviously frightened. She kept asking &quot;What&apos;s it doing now?&quot;  She spoke to all four of us in turn.  Thirty minutes is a long time for a 911 dispatcher to stay on the line with you.  The craft was huge, totally silent, moved up, down and diagonally with amazing rapidity.

It reappeared thirty minutes later on the water line even brighter for another two minutes.   Unfortunately, we were caught off guard and couldn&apos;t catch it on video.  The police and coast guard called throughout the night as if it was a  flare (I don;t think flaares can hover for two minutes in the same spot).  The coast guard told us that they sent aircraft to investigate.  We watched all night and saw no response.  My guess is they knew that it wasn&apos;t a distress call.

I saw what appeared to be a greyish blue disk-shaped flying vehicle that rapidly approached us from the ocean and passed over our heads.I was unable to estimate the size or hieght of the object due to its fuzzy appearance (it seemed to be indistinct along its edges).  There was another aircraft in the sky nearby the flight path of the object; a biplane which was doing some stunt practice at about 4000&apos;.  The other aircraft did not seem to change course when the object flew across its flight path, but I&apos;m not sure if that is because it was above or below the biplane.The object flew over our heads to the left side of us (at about 11:00 high) and looked to me like a greyish fuzzy object that got darker in the middle.  My wife said that it had a pattern or markings on it, but I couldn&apos;t see anything like that.There was no sound from the object, and that surprised me as there was little to no noise from the ocean (no wind).Its flight path was a straight line from the south to the north without any course changes.

My wife was sleeping at the time.  I saw a bright light screeming across the sky, from southwest to northeast, at a fairly low level (approximately 10,000-15,000 foot range).  It was traveling much faster than any jet plane, and my first thought was meteorite - but it was flying horizontal, not in a downward direction, and there was no trail behide it.  It was also flying much faster than any craft that would have been flying in or out of the airport - and at a direction not in line with any runways.  There was one airplane coming into the airport from the oposite (south) side of the city, and the pilot may have seen what I saw, although he/she was likely preoccupied in preparation for landing.  I only saw it for a few seconds as it was moving so fast.  When we arrived at home, I told my wife about it.

I watched and waited but it did not seem to go away or come closer so curiosity took over and I looked even closer at this object to see weather it were an small single engine aircraft or helicopter. I watched as this object seemed only to move slightly up down and around in a very narrow window of area, as it began to move more noticibly, it&apos;s movement seemed to become erratic with short jerky meandering motions with a strange purposefullness about it. As I watched it I noticed it had 6 lightsin a sort of delta pattern, the lights were blinking simultaneously going from nearly white-(canary diamond white)-to beautifull orangish amber- these colors continued alternating one color change cycle per second for the duration from the time that I actually percieved  the blinking...which was actually from the very beginning. As I watched this object it began to descend a little bit and then it cycled it&apos;s lights down to orange then it slowly dimmed out within 2 seconds to a really dark cherry color and then to an allmost black amorphous shape with the still visible dark red color in the center near the bottom of the object. This phase remained for about 5 seconds then the lights turned back on again as it were and the fullest intensity of white light came from the 6 lights and it resumed it&apos;s cyclical blinking and then began to ascend diagonally south/southwest...while I was due east of it. The object then leveled off and began to move at a relatively slow pace-(considerably less than common commercial aircraft minus small single prop types)-I then noticed anoth! er same object way to the right/north of the other object and still west of me. The newly appeared object appeared suddenly as out of nowhere, or the timer turned on the lights...well this thing just was going at at least a 70 degree angle and had no difficulty gaining altitude and covered several thousand feet at a speed that  &quot;seemed&quot; to move around 1500-2000 mph at this time I ran downstairs to show the security guard but I realized that he would not have been able to see it from his perspective and then ran inside to call a friend. I came back outside to look for the first object and noticed that it was not in my field of view anymore and the second was stationary [or it seemed]very high in the sky as if it were a bright star roughly was around the same general vicinity as where I last saw it except higher. I may be mistaken as it might have been a star which seemed to shimmer like a neutron star. I did not bother to continue to watch this star to see any changes and then heard my phone ring so I went to get it. Note:The sky was very clear that night because it had rained a day earlier. I do not wear glasses or contacts and have relatively good eyesight. The entire duration of the movement of the object never once did it or they seem to bank or turn on any deviant axis from their original longitudinal /horizontal fixing...when it or they moved it was only up down or around with a very 2 dimensional quality in the sence -(to repeat )-that they only showed &quot;face&quot; or one profile continually. The brilliance of the lights made them very cleary defined that is why I can reccolect 6 lights in their pattern on theobjects #1 and #2...as in the order first described. When the #1 first dimmed out to a blackish amorphous object there were originally 6lights on the object untill it went dark then it seemed to have one dark cherry red glow about the center before resuming blink mode. I truly regret not having a video camera or at least a large pair of binoculars, this was an incredible event to me even though some! what surrealistic...the feeling that I got from viewing this/these objects was that of something intelligently controlled with the intention of being seen...with an otherworldly feel from it which gave me chills at one point while viewing it, at the same time being totally exhuberant like I had won the lottery. I am not a pilot or have ever been...I am a sky watcher -(no optics)- I do not posess any licenses or badges etc. Just a regular guy and no less credible according to my own perspective. This is not the first time I have seen strange things of this sort both here and abroad...I suppose that if you look up often enough you will see all sorts of things. I could not really get a relative idea of the distance of the objects because of the unknowable size of them...a crude guestimate would put them at 5 miles near the vicinity of harwin street @ beltway 8 southwest houston or further.

Trailing from the light was what appeared to be sparks or dots of light floating away behind the light. There were approximately 4-6 total forming and streaming behind.

I was traveling home from the Rich Pond area toward the city of Bowling Green, Kentucky.  After I had left the Nashville Road, and began to drive on the Cave Mill Road, I noticed a very large bright red pulsating glowing light to my left out of the front windshield of my automobile.  Realizing that Bowling Green has a small airport, I at first thought it was an aircraft of some sort.  But then I began to notice that the object was not moving at all, and it was hovering silently in the same position.  There was no sound at all from the craft that I could hear.  I was now close to the Church of Later Day Saints on the Cave Mill Road, and the object was still hovering silently in the same spot.  Then all of a sudden the bright red pulsating glowing light somehow became smaller, and I could see that the object was triangular in appearance.  The object had a red pulsating light glowing underneath it, and also two smaller white lights on the back tip ends of the triangle.  I immediately pulled into the Church of Later Day Saints parking lot to observe the craft some more.  After watching it hover for close to five more minutes, the craft then began to slowly move away to the southwest.  The object was still so bright that I could see it moving away slowly for several miles before it finally disappeared.  This was indeed a very strange incident, and it DID happen.I have no explanation for it.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  Date is approximate.

PD", "Red pulsing light above Los Angeles in AugustI saw a news report on TV about the red light in LA and did some web searches and found this sight.I thought I was the only one to see this but my story is similar to others.  I saw a bright ruby-red light that hovered in one area in the northern sky of Los Angeles.  It seemed to pulse slowly then more quickly and finally disappear.  I saw it twice in the same spot to the north.  I didn&apos;t see it move at all, it just hovered, then pulsed and then disappeared.  I called the satellite office of Griffith Observatory once to report it (they gave me the same story that I was looking at Mars).  I called the second time to see if anyone else had reported this, again they said no, I then asked them to log my call in case any one else called in and to keep an eye out in the northern skies.  The second time was the last I saw of this light.I&apos;m thinking this was some sort of laser coming from the Mount Wilson area scanning the sky, maybe even conducting some tests due to the fact Mars was so close to Earth.  I don&apos;t know, it&apos;s just my theory.  The more exposure we can get on this the better chances we have of figuring out what it was.Another interesting fact I  have noticed is that most if not all sightings were from the San Gabriel valley area (I also was in that area), more specifically Monterey Park and Montebello.((NUFORC Note:  Many other reports of a sighting of a red light seen hovering over the area east of downtown Los Angeles.  PD))", "I was returning from town to my farm located 4 miles NE of Eunice.  I turned north off of the main Hwy. and as I cleared some trees to my left I noticed a row of lights about 1 mile to the NW of my present location.  As this light was located on my farm property, and in a remote location, I was concerned that someone was trespessing on my property.  There were a row 5 white lights with smaller red lights in between the white ones.  They seemed to have a concave spacing, did not blink or move, and did not give off a beam as a light might if it were lighting up an area. (Like a baseball field) although it seemed to cover an area of several hundred yards.(from one end to the other) I proceeded immediately north on the farm road and turned left (west)onto an intersecting east/west farm road.  As I continued west, I could see the tree line under the lights which gave me a reference to its location.  As I continued west down the farm road, I noticed the lights starting to flicker, as if trees were getting between me and the light source. When I reached the end of the road, the flickering lights were now due north, about 400 yards.  As I turned north, I could no longer see any light.  I then thought trees had gotten between me and the lights, so I backtracked east on the road I had approached from.  I never saw the lights again. The overall size of the light grouping was quite large.  It would have covered an area the size of a baseball field.  I own 850 acres of farm land with the home place in the very middle.  There are no other buildings or structures and there is no electricity or power lines in this remote area.  I have since watched this area each night since the original sighting with no results.  I did not observe any object attached to these lights, nor did they move other than blinking out. It made no sound that I heard.  I went to the site the next day and found no evidence in the freshly cultivated fields on either side of the tree line or in the tree line.  I can&apos;t explain it.", "Falling starYellow fireball, northern sky, straight drop, no tail streak, disappeared behind treeline.  (Falling satellite or meteorite.)

It had lights going all the way around it and had a metalic apperance.

It remained suspended for about two minutes during which time I checked my watch at 9.00pm. I was with a fellow worker and we stood on a sidewalk watching this object, and soon another ten people or so joined us and watched it. The object seemed to have a large gantry object sticking out in an inverted V shape but strangely the &apos;gantry&apos; would appear to show up on different sides of the object.  After hovering in a fixed position, the object slowly moved nothward but then a most astonishing thing happened. Long streamers, about a dozen in number streamed down, each streamer was on fire and falling in wavy fashion but the flaming debris went out long before they reached ground.

The sky was black as pitch, or it seemed that way to my eyes that couldn&rsquo;t grow accustomed to the dark because of headlights. About 40 miles north of Gainesville, the sky suddenly became a uniform eerie green (slightly bluish) color all over and lasted that way for a full 1.5 seconds. The light was not bright enough to illuminate the terrain.  Jasmine started awake and looked out the window. It seemed to flicker slightly and then, poof! it was back to black. Jasmine looked around a bit, gave me a hurt look that said she thought I had tricked her, and curled up again to sleep. I don&rsquo;t know what could have caused it. A meteor fire-ball is almost never that color, that long lasting, or that bright, from what I&apos;ve seen of meteor-shower watching over the years. I didn&rsquo;t hear an explosion. I know there&rsquo;s some sort of mining operation (phosphate?) just off of I-75, but that is many miles away, and I can&rsquo;t imagine what could generate that much light (unless they dug up a ton of pure phosphorous).

She went on to say that her and her family had drove to Cranbrook, B.C. to attend a family members wedding on July 26, 2003. While they were in Cranbrook they stayed at a friends home which was approx; 15 kilometers west of Cranbrook. The next day after the wedding a group of people were in the back yard talking, etc.. and one person pointed out something kind of strange. They all looked off into the distance and saw something very bright and silver/white in color. The witness told me the area where the object was spotted is covered in trees and the light was sitting amongst the mountains. She also told me it was west of the friends home and it was sitting very low, actually the light was sitting in a depression on one of the local mountains.

She hollared over to me and her best friend (11 years young) to look at something weird. We took the few steps down the back porch to get the view she had. She was aprox. Instantly we noticed the strange craft. It was a charcoal colored disk with a center that was shining. The color of the light was a whiteish/blue and simliar to the color of electricity. This craft was...guesstimating here....about the size of a larger helicopter. It seemed to fly at a slow speed. I would compare it to a car going 30 mph. I have no idea as to how high up it was. Again, I&apos;ll compare it to something familiar. We often have medivacs cruise thru here everyday or so. They seem to be heading to Seattle or out to the VA hospital area (Fort Lewis). Well, I&apos;d say that this craft flew a little higher than theses helicopters. It made no sound and was in no hurry. I checked the wind direction to decide if it was being blown but it was not the wind doing this. It was moving in a straight direction towards Puyallup Valley area which is aprox 5 miles from my Eastside neighborhood. I feel foolish now for mocking all of those silly spaceship/UFO shows from the 50&apos;s/60&apos;s. It didn&apos;t look like a man made object. The way it moved was unlike anything I&apos;ve seen. And the shiney light, (probably blinding if you were 500 feet or so closer), seemed to be an energy source. Perhaps the sun? It also seemed to be reflecting the sun and maybe that reflection is maybe why it seemed so shiney and  the color of lightning. To my shock, this darned thing was a flying saucer. No way!", "UFO seen in 1975 on a desserted hwy. in NCIt was summer, in 1975 when an object followed our car for miles on an empty highway road and the UFO followed us for 15 minutes so we stopped and pulled off of the road and all three of us got out and the UFO pulled up beside us and stopped and hovered above the tree tops about 250 meters away from us and the UFO had multicolored lights that flashed around the mid-section sequencially, Purple,red,white with weird speckles of light inside of it,yellow,green, etc. It just hovered for a long time and the lights turned purple and the lights reversed direction and and flashed in the opposite direction. Then it started to land just behind a few trees that were widely spaced apart and it landed on the lawn in a field across from us which was approx. 250 meters from where we were at, and we got scared and got back in our VW Beetle (New) and we got out of there. It was very terrifying at the time and we were very scared about what happened. There was no one around at all, no cars, people, etc. Nothing at all.

She was sitting in the passenger&apos;s seat.  We both were gov&apos;t workers at the time working the evening shift at the local VA hospital. She was an RN and I was a CNA.  At 12:30AM, she looked out her window and saw what she thought was the moon and said it was very low and bright that night.  I looked out her window and saw that it was moving through the trees and over the tops of the occasion house or two.  We were heading east on the road.  A couple of minutes later, it moved to my side of the car and was only about 100 yards from the road.  It was keeping pace with us.  When we came upon an open field, I decided to stop and get out to investigate what this thing might be.  So I got out of the car and this sphere just hovered above the field.  Again, it was about 100 yards away from me and about 200 yards above the ground.  My passenger elected to remain in the car.  It looked to be 3x the size of a basketball from the distance where I stood.  No noise, no sound, no trail,no pulsing lights....just a bright white light that seemed to steadily emanate from within the craft.  After a minute or two, I walked toward the thing and it moved away.  I slowly walked backward toward my car again and it came forward again.  I did this a few times and realized this was no weather balloon or any type of natural phenomenon.  I finally asked out loud, &quot;Who are you?&quot;  It then grew brighter and my car stalled and the radio began flipping through all the stations rapidly before everything finally quit on the car altogether.  After what I thought was 10 minutes, I got back in the car to start it up and it wouldn&apos;t start.  Then, everything came back on again and I turned the key and we were out of there in a shot!  But the craft remained behind my car and it was in view of my rear-view mirror, but it traveled over the road this time.  We were doing 80 mph for several miles until it disappeared.

But, upon entering my home, I looked at the clock in my livingroom, it read 2:55AM as did the other clocks in the house.  I called my co-worker at her house and asked her to look at her watch and then the clocks in her house.  She, too, became scared and we both wondered what happened to the 2 hours that were missing from what should&apos;ve been only a 40 minute drive.  As it turned out, many people in the area saw this thing.  2 of my brothers saw it and they lived in 2 seperate towns.  One in Victor, NY and the other in Ithaca, NY.  Apparently this thing had been seen all around the Fingerlakes region for most of that evening.  Most of my other co-workers also saw this thing as they drove home too.  My passenger no longer remembers this incident, but I do!  It still remains a mystery as to what happened to those 2 missing hours.

While I observed with my neighbor the two grey colored craft flying together with several hundred yards separation but in definite formation one slightly higher and in front of the other, I noticed a (blurry) pinkish orange object below the other two in apparent formation with the slightly larger and more defined grey colored craft above it.  The three objects moved at a constant speed in constant formation to the south and no exsaust trails or sounds where heard. No anti collision lights where seen and no markings could be seen. From my view the objects where smaller and slower than airliners and there was a brief discusion as to the close proximity of the craft, that they could not have been airliners. My neighbor thinks they might have been military aircraft but I do not agree. I was in Navy aviation for many years and am highly trained in observations and understand aviation and air traffic. As the 3 objects moved out of vision to the south horizon, the sun light from the east brilliantly refected off all 3 objects and they looked like 3 bright stars as they faided out of my view.

We were sitting in the vehicle conversing prior to ending our social engagement.  In the middle of a sentence a bright green light illuminated our surroundings.  The source of this light was unidentified, since the roof of the vehicle obstructed our view, however it appeared to be comming from above our location.  I clearly recall feeling like our vehicle was close to the center of this projected light, because I noticed a clearly defined break in the green light line on the background of the white walled residential houses.  The light was so bright that everything inside the vehicle and outside the vehicle seemed visually permiated.  The light remained constant for about three(3) seconds and then discontinued.  We both looked at each other speechless for a few seconds, then slowly asking each other what was that.  Approximately four(4) or five(5) seconds later the light re-illuminated our surroundings once again.  The duration was again, approximately three(3) seconds.  And again, the light was green with clearly defined line boundries on the white background of the near by houses.  This time I immediatly rolled down the window to see if there was some kind of aircraft.  We did not see any evidence of aircraft,any evidence of audio noise, or any remaining physical evidence of the event.  The closest way to describe the event was like a very very bright spot light someplace directly above the vehicle, but the light we saw was extremely bright, all consumming, and uniform in content.  I revisited the location many times after and could find no logical explanation for the events that took place.  I am a professional investigator of 11 years (currently) and am one of two credable witnesses.  I also noticed that on 02/15/03 in Virginia Beach a similar event was recorded.((NUFORC Note:  We have written the witness, requesting that he attempt to provide a precise date for the event, if possible.  We observe that his sighting occurred at the approximate time of the annual Leonid meteor shower, but his description does not seem consistent with a typical meteor, unless it had been moving directly toward the witness.  If the event occurred in another year, we believe we may know what it was he observed.  PD))", "((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a twinkling star.

I looked over towards the Pilgrim Monument and then my eyes wandered upward to the sky.  It was a clear night and there were many visible stars.  As I looked due east I saw a particularly bright, blinking star that appeared to also have red and blue colors.  I stared at it for several minutes and the brightness of it would grow and dim and sometimes fade completely only to return again.  I was very curious about what i was seeing.  i called my friend out of the house to take a look.  I pointed to the sky and asked him to tell me what he saw.  He said he saw a bright star and thought he saw some red in it.  I asked if he had binoculars which he went and got.  He gave them to me and through them could see and object grayish in color with lights at the bottom of it which seemed to move round and flash.  The closest thing I can compare the shape of it to is a hat...wider at the bottom and rounded at the top.  The object was not moving in any direction.  Without the binoculars it appeared stationary, but with them it was pulsating or moving irratically in one spot.  Without describing what I was seeing I asked my friend to tell me what he saw and his description mirrored my own.

While trying to find Mars, we both noticed 2 very bright stars (we didn&apos;t mention them to each other, but kept trying to locate Mars).  We located Mars, and then one of us mentioned the 2 bright stars we had seen.  We both found the 2 bright stars again and looked at them for a few seconds (had to look straight up with our necks craned) and then they both started moving.  They went up into the sky (you could tell they were going up - not just fading) and, then instead of going up (vertically), they started going &quot;sideways&quot; (horizontally) in the same direction (toward the south, I think) and then just disappeared after about 15-20 seconds.  They both moved while keeping the same distance apart the whole time.  We stayed outside for a few minutes afterwards, but didn&apos;t see anything else move, so we came inside.

I was forwarded and email with details of your witness stories from Kelowna regarding the events of July 31st.  I also witnessed a strange event that night.  I was in bed, still awake, looking out my bedroom window which faces West.  I was looking at what I thought was star, but it seemed oddly out of place.  It flashed as bright as a flash of lightening.  The brightness and oddity of this flash made me jump out of bed, awakening my wife and asking her if she had just seen what I had.  She was asleep and did not witness what I did.  I went outside to gain a better look but it was gone.  The time of this occurrence, to the best of my knowledge was somewhere between 12:00 and 2:00 am. Thank you to the witness for the report.

But it moved upward and then back down.  It then hovered, it seemed to waver around in the sky.  We watched it dance around for an hour and fifteen minutes.  It was moving from the north to north north east and downward(over the full time.).  It was triangular shaped, the lights followed the sides to the bottom tips to the top tip, but none on the center bottom. They gave off different flashing colors:mostly blue/white(these were more constant-harder to tell apart but you could notice a difference at times), red, almost orange at times. the red light seemed to appear more in the middle, while white was on the bottom and blue seemed to remain near the top tip.  near 4:00 it seemed to project some weird red light.  It was not a beam, but more like a red dash in the sky.  This light would flash on and off, but only appeared about 7 times.  I almost stopped watching until i saw that different light.  and the sound, it was a dull roar, easy to dismiss, almost the sound of a helicoptor, but the sound was too constant, it just wasn&apos;t a helicoptor.  One plane flew by about 5 minutes before i could no longer see it.  It flew over the ship i was watching about 2 minutes after the red beams flashed.  the ufo seemed to almost get nervous and hovered around quicker than before.

They were all moving north west across the sky. This was the most patterns I had ever seen at one time. In the last month both myself and my wife had seen 4 other triangular patterns always moving in the same direction, but only 1 at a time. What we saw tonight was phenomenal, and is why I am writing in. I have been watching the sky&apos;s for as long as I can remember, and before this past couple of months had only ever seen singular lights moving in the sky. I have to say this has kind of freaked me out a bit. Such an large amount, and the patterns were all so perfectly formed, with the lights never breaking formation, with the exception of the ones moving individually. I have seen many unexplained lights in the night sky but this is the most incredible. I will be trying to get some video footage from now on with no guarantees, as sometimes these lights are hard to spot with the naked eye. I hope I&apos;m not the only one seeing these lights in Saskatchewan. The past couple of months have been just incredible for sightings. Thank you to the witness for the report.

I saw an object, shape unkown, perform manouvers which seemed to defy the laws of physics. I saw a lighted object, perhaps eight lights in all. It seemed to be literally &quot;tumbling&quot; across the sky. It would go from the West end of the San Fernando Valley to the east end, and then back again. It did so very rapidly, and with no noise discernible to me. The strangest thing about its journeys, (even more strange than its speed an silence) was the fact that when it stopped, it stopped almost as if it was at the end of a pendulum swing, and then it swung back.

I have above average intelligence, and am not prone to &quot;seeing things.&quot;", "Huge, stealth like craft passses over us with red and white lights, only to be followed by squadrons of fighters in its pathCraft sounded like a slow flying jet. We could hear it coming before we saw it. It was around midnight so it was dark and all you could see was the lights. There were four white lights on the rear of the craft in the shape of a diamond and two red lights on each wing, Maybe one on the end of the wing and one in the middle of the wings. None of the lights were blinking like all the other aircraft in the sky today. The lights on the wings were angled back so you could tell that the wings were swepted back like a jet. It reminded me of a Stealth only in a much much larger scale. At first I thought it was more than one plane flying in formation but the lights would&apos;nt have made any sense, because there would have been only one plane with the four white lights on the back of it and four other planes flying with only one red light. So it came to our conclusion that it could only be one plane. Antway it continued across the lake and at that point we could see two other planes coming across the sky at a very fast rate of speed to meet up with it and fly almost like escorting it till it was out of our sight. About twenty minutes later a squadron of planes flew over us in the same exact spot and the same direction almost like they were trying to duplicate what the other had just done. Only the precision flying wasn&apos;t there, and the lights were blinking on these planes. They had red and white lights on them too. Only each plane had red and white lights on them. After a while another squadron of them flew the same way and a little while another squadron. All of these planes had both red and white lights blinking on them. Thats why I think that the first one we saw was one big craft.", "sky ripped open - bright white lightDriving along and it was as if the sky was ripped open.

The craft appeared approximately 1/2 mile to the west.  I estimate it to be between 1500- 2000 feet in the air.  It appeared over a treeline.  Once we saw it we thought it was a new version of the stealth fighter out of Whiteman Air Force Base, Knob Knoster, MO.  If this was one, it was one bad ((object)).  When it started coming to us, we realized it was something VERY different.....we are use to seeing these stealth fighters at all times of the day/night.  We are use to the lighting, and sounds of these planes.  This was different.  First thing we noticed out of the ordinary was the lights.  This one had a HUGE &quot;headlight?&quot;  It looked just like a car headlightlight beam shing in a fog.  As it got closer we saw the bottom of it.  It had 1 huge dome light on the bottom.  it had 3 much smaller lights that made an equilateral triangle.  This thing was heading straight at us.  That is when we got out of my truck.  It flew by very close to us from the NE.  By this time this thing was probably 500 feet high.  That is when we both noticed how silent it was.  Before that we were just entranced by the lighting of this thing.  But this thing was SILENT.  after it passed, we watched it fly to the south.  Once it got about 1/4 mile away, all we could see was 2 flashing lights.  At that time it looked like a typical stealth bomber.  Later that night my co-worker was taking trash out and saw another one.  He said it was silent as well, but with 1 headlight, and 3 bigger lights making up the triangle, but no dome light.  We figured it might have been a new version of the stealth, but why would a stealth bomber have all those funky lights?  My co-worker and I went to the day shift this week, and today I was telling a friend at work about this encounter, and he told me an interesting story.  He said another guy told him about a girl witnessing the same craft, but she called the sheriff.  He said there was nothing to worry about, but that they had over 100 calls about the same thing that night.  Windsor is a very, very small town, and to have 100+ people report it is just mind boggling.((NUFORC Note:  We will forward this case along to the Missouri Investigators Group for follow up, and to try to find other withesses.

So then we came out to watch it and at first the light was really visible and seemed like it was moving slowly to the right and the left for awhile and then would remain stationary.  When veiwing it through the binoculars or video camera it would just bebop all around the screen even though the camera was steady.  we watched this for about 4 hours.  The video tape is amazing.  we have the object changing colors from green to red to blue and then all of a sudden stretched out and then disappears into a cresent shape and then it took a couple minutes to find it again.  then it was back doing the same thing again.

It was a clear night and at first glance I thought it was either an airplane, or better yet, maybe a satellite passing overhead.  It was neither.  It was a tiny dot of medium brightness that moved rather quickly, in a straight line, for a seemingly short distance before coming to an abrupt halt.  It remained stationary for 1-2 seconds, then darted off in a direction close to that in which I first saw it move from.  There was no accelleration.  It went from nothing to all out speed instantly, then once aqain stopped suddenly and remained motionless for another second or two.  This display of short bursts of speed, in different directions, followed by abrupt stops continued for maybe fifteen seconds, give or take, then the little dancing dot zipped away and vanished, looking somewhat like a meteor.  While this was going on, I asked if anyone saw what I was seeing, but there was no answer.  They were sound asleep.  The next morning, I told them about what I saw... and it took me quite a while to live it down.  Should have kept my mouth shut.I have no idea of the size or shape.  It was the same color and intensity as a high flying aircraft&apos;s white tail light, or a satellite.  It blended in well with the stars and I&apos;d have not even noticed it, at all, had I not happened to be looking up, in the right place, at just the right time.  If I were to hold a ruler out at arms length, while this object was darting around, it would have been viewed as performing all of its maneuvers within about a two inch square window before &apos;zipping&apos; away and vanishing.

Upon noticing this, I saw it move slowly westward towards PBIA and assumed it must be a plane. Then all of the sudden it  dropped around 500 feet straight down. I reached over to get my digital camera on the seat and kept my eyes on it at all times. Right as I was getting ready to take a picture of it, the craft shot off towards the west at incredible speed.Then 2 hours later I left PB and headed south to Lake Worth Pier to see how the Isabelle swell was hitting there. Right as I was setting up my camera to tape the surfing, I noticed the same craft in the southeastern sky at around 3000 ft up. The craft seemed to notice me when I noticed it and slowly turned away from me showing the rear or front of the craft. It then slowly faded to a small point and was gone in an instant. You&apos;d think with all the people on the beach someone else would have seen it but nobody saw anything most likely because the surf was keeping their attention. The strangest thing about both encounters was the fact that it seemed to know it had been noticed and sped away both times before I could get my camera ready.It almost seems as if they were watching the surfers or the swells coming in at our local beaches.Craft was roughly the size of a commecial airliner in length, and was obviously metallic because of the glint the sun shone off of it. No wings just a smooth cigar shaped object.Something is going on in our skies as of late, and now that it&apos;s come to my neighborhood, I&apos;ll be watching the sky a lot more and next time I will get some footage for sure.((NUFORC Note:  We will inquire as to whether the witness called the object to the attention of other bystanders.

As it slowly moved downward towards the tree line, it would would jog slightly to the left or to the right and then jog back to approximately the original downward line it was following.  These left and right shifts were irregular in terms of distance and frequency.  The greatest sideways displacement was approximately 1/8 degree.  The downward speed was not completely constant.  After a few minutes it started to fade and then completely disappeared a few degrees from the treeline.

One night, while not able to sleep, I was drawn to the window by the sound of a nearby fire alarm sounding.  While at the window, my attention was caught by a bright light in the sky.  At first I had thought that it was just a plane, but noticed that there were no blinking lights of any sort, and that it was a single white light, much too bright to be an airplane.  I watched the light move slowly across the sky in a slight wavy pattern, and then, just east of the big-dipper, increase speed, and dissapear back into space.  I was a bit confused by it and tried to figure out what this object could be.  My only thought was a low-orbit satellite.  But why would a low orbit satellite move in that pattern?  And would it be as bright as what I saw? The next day I spoke whith a few neighbors about it, and told them about what I had seen.  They all too passed it off as a satellite.  Well, the second night, I was in the window again, hoping maybe to see somthing again.  To my surprise, The same light appeared in the sky.  Same type of pattern, but a bit more north.  The only real difference was that it appeared exactly one hour prior to the time it had the day before.  At this point, noticing the time of the appearances, I thought it must be a satellite.  The next day, I again told my neighbors of it, and we arranged to all meet outside that night so that I could show them what I was seeing.  So when meeting, just as expected, it showed up in the sky, a bit more north and exactly an hour earlier.  After my neighbors had seen it, they all agreed against me that this couldn&apos;t in fact be a satellite.  The pattern, the amount of light it projected, none of it reflected a satellite.  Well, the days continued, and it moved a bit north everyday, and was exactly an hour earlier everyday.  Although, the last day it was seen, there was a change.  The first sighting was at 2:30 am, this last sighting was at 8:30 pm, on sunday the 27th of July.  I wasn&apos;t the person to see it, but my neighbor said that while she was outside, she noticed it.  This time it was still daylight, and it seemed to appear on the same path, but this time it had moved south.almost as if it was back-tracking.  She also said that directly behind it was a jet.

I leaned over towards driver and looked out his window and saw a medium green (medium-nor bright nor dim)object (about the same color as a traffic light)round object at approximately a 40-60 degrees angle in relationship to the ground.  Object was stationary and I was unable to determine size.  Best description would be that it was about 1/4 the size of a full moon when straight overhead.  Looked at object for approximately 20 seconds, looked away,(to undo my seatbelt) and then looked back for about 20 more seconds.  Object then markedely increased the light intensity enough to where I was able to see the entire landscape surrounding us including the slope of the distant mountain.  This lasted for about 3-5 seconds.  Light then &quot;shut off&quot; and object was nowhere to be seen.  I determined thea object had to be between us and the mountain (probably about halfway)due to fact that entire area between us and mountain including the slope was illuminated.  Illumination can best be described as approximately twice the brightness of full moon night on clear night.  At time of sightning, there were no clouds and weather was clear.  When light increased, I could no longer see the object, just the landscape lit up.  Landscape and surrounding area was lit up the same green color that object was seen as.  Light was not emitted as a beam or anyting like that.  It was as if someone just turned on a dim to medium light that lit up surroundings on an otherwise dark winter night.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We turned the corner of the building and right away I saw this object in the sky. It was silver and was reflecting the sunlight. As soon as I saw it I was sure it was not a airliner - it had no wings or tail. It was traveling at a slow steady speed in a straight line traveling basically from North to South. I called my neighbor out and we watched it for a good three minutes. It would at times appear to me as a disc or a saucer and at other times it looked like a cylinder. There was no sound. Nothing. It continued on it&apos;s way at the same speed on the same course across the sky until it went out of sight. It was flying a little higher than the level of commercial aircraft in our area but it was clearly not high altitude. It wasn&apos;t an incredible experience but I would like to know how something like that could fly without wings or a tail. Or Sound. Oh and one last thing there was no wind and it was traveling to fast to be a balloon.", "I saw a dark triangular shape, slowly moving at treetop level,without any sound,  There were white and red lights on the bottom that faded off then back on.

At first we both thought it was a star, however as i was driving towards the direction of the light (above Falkirk)both myself and my partner clearly saw the white light become dome shape.after about one minute of clearly seeing the object we both witnessed the light simply disappear. however it was slightly strange as the light disappeared as if the light was being extinguished from the top to the bottom.", "Car enveloped in a very high intense white light !Mass Sighting:  Tonight on September 2, 2003 I had a call from a gentleman who lives 30 minuets northwest of Barrie, Ontario.The witness reported that he and his wife were driving out of Barrie on their way home and recorded the time as being 12:29 a.m./12:30 a.m. from the clock in their vehicle. The fellows wife was driving and he was in the passengers seat. As they drove along they suddenly were enveloped in a very high intense white light. The witnesses reported that the light was coming from behind them. The husband first thought it might have been a O.P.P. cruiser with their spot lights on. But they soon realized that it was something very unusual due to the light growing in size around there vehicle and the surrounding area. Also the couple mentioned it all took place very quickly, in approximately five seconds went by before the event was over. The witness said the light was so intense that it lit up the whole hemisphere. They said from their location on the highway they had a beautiful view of the area and the whole sky was lit up. His wife who was driving looked into the outside rear mirror and observed an object coming up from behind them with three colored lights on it. (In the sky)  His wife reports that the lights were orange, red and green in color. Also they added that the white light which engulfed their vehicle was so bright that they had a very hard time seeing where they were going. Also their were a number of cars on the highway at the time and everyone hit their brakes as the witnesses noted all of the car&apos;s brake lights came on. The fellow said their had to have been some 10 or 12 vehicles on the road at this time due to the long weekend. Just as his wife glanced into the mirror and saw the three lights behind their car, there was an explosion of this bright intense light and then it disappeared. All the light was gone, and not a sound was heard throughout this whole event. They did mention to me that the vehicle&apos;s windows were rolled up and they were listening to music. After the couple arrived home and started thinking about what just took place, they wondered if an aircraft had exploded as they were trying to make some sense of what they witnessed. He told me it was a clear night so know lightening was around. The fellow said they saw some neighbors sitting outside, so he went over and asked, did any of you see that bright light? All of the neighbors said yes, and commented what the heck was it. Others who were camping around the area also witnessed it. Pilots who were on the ground at the time, saw it. Also the T.V. and radio stations were reporting it as well and a number of area residents had called in reporting they saw this very bright light which lit up the whole sky. Anyway gang, there is a lot more to come of this sighting. This is just the first of a few reports I will be making on this event. Thank you to the witnesses for their report.

As the red object became brighter, whit light pulsations were seen.  These pulsations may have been the result of its passage through clouds, estimated at some 5,000 ft.   The object was preceeded by a much smaller red object in front of it, maintaining the same degree of separation for the duration.  The objects eventually disappeared behind buildings.The sighting was very similar to that reported by us on 31 August, although in a different quadrant of the sky.I am a retired oil company executive, and my wife, who also witnessed this, is a business administrator.((NUFORC Note:  Report was, indeed, submitted from an e-address in Mexico.  Please see other similar reports from Los Angleles, and other locations, for two and three days earlier.  PD))", "A shiny, tumbling disk was seen moving slowly to the southeast.I was just heading out of town (Lompoc, CA, USA) on an overnight trip. I was driving S/E on Highway 1, when I noticed a flashing out of the corner of my eye. I looked out the driver&apos;s side window on my left, and noticed a strange disk like object that seemed to be tumbling. The flashing seemed to be from the object reflecting sunlight as it tumbled. I immediately pulled my car over to the side of the road, at the point where Jalama Beach road intersects Highway 1. This is about 8 miles S/E of Lompoc. Vandenburg air force base is about 10 miles to the west of this sighting, and extends to the north.The object eventually disappeared behind a mountain ridge, the ridge being about 1 mile S/E from my location, and perhaps 1000 feet above my vantage point. I was able to watch this object for about 5 minutes; which gave me enough time to mentally record some facts, which I&apos;ll list here:  Time: 2:25pm, August 25, 2003  Weather: fair and sunny, warm, no clouds. Wind (at ground level) was calm. Direction: object was N/E of me, moving S/E, parallel to Highway 1. Motion: object was moving slowly, possibly drifting in an upper level wind (wind was calm at ground level); moving away from Lompoc, in the general direction of Gaviota or Santa Barbara. The object never changed direction, or speed. It crossed perhaps 90 degrees of open sky over the course of 5 minutes. Size: object seemed about 1/16 inch in diameter, viewed at arm&apos;s length. Distance: object was greater than one mile away(see above). Description: object was disk shaped, with a shiny, chrome-like upper side, and a dark,  gray or black, non-reflective bottom. The shape was similar to a coin. The flashing I noticed was due to the top side reflecting sunlight as the object &quot;tumbled.&quot; No features were visible on the disk itself. The object was completely silent. Tumbling motion: at first glance, this object seemed to be slowly tumbling as it drifted to the S/E. As I looked more carefully, I noticed that the chrome-like top side remained the top side throughout each &quot;tumble.&quot; Perhaps &quot;extreme yawing and pitching&quot; would be a better term than &quot;tumble,&quot; with the disk as much as 80 degrees from horizontal at maximum. This &quot;pitching&quot; had a very regular periodicity, lasting about 2 or 3 seconds before repeating. This allowed me to see both the top(chrome-like); and bottom(dark); sides of the object, as well as its&apos; thin cross section, when seen from the side.Though the object was too far away to be sure, I strongly suspect that the actual motion of the object was a &quot;rotational precession.&quot; This is similar to what a spinning coin would do as it slowly comes to rest on the surface of a table. And like a tabletop coin, this would indicate that an upward force was acting on the object. This object was far enough away to make a positive ID difficult(A pair of binoculars would have been perfect, but I didn&apos;t have any). Still, as I watched, I mentally went through a list of what it wasn&apos;t. It definitely wasn&apos;t: an airplane, a hot-air balloon, a helicopter, a rocket launch (I&apos;ve seen many from Vandenburg), a piece of mylar scrap, a blimp, or an advertising balloon. It was also flying fairly low over private ranchland, which would make a vehicle of government origin, less likely. The only rational explanation I could think of was a child&apos;s mylar balloon, drifting in an upper level wind. However, a balloon of this type would be far too small for the distance this object was at. They&apos;re also too &quot;fat.&quot; This object was thin, like a coin. When the object was viewed edge on, it practically disappeared, with only a thin line visible. Also, remember the tumbling? A drifting balloon will remain motionless(no tumbling), as it slowly glides over the ground, since it would be in equilibrium with the prevailing air currents. Was the tumbling then caused by thermals? Probably not, since there was no altitude change, and the motion of the tumbling was quite regular(periodic). I decided, while still watching this object, that the balloon scenario was extremely unlikely. I searched this UFO database and noticed three other similar cases, oddly enough, all from this general area, one in Laguna Niguel(5/11/2003), one in Goleta(also 5/11/2003), and one in Santa Barbara(8/24/03, one day prior to my sighting). Laguna Niguel is about 150 miles S/E of here, Goleta and Santa Barbara are just down the road, S/E about 30 miles. Also of note: when viewed on a map, the direction this object was heading was exactly parallel to the Pacific coast, albeit 10 miles inland. About me: I&apos;m male, 39, 20/20 vision. I have a strong science/math background, and currently work as a teaching substitue at the local high school. I have some flight experience, having once trained as a naval aviator. I&apos;ve also studied UFO cases for many years, though I prefer to stick with cases involving policeman, military, or pilots. I never expected to see one for myself , though.", "Several dark objects traverse the moon on the night it was historically closest to the earth.I don&apos;t remember the exact date but it was the night that the MOON WAS THE CLOSEST that it will be or has been in many, many years. In fact I think they had either Dr. Sky or one of those astronomers on the radio that night to speak about how the Moon was phonomenally close that night.I have a Red Pot Bellied Telescope that I bought from Edmonds Scientific so I pulled it out and decided to take a look. I set it up in the front yard and as the moon came up in the North East, I looked at it through the telescope. It was about 2/3rds of the way up the sky well above the neighbors trees. I am guessing about *;30pm or so because it was after dinner but the housekeeper had not left yet. Since I don&apos;t remember what season it was I can&apos;t really tell the time by the darkness, but I was cold, it may have been November or December, and it was definitely dark nighttime.While I was looking at it I suddenly saw several dark things go across the moon. It took less than a minute for them to cross the whole moon and I stared at them in amazement. It happened again maybe about 20 minutes later. I I didn&apos;t report it because I surmised that it must have been something close to the earth that came through my field of view. But they didn&apos;t flap like birds, but moved smoothly and all at the same time. When I saw them again they weren&apos;t in the same exact juxtaposition amongst themselves, but I still thought it might have been something close to earth, or perhaps satellites or something.But when this guy tonight said that because they were in focus they had to be close to the moon, I decided to report it because they were in sharp focus. Several dark shapes against the brightness of the moon. And just as the guy said on the radio tonight, they would have been about the size of a pea if the moon was the size of a beach ball. But the optics on my telescope did not reveal any spherical nature, they simply looked like flat dark round or oval shapes, not all the same size because I remember my first thought was like a Momma and some baby birds, but they didn&apos;t have wings or appendages nor did they appear to flap.Did anybody else report anything that night? I am sure millions of people must have been looking at the moon that night like I was. In fact that&apos;s another reason I didn&apos;t report it because I figured if there was something there, then somebody else with a stronger telescope than I had would have reported it.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We have seen the small disk shaped ones here often, for years. These ones never seemed like such a big deal, they fly 10-15 times faster than an air plane and 5-7 times faster than a jet, they stop on a dime, turn while moving in any direction. We were use to these they almost call you in your brain when there around to get you to look up to see them. [sounds a little crazy,I know],but this is the true. But on this night,I ended up feeling as though the human race is very primitive as far as tecnolegy is concerned.I have waited this long [7 yrs.]why I dont know ,to report this I guess I feel it doesent matter one way or another if you report or not.Well! We went and sat by bon fire, the fire had gone down there was not very much flame left just a lot of rea coal.It was a little chilly so I put the front legs of my chair on the big rocks so my legs would hang over the coals, we were talking low but not real low he was telling me some secrets about my daughter and I was asking questions.out of the conor of my eye about a mile to a mile and a half across the lake and up the hill I noticed a green flash so I turned my head to look at what caught my eye by then it flashed on again and again each time it had come a quater mile closer on for 2 seconds and off for 2 seconds about 6 times in all. by this time it was about 50 yards away, and only 50 feet above the ground. I said some what loudly to my friend [what the fuck is that?]It was a very long,rectangular shaped about the lenth of a foot ball field and about quater in width the front of it was longer on the bottom than on top [about a yard or so],like a sameri sward or something.[now this is the part that concerned me]! When I said what I said to my friend, the object reacted! the front10 or 15 yards of it turned like a check mark [right and down] and looked at me!.then as the part that looked at me started to grow comming towa! rds me,as the front was getting longer the back was getting shorter at the exact point that the first part turned.staying lit now the whole time.When the front of it got right above us, a small ball of light formed,the whole object went in, as it was going in, the ball was growing bigger and bigger, until the ball was all there was [as big as a sports arena].at first I was in amaizment! then at some point I felt as if danger should be setting in and starting thinking maybe I might want to get the hell out of here!Then I realized that my feet are hanging about 2 feet above the ground,knew that I was not going to get out of this chair super fast to run in to my cottage Imoved my feet around tring to get an angle to get up and run,Ifelt as if I had to do this fast but new it wae going to be a blunder and also my friend being left there also entered my mind.but to bad I was going to go for it anyway.Just as I got an angle with my feet that I felt I had a shot.I cant explain it but I felt something say [not with my ears,I know this might sound stupid but kind of in my brain] we cant take them with out taking the fire to.[not in words but in meaning] so just for a second or two I hesatated and believe it or not it started going upward slow at first then faster,itwas out of vision in about 7 to 10 seconds.I use to feel privilged when we along with family and friends would see the small ones,but after this Ifeel kind of a lower form of spicies like we are so far behind,millions of years behind!it is some what a little depressing, one that I only at that time only 37-38 years old will never get to expereance in my life the expereances that they get to!

I was sleeping the other night and was awakened at about 2am by what sounded like glass breaking outside. I went outside for a moment and looked around but saw and heard nothing from my second story deck. Since I live in a second story pent house like appartment I wasn&apos;t overly concerned about it. It was quiet and calm with nothing going on. When I went into the kitchen to have a glass of water I saw a very bright flash of light through my dinning room windows that were covered by curtains completly. The bright light flashed for one second perhaps two at the most. Since the windows are very large and tall I opened the curtains immediatly and expected to hear a clasp of thunder within seconds, the weather at that moment was steady light drizzle and no wind at all. I STOOD THERE WAITING FOR THE THUNDER BUT IT NEVER CAME. I then noticed that the bright light had knocked out all the street lights for a two block radius. After about 30 seconds the lights slowly turned back on like they do at sundown. I was so intriged by the event that I made some coffee and stayed up for 3 more hours watching from my vantage point over the city streets and waiting for the light to happen again or a laser or some kind of power ark in the power lines but nothing moved or happened. It occured to me that my neighbor about a week ago said that he saw the entire sky turn into day for a split second at about 12:30 at night, but I just said wow that&apos;s interesting and forgot about it until now. I&apos;ve had a lot of scientific training and I can&apos;t think of what the light could have been. I&apos;m just stumped on even a hypothosis on this one. The other thing I wanted to say is that I too have seen on many occasions star-like lights that make turns at super high altitudes or blink on and off in completely clear night skies. I can imagine a rotating metalic cylindrical satelyte that reflects light from one side because it is painted black on the other, so it would appear to be blinking as it moved accross t! he sky as it rotated. I can&apos;t explain in any rational way the star like objects that I see that turn and then faid out while still very high in the sky nowhere near the horizon. There is definately something going on up there. It sure is good to have a site like this available to us where we can compare notes!", "An indescribable feeling/light felt/seen in a short instant.This is a weird one... sometime in spring of this year (I estimate March), I was awoken in the middle of the night by a strange sensation and a flash of light. This was no ordinary flash of light, mind you. In one split (micro?) second, I was awake, fully conscious, had an indescribable feeling, and saw the brightest light I have ever seen. It encompassed my entire field of vision. I later learned that a friend of mine, one block over, and another friend, while at a party in Maine, saw/felt this same thing. I posted on an internet forum afterwards (maybe the day after) about it, and others on the East Coast had seen it as well. Chilling!((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Viewed through binoculars these objects were emitting brilliant flashing rainbow lights -- predominantly red, blue, green and gold. Other stars viewed through the binoculars did not take on this appearance.  The majority of these 17 objects remained stationary.  Most of them were in the southwestern quarter of the sky near or over the Barry Goldwater military range.  A few were observed in the northwest and northern quarters.  A few were observed in north-northeastern quarter.  A few were viewed in the southern quarter.  None were observed directly overhead and all at distances too great to discern shape of object.  I only saw the lights which were only visible with the binoculars, not the naked eye, so they appeared to be very far away.  Three were observed to be moving very gradually:  one in the north moved northwest to northeast in the direction of Phoenix.  Then a pair in the south moved closer to one another as did a pair in the northwest.  Several of them formed triangles at the points of the compass.  Two finally disappeared out of visual range or below the horizon.  At one point, one in the south changed from flashing rainbow colors to brilliant purple-blue light.  I did not observe any other unusual activity in the skies.  Some aircraft flew by during these hours, yet I was completely able to identify them as conventional aircraft due to the wing lights and rapid consistent movement.  None of the rainbow objects moved that fast.

It began to move upwards in a northerly direction towards my location. As it got closer I could distinguish that the light was composed of three smaller lights in a triangular configuratiion. The light object hovered there for about five seconds then it became reduced in size at high speed and disappeared and reappeared a few times until finally disapearing for good. When it turned off and on it seemed to be breathed in and out of space. I ran in the house to turn off the oven, I looked outside again towards the southern sky and there it was again in the same location as the first sighting, to the right of Mars! It started moving upwards in the same direction as the first time. It seemed at a higher altitude than the first one. When it got almost overhead, it hovered for a few seconds before moving in a doodle like line for about a minute before moving farther in a northwest direction and doing similar movements. It then moved northbound and closer before completely disappearing into space again.", "Massive bluish colored ball of light .A call came in telling me that a dentist and friend witnessed a massive bluish colored ball of light this past Saturday night.

My wife hollered for me to come outside and look at the lights which I did.  I noticed at least 6 bright lights, 2 non-flashing white lights in front. and five red flashing lights in the back   flying to the East in a large V shaped formation, they weren&apos;t flying very high or fast and they gave off a low rumbling sound somewhat like a jet.  As the formation went over my house they suddenly broke their formation and were moving around.  The whole event was startling to witness.  One of my brothers was hollering at me to get my camera.  I told them it would not pick up the lights so there was no use trying to take a picture.  I called the Sheriffs Dept. at about 11:30 to see if any one else had reported these lights.  The dispatcher said no one else called anything in.  Then at 12:03 a.m. another formation of lights flew overhead just like the first formation, heading east and a little to the North.  We had all decided to stay outside to see what was going on at this point.

I was in highschool.  I was awakened around 3AM by a strange noise outside--A &quot;Whooo--whooo--whooo&quot; sound, fairly high-pitched.  There was a sliding glass door leading from my bedroom to the back yard.  I stepped outside.  It was a clear night and cold.  About 1/4 mile or so I saw a dics-shaped object in the sky, about 500 feet off the ground. It was hovering over a residential neighborhood, making that &quot;Whooo--whooo&quot; sound.  Suddenly, in the blink of an eye, the craft darted towards my house, as if it sensed my presense.  It scared the crap out of me.  It looked to be about 100 feet in diameter.  The craft was dark, with a band of glowing orange light around the middle.  Since it hovered over my house I got a very good look at the underside.  There were 3 half-domes of glowing bright blue light.  I gaped at the craft with a mixture of terror and awe.  The next thing I remember, I was waking in my bed the next morning.  To this day, I don&apos;t know if it was real or a dream but I have never been able to shake the image of that craft hovering over my house.  I have never had a dream that felt as real as this experience felt.

We looked south and saw a large triangular shaped object. It was moving slowly and silently above the tree tops. It appeared to be about one hundred feet in length. The object was black and had three white lights on it-one on each corner. It had a bluish light in the center. We  slowed down to watch it as it moved towards the southwest.

We stood at the deck which overlooked the lake. Mountains surround the area and it is lit by the moonlight. It was very peaceful and pleasant, no one was out at this time of night. I remember feeling safe with guy friend, then suddenly from behind the mountain, a huge, maybe 100&apos; wide flying saucer hovered into the valley like area, almost like it was hiding. It made a very swift humming sound and took over the sky. There were colorful lights twinkling on the bottom of the saucer. I was amazed, I looked over to my friend and he started running and left me there! I realized then how dark it was. The saucer had taken up the sky and the moonlight. I couldn&apos;t see the road which would lead me back up to the car. Oh my god, this guy left me! I said &quot;Wait&quot;!. Luckily, I found my way up the hill by memory, for have often visited Lake Chabot. There he was, my so called friend, taking off in his car. I was able catch him. He was very frighten, where I was more amazed. We went back to my house to share it with my roomate and she thought we were on drugs. Well, we weren&apos;t.

When I saw 3 round lights in the sky.  Within another second or so later I saw 30 lights in row forming a half circle.  The light was pretty big, it looks like it&apos;s about 4 or 5 feet in diameter.  The light was an orange bronze color.  You could see it clearly, but it wasn&apos;t bright.  I thought it was an airplane flying very low, but I was wrong. As I got closer to the light I could see the circle shape spinning counter clock wise while the lights are taking turn diming in sequence. The object was facing down at about a 30 degrees angle. The flying object looks like it&apos;s about the size of a Wal-mart supercenter. That night while I was driving, I got my windows down to enjoy the nice cool weather. As I saw the object with my eyes, I tried to listen if the object have any sound, but I didn&apos;t hear anything from it.  It was just hoovering in the sky. I was going to follow it, but it disapper as fast as it appeared.  The whole incident lasted for about 30 or 40 seconds. The sight where I saw it is normally busy with traffic during the day, but at night, it&apos;s really dead. I was the only car out there when I saw the object.

It was just after midnight. I noticed some strange flashes of light that seemed to be behind me then in the sky to my left. I was traveling at 70 MPH at the time, traffic was light. It was clear and dry.  These object were high in the sky, I would estimate 3000-4000 feet ?  As I looked more closely they began zig-zagging from one side of the highway to the other in a wide sweeping sharp motion. All this time the 3 objects were flashing and seemed to be chasing or following each other. They accelerated ahead of me , still seaming to follow the highway. They kept zig-zagging back and forth in sharp motions, NO aircraft that I ever saw could make these fast sharp-hard-left to right changes and stay airborne.  Much less 3 following each other in the same manor. The entire crafts were all plusing or flashing from back to front, after 2 to 3  minuets of observation they made  abrupt 90 degree verticle turns and headed straight up, vanishing in the nights&apos; sky.  It almost seemed like they were buzzing the highway, or observing the the many cars with  head &amp; tail lights on traveling at 65-70 MPH, along the highway.  It was hard for me to see exactly what these craft looked like because of the dark-sky and the objects were plusing off &amp; on.I can say that they didn&apos;t seem to be very big, and they seemed to be Cigar shaped vs Saucer shaped, much more rocket or missle-like. It also seemed that they were flying Very close to each other,about a ships length apart. They flew so close together it looked like they were towing each other or connected in some way.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "email report.

While standing on the beach admiring the star filled sky with 4 other family members we noticed a sphere shaped object track across the night sky. This object appeared to me metallic in nature as the light from the full moon was reflecting off of it at diffrent angles as it moved across the sky.

There was no sound Its path was from ESE to WNW. It disappeared beyond some buildings that were across the river form my vantage point. I told a co-worker that I thought that I had just seen a plane about to crash. However, it didn&apos;t look like a plane, and  there never were news reports about the object.

PD))", "Black oblong boxes, connected by what looked like a hose, silently floating at tree top level with no lights about the size of big rigsI don&apos;t remember the month or date, as it was so long ago, or the zip code for then as things have grown and changed. I have never heard of anything like this. We lived several miles from both an army and air force base and their helicopters were a constant nuisance, flying way lower than they were supposed to do. So low, I could see the faces of the pilots and it would shake my house and wake up my babies, drowning out anything I was watching on TV or radio for several minutes at a time. I would call and complain to whoever I could and they would deny they were their helicopters, as they were required to fly no lower than 1,000 feet and not over residential areas, having different flight paths, I was told. I got nowhere with stopping them. I would call when they were pounding noise over my house and tell them to hear this and tell me they weren&apos;t coming over my house, but it did no good. They only denied they knew anything about them. We lived out in a remote area, where houses were spaced out and far from town, however we had houses and an apt. building within sight of us on a lonely country road surrounded by acres of thick woods. My house was a mobile home placed on a brick basement down in a dip or hollow of the dirt road with rises of hills on either side of us. We were surrounded by woods and tall skinny trees. Aspen, birch and pine. There was nothing on the other side of the road from us and behind us but woods. We also had thick woods on either side of us, but at the top of the hills, were houses. We had a dog that was about 98% wolf and Malamute. He was big, fast and fearless. He was always barking at moose or bear that would come into our yard and was afraid of nothing and no one. We kept him leashed on our deck at night. He usually kept silent watching until an intruder would come too close and then I&apos;d hear his chain sliding across the wood before he&apos;d start barking to chase them off, pulling on his chain to give chase. He ran free in the daytime with me for protection from bear and moose as I&apos;d take the baby up the road for a stroller ride. One time he saved the life of my 1 yr old baby and myself when he lept out of the woods to get in front of her stroller to face 2 St. Banard dogs that were threatening my daughter, growling at her, inching closer to her with teeth hanging out and intentions to attack her. I didn&apos;t know what to do with her in front of me just 2 feet from those hostile dogs. Afraid to make any sudden moves. But then, there was my protector, with fangs bared, hackles raised, head lowered, long legs spread ready to pounce, and this terrible rumbling sound coming out of his throat, my dog stood his ground before them giving me time to turn around and run down the hill to my house while he tangled with them both. I thought they&apos;d kill him, but he came home unscathed and smiling, pretty happy with himself. Besides the helicopters that bothered me so much, I had interference with my TV that only got 3 channels in those early days in alaska broadcasting. The screen would suddenly get snowy and then I&apos;d hear intermittent beeping noises that were very strange and sporadic, like a code or signal of some kind. Very high pitched. If I watched the snowy screen, after awhile it seemed to form into patterns I could see somehow in conjunction with the beeps. Usually after that, the black helicoptes would come flying over my house so low I would run out and curse them, shaking my fist at them. My wolf dog would watch them, unbothered. But this one night, I was ironing while watching TV while my husband dozed in his chair and my babies slept in their rooms. The dog was out on the porch. Suddenly the TV did it&apos;s snowy beeping thing that made me mad because I was watching a movie. But while it was quiet, I heard the dog&apos;s chain sliding across the wood deck like it did when something or someone came into our yard, and then I couldn&apos;t believe my ears, as he was whining like some terrified dog next to the house wall. I had never, ever, seen or heard such behavior from him for any reason. He got louder and louder and was scratching and banging on the wall in the corner of the deck, trying to get off his leash and run away. Trying to hide for some reason. I couldn&apos;t believe this and without thinking I could be in any danger, as he would be taking on any bear or moose that could be there, I opened the door to see what could possibly be wrong with him. What in the world could be out there to make him be acting this way? This was a first and I wanted to see what would scare this brave dog. When I opened the door to tell him to stop it, I looked to my left where he was cowering without looking to my right. I was scolding him when I noticed he wasn&apos;t looking at me, but over my head, behind me, while he was trying to back himself into the corner of the house, pushing back with his front paws as he sat down with his back to the wall and nowhere else to go. Something in his eyes, the look on his face of pure terror made the hair on the back of my neck stand up and I wondered what he was seeing behind my back that I hadn&apos;t looked at when I came out on the deck. I turned around and was so shocked by what I saw that I almost fainted. I noticed at the same time that the night had taken on a very loud hush. Not a sound was to be heard and it seemed there was a heavy thick feeling in the air. The silence was profoundly loud, somehow. Total silence, giving me the sensation that time stood still or suspended as nothing but my dog moved behind me or made a sound. Everything felt slowed down somehow. Slow motion for me. Slow thinking, responses, maybe shock. And in this total silence, there hung at tree top level on the hill above my house, two oblong black boxes, just hanging there, sort of floating, not moving or making a sound. One was right at the tree top level, the other one was slightly behind it and higher. A cord of some kind connected the two boxes like a gas hose, coming down from the higher one and bending like an &quot;S&quot; to the lower one. Reminded me, in later years, of the way our airplanes refuel each other while flying. But it connected them from the back of the lower one to the front of the higher one. There was nothing discernable on or about them to say which was front or back or anything distinguishable in any way. They were smooth without anything sticking out or raised or reflecting any light. They had no lights either. They were about the size of the freight containers that big rigs pull, or bigger. Very long and square edged. They were solid, dense, black. No shine. I couldn&apos;t comprehend how these heavy looking solid huge box shaped things were defying gravity to be so silently hanging there. Just there where nothing should have been floating. It suddenly hit me that my wolf dog was still crying and trying to dig a hole thru the deck behind me to get away and I was all alone standing there facing this dangerous situation outside in the dark. I hadn&apos;t even heard him for that time in space. I felt very threatened by it. It seemed malevolent. Brooding, watching me. Caught in the act, whatever it had been doing as they floated there. I felt watched like a bug on a slide. That it would somehow grab me or hurt me any second, the longer I waited out there all alone. It was obvious my protector was not going to be protecting me this nite. No one knew I was out here, either. My hair felt like it was standing up all over my body, like electricity in the air. After staring at that for I don&apos;t know how long as I seemed too stunned to move, it was like I &quot;woke up&quot; suddenly, coming to my senses. I turned to the front door I&apos;d come out of to dash back in the house and was so afraid, I couldn&apos;t get the door to open or the knob to turn. I pounded hysterically on the door, calling to my husband to open it up as I thought it had locked behind me. All the while I pounded on the door and screamed for help, I was aware it was still hanging there to my left, watching me. I was afraid it would take me I was making so much noise, if the door didn&apos;t open. I don&apos;t know why I thought going thru that door would save me. After what seemed like an eternity of banging, the door opened and I fell in the door to the floor, yelling at him to shut the door, shut the door. He was confused, not knowing what was going on, saying the door hadn&apos;t been locked and what was wrong with me and the dog? I hurridly told him about the black oblong boxes hanging ominously outside up on the hill and he laughed at me like I&apos;d been dreaming. Maybe 15 seconds had gone by since I fell in the door and I dragged him outside to see for himself but they were gone. Completely gone. Not a trace. We went back inside, I was shaking all over, telling him over and over what I&apos;d seen. The beeping stopped on the TV and the program came back on and then the helicopters came by. I have told many people about this story, hoping to find anyone else who has seen such a strange thing but no one has. I called MUFON several years ago to ask if anyone had ever reported anything remotely similar to it, as it has bothered me for all these years since then, wondering what it was, if I had been in danger, if I had missing time. It seemed to be later when I was back in the house than when I went out there. I thought I was only out there for less than a minute, but at least 15 minutes had gone by or more when I came back in. What took my husband, who was sleeping in his chair not 5 feet from the door, so long to wake up and open the door with all the commotion I was making? Why was my wolf so terrified when nothing fazed him in his life before that? I wondered what my dog saw that I didn&apos;t or didn&apos;t remember seeing? Or what he heard or sensed that I didn&apos;t. The man that I talked to at MUFON said that around that time in Canada just a couple, or maybe a few isolated cases of black oblong or square boxes were reported, but never again or from anywhere else that he knew of. He had no clue about it anymore than I did, saying it was fairly rare. I would like to know what they were, what they were doing there, if anyone else has ever experienced anything like it or has any ideas about what we experienced. It was also strange that it was so quiet and no one else seemed to know about it. Other dogs weren&apos;t barking or whining. How did they leave so fast? I am not a good person to measure distances, but I&apos;d say the tree was maybe 4 carlengths (end to end) high, and it was maybe 5 or 6 car (van) lenghts (end to end) from my property up to the hill where the tree was where they were at. I don&apos;t know how far that measures, but they were close. And what about those black helicopters? I always thought they were associated with the military bases, but what were they doing always going over my house and that beeping on my TV?  I&apos;ve seen other things at different times in different places, but maybe I should make a different report out for each one. Thank you((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We still don&apos;t know what caused us to look up into the sky because the craft was silent and almost completely transparent and it was dark and cloudy. The craft was in a pulled triangular shape in which we were only able to see the edges. It was moving exceptionally slow and was hovering low. It pass through the sky with complete silence.

Then tonight on 9/12/03 at 11:30 there outside my apartment at in the sky. There is something going on in the sky&apos;s of Barberton,Ohio. I dont know what but it couldnt be sattelites or stars because they dont zig zag around and move. It&apos;s almost like there is some kind of security going on in the sky&apos;s because they dont move far at all. I dont know what it is but I would like to know!((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witnesses observed, but we believe that &quot;twinkling&quot; stars would be the first possibility that would have to be eliminated.

PD))", "3 bright white flashes high up in night sky and &quot;V&quot; shaped craft faint white w/round white lights silently going overhead so. to northI was out on my backyard deck watching the stars by myself, hoping to see a shooting star. My family was inside watching TV. As I sat and faced south, I noticed a sudden flash in the upper sky, way high up near the stars. It flashed a bright white that crossed the sky then was gone as suddenly as it came, like a camera flash in intensity and suddenness. I thought that was strange and kept looking to see where it had come from. It was straight ahead in the south, up at the top of the sky where I was looking. It happened again a couple of minutes later. I thought that was even stranger and called to my kids to come out and see this, but they declined. I waited, looking for something else that might happen and it happened again and this time I saw a very bright yellow/white light moving very fast from north to south way up where the light had come from. Way high up. I watched it and had a hard time keeping track of it as it moved very fast and winked out and in, gone and then showing up a few seconds later way far ahead of where it had been going. Then, as I tried to track it,I noticed that I was seeing something with the corner of my eye, the peripheal vision. It was very faint white, like the moon in the daytime sky and I could only see it out of the corner of my eye. Every time I turned to view it with my full frontal vision, it disappeared. I kept track of it&apos;s movement by looking out the corner of my eye and trying to catch it with my full vision as it moved south to north coming towards my house, altho it was very high up. I forgot about the other light as this one intrigued me. As it moved closer, it was still only visible thru periphial vision until it got right over my backyard and then my house and then I could see it was in the shape of a boomerang, longer on one end than the other of the &quot;V&quot; shape, and faint, faint white like whispy clouds look in the day sky but in a row along the &quot;V&quot; shape were round white lights. It moved very slowly and silently over my yard and house, but also very high up. I saw a jet moving across the sky with blinking lights and it was very tiny compared to the size of this thing that was moving so slowly and so high up. The jet was down much closer to earth and to me and was just a speck compared to this craft looming silently so high above us. I held up my hand to it to measure, and the faint white craft was the distance across of my thumb outstretched to my little finger if my hand was spread open. Maybe 8 inches in length. The jet that crossed way beneath it, so much closer to the earth and to me was the size of a beebee. I called for the kids to come out and see it, but they were too afraid to come see it go flying past our house and keep heading north until it was too faint to see anymore. It seemed that I should hear some sound, but there was no sound at all.  I don&apos;t know what the connection of the flashes of light were to this, but to me they seemed somehow connected. If it was that big and so far away, so high up in the heavens, how big was it?  It&apos;s funny about the flashes, too, because I saw flashes several years ago too, in a different part of Calif. I was driving home on hwy 101 and coming from Marin County to Sonoma County and I was surprised to see a bright flash of white light in the dark night coming from my right where there is no housing for miles. I remember thinking to myself, &quot;Huh. That was strange.&quot; and driving on into the night. A few minutes later, it happened again, and the weird part was, again, I thought to myself, &quot;Huh. That was strange.&quot; It happened 3 times in a row and every time, I had the same reaction as if it was the first time. Then, I thought that THAT was strange. The strangest part of all was that it seemed beyond my control to think that and keep on driving and not really turning to look at where the light flash came from. Just keep on driving. Don&apos;t look. And I did it like it was mind control. It wasn&apos;t until I got home that it all hit me as being really strange and wonder why I didn&apos;t stop to look and see where the light was coming from. It was also high up in the sky, I thought, but lower than what I saw in my back yard this time.((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

The bright shiny object is what I saw as I came into Valliant OK (Valiant is about 20-25 miles from Hugo.). It was almost, if not still. I spotted it just as I made the city limits. I tried to find a place to park where I could see the object and at the same time fumbled with my Mavica. I parked on the north side of Hwy 70, by the bank. As the camera booted up the object started to fade. It faded out of sight over about 30 seconds. I thought it might have been an airplane, but I could not see anything after it faded.As I try to figure the angle that I was looking at, the best way for me to tell you is that if 9:00 is straight forward and 12:00 it straight up then the object was at about 10:30. That would be about 50 or so degrees would it not? Then over about 12 or 15 degrees to the north, just over the top of the first building going down the business district. I have no way to judge the distance, or height, but it was about a .25 inch at arms length, and very, very bright.I know this is not much of a sighting, but after I read the story about the Hugo sighting the next day, I thought I should drop you a line. You be the judge.", "rapidly moving white light--not meteor or satellite or aircraftWe two were walking South along Mission Beach boardwalk and observed craft moving South or East.  It appeared just as a white light, approx. 1/2 the (current)magnitude of Mars and covered about 20 degrees of arc in approximately 4 seconds in a straight path.  We think it was in front of some clouds at some point, so don&apos;t think it was astronomical in nature.  Was similar to a satellite, except brighter and much too rapid (as well as for any known aircraft). On the other hand, it was  much too slow to have been a meteor.  No sound could be heard, nor navigation markers seen. Very puzzling, and I have observed the sky casually and as amateur astronomer for several decades.  Have seen missile tests in the atmosphere as well, and this didn&apos;t resemble that (also doubtful such a test would be performed so apparently close to populated area).

I was just enjoying the evening light as it was fading in the mountains and scanning the horizon.  To the Northwest at 8:50pm I saw 3 lights in a triangular formation just above the mountains: the brightness was unlike a street light that has the appearance of shards radiating from it...these lights were brilliant, clear bluishwhite and were perfectly round.  The distance would not allow me to tell if there was one object or three.  I could not believe what I was seeing, just sitting there in the distance, because I had always wanted to see a UFO.   But there was no doubt in my mind, I was fixated.  I stared at them, the lights,  for about a 2 minutes and they winked out... just gone...even though I could see nothing but 3 lights I wanted to look some more.....all of a sudden, about 2-3 minutes later there were bursts of rapid firing light (similar to anti-aircraft fire, but they had no arc to them) from the ground (they were rectangular shaped and there was about 10 - 12 of them one behind the other). I could see nothing in the direction the lights were traveling but about the time the last light reached a certain height (approximately 2 inches to the right of my original sighting if you hold a ruler at arms length) there were several objects that streaked off in about a 30-45 degree angle from where I saw the AAA lights.   It was very much like watching ships in star trek going into warp,,,,it was amazing....I called to a mechanic in the room behind me to come out,  we saw nothing but there was a jet that appeared to be of stealth origins flying low over the mountains without lights heading in the general direction of my sighting the mechanic then left.

After a minute or so I took notice of the stationary orbit of this object. I did&apos;nt think it was an airplane( or else it would&apos;ve flown on by now ) nor a helicopter. ( As I thought it was too far up for any helicopter to hover---that I&apos;m aware of.) I pointed this out to my friends and for the next half-hour or so we watched this red-lighted object slowly traveled west,northwest,north,and finally northeast before it suddenly vanished as though someone turned-off a light switch!  During its slow flight we observed this object through binoculars and we were able to see this object as a cluster of lights from a very faintly dark-colored almost-triangular shaped object. Some starlight was able to provide a slightly lighter background for us to make out this dark shape. Also during its flight, we noticed the red light dimmed at times as well as getting slightly brighter. Two other witnesses were called out and watched with curiousity and interest. We concluded this was an object we had not seen before.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

We had walked to Pike Place Market and exited out to Post Alley to go and look at some of the furniture stores. As I waited outside while my wife looked in a shop, I looked up and noticed a shiny, cylindrical object hovering over the city. It appeared to be motionless, but occasionally it would appear to rotate slightly because the quality of the sun&apos;s reflection would change on its surface. I assumed that it was a helicopter, but I couldn&apos;t see any rotor blades. My wife came out of the store and I pointed the object out to her and we watched it for around 10 minutes. It didn&apos;t move during that time. We continued walking, and we went in a few stores over the next 20 minutes and each time we came back out onto the street the object was still in the same location, still rotating slightly causing the sunlight to glint off it. At one point, we stopped to watch an aircraft fly past it and as we did, we noticed a very tiny speck of white light (which I assumed to be a satellite or perhaps the ISS going past) travel past the object and stop. We continued to walk, and when I looked up again, the dot was gone but the cylyndrical object remained. After we had observed the object for approximately a half hour, it started to slowly drift to the southeast and we lost sight of it over the tall buildings in downtown Seattle.", "3 lights spoted over Apache ReservationOn Sept. 29 2003 @ 00:17,  I was at work (hospital security) and i was sent to check the airport(runway) for debris.

I always thought aliens, Loch Ness monster, and all that crap was just a bunch of lies used for us to explain the unexplainable. Well, my thoughts changed a little more than a year ago.I was in my father&apos;s home in Baltimore, about 11 o&apos;clock at night. I was looking out the window as I always do at the street life, waiting for Saturday Night Live to come on at 11:30. I was the only one home at the time. As I was looking around, I saw a helicopter take off, very silent. It seemed much more silent than a normal helicopter...but, oh well. Anyway, as I tracked its movement I saw out in the dark of night two lights slowly making their way across the sky. I thought it was other helicopters, or planes, or anything like that. But then, the lights vanished. I looked again, and they were gone. The helicopter I saw before was making its way towards the area where the lights were, and it had turned it&apos;s search light on. Then, about...say...300 feet from where they appeared, the two lights came on again, but there was this haze around them, and they were heading away from the helicopter. But, they were going straight up in the sky. Then they went down, left, and finally went out again. I thought it was just some sort of light on the ground making this, but the helicopter was now flying as fast as it could towards the lights.I saw another helicopter off in the distance heading towards the lights, it was coming from the opposite direction of the first one. It also had its lights on. The two hazy lights returned quickly right near the second helicopter, then went away.Finally, I didn&apos;t see anything for a few minutes, but then as the helicopters were about to meet, two hazy lights that seemed to come from the ground shot up into the sky, and vanished. They looked like the two lights I had been watching. I went to the police station the next day to ask what the helicopters were going after, but they said that no helicopters took off last night. I believe firmly to this day that what I witnessed was something, and something that someone didn&apos;t want to tell me about. I also did receive about 5 calls within the next week, and when I picked up, the person on the other line hung up. On about the third call I heard someone talking to someone else when I picked up, but when I said &quot;Hello?&quot;, they hung up again.

The lights were consistent (not flashing). At first I could barely see the strange lights which seemed to be heading almost straight towards me, but as it approached I could clearly see a large (150-200 foot wide) dark-colored triangle-shaped aircraft.  I estimate it passed about 500 feet to the south of me, no more than 500 to 800 feet altitude, and traveling SW at about 700 mph (estimate based upon roughly 3 miles covered in the mere 12-15 seconds that I observed it).  It did not deviate in either speed or direction.  I was within (no more than) 1000 feet as it passed just south of me and yet it was TOTALLY silent. The ONLY visible lights were the 7 mentioned above, across the front leading edges.  There was none of the legally required (FAA and military) red and blue wing tip lights, nor flashing strobe lights.  Both the lights AND the aircraft were easy to see looking straight at it, yet would have been just as easily missed had I not been looking right at it as it approached.  I felt like this was intentional, as if to warn close conventional aircraft, but to be otherwise relatively unnoticed. It was a dark, moonless night (moonset 5:37pm the evening before) yet at the mid-point of my viewing the dark-colored aircraft was quite distinguishable against the starlight... and against the glow of the city lights. This aircraft was definitely not a B-2 Stealth or any traditional aircraft... TOTALLY silent... unusual shape and lights, and no aircraft that I&apos;m aware of could possibly fly so fast, low, and yet completely SILENT. At about 3am I called the FAA Regional Control Center in Longmont, CO, and talked with a very helpful and interested supervisor.  In addition to checking their records, he checked with DIA approach (Denver International Airport) as well as Seattle Regional Control Center:  There had been absolutely no military aircraft in the area all night, and no reports of anything out of the ordinary.  I&rsquo;m sure that this craft was flying below radar. At the suggestion of the FAA I reported the incident to the National Institute for Discovery Sciences (9-23-03) and now the National UFO Reporting Center (10-01-03). I have never seen anything even remotely like this before and hope to learn more about what it was.  I&rsquo;m not one to jump to conclusions, yet I immediately felt that the craft had to be non-terrestrial.  Even if I was to disregard the &quot;illegal&quot; lighting, we are clearly many, many years away from producing an aircraft with characteristics such as this.

He watched with me and then we both saw the light again moving just above the big dipper area. Again the light seemed to fade away. We continued watching and it again appeared but this time moving across the sky in the same general area but from a right to left pattern. My wife had stepped out about this time and saw it just befor it faded away. We then spotted it moving through the clustered stars of the milkyway again in in a right to left pattern then aburptly making what appeared to be a sharp fast U turn then travel back to the right. The light was constantly moving rapid then dissipearing. My daughter whom is 14 came outside and asked what we were looking at and my wife was telling her when the light reappeared moving left to right then in a downward motion. We watched the light for about an hour constantly fading away then returning but always in the area of the big dipper and milky way. My house faces a easterly direction. I have seen many aircraft but none at this altitude at night that you could see any light on them at that distance nor any that could move as fast or change directions as this light did.

My niece and I were playing the game Clue in my room when we were kids. She is 6 years younger than I. So, based on the fact that she was old enough to understand the game, and I was not out of elementary school yet, I believe it was 1978. It was also hot outside, so Iit had to be July or August. (I know we were out of school on summer vacation as well.) I entered the date 7/26 based on similar sightings listed at your site for Missouri. At the time, we were in my bedroom. I lived in a two story house. My bedroom window jetted out of the roof, and was on the side of the house. If you looked out it, you would see the top of the roof of the neighbors house. (These were steep pitched roofs...not flat.) We were playing and I looked up at my neice and said, &quot;your face is all red&quot;, and she said the same thing to me. We looked around and noticed the whole room was lit in red. There was no noise, and being that the window was open and we lived in the city near the Mississippi River we were accustomed to boats, trains, and airplanes form nearby Lambert Airport. So, it was unusual that if it were a red light coming from above i would have expected a helicopter noise, because whatever it was had to be flying low enough to light up my room. in fact, if you understand where my window was, it still baffles me how that much light could light up the room from that angle without it being right out the window. The next thing I remember is that her and I ran downstairs and I told my mother and my sister (her Mom) we saw a UFO as we ran out the front door to catch a glimpse from the porch. We saw nothing and heard nothing. My sister thought we had made it up until about 20 years later when my niece and I both recalled this story to her. I reported this originally to MUFON to see if they had similar experiences in St. Louis during the Summer of 1978 and they referred me to this site.

To make sure I was not dreaming, I took a few steps forward and then moved to the other side of the patio.

The object was smaller than a small aircraft but shining brightly indicating its metallic surface or something shiny on its surface reflecting the bright sunlight. The object was moving West to East at a moderate speed. The object was definitely NOT A PLANE OF ANY KNOWN COMMERCIAL SHAPE OR MAKE. IT WAS NOT A BALLON OR KITE OR A BIRD. IT WAS AN OBJECT.

I grabbed a camera and ran outside to take a picture. It was too late. The object was gone. I looked all around in the sky, it was not to be seen. There were some larger trees, and it is possible my sight of the object could have been blocked by those trees. What is interesting is that the object had suddenly appeared in my view from nowhere.

This would be looking southwest from my house; Pikes Peak on the left of the object. I observed what appeared to be a very bright PARALLELOGRAM (exactly what it looked like); yellowish glow, either moving very slowly or nearly stationary. I brought out my field glasses but could not make out any other lights; in fact, there seemed to be dark splotches scattered on it (not symmetrical, just random). Oddly, I could not really get it into focus (it was kind of shimmery), although I could focus on the visitors center (sharper but much smaller) at the top of Pikes Peak fairly easily. It was quite large in comparison to the visitors center so it seems I should have been able to see more detail. Trying to use my videocam and my digital still camera proved fruitless...I couldn&apos;t even see it in the viewfinders. It was visible for approximately two hours and appeared to move only slightly from right to left; at one point it was partly obscured by trees which is how I could detect the motion. It did not move up or down, just slowly side to side. It was an absolutely perfect parallelogram (I even looked up a photo of a parallelogram just to make sure). I made my husband come out and look; he saw it but kind of shrugged it off even though he had no explanation for it. Size-wise, using the Pikes Peak visitors center as a standard, it was at least five times larger. I believe I have seen only one other UFO in my life and that was over 25 years ago in San Diego, CA. I called a local TV station about that one (cigar-shaped with colored lights) and other people had also called in about it. I did not call any local TV stations this time (I probably will in the AM) as it was getting late.

But I didn&apos;t really think anything of it at the time so I just went home and didn&apos;t continue to watch it. And a day or so later I started hearing other people saying they had been seeing something in the sky that was a stereotypical UFO or something that would light the sky up. Additional Information:  The sighting only lasted for about two minutes, my home was only about three houses away when I saw the object so I just ran home, went inside, and didn&apos;t really think of it till I started to hear more similar stories. It was still light out, but just starting to get dark they sky was still blue though.It was roughly around pea size to nickel size to pretty much &apos;pin prick&apos; size  It was completely still when I first noticed it, that&apos;s why I thought it was just a &apos;light&apos; tower.It was a bright white light and what is odd is it stayed white. It was nothing like I had ever seen before, nothing like a plane, satellite or shooting star. Hope this helps. (Personal information deleted by HBCC UFO).

At first we thought that it was a low-flying aircraft nav light, but as it approached - quite rapidly in an arc flight path below a moderate cloud cover - it became evident that it was no aircraft.  No navigation lights, no strobe lights, no green starboard light.  We turned off the music system and the jacuzzi pump to listen for any engine noises.  There were none.  We live in a rural area where there is very little noise at night - no traffic noise at all at that time.As it approached, the red light took on a ball shape with a steady, bright white light emitted, along with the red light.  We watched it disappear beyond our house roof in a NE&apos;ly direction, always maintaining a steady, rapid flight, covering the arc of about 100 degrees in an estimated 45 seconds.I am a retired oil executive and my wife who also saw the entire event is a business administrator.", "on July 3 1997 my 2 brothers and I on our way to see the firework in san diego we saw a cigar shape going northwest it lasted a few minon July 4,1997 we were on our way to the Coronado Island for fireworks as we were going over the Coronado bridge we notice a cigar shape object going north west.

In the western sky we saw a flashing green and red light. Besides the color and the flashing it looked much like a star. We continued to walk and above of us we could see a fast cigar shaped craft flying through the sky. It had a dull orange color to it. In continued to go through the sky until we lost it behind the trees. We went inside of the house. We told my father of the experience and me and him went out with a pair of binoculars. The green red flashing star was still in the sky, but it had moved into the north-eastern sky. We used the binoculars to get a clearer view of the colors and we what we saw was a star looking light that was green. At the bottom of it was a flashing red light. My father and I dismissed it as a plane and went back inside. I came out ten minutes later to see if it was still there. It was still there, floating in the sky. My father and I continued to watch it. Over the course of 20 minutes or so it very very slowly drifted east. We continued to watch ht for another ten minutes and went back inside. I cam back out nearly half an hour later. It was still there but it had drifted into the eastern sky. It was flashing much more distinctly now. It made a flash and then vanished. My father went out later and found it back were we originally saw it with the binoculars.((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that twinkling stars would be the first possibility that would have to be ruled out.

The two oval lights then appeared to &apos;double themselve&apos; and break into four at times and become two again very quickly.  In some areas of the sky it was cloudy, but we noticed that the lights would continue on, whether they were on top of the clouds or on the clear portions of the sky, so we concluded it couldn&apos;t have been &apos;lightning&apos;. We also concluded that the sophistication of the movement patterns at times were too controlled to have been spots of lightning, as the lights would go in perfect cirles at 180 degrees from each other, and then one would catch up with the other and they appeared to almost be dancing.  The colour of these objects was white and we watched them for forty minutes, before retiring.  I don&apos;t know how much longer they were were visible after that. My friend is quite a skeptic around these matters, so for her to have seen them as well proves I wasn&apos;t &apos;seeing things&apos;.", "Glider shaped with round greenish grey orbs making the formation changes formationLooked up into night sky after bringing husband home from work saw what I thought was a kite that glowed up in the sky was that size in a triangleish stelthy looking shape.

As I watched this thing what ever it was the dim greenish grey lights moved out of its origional pattern into what I could only explain as a geese formation the V. I dont know if I was shocked by what I saw but I sat there froze till it went past the tree I was standing under.  I then asked my husband if he had seen what I had and he said no but look in the sky and there it was very far off flying towards the east like it was making a circle from the town.  At a distance it was still in the shape of the V formation but the lights then appeared to be white.", "I saw a short teardrop shape brighter than Mars with a small bright object following, with a bright letter &quot; D&quot; in the center.Don&apos;t get me wrong, I don&apos;t think this was a space ship.  I witnessed an object in the sky that was brighter than Mars.  I grabbed a low powered telescope that I own and took a closer look. It had a short round tear drop shape with five distinct trails.  The longest trail was the center, and immediately following the center trail was, what I thought to be a moon.  Several observations lead me to believe this was more than common siteing of a planet.  The first was a bright &quot;D&quot; shape in the middle extending from the top of the tear drop.  An arch extended from the center of the straight part of the letter &quot;D&quot; downward toward the bottom of the raindrop.  The other thing that grabbed my attention is the fact that the darn thing was moving.  It was everything I could do to get four good looks at the thing.  I drew a couple of pictures of what I saw, but when I went to take another look at the thing it was gone.((NUFORC Note:  We have had several similar reports from NM, AZ, and TX recently, which makes us wonder whether there may be a high-altitude, helium-filled research balloon in the skies above those states.

You suggest it was a blimp.  I&apos;m telling you it was not.  I was close enough and I watched it for well over an hour.  I have never seen a blimp maneuver like this and at the time I considered it an impossibility .  A blimp that close would have been clearly distinguishable as such. Then there was the lights, which were very unusual but consistent.Now I see you have posted another report of a sighting on the same night, about the same time in the same area.  It was viewed from a different location.  the description is very similar to mine.

Since I was driving I was only able to see it as a very white bright light, I thought at first that it had been a shooting Comet or Meteorite Because it was so big! and it was definitely very close to the City and what  seemed above the buildings. At that moment what went through my mind was &quot;Oh my God that meteorite/comet is going to hit some buildings it was really so close that I said it will hit something how could it not!

Then there was a black spot in the sky where the light had been.(No stars)", "I heard many stories ,but this time I witnessed it.It was around 11 pm ,we were just talking about everyday affairs when we were surprised by this little red ligth up in the sky ,it moved from east to west and then it just went upward and it disappeared .......", "Bright Green Oval shaped  UFO spotted.I was going outside to go look at Mars. I was looking towards the Northwest when I saw the object when It was a bright green light shaped like an oval,  moving from left to right. the Object didn&apos;t emit any sound.   I couldn&apos;t see it clearly because a big oak tree was blocking my view.   It was moving at a moderate pace, and appeared to be at least 150 feet up in the air.  I was standing about 300 feet.  It was it the sky at about a 70 degree angle from the ground, and it was gaining altitude.  Then suddenly I saw sparks emitting from the bright green object and it lost altitudes, and disappeared behind the hill/herizon. I heard dogs barking like crazy after I regain my composure, and could focus all of my senses.  I have seen UFO&apos;s before, but I was 10 the first time, and 18 the second time.  I am 25 years old.  and this is my first report.((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION WITH WITNESS))It really didn&apos;t go in a 90&apos; degree angle  I believe I said it was  a 70 degree angle when I saw it.  It climbed gradually from an 75 degree then to an 80 degree, then it gradually lost degrees,  that is when I saw the sparks.  Then it disappeared behind the hill.  I thought it might have crashed but I didn&apos;t hear any noise.   The next day, my neighbor and I took a walk in the woods behind her house, but we think it may have landed or went over the neighbors property.  I also forgot to tell you about the size.  I would say it was  double the size of the north star.((END))((NUFORC Note:  Please see report from Illinois for the same time and date.  PD))", "We saw one large craft that changed colors and later on we saw 2 other crafts that were smaller and emitted a red light.My friend and I were night fishing on Prien Lake at around 1:00am.  At 3:00am we moved from one spot to another on the other side of the lake. At about 3:30 my friend asked me to look above us, that he had been watching an object move around for the past 30 minutes and that he thought it was a star at first, but now he was positive that it wasn&apos;t.  I looked up to see a yellow light that seemed like it was getting closer.  Within about 5 minutes we started to see that it was changing colors. I had binoculars in my boat so we looked at the object through the binoculars.  The colors it was putting out were red, yellow, green, and a metallic.  The object seemed as though it was spinning.  It looked round at first, but then seemed as though it might be triangular as it got closer.  The whole time we watched the object it was moving in a way that no other craft known to me or my friend had ever moved.  It would shoot sideways(to the right) at a great amount of speed with no accelleration, just from stop to as fast as it could move sideways in 1 second.  Then it would shoot back the other direction(left) just as fast.  It would then shake a little and then shoot upward extremely fast.  After it would shoot upward, it would appear as if was floating back down, almost as if you dropped a feather and it swayed from side to side as it fell.  After watching this ship for about an hour and a half I started seeing a purple cloud around the craft.  I thought I had been starring at the object for to long and then my friend said that he needed to quit looking at the object because he was starting to see a purple ring around the object.  That is when I mentioned that I had been seeing a purple ring around the object for the past 15 minutes.  We started to realize that the object would only create a purple cloud around it when it would try to shoot upward.  After watching the object for about 2 hours we started thinking that it was maybe having a problem leaving the atmosphere.  The sky was clear(no clouds! ) and it was a full moon, so the visibility was excellent.  About 15 minutes after we discussed the possibility of it having problems, we saw another object come up from the West.  This object was smaller than the original object we were looking at and we actually thought it was some type of jet.  It was moving very fast toward the original object, but it was about a thousand feet or more lower than the first object.  This smaller object was flashing red and when it got below the first object we sighted it went from a fast speed, like that of a jet, to an extremely fast speed, faster than anything we had ever seen.  It shot across the sky about 10 miles or so in 1 second and then came to a complete stop.  The craziest thing about all of this is everytime either of the objects would move sideways or up and down, their was never any acceleration.  It was stop to as fast as it could possibly go and the human eye still see it move, with no acceleration.  There was also no sound.  The smaller object stayed in one spot for about 5 minutes, then it shot across the sky very quickly again toward the original object.  After it got below the original object, it shot up towards it and without stopping, headed South until it disappearred.  Then about 5 minutes later, another red flashing object appeared taking the same path as the last one.  Only this object would stop and go franticly as it headed to the first object we sighted. This third object moved stranger than the other two, but seemed to be the same as the second object we sighted.  It finally got underneath the first object we saw and it shot up toward it and then headed South until it disappeared.  Then suddenly both red objects came into view.  Both of them were on each side of the first object sighted, but not right by it, probably a couple of miles away on each side.  By now it was getting daylight and the two red objects were not visible anymore.  However, the first object we had spotted was still in the air.  It appearred to be further away now and kind of looked like a star bouncing around.  It was now about 8:30am and an airplane was coming in for a landing at the Lake Charles airport, which I thought had to have seen this activity on radar all night, but I later found out that they close all departments of the airport after 10:00pm.  This plane was coming in for a landing with its landing gear down and the original object that we had saw after 3:00am was starting to fade off to where we couldn&apos;t see it anymore.  Then the plane that was about to pass over us and land started to turn and eventually took off in the direction it was coming from, leaving us only to think that the airport had diverted this plane away.  At around 9:30am, my friend and I left the lake.  We both realize that we will never really know exactly what we saw, but I hope by posting this message, someone else will have some input on the same sighting that we had.  It just lasted too long and the sky was too clear for someone else not to have seen at least some of the activity.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

It was moving left across the sky very fast. Much too fast to be a plane. Planes were visible everywhere to compare the distance to the speed. The object was red with a tail at first, then slowed down eventually stopping completely. It was a steady red light, after stopping for about 15 sec it disappeared. Then the object reappeared and flew back in the direction from which it came. Nothing I know of can move that quickly, stop, and reverse itself...nothing!!

We were 17 miles off the coast of Jamestown and it was night time. The sky was extremly clear that night so i was watching for shooting stars when i noticed a bright light, very bright light coming from what seemed to be aircraft. I alerted my husband to it to see what he thought &apos;they&apos; were doing. I had thought it was a helicopter possibly looking for a person or a boat in trouble b.c the light was so bright. i went below to get binoculars and gave them to my husband since he is very familiar with the different types of aircraft. The aircraft was alone at that time, and from what i could tell had one bright light. It wasn&apos;t far from the ocean like an airplane might be. It flew at the height of what most helicopters fly when they are looking for something.What shocked me was the pattern in which it flew. It wasn&apos;t flying staight nor was it flying in a zig zag. it seemed to be flying in a circular pattern...almost as if it were going around another object. I couln&apos;t hear any noise except the waves in the ocean. We watched it til it was almost out of sight. At that point, i thought i saw another one about 90 degrees away from the original one but I am unsure.

I could tell that it was starting to get kind of light outside and I thought it would be cool to watch the sunrise since I was awake anyway. That&apos;s when I noticed in the distance just a gold shining ball. It looked like a huge gold star but I knew it was too big to be a star. So i thought it was a planet but it was moving toward me and it was getting bigger. As it got closer I could see the lights flashing on it and there were like these red and blue lights with gold lights on the bottom, the red and blue lights were on the sides. So i thought it was like some really weird fancy airplane, but it was a circle, and it just flew right by. I am really scared right now...I sat there and told myself it was a plane and to forget about it but I cant.

I tried to get comfortable noting that the time was 1:09 A.M.. Laying and looking out of my window I noted the sound of what I thought was a helicopter approaching.  It is not an unusual occurance for medi-vac copters to have a flight path to the Everett Hospital.  The noise which sounded like copter blades creating a pressure wave vibrated my house some what.  The sound increased and then remained over head. There was not a shift in the pitch of the sound indicating movement.  I became somewhat irritated and thought to myself, &quot;why arent they moving the helicopter&quot;.  My second thought was that if may be a sheriffs dispatched helicopter.  The sound persisted approximately 5 min.  At that point I decided I needed to check out what the source was.  There was then a bright flash that eminated from outside and lit my room up and caused a temporary power outage.  At the same time of the light flash the sound instantly subsided completely going silent.  My electric fan and digital clock powered down and then came back up.  I then jumped from my bed and went to the southern window of my room and was looking east to the alley way and noticed that our alley light was at a low glow.  I assumed that the momentary power outage caused the pud alley light to shut off (or the bright flash trip the optical light sensor).

I saw in the eastern sky, looking from Port Coquitlam B.C., a very large green light streak across the sky.It traveled from north to south with a large tail. It moved very fast and appeared to start quite high and was traveling in a downward motion. If you have any info on this I would love to find out what the heck it was.... The green light I saw appeared to be quite high as it seemed to be behind some late evening light cloud cover. It moved very fast,perhaps about a two second sighting. It also had a very long tail. I didn&apos;t think it was a flare or fireworks because it originated so high in the sky and arced towards the ground. Unfortunately I was alone at the time and have no verification. The green ball itself was quite large. Perhaps it was a flare of some sort, but it did not look or act like any flare I have ever seen. Thanks again for your quick response  Thank-you.

As it&rsquo;s been getting dark earlier, we decided to jog through our own neighborhood. At about 8:30pm we were heading west down Old College Way. I glanced up and saw a panel of lights almost directly overhead. It was moving slowly and silently from west to east. It seemed to be approximately 1000-2000 feet off the ground. There was no erratic movement at all. After a few seconds the lights dimmed out, almost as if they had sensed me watching. The sky was very clear and once the lights went out, I could not make out any dark silhouette. My wife had not looked up in time to witness anything, but suggested maybe I saw a shooting star. As we looked at the sky, a small private jet went overhead, heading almost due north. It was quite audible and its black silhouette was easily identifiable. It did not appear to be chasing or even aware of the lights. My wife repeated that it must have been a shooting star. However, the lights were very clearly defined. They were three horizontal rows of six lights each. The lights were perfectly round and almost looked light a panel of stadium lights floating in the sky. They were very 3-D looking. They appeared to be angled over the ground at about a 30 to 45 degree angle. There was a definite dark shadow behind the lights like a short, stubby cigar, though the lights themselves seemed to be flat on the same plane. My most immediate thought was that I was looking at the Goodyear Blimp, but the moment the lights dimmed out, the black shape vanished as well. From my experience at football games, I have been able to hear the blimp even over the crowd noise. Whatever this was, was dead silent. The image I have included is a rendering in Photoshop of what I saw.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length via telephone with this witness, and we found him to be exceptionally lucid, objective, and credible.  We have invited his wife, who also saw the object briefly,  to submit a report, as well.  The witness was certain, he said, that the object was not any type of blimp.

Better late than never.  I remember this incident well because it was the evening of our 21st wedding anniversary.  My wife and I arrived home after dinner and we were walking around inside our house checking on our two children when we heard a rumbling noise in the sky near our house.  We live in one of the highest locations in the city and the evening was quiet.  The rumbling - similar to a jet engine - would last for about 10 seconds or so and then abruptly stop.  The noise got progressively louder so that it got my attention, and I walked outside but could see nothing.  The area around the house is wooded and our view of the sky to the north and east is obscured.  By the time I walked outside, the noise was continuing at regular intervals but was fading into the distance.  The &quot;jet&quot; noise sounded similar to the blast of the propane engines that are used to heat hot air balloons.  The city does have a hot air balloon festival that takes place in late August.  However, no balloonist in his right mind would fly at night, and there were many sightings of something strange, to go along with the many people who, like us, heard but did not see anything.

First thought was they were mylar ballons, but the perfect formation, then the change to a &quot;V&quot; made us wonder. They were not moving much, like you would expect from a formation of planes, from their position, but hovering. Then 2 of the dots started moving in slow broad circles around the others. After this, they started to split up, slowly, and seemed to go higher and less distinct.

The area I live in is very quiet, so it was unusual to hear an airplane, especially one loud enough to wake me up.  I went to the window to look outside (my bedroom faces west) and I saw a bright light in the sky.  It seemed too large to be a star and it wasn&apos;t moving like an airplane.

The planes I&apos;ve watched since then don&apos;t stay stationary that long and they fly across the sky along a particular route.  I don&apos;t know how long helicopters can remain stationary, but the object I saw seemed too high in the sky to be a helicopter.  I have also checked to see if there are other lights in the same area that I may have misinterpreted for this object, but all of the lights that I have seen (from houses and buildings)are much lower in the sky than the object I saw.

I&apos;ve been always looking towards the skies, this was sighting was a bit startling and came at a surprise.  I&apos;ve always been a skeptic and keep an open mind.

From our perspective the lights we had noticed we just two white lights, unlike an airplane lights these lights were not constantly on, they were blinking on and off. So from our sight through our windshield, the pattern of the blinking was from left to right, on and off.  I had mentioned to my wife, the lights were odd because they were quite bright. In the area, we have a lot of low flying small aircraft such as single prop planes and so forth, in addition O&apos;hare has a flight path coming in from the Northwest, but our distant from the airport is 40 miles out. So this would be impossible, because we had noticed the air traffic to our Northwest at a much higher altitude.  As we were traveling Northbound on Rt 12, we were headed toward the object. I started to panic because one of the feelings of amazement and the altitude was very low perhaps 1000 ft at best. As we had past underneath the object, I had nearly crashed the car because I was checking the local traffic around me to see if they were viewing the same object. I had rolled down the window and looked up to see that there was no sound, the lights I had saw were three white lights also one green and red in addition.  The white lights were position on each end of a perfect triangle. The red and green were somewhere on the object but can&apos;t make out exactly where. The object was flying quite slow, I couldn&apos;t make out a body because it was pitch black as far as a craft. The object was flying was as a backwards triangle, meaning the third light was positioned on the back. I wish I could have pulled over, but due to traffic. I could not.

I sometimes have sensations in peripheral vision like small bursts of light, or meteors/&quot;falling stars&quot;, but this never happens when I&apos;m looking directly at the area where these occur.  On one occasion, I was watching the &quot;star&quot; closest to overhead, when I noticed another light with peripheral vision that had not been there before.  Unlike the lights I&apos;d been watching, this one moved in a straight line, &amp; I assumed it was a plane, but it suddenly disappeared.", "4 big bright lights hovering over Stanford university area...changing formation...top one arched away and disappeared. Seen from 280 freeway going south by my husband...he called me and I grabbed my camera jumper in the car and viewed them (orange) driving north. Sadly no film in camera. I saw them orange...my husband white. Maybe because sun was setting and viewed from different directions 20 minuets apart. copters and planes near ...many people must of seen as cars were slowing on the freeway and people were out of there cars on side roads viewing. When I turned on my camera I got a good shock&hellip;that never happened before.", "7 spheres in a formatin hovered above us, traveled at a high rate of speed,changed colorMy wife and I where walking in the park. The park had tall trees. Then the sun was blocked off, like a cloud had passed over head. We looked up, because it was a clear sunny day, with no clouds. We saw large sphers over the top of us. They were blocking the sun. My wife said, go get the camera. I ran to the car to get the camera. I turned and looked up to see the sphers, which had a light gray bottom, move to the north, out over Lake Ontario. They stoped at the edge of the lake. The bottoms changed color to the same color of the lake, light blue. there were 7 of them about 200&apos; to 300&apos; in Dia. They were in a formation that they kept when they moved. Two in front, with 3 behind and 2 to the right side ot the formation. As I was trying to take a photo, they moved at a very very high speed straight out over the water. I would say they were no more then 150&apos; above the water. Then the sphere that was at the right rear moved at a 90 degree angle and went East along the lake shore. They main groop went straught north out over the lake. They were moving at a very high rate of speed and was gone in a second. They made no sound and had no lights on them.I have never reported this to anyone before. I watched the newspapers to see if anyone had reported this incounter. My wife and I decided not to say anything to any law inforcement agency as they would not beleive us. Years later I was in a book store and picked up a book on UFOs. In the book there was a photo of 7 spheres in the formation I and several other people had seen back on that 4th of July 1975", "On 09/11/03 about 21:00 Hrs Ca time 3 star like obj at hi altitude travel acrosss sky from south to north within moments of eachother.I live in an area where we have no street lamps. On several occassions during the past six years about this time of season I have seen  what almost could be mistaken for a tiny star in the nights&apos; sky. Except that it is moving across the sky at a very good rate of speed. It&apos;s direction is coming from the South and moving North and sometimes South to Northeast or so. In the past I was by myself when I viewed these things. My thoughts were that it was a possible sattlelite, but on one occassion two or three years back I saw one of these do a tight zig zag pattern as it passed over head. Anyway I had a hunch that tonight I might see one of these Traveling Stars as I began talking to my thirteen year old daughter about my previous sightings. I guess as the conversation tappered off we began to look up into the night sky. It was a clear night. No fog maybe some slight haze and a full moon rising but low enough not to interfere . It was dark in our back yard and we were in the hot tub looking up when by chance my daughter spotted what I had described to her just moments before. So we got very exicited I thought once again that may be it&apos;s a satalite. We watched it pass and as it was passing I was yelling to my wife inside the house to come outside and get a look at this thing. I wear glasses and my wife wears glasses but my thirteen year old who spotted it has twenty - twenty. My wife did not make it outside in time. It probably took about fifteen seconds from time of spotting till it crossed over going North till it was far from sight. My daughter asked if it could be a UFO and I said I don&apos;t know for sure. It was a school night(09-11-03_ about 21:00)and she after seeing this wanted to go inside.I do not know my GPS location on the map but if this helps I&apos;m located about 40 miles south of San Francisco, California which is SFO= 37deg/37&apos;/5&quot; North-----122deg/22&apos;/22&quot; West  Note: One of my previous sightings I called Lick Observatory and inquired about Satalites crossing overhead for the time/date or UFO reports but did not get any definitive answer.Continued: I was now alone and looking up gazing around and was wondering if my wife and I would have some quite time in the hot tub and would&apos;nt it be neat to see some more when there it was again another little star like object traveling probably the same path as the previous one did. I yelled out to my wife and she was near by this time and she came out side with her glasses and I pointed to the proximity in the sky directly over head now and her eyes found the object in the sky and it too went out of sight. A third passed over in the same fashion except it sort of skewed it&apos;s course just as it crossed over our area. It&apos;s direction headed sort of North by Northeast once it passed over us. Now during that time on the cordless my wife called her sister whom lives in Sunnyvale about 6 - 7 miles North from us and my wife tells me that her sister went outside and she also had a chance to catch a view. But I&apos;m not sure if she saw what we were seeing because she mentioned to my wife that she saw them moving and line up and that there were 4 of them.Decription: These things which I was seeing looked like a tiny greenish stars. It seemed to be very very high in the sky (may be 60 to 100 miles out). Not like a B1 or B52 bomber or jet airliner at 35,000 feet. This was much higher like sputnik or the Space Station which fell to earth some years back.My Thoughts: Some kind of controlled satalite or UFO.", "A brilliant bright light with a slight green glow .Brian,  My friend (name deleted by HBCC UFO) sent me your message after I told him about something I had seen early Sunday Aug. 31st around 12:30 am.  We have a home on Picnic Island in Honey Harbour, Ontario.  At 12:30 AM my daughter and I were out for a short walk when the entire park lit up with a brilliant bright light.  The light had a slight green glow to it and I thought it was a car coming up the road with strange headlights until I turned around and noticed an orange/green ball of light above our heads.  As soon as we looked at it, it exploded directly above the trees beside us, when it exploded it was like a firework exploding in all directions with orange balls of fire.  I did hear a sound that is hard to explain, I believe what we saw was a bolide.  I spoke to several people around the park who had seen it and everyone saw a ball of light explode and several heard the explosion.  None of us saw any coloured lights on the object. I hope this helps your investigation. I would like to thank the witness for their report. Witnesses personal information deleted from this email.

We were halfway there,and saw a very large triangular shaped craft,with 3 bright white lights at each end, the lights did not blink or flash. The craft was just above the car and was moving at about the same speed as I was about 35mph. It was going the same direction also. We arrived to my home, and hurried up and was going to look at the craft from the back porch,we ran from the car inside one door and my friend ran out the back door to look at the craft closer. I did not make it to the back porch,because I heard a strange noise coming from my bathroom. My hairdryer was running on high speed. I had not been home since 3pm that day,it was now around 11:30pm. And I have never left my hairdryer of all things on and running. No one else had been to my home and the door was still locked as I left it. I remember turning my hairdryer off and then meeting my friend back in the kitchen area where my back porch door was located. I do not remember what happend after that. Recently, in May of 03, i discussed this with my friend and she did not remember the whole occurence. I had to keep talking about it with her over and over..and she still isnt sure if it even happend or not. Im not sure if time was lost or not,if it was,then it wasnt that long.Prior to this incident, I would see from time to time red lights coming from outside of my windows at night time,and my neighbors told me it was probably hunters. But once there was a very bright light prior also to this sighting coming in all windows of my downstairs. My friend told me she did not turn any lights on that the lights were coming in the windows from the outside,and she was so scared she covered her head up and would never stay there again. I have since moved away from that area and the house had been torn down.((NUFORC Note:  Date in June 1999 is approximate.  PD))", "I sent this in the other day tothe national reporting site as well....My brothers and I and other friends have saw ufo&apos;s in the area over the years. What started it for me was in 1967 or 68 in june I saw a large disc tree top high at about 15 mph .It was about 250ft around.and I could see the writing of some kind on the craft .I was in my dads yard and the ufo flew just over the trees across the road -my dad was under his car and dident come uot to see it when I yelled look.So I went to see if anyone nextstore saw it.Thay had there backs to it hanging cloyhs on the line... &quot;However they saw me&quot; about 9/2/03 I saw on the history channel that the cattel mutalations started in about 1967.And they say that it is lasers that make those clean cuts. And back then there was no laser or portable ones.1967 in late june I was 8 year old-- this was after I saw the ufo--I was playing alone in the woods just behind the house for a while. Then I came to the front of the yard to see we had company--My dads sister and boys my age --they went to the treehouse--so I to went to find them --I went up the tree into the the treehouse --5 minits or so later I noticed my right leg felt funny --So I went back down to the house to my bedroom and pulled down my long leg bluejeans --with no cut in them--or no blood on them --I looked at my leg and I had a 6 inch long cut a inch and a half deep--still not bleeding--and no pain --I went to show my mom to take me to the doctor and have it sticked up--She said what happend --and I said I don&apos;t no-- But it is a laser cut made by that ufo I saw.1968 in june agin--I was with one of my 3 brothers picking blackbarrys with the family dog. This time we where accross the road from my dads house direcly under the path of the ufo I saw the year befor.  I said to my brother --I found more barrys over here so we went deeper into the woods and never seemed to find the barrrys --We thought we got lost--We got picked up by a ufo and they took us to a place and dropped us off--We think-- WE saw pine trees with snow on the branches ? --The next thing we no we found areselfs inside of a hourse fence a mile from home.--there is no way we could have walked there without crossing a tar road and 2 dirt roads. We did not cross any roads lost in the woods to get there. Thats where they dropped us off. We new right what had just happend. Also we don&apos;t remember when we lost the family dog. but the dog was at home.1976 trapping season my same brother went to cheak our trap line in back of the house--with a friend they dident go far--on a hay feild at dusc they heard a crashing noise like branches braking--They stopped and saw a dark image of a small ufo come right out of the forest and stop at the feild --then it started to glow and they ran and got me and we all went back to the spot --we took a gun with --We dident see anything at frst so we went farther back to a tree line dividing 2 feilds--At the end of the next feild we could see a red object that flew in the night sky slowly over the trees --the light would go out--and when it came back on it was forward and down from where it was--and when the light went out agin and came back on it was back and up from where it just was--and we could see the tree tops lighting up under it --like it was taking picturs 1999 I was at my dads cabin in atkin MN with my family of 3 and we slept in a camper in the yard that stay.after we left my dad called me to say there was 3 dark rings in the grass in the most open part of the yard.He said they where not there untill we stayed over the weekend((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "3 Orange Orbs Over S Pinal CountyI am ((age deleted--young)), a ((specialty deleted)) technician at Evergreen Air Center.  While that doesn&apos;t hardly justify me as a credible witness, I&apos;ve been around aircraft all my life.  I work at an air station where we see everything from Cessnas to B757s.  It is my opinion that what I have seen is either not man-made or not conventionally identified per FAA regulations and as such should have been forced to land for their altitude was far greater than 500 feet.  So, to the incident...  I was talking to my mother outside while she watered plants in the front yard when I noticed a single orange light.  It didn&apos;t dawn on me that it was there until it instantly disappeared.  When I commented on it she turned around and suddenly 3 orange orbs appeared.  I could not gauge the distance except to say that we live 8 miles to the east of I-10 and these were hovering over the valley and north of Evergreen, where I work, which is 3 miles west of I-10.  As we watched they disappeared one by one.  I was tempted to get a camera, tried to get my father to see them but he was unavailable.  They disappeared after only 2 minutes.  I did not see any signs that they were man made aircraft.  They did not have strobe lights.  I heard no sound, but since I&apos;m assuming they were at least 11 miles away I probably would not have heard a helicopter from that distance.  However, I have ruled out helicopters because if the lights had been spots, they did not go out gradually as if turning, and given the distance spots would not be focused 11 miles away, they would be focused downward, and finally why would 3 be focused in my direction.  Given the apparent distance and their apparent separation of 1 to 2 miles from each other, I would surmise that they would have to be purposely focusing on my house.  Not a likely prospect. Hence, they were not spots but simply bright lights.  But as the lights went out, I should have seen the strobes.  Also, the objects seemed to disappear in correlation with known man-made aircraft entering the same airspac! e.  Incidentally, it was a near full moon. This was the first of two sightings, but I&apos;ll file a follow up for the second.((NUFORC Note:  Date indicated is approximate.  Please see other report.  PD))", "Perfectly round,perfectly silent,consistent in speed,moved smoothly and disappeared quickly.The sky was clear,and brightly moonlit,in the Mission District,SF. The craft moved slowly into view from beneath the area of the moon.It was perfectly silent and somewhat small.It appeared metallic,however of such a quality that it seemed translucent.There were no lights,no evidence of fuel combustion,no trail. It moved very slowly in the direction of the coastline,coming into view,going by,moving past,then finally disappearing.I knew it was round because the moonlight caught it on it&apos;s side,accentuating it&apos;s round shape. Amazing.", "teardrop shaped craft with 3 steady lights underneathI was in my friend&apos;s bedroom about 11 p.m. when we heard a loud whirling sound(not too loud, maybe as loud as an airplane).  The sound was unlike any we had ever heard. It was a whirling sound almost like the sound of air vibrating when you are spinning something very fast.  I saw three steady lights through the blinds in her window. I looked out the window and saw a white air craft that was narrow on one end and got wider towards the other end, kind of like a teardrop.  On the bottom of the craft were 3 steady lights in a triangular shape.  They didn&apos;t blink or change color or anything like that.  The sides of it appeared to be blue.  It was kind of hovering outside the window and then started moving slowly to the right.  I Only looked at it for a few seconds and told my friend that it was a blimp.  She didn&apos;t believe that it was a blimp because of the sound she heard.  She looked out the window about two seconds after I moved away from it and she couldn&apos;t see it but we still heard it.  She immediatley ran outside hoping to get a glimpse of it but it was no where in sight even though she could still here it. I don&apos;t know what I saw.  But I do know that it was not an airplane because it did not have any wings, it was not a helicopter because there were no propellers and nothing underneath the craft other than the lights on its bottom. And we figure that it was not a blimp because as I said there was nothing underneath it other than the lights and blimps do not advertise at 11p.m. Also the sound was not like that of a helicopter or airplane.  I know what airplanes sound like I live near the airport, and this was no airplane. I&apos;d like to know if anyone else has seen this or has some other explanation.", "Blinking red and green lights.My friend was sitting outside, and he told me to come look. I went outside and he pointed out a bright light that was blinking red and green in the sky.I figured it was just a plane or something and went back inside. After everyone went back to bed I went outside to look at it again, this time it was in a different spot. I watched it and it didnt seem to move at all it just blinked red and green still. I watched it closer, then it shot to the side about 2 inches, then went straight back, and started moving in a very small circle.  now every night its out there and lately I&apos;ve seen 17 of the blinking lights and only 2 of them move.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We suspect that twinkling stars would have to be ruled out, before we could conclude that the witnesses observed genuine UFO&apos;s.

We hope we are not wasting anyone&apos;s time, probably something simple.", "Triangle, moving south from the north, not moving very fast,  I was completely sober and my wife saw it too.Tonight at about 2315, my wife and I saw a triangle-shaped ufo flying in a southerly direction just west of Frisco, TX. There was no sound coming from it at all and it did not seem to be moving very fast but fast enough to be gone when I tried to find our camcorder. It had lights that just seemed to glow, not beam like a normal aircraft. There were 10 or 12 lights on this object. This was a ufo. I spent time in the navy working on aircraft on the flightdeck of the USS Eisenhower and have seen planes flying in formation at night, and this was definitely not normal aircraft. I guarantee you that I am not the only one that saw this. You will probably get other emails about this too.", "the craft in the sky is like a spinning orb with its lights of red, yellow, and green.As you kmow-it is pretty dark at 3:30 am.  What caught my eye was i looked out living room window (on fourth floor of apartment building) and saw a round shape in the distance just sitting there - flashes of red, yellow, and green.  I woke my husband and asked him to look to so I was sure i was seeing what i was.  it looks like a spinning orb as the lights pass, however it is in distance.  My husband was passing it off as star clusters.  But as i sit here now and look at it - it still peeks my curiosity.  We live in flight pattern for newark airport- and i am used to seeing helicopetrs hover and plane lights - but never have i seen anything like this.sometimes the white is really bright and then fades- but its just hovering.  I wish someone could tell me what this is.", "reddish orange lights over Palo Verde Nuclear Plant following a vehicle with new technology.I am writing this because I have read several reports about these same objects on your site.The lights we witnessed were first spotted coming over the Palo Verde Nuclear plant coming in from the west around 20;00. At this time the two lights were glowing a deep reddish orange (very scary). The lights would turn on and off silently. No other identifiable lights and behavior ruled out airplanes and baloons.  These objects  continued on an easternly path directly toward Phoenix.  As we drove through Phoenix on I-10 the lights again reappeared south of Phoenix, as we headed towards Tucson. Now the lights changed to a bright solid yellow, in formation,and turning off and on.As we approached a small town or suburb, to the east these two objects hung in the sky, over the town and this time they were metallic gold and round in shape. They reflected light and appeared to be metallic.  They also lit up the entire sky around them and you could see the clouds above (high ceiling) and were certainly very visible from the ground. You could not miss them.  We had been traveling 70 mph or better on the interstate and the lights not only kept up the pace but were ahead of us and waiting?  The lights then turned again to bright yellow and continued their turning off and on wobbly manuevers as we headed towards Tucson. Then just as we were about to reach the first lights north of Tucson (suburb) the lights turned towards the southwest and disappeared out over the Papago indian reservation and towards the Kitt Peak area.My husband is the second witness.  We were on our way from Seattle,Wa. to a place in New Mexico with a device involved with new technology.  The lights were a bit un-nerving as well as the length of time.  I am estimating it to be four hours or so.I wish I had reported this at the time but I could not do so.  Now I can.", "We were all celebrating a birthday party on the lake, between Northport Wa. and Colville Wa. There were about 25-30 people who all witnessed this event and also others that were staying at the lake. It seemed to have caught the attention of all that were outside. suddenly high in the sky a bright blue ball of light came streaking across the sky. It turned from blue to orange then green and left a trail of light like something burning in the sky. the trail of light seemed to have lasted for about ten to fifteen minutes. None of us of all ages have ever seen anything like it and left us all wondering what the heck it was. We all thought maybe a satelite burning up in the atmosphere. we all thought for sure we would hear something 0n the news or papers but nobody has heard anything as to what it was.((NUFORC Note:  Witness states that event occurred on Sunday morning, August 31, at between midnight and 01:00 hrs.", "Bright shining object over Porland ORAs i was leaving Portland heading south on the Amtrak train looking out the window to the southwest, I noticed a bright silver light high in the sky (to the southwest).  At first I thought it was a refraction of the setting sunlight on an imperfection in the window glass of the train, but as i changed my perspective it became obvious that I was looking at something very high in altitude, directly over the hills south of Portland.  Whether it was in motion or not I couldnt tell due to the motion of the train and its apparent distance. If it was moving, it was travelling very slowly. To me it appeared to be still..but as i said, i was in a moving train.  It was close enough to tell that it was NOT an airplane, but too far and to bright to make out any shape.  Just looked like a silver object brightly reflecting the sun.  I was watching it, trying to figure out if it could be a balloon, sattelite, or some other type of high altitude craft, when it just dissapeared. Not faded, not accellerated and left...just gone. The oddest thing was that it seemed to stop reflecting sunlight and turn a creamy orange-white color just an instant before it vanished.

She said it was hovering ~ I said, no way..and laffed.  As I began to enter the bend in the road prior to the highway, it was directly over top of us.  There were four lights, with the two on the outsides being slightly the largest.  I could not see a shape  of the object, per say, because the lights were so bright and it was so close.  I told her I was stopping the van when I got out of the curve, right at the highway intersection.  By this time, it was obvious that the object was in fact hovering, b/c i had to look &apos;behind me&apos;, thru the back van window and also in the driver&apos;s side window to see it.  It was still up there.  I said, &quot;Let&apos;s get out&quot;.  As I unlocked the doors, I was watching it out of the corner of my eye (I had my head turned slightly left looking out the back side window at it.  We both jumped out of the van.  The very second I turned, it was absolutely and completely GONE.  (This thing was SO CLOSE to the ground, that the lights were almost blinding to look into.  I would have compared the lights on it to vehicle lights, maybe 4 car lengths ahead coming toward us.  It was, however, considerably wider). We literally jumped back into the van, and went into town (it was 8:40 when we arrived at the store, b/c the lady told us she got off at 9PM, in 20 minutes).  We got our few groceries, came back, &lt;still saying NO WAY&gt;, and returned home not seeing it (about 7 min from the store.)  Maybe because of my work background, I told her let&apos;s not discuss what it looked like, lets both go home and draw it.  We did.  It was the same thing.  I still have the drawings.  It was UNreal.  She and my husband and I went back out about 15-20 min later and reinacted it as closely as possible.  I turned on all lights in the van, at the area &apos;it&apos; was seen inust to prove to myself that it was not reflection! from inside the van.  She lit a cigarette, that wasn&apos;t the 4 lights.  Nothing made those lights appear again.  This was a craft of some type.  I could just &apos;sense&apos; it was hovering (well, how else could it be suspended in the sky so close to the ground unless it was in fact a craft, hovering?????)  We are still &apos;anxious&apos;, for lack of better word, still not believing that we saw this odd looking thing.   Both of us continue to say, &quot;This can NOT be for real!&quot;  But it is.

Only when it was right above us did we hear a slight humming sound.  Could not make out shape, but was 6-10 lights in a triangular formation, moving slowly.

At first i thought it was a couple of airplanes, but they were moving in perfect harmony, and had no blinking lights. I then saw a fainter, less red light, about 3 or for fist lengths from the other two, forming a triangular shape with the other two. I thought i could almost make out the outline, but there was no moon, and the sky was incredibly dark. I watched it for about 2 minutes, until my vision got blurry from eyestrain, so i closed them for a few seconds, trying to rest them, and when i looked up again, the thing was gone.

Two (2) saucer-shaped, glowing green objects and one (1) brilliantly glowing sphere gliding over the lake.My father, mother, sister and I had just finished dinner. When my sister, who left the table first, went to the front part of the house, yelled suddenly &quot;Mom, Dad - look out over the lake.&quot;  When we heard that, we rose from the table and looked out the kitchen windows.  We observed two (2) saucer shaped objects over the boat landing area, which was located approximately one-quarter of a mile away.  They had a light green aura.  My sister and I ran out behind the house and up the hill to observe from a better vantage point.  When we turned back around to look at the objects, we noticed a third object over the water of the lake, which appeared to be approximately three hundred (300) to three hundred and fifty (350) yards away.  It&apos;s appearance was that of a sphere of approximately ten (10) yards in diameter, that was glowing from within with an intense, pure, bright white light which reflected off the water and tree tops.  The third craft moved slowly in a south-easterly direction at approximately five (5) miles per hour, crossing from the water onto the land and above the trees.  Meanwhile, our attention was recaptured by the two (2) saucer-shaped objects.  While my sister and I were observing the crafts and concentrating on them intently, I noticed that cloud-like formations appeared flanking the objects.  Both craft then seemed to move within the cloud-like formations.  One of the objects and it&apos;s accompanying cloud-like formation faded from sight over a period of approximately five to seven seconds.  The other cloud-like formation was at this point still visible.  Shortly after the first cloud disappeared, the remaining vessel emerged halfway from the cloud-like formation, as if to be playing &apos;peek-a-boo&apos;.  Then I suddenly felt a shiver throughout my entire body, and began wondering where the first craft had disappeared to, and if it were behind me.  I turned to look and there was nothing there.  That was when I realized that I was dealing with something that was beyond my experience. ! We both ran back down the hill and into the house.  When we looked back out the window, there was nothing there.

I noticed it too and since we were at a concert I had a monocular.  I used it to look closer and saw a totally black triangular object that appeared to be at least a thousand feet or more above ground.  My daughter, her sister and my wife each eventually looked at the object through the monocular.  My wife who is a pilot insists that it was not like any flying object she has ever seen. Each of us took turns the next day drawing a picture of what we saw. Without any help from each other we all drew the same item. There were no lights (on the object) and no reflection from the sun.  The object eventually became impossible to see as the sun went down. It made no noise.", "9/24/03   BklynN.Y.  sphere  less than 2 seconds. object moved at speed of meteor. stopped and made a left turn an dissappearedWhile star gazing on my porch last week hoping to see a meteor or sattelite pass by.After about 10 min. I see what I think is a shooting star or meteor cross the sky. My eyes instinctly followed it. But to my surprise it stopped as fast as it shot across the sky.Then it made a left turn and dissappeared.  I told this to many people. All were very good to listen and not make fun. I&apos;ve seen numerous meteors in my life but never did I see them stop and make a left turn. The approximate position of this ufo was going  northwest from over Brooklyn N.Y. at approx. 2:40 am.  Then after it stopped which I would estimate was over northern New Jersey then turned going west or south west.

The orange light appeared again as well. I am certain that at least 20-30 travelers on the GSP saw what I saw as we all slowed down to see what was going on. There wasnt any sound associated with these lights but they were nothing I have ever seen in my 38 years of being here. Since the GSP has trees along its banks, it made it difficult to see what caused the illuminations but it was clear that whatever it was made pure daylight for 3 seconds for quite some distance along the NJ shore.. Regards.. Richy", "An object made up of 5 white lights in a V shape moved across the sky at a steady pace.I was observing the stars when I noticed 5 lights, about the same magnitude as the brightest stars, moving across the sky headed directly South.  They never varied their formation or speed and traversed half the sky within about 30 seconds. There were no unusual changes in direction or, if seperate crafts, break in formation.  There were no red/green flashing lights one expects from an airplane.  The white lights could not have been landing lights since the object was moving away from me. The object was moving at probably 2 or 3 times the speed of the typical sattelite.  Also, moving directly South is an unlikely path for a sattelite, much less a formation of 5. Also, it was not moving in the direction of the V, it appeared to be moving sideways.  In other words, the direction of travel was toward one arm of the V. There was no sound and within half-a-minute it had disappeared in the horizon.((NUFORC Note:  The witness does not specifically state whether the sighting was during the daytime or night, although we presume it was a nighttime sighting.  We have amended the time above to reflect that fact.

Something caught my eyes in the sky above me. When I glanced up, I saw 3 bright lights (I thought they&apos;re stars at first) in a triangle formation moving at a fairly low altitude. By low altitude I mean an altitude where helicopter might fly at (not plane). My second immediate thought was they could be Canadian geese simply because of the triangle formation and the low altitude they&apos;re flying at. Only when I begun to notice the speed that thing was flying at and when I starting to make out the underlying shape of the object, I dismissed the geese theory and I was certain it was somekind of aircraft. Since it was moving at a very quiet demeanour, I basically ruled out helicopter. In addition, I just want to mention that those 3 bright lights weren&apos;t blinking at all. Hence, it couldn&apos;t be a commercial plane in my opinion. Now, I don&apos;t necessary believe that this object is from out of space. It could be some military spy craft from US for all I know (I don&apos;t think Canada can afford something like that). But it sure gave me an interesting experience. One last note, the object was flying towards the North-West direction before I lost sight on it.", "Bright red light in Albuquerques southwestern sky.My wife and I were walking our dogs. The sun had just set and we have lately been looking for Mars in the sky. I first looked to the south western sky and I saw a bright light as bright as Mars but in the wrong place for that time.The light though was a redish color. It was not the light of a planes nav or landing lights as I am a pilot and know what they look like. After looking at this bright lite for a few minutes it faded away as if on a south westerly course.The sky was quite clear with unrestriced visability.", "extremely bright glowing object at dusk, then fading to three lights circling craft in odd flash patternMy three children and myself stopped at a traffic light and a train was coming so we were sitting for sometime. As I looked at my daughter in the passenger seat, I noticed a bright light to the East and became curious as I watched it move to a stationary position in the sky and the light it emitted became brighter and brighter.  It was much too bright to be a star and remained COMPLETELY  stationary for 3 - 4 minutes.  It was extremely bright at its center.  A really strange thing was how the light from the object illuminated the clouds around it.  I noticed how a cloud below it was softly lit up (not glowing) as a light bulb might shine onto an object.  Then the light from the object slowly faded and the object then turned slowly toward the south and continued on.  The lights were similar in color to a planes running lights except the green was replaced by a blue flasher and the pattern was not consistent.  The lighting effect was as if the flashers circled the craft, as opposed to consistent flashers on airplanes.  The sun had completely vanished at this point and we were unable to determine what it was or the exact shape.  I have never seen anything so bright and so still in one spot in the sky for such a long period of time.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I live in an apartment on the 29th floor with bay windows with sky views of the Hudson River, New Jersey, planes lading towards Newark Airport, La Guardia Airport, and Queens. I&apos;ve noticed on a slight foggy night about Mid August an unidentified white light glowing floating object-size of a blimp, just standing still over the New Jersey side of the Hudson River.  I assumed it was probably a blimp floating at night because in the day, blimps fly over my window advertising for Saturn, Fuji, etc-it stayed there for 1-2hours. I didn&apos;t pay much attention b/c i thought it was probably a blimp until I noticed the same object in a non-foggy night sky last night. I noticed the same object, behind the LaGuardia Aiport floating but smaller because it was farther away and higher. The lights on this thing was similar to the object seen over the New Jersey side of the Hudson, but the lights alternated from red to white in periods of 10seconds apart. It stayed in the air, moving slowly and standing still for about 1 hour.  The airport scheduled continued b/c the incoming airplanes were landing at the airport. There were city helicopters flying over the sky in other directions-with the police lights, but nothting bothered the object. The lights on this object differed in pattern blinking, size, and color than all the other lights on the other aircraft that was flying in the sky last night.

My first thought and only logical thought was they are doing some hoot owl loggting. That is starting very early in the morning so as to lesson fire danger. But immediatley it dawned on me that it was early evening and so this made no sense to any of us. As we continued up the mile long inlet to the inter section the light disappeared very quick. We were talking about these lights as we made the right hand turn at tht little gravel intersection and as we rounded the corner art about 25 mph, all of a sudden we realized thatthere was a craft directly over our heads at about 50- 75 ft, right on top of the tree line.

We were near the north end of Hartnell Road, coming down the road when we saw a brilliant flash to the northeast, illuminating the mountain behind.  As suddenly as the flash appeared, it disappeared. The energy required to illuminate the mountain (East Vernon Hill) must have been enormous. Neither of us had seen anything like this before. As you can imagine, given the fire danger, we were anxious to find out if this event had fire potential. The sky was clear and cloudless so we discounted lightning...did not see another flash thereafter. Also, there was no sound accompanying the flash.

A witnessed watched a extremely large craft fly quickly overhead. Just tonight I had a telephone call from the same folks. The man&apos;s wife was outside tending the farm animals and her husband was with her. He takes his video equipment with him on many occasions as he is a sky watcher and does catch some good footage of different things. He also caught some great footage of the forest fires which were burning in the Barriere area. Tonight on September 10, 2003 at 8:50 p.m. the couple heard a sound coming from the north, when they looked towards that area of the sky they saw a bright white light heading directly in their direction and it passed soundless over top their farm. Both stood speechless ! They looked again towards the north where they could still hear the sound coming from, which at this point was growing louder and louder as it approached their location. Seeing the fellow was so shocked to see what just went over top of them, meaning a large silent bright white light, he never thought to &quot;try&quot; to take a bit of footage. But he did say the white moved very quickly and was soon out of their line of sight due to the surrounding area. But as the sound from &quot;something&quot; else drew closer and at this point was at the edge of the farm, he started rolling video tape and was surprised to see two large military helicopters fly low over head. He said I don&apos;t know what one would call the make of the helicopters, but the two of them were really large and flying in the same direction the light was heading. The witness also told me he has good equipment for his camera and did catch the two helicopters on film. (The footage will be making it&apos;s way to me as soon as he can get a copy made up). (HBCC UFO Note: Due to myself knowing there is a fire in that area, I asked if the aircraft the witnesses saw were anywhere near the fire. The fellow said the helicopters were not even close to the area where the fire is burning. The fire is burning way up on the Bonaparte area and the two helicopters should have been way west of these peoples farm. I also asked one of the witnesses if he knew of any helicopters flying at night due to the fire activity in the area. He said he knew of none flying at night. He did say the run of the mill helicopters are seen a lot during the daylight hours but no military helicopters have been seen in the area. He also added there are military personal in the area and many of us would have heard of this on the news. There are a good number of Canadian troops on the ground fighting these awful fires through the province. I also asked the witness how bad was the fire in the area, and he told me it wasn&apos;t bad at all. (There is a bit of important information I cannot give out as it could lead back to one of these witnesses. This bit of information is key to knowing what is flying and isn&apos;t). Something else which stuck me as odd. A shor time ago the media, along with the general public were at one location taking pictures of the forest fire. I was told the RCMP showed up and took everyone&apos;s film away from them. I also have heard from people in the Vernon area that the military is buzzing around. Matter of fact the witnesses in Vernon, B.C. said it was if they were on some kind of alert. I telephoned the Kamloops airport tower just after I talked with the witness, but the airport operations were closed for the night as all I got was an answering machine telling me the hours they operated in. So I will be calling them back first thing in the morning to see if I can get any information on aircraft flying in that area at the time of the sighting. I will also try the Comox military base on Vancouver Island to see if they are flying military choppers in the Barriere area. So what we have is a bright white light/object flying low over top of the witnesses farm, followed by two military helicopters following at a distance behind the soundless light.

It then moved closer to the road to the point where my son could see the typical round object on the underneath and the three lights, blue, red and white.  He said it hovered there, made no sound and had a wobbling motion.  A car was coming from the other direction and the craft was so low the car did a U-turn and went in the other direction.

When it happened last time I reported it to another UFO web page I came across on the WEB. I came across this web page a few weeks after the first occurence last Feb/March or so.Well this is the strangest and most eerie thing that has ever happened to me. A short while ago as I was walking my dogs they started to pace and hide behind me, much like they do when there is a storm w/lightning and thunder. And almost exactly as it happened before, the area above me turned pitch black. I mean it was as if the sky had been painted over. The area was huge from my vantage point.Well put it this way it was either huge and far away or it was closer than I thought it was. I mean there were no stars, no clouds, no light of any kind. I could see a defined edge but the shape changed from oblong to kidney shape and then to a distorted sphere of some kind. There was no noise of any kind, and the black shape moved at a pretty slow pace. It covered very little area in the 5 or so minutes that I could see it. I was determined to get a picture of it and I walked over to my car and grabbed the binocular/digital camera I bought myself a few weeks ago to snap pictures of the birds around my yard. I started snapping like mad and took at least 50 exposures.None of them ended up looking like anything except a shot of BLACK and nothing else.It would be pretty hard to get a good picture of it unless it was a crystal clear night loaded with stars.( unfortunately tonight was a bit mixed with clouds and pockets of stars) I am so excited that I was able to verify to myself that I wasn&apos;t going crazy. Last time I was all by myself with the dogs and I had to keep telling myself that I saw what I saw and that it was OK. But tonight I saw it again and this time it hung there in the sky for a goodwhile. The creepy part of the whole thing was that last time I only saw it for a few moments maybe 1/2 a minute but this time not only did I see it on approach to where it stopped but I saw it leave as well. It just picked up speed and within a few seconds it had risen into the night sky and I could see stars taking the place of the object as it rose and then it was gone out of site.

I saw two planes flying in the vacinity and suddenly the two objects shot straight up to the sky and within 5 seconds or so became as distant as the stars themselves.(Very faint light but visible). The distance traveled in time was incredible. It appeared that the craft flew 200-250 miles upward in a matter of 5 seconds. (I know that this must defy our most current-to-date physics????) The Craft that I saw did not have blue or red lights on them as far as I could see so they did not appear to be planes at all.

Thursday night, we went into the tub and sat looking at the passing satellites going over and we noticed an extremely bright, pure white flash of light in the southern night sky at about 80 Deg. above the horizon. This light flashed and was gone. It suddenly appeared again but had travelled approximately one fist width (held at arms length) in a northerly direction. This light flash on and of at approximately two second intervals for almost 30 seconds then the frequency changed to an erratic flashing that would pause for a second, then flash, then pause for two or three seconds then flash. This continued for another two minutes or so and then it just stopped and disappeared. Then, at the same line of travel, back in the southern sky came a second flash. This one was also at about 80 Deg. above the horizon. This one continued for about one and a half minutes, following the same pattern of erratic flashes and also followed the same north bound path, but it was further to the west of the first object. It also disappeared (stopped flashing) as it passed overhead. I have been an avid atronomer for over 40 years and can honestly state that this caught my attention in that when I went inside, I got on my computer and hit the Nasa Site - &quot;J-Track&quot; (Satellite Tracking Software that is available to all) and there were no satellites tracking over our part of Alberta at that time. I have also been involved in Satellite Tracking of land-based assets and have also participated in the Cobalt Radiation Testing of Chips and related software for the GPS Satellite Constellation Correction and Surveillance Sats Sys that actually tracks and maintains the record of correctional data for the deliniation of the current Glonass and GPS Constellations that are orbiting the earth today. It is not that I do not know what an orbiting satellite looks like as it goes over. THese objects were not satellites or anything that we have sent up. These objects were pulsating at a timed and then erratic rate which indicates a self serving &quot;at the time of initiation&quot; protocol, not one that is programmed by any standard we use on earth. I have seen hundreds of Satellites that spin along their axis in their orbit and have witnessed their solar panels flashing as they rotate toward the sun and these flashes that my wife and I witnessed were simply not the flashes caused by the solar panels of satellites being illuminated by the sun. The lights were of such an intensity that they were similar to th star burst flares dropped from aircraft to light up ground positions......only so very much brighter. My wife says they were like looking into the flash of a camera. Finally, I was travelling west on Saturday morning at 0400 and was listening to you on the radio for that hour and was taken with the fact that someone had seen the exact same lights over Seattle only one or two nights prior to my wife and seeing them over Alberta. Incidently, high orbit travel at any conventional sat speed from Seattle to Edmonton is about 11 minutes or so..............rough of the top of the head reckoning. I hope this helps you in your project and I can honestly state that this did in fact occur and my wife was and still is, somewhat amazed and left wondering.", "On this particular clear sky evening in rural Iowa. I was leaving our farm and goin on a date in town. I was 17 at the time and was going to meet my girlfriend. On the way up the gravel road I happened to notice on my left a light in the sky...not unusual really ecept this one was doing some very odd things...Odd enough for me to slow the car down and take a closer look. Another vehicle coming towards me also slowed down and I could see the people in side looking in the same direction as I as they passed...I stopped and they continued on..as the dust settled from the road I got a much better look at this craft. From my vantage point it was simply a VERY bright light light in the southern sky...it was not all that far off the ground and I noticed it suddenly throw an incredibly bright beam straight down to the ground..I thought then it was just perhaps a police helicopter. What told me different was the incredible flashes of color it suddenly began to give off...first a brilliant green fading into green then blue then yellow...not airplane lights...these were bright and faded from one to another and the speed in which they changed varied ...as I watched this thing..it stopped the beam of light it had in the fields below...and then it swiftly moved to the right....then up and then back down forming a triangle type flight path of about perhaps a mile in length...it was no more than a quarter or a half mile from my viewpoint butI figure but who can tell?....I got out of the car and I couldnt hear any sound from the direction of the object at all. As soon as it made the triangle manuver, it suddenly took off at a speed no conventional craft could attain and went straight to the horizon and disapeered. I had a wonderful view to the horizon and I would say it crossed about 20 miles in less than 5 seconds...I sat in my car amazed and completly happy...I had my first encounter with something I believe wasn&apos;t of this earth...and buddy, they got the SPEED!!!

I did this. The object was gone. There was never any sound. The object  appeared to be circular, maybe 10 - 15&apos; in diameter.

Since I was already outside with my telescope looking at Mars (which was in the opposite sky), I looked at this object through my telescope. I could discern no shape, or even source of the light (was not reflecting light they way lights on standard aircraft tend to do.) Therefore all I could see through the telescope was a &quot;very red star&quot; surrounded by darkness. When I looked at it an hour later, it had moved or another one had shown up, I only saw the one light. No flashing, blinking, or moving; one moment it was there, and suddenly it was gone. At first I thought it was a helicopter, looking through my telescope I realized it was not (I would have seen the shape.) Sky was clear overhead with some haze/fog along the horizon (well below the strange light.) This red light barely even twinkled, adding to the strangeness. I am baffled. This light didn&apos;t do anything at all. I just recognized it as a &quot;star&quot; that shouldn&apos;t be there, and a ruby red star at that.

The flashes were very bright alternating between blue/white and orange. The patterns were random. We at first were convinced they were explosions from military testing. We ruled that out knowing that the fire risk was to high for such activities. The lights most certainly were not planes or flares. The flashes varied slightly in intensity. The area we were watching was roughly in the area that the Appalachian Trail would be heading after it left the Bigelow Preserve, toward the Forks area of Maine.

He quickly looked up, and was flabbergasted to witness two distinctly red, seemingly oblong luminous objects moving across the sky at a high angular velocity.  He reported that they were very bizarre in appearance, and they may have maneuvered, relative to each other.  They disappeared behind a nearby building, as they coursed generally to the northwest. The witness quickly returned to his residence and drew a picture of what he had just witnessed minutes earlier. NUFORC is awaiting a written report from the witness.  PD", "Myself and my sister saw a saucer shaped object in Norththern EnglandWe live on the edge of the town. It was about 10 pm and I looked out of my bedroom window and saw a disk shaped object in the sky. Very much like a saucer, but had a long line of light around the outside not flashing. I called my sister ((name deleted)) and she saw it as well. We saw the object fly over the fields about 800 ft up and then disapear into the clouds. There seemed to be a cloud of light around the object as well, but that may have been it shining through the mist. It also made a quite humming sound as i found out as I opened my window.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "Fighters trying to shoot down UFO over Ft. Drum NY?Me and some friends were outside watching satellites and saw some explosions in the sky toward ft. drum. We thought it was a meteor but to our surprise we saw a flashing light moving across the sky at a high rate of speed. The object changed directions and stopped many times. It would move almost out of site and then rapidly zoom over ft. drum. What looked like several fighter planes attempted to follow it and more bright orange fireballs appeared behind the UFO. We could here jets going to afterburners and the object would zoom away again only to return after several seconds to be fired upon again. Truly amazing!  The sky was clear and the milky way was clearly visible.((NUFORC Note:  We received no other reports from this area of New York, so we are unable to confirm the report.

If I was to hold my fingers out at arms length and about 2 1/2 inches apart, that would be about the size it appeared in the sky. The sound was a low rumble like you would hear from a jet liner going over, except that the sound was coming directly from the source, as opposed to trailing the aircraft, which makes me think that it wasn&rsquo;t very high in the sky, but yet I would estimate it at between one and two miles. It turned to the east and continued on until it was out of sight. As far as the shape, I would say it was like a B2 bomber but would have had to have been bigger. A little before we saw this my brother and nephew had noticed a couple smaller aircraft flying around to the north of the lake. As the big one turned to head east, the two screamed across the sky and met up with it a ways out. We could not hear the smaller planes so they must have been pretty high up. On a normal night we may only see one to four planes on average, and knowing how slow they move across the sky I thought that the two planes must be jet fighters because they crossed the sky quickly. Within an hour later 2 smaller planes came back from the east and we watched them thinking that it may be the same two that had caught up and escorted the big one. They had made a couple of turns, which again made me think that they were not commercial planes ( again, what we normally see up there are commercial planes that fly high over head in a perfectly straight line.) Anyway then we heard planes overhead and saw four planes flying in &quot;V&quot; formation and trying to follow the same route as the big craft flew. The formation looked like they were trying to make it look like it was what we saw earlier, but was obviously not. After a while and seeing a few more planes jetting around the sky I went to bed, but was told that everyone that stayed up saw one more display of the &quot;V&quot; formation a little later.A few key points to myself are.1) We normally will only see one to three planes per night. We sit out at the campfire every weekend looking up at the stars and counting satellites, so it&rsquo;s not like we don&rsquo;t look up. On this night we saw in excess of 20 planes, all after 11:45 p.m.2) The big craft appeared to be flying too slowly for something that big.3) The fighters that screamed across the sky to intercept or escort.A couple of questions.1) What was this large craft? 2) Would the airforce admit to flying &quot;training exercises&quot; or anything else? 3) Is it possible that this large craft was below radar and the other planes were waiting for it to show itself, and we saw it as it was going up and the two smaller craft streaked toward it when they picked it up again. Lastly I would like to mention one thing that may have nothing to do with this but may be worth mentioning. About an hour earlier than the sighting of the big craft, we heard loud commotion back in the woods maybe a mile or more that sounded like many coyote&rsquo;s or wolves howling or fighting. This went on and off for about a half an hour or so and ended shortly before seeing the big craft. These sounds were coming directly in the area of where we saw the craft come from. Probably just a coincidence((NUFORC Note:  The date of the sighting was August 30.  We have amended the data above.  PD))", "Light traveled on a straight line, but the strange thing was, it moved from side to side as it movedVancouver, B.C. &amp; Point Roberts, Wa., United States  I received an email today, September 27, 2003 from a lady who gave me a short report on a sighting her husband had on September 26, 2003. I asked if I could call to see if I was able to get anymore details on the sighting. Everyone agreed and I called. I talked to her husband, the witness who watched something fly through the sky. The witness said the object would have been seen both in Wa. State and in British Columbia. Between 8:30 to 9:00 p.m. the fellow took his dog outside so it could do it&apos;s business. It was a clear night and he was looking up at the stars. The fellow saw a strange light fly across the sky, which he first thought might have been a satellite. The object/light was traveling west to east. He said it was just a little smaller than the planet Mars, but very bright. The witness mentioned it traveled on a straight line, but the strange thing was, it moved from side to side as it moved across the sky. His thoughts were of a Jet Ski bouncing up and down over the waves, but in this case the light was moving from side to side. The light was a faint blue/white in color. No tail was noticed following behind. The man also described the light as being spherical in shape. Although it was rather high up, the witness did not believe it was as high where one would find a satellite. No sound was heard, no response from his dog after the light passed overhead. The light was extremely bright and as it moved towards the east and it just faded out. The sighting lasted between 30 and 40 seconds. Thank you to the witness for the report.

I looked up in a clear sky and saw a Sac Bomber comming in for a landing in Fort Worth. The Bomber was Bigger than anything I have ever seen so I stopped my truck and Pulled out my JVC GR-AX70 camcorder and focused on the Jet Bomber. It looked small in the Viewfinder so I zoomed up to full zoom and as I was Taping it A Circular ball Passed in front of This Jet. Let me make somthing perfectly clear this jet is Big at least 2 football fields long wide etc. The Ball that passed in front of it was half is big as the jet so it can&apos;t be to small acording to distance because both objects are in clear focus. From the track of the UFO from intrance to exit of the seen the jet never passes or catches up with it this desplays an advanced flight capability we can&apos;t do at this time.

It was a fine day with blue sky and no clouds. If I had to estimate the size of it I would say it was about the size of a car, a small car.  We were standing in the shelter at one end of the oval looking straight out towards the other end of the oval. The object came over the top of the pine trees to our right and stopped right in front of us.There was enough time for me to gesture to my friend by touching his arm and pointing. I couldn&apos;t speak. I was renderred speachless. Not by the object but just by the shock of seeing it. It sounds so cliche that it was saucer in shape but it was and it was a distinct black on the underside and the silver of a wine bladder on top. The was no noise but if there was any we couln&apos;t hear it from where we were at the other end of the oval, and it didn&apos;t get the attention of people on the oval, that I know of. As it moved away it seemed to move in about before it went towards Para Hills at incredible speed and agian making no sound. During the time it was in front of us it was about 50 feet off the ground, and as it moved away it rose up to several hundred feet. When it sped off it did so in a straight line, then it disappeared out of sight in a split second, as though it had vanished. We expected to see reports in the paper about others who had seen it, but there was no mention of it. To this day, when we talk about it, the hair stands up on the back of my neck. I had always scoffed at other reports and they are lights in the night sky, I still do. But this was a clear day. It was about 26 years ago, but I can still see it. We have relived it dozens of times. I wish I had a camera, but I didn&apos;t and it&apos;s gone. It hasn&apos;t affected my life, and we haven&apos;t kept it a secret, and I don&apos;t expect this report will be any different to dozens just like it.

PD))Wobbling bright &quot;twinkling star&quot; exhibits white/yellowish light along with bluish and red randomly flashing lights.Riding in the passenger seat of a car East on Hwy 40 toward Vernal, UT, I watched what I thought to be a very bright star or planet in the low Eastern/Southeastern sky to the right of a 3/4 orange moon.  As the moon rose in the sky and turned to white, the bright star remained in approximately the same position in the sky.  I observed the light intermittently as I gazed at other objects (stars, Mars, the moon, planes).  After approximately 10 minutes of this stargazing I began to think the light was twinkling quite a bit and uncharacteristic of any star or planet I&apos;d ever seen.  I was not aware the driver had also noted the odd characteristics of the light until he asked aloud, &quot;Is it just me or is that star flickering a lot?&quot;  We both began to watch it in earnest at that point.  We watched the flickering until we lost sight of it as we entered the hills, but not before deciding the white/yellowish light just might be intermingled with intermittent red flashes as well.  We anticipated picking up the sight again once we cleared the hills some 5-10 minutes later, but were surprised to find it was not to the right of the moon where we&apos;d &quot;left it&quot;.  We continued our drive into Vernal scanning the sky for the same light, possibly tracking across the sky at this point.  Instead we spotted an identical light in the low Northern/Northeastern sky.  We watched from outside the car for a few minutes noting now this light had definite flashes of red.  The other witness got the binocculars and through these I saw definite bluish light as well.  It was also apparent this light was not completely stationary.  It didn&apos;t track across the sky, but seemed to &quot;wobble&quot; in place.  After some time it became apparent it also moved from side to side at times, but maintained the same general visual position in the sky.  During this time, another identical but brighter light was spotted in the low Western sky.  Through the binocculars the red light on this object almost seemed to be circling around an object and t! he bluish light was even more visible.  This object behaved in the same way, not stationary, but not tracking or moving rapidly.  It disappeared below the horizon at about 23:00, but the light in the Northern sky remained in relatively the same position until we tired of watching it at about 23:30.  The following night of 9/15/03 as stars were beginning to appear, we located the light in the low Northern sky easily just as before exhibiting the same colors.  The light in the Western sky was not as low as the night before, but it was also earlier in the evening.  Unlike the previous night, however, the Western light blinked out numerous times for a few seconds while we watched.  We left these 2 lights in these positions to investigate the posibility of them being satelites as a family member stated he&apos;d heard of &quot;red white and blue satelite(s)&quot;.  We can not find any information or mention of these on the internet.  The only &quot;red, white and blue&quot; accounts were on this website, the most parallel account also occuring in Utah a couple of weeks ago some 3 hours drive time from here.  The account in the Wasatch Mountains above Salt Lake City dated 8/23-8/28/03 is precisely what we saw in color and behavior and location, except we did not see them moving rapidly enough in one direction to say the lights moved out of sight or below the horizon as opposed to the Earth rotating and causing the position change.  I could only surmise the light moved and disappeared below the horizon because the other stars in visual proximaty did not move out of sight during the same time frame.  However, I&apos;m unsure what effect altitude or distance from the Earth might have on an object&apos;s position in the sky and movement through the sky from horizon to horizon.I know nothing of satelite characteristics except for the common white light tracking fairly quickly across the sky.  (We also noted 2 of these moving across the sky the night of 9/14,in close visual proximaty to the Western light.) Are these colored, wobbly flickering lights possibly satelites as has been suggested to me?  If so, could you elaborate on the cause of the patriotic colors and odd wobbly movement?  Please do not contact me except to answer the questions I&apos;ve posed or to request more details of this specific occurence.", "Not sure what it was but it went very fast across the sky not certain on the exact shape either as it was moving WAY to fast.

We were talking and we both stopped and said &quot;Oh my Gosh!&quot; We couldn&apos;t believe what we were seeing!! There was two incredibly bright red lights coming from the north and what stopped us in our conversation was that first they were incredibly bright and red and they were flying too weirdly together... At first they flew side by side and then they just kind of stopped.  One kind of back-tracked a bit and that&apos;s when I really couldn&apos;t believe what I was seeing! One of the bright red lights just kind of lowered and then fell straight down.  Then the other seemed to stay there for a second and then it also fell straight down..

I heard sirens later and we saw smoke.. So we went to investigate.. It was near I-20 and it was a trailer house that was totally engulfed in flames.  It was right about where we saw the lights go down.. It was around 12:45 am and there was over 5 fire trucks trying to put out the fire.  I drove by it today and it was rubbles..

We couldn&apos;t tell if the blinking was due to it possibly rotating and reflecting from the sun. The object was not moving in the sky then it moved quickly from west to east in the sky.

It was about 12-1:00am on Friday morning September 19, 2003 when I turned the vehicle to face south when something in the sky caught my eye. It was a circular red-orange ball of light that was hovering slowly east. If it were right in front of me I would have to estimate it at walking speed. The size, like throwing a golf ball straight up into the air about seven or eight feet. At first I thought it may have been a helicopter or airplane as this object was above Mather AirForce Base, which is inactive. Usually, however, a helicopter or plane is accompanied by flashing green or white lights, as I see them on a nightly basis. So I turned off the engine to my vehicle and opened the door to see if I could hear an engine of some kind ... there was nothing. This light continued to hover east for several seconds then came to a stop. It had only been still for no more than two seconds before it disappeared. It didn&apos;t fade or speed out of sight, but just vanished like turning off a light switch. I sat there for several more minutes hoping this thing would return, but it never did.

It was one of those incredibly clear high country nights, not a cloud in the sky, no moon. Just above the tree line, my eye caught a moving light. It was a perfect sapphire blue, and was large enough to just show a disc, rather than a pinpoint. My immediate impression was that this object was at very high altitude and moving very fast. As I watched, it crossed an arc of about 100 degrees of the sky, in about 5 seconds. Then I saw another object coming in on a converging course at about a 30 degree angle from behind. This object was a greenish white pinpoint of light, also moving very fast,and converging on a collision course with the first object. At this time I thought the guys at at Sandia Missle Lab had really come upwith some kind of intercepter missle, and there&apos;s going to be a hell of an explosion up there. To my surprise, ther not only was not an explosion, the two objects met, merged, moved another 30 degrees across the sky and winked out. I then had the immediate thought-scout ship pick up!!! This had all happened so fast that I hadn&apos;t said a word to my ex, so I asked her if she had seen it too, and she said yes and described exactly what I had seen. I would like to add at this time that I have spent most of my life outdoors, in all conditions, and I am very familiar with aircraft of all types, having seen them in every combination of light and weather. Further I have ecellent depth perception and distance judgement, as I am a life long hunter and also a competitive shooter. I point this out because while I had no real reference points to judge the altitude of this object, I had an immediate impression of extreme altitude [possibly sub-orbital].  Given that the first object was showing a disc, barely, and that it covered an arc of sky of about 130 to 140 degrees in about 8 seconds it would have to be BIG and FAST !!

We noticed a craft flying low in the sky above the other side of the freeway while we approached closer the object displayed a bunch of colored lights then it landed on the roads opposite side the lights were moving and pointing at us then when my car got to where we were even on the road with it it took off and blasted off int the sky moving like nothing I could explain at a very fast rate of speed it took staight of a disappeared into the fog of the night .  The craft was making vabriation sounds like a reactor of sort .

It wasn&apos;t something I saw, but it was more of what I heard.  I am accustomed to hearing Life Flight over my house and I am also familiar with a small frieght train that passes at around 2 am a couple of times a week through our neighborhood.  However, last night there was a strange sound I have not heard before.  First there was a white light that shown through my bedroom window which cause me to turn my head.  It quickly went out, but was followed by a low whiring sound almost like a steam roller.  It wasn&apos;t the local train because it didn&apos;t fade in and out and there was no train whistle.  This sound was constant and loud similar to the Life flight, but there was no rattling of our windows as is the case when helicopers fly overhead.  In the morning, a neighbor confirmed the same unusual noise and had come to the same conclusion as myself that this was not the normal noises we encounter regularly.  I have not been much into UFO sitings, but this was too strange.  I thought it might be of interest.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

PD))", "Craft with light too low and too quiet for a plane and too often to ignore anymore.This is the third time our family has seen UFO type objects in the 9:00 p.m. hour in our area.  We live down a dead end road in the hills in between Charlotte &amp; Greensboro.  If it wasn&apos;t for our yard light, it would be totally black except for the stars and moon.  We see planes in their normal flight patterns fairly high above us every evening, but these sightings are definitely different.  The first sighting was at 9:15 p.m. EST on a Monday, Memorial Day, May 26, 2003, when he walked out to give our dogs some leftovers.  He saw a very large rectangular object hovering at tree level in the east about 1/4 mile away.  It made a strange and scary noise and he hightailed it back to the house.  It just disappeared after a couple of minutes.  The second sighting was the same.  The last sighting last night was odd and unnerving.  We were watching the Monday night game with the front door open, which faces south.  I was bored with the game and glanced out the door and a light caught my eye as it appeared to be below tree level on this side of the mountain behind it heading towards our front door.  I asked my husband what that light could be.  He looked and we couldn&apos;t believe what we were seeing.  We called to our 15 year old son and we all went out on the deck to see what it could be.  It was a square type object full of light moving slowly towards us below tree level.  Since we had seen other strange things out here, I ran and grabbed my camcorder.  With the yard light to my left and rear, I was first unable to find the object, so I moved to a dark portion of our deck and picked up the object.  It moved towards us and then turned east and was out of sight very quickly.  There was no sound and should have been as it was within 2000 yards of us.  After it disappeared, we saw a regular plane coming out of the east towards the west and heard it&apos;s sound.  My husband and son went back inside the house and I stayed out to see if it would come back.  Within 1-2 minutes, I saw lights coming towards me ! again through the trees from the south to the north and then it turned towards the east and went out of sight.  It didn&apos;t seem to be the same type craft as the first time but it could have been.  It happened 5 times ending at 9:50 p.m.  Since my camcorder ran out of battery, I grabbed my binoculars and caught the light on the fifth time.  I noticed that this time it looked like a triangle shape with 2 lights on each wing and 2 in the front center with a red light on top as it banked out to the east in a clearing of the trees.  I worked for Northrop Grumman in the past and it could have been a B2 or something.  It had that shape but it seemed different from the craft we all saw.  Maybe there is some testing or training going on here but the crafts were all silent this time. I am reporting it this time in hopes of finding out what it could have been.  We&apos;ve only been here for a year, we are originally from Virginia Beach.  Any ideas out there?  The camcorder shows the lights have a square look and haze to them probably because of reflection but comes into view like something else.  There was what appeared to be heat lightning briefly following the sighting.", "me and my girlfriend were traveling north on hwy 89 leaving bemidji mn going to redlake mn and the sky was dark you could not see any stars in the sky but we did notice a bright flash of light that was mimicing a strobe light in the sky but did not see the source of it for another 10 miles it was really bright but we come to where you would turn right to poposky {east} and obsurved the source of the flash as we drove by {it flashed twice} and we didnt think nothing of it for another 17 miles north up the road real close to redlake then i had stopped the car ((text deleted)) and i looked at the sky and i could still see the big bright flash in the sky i told my girl friend she didnt think nothing of it i thaught it could have been a a tower light but they were not that darn bright so we turned around went back south on hwy 89 17 miles back to the poposky road ware we should have turned left to go east toward poposky but we stopped to observe the source of the bright light we could not make any object out but it was bright it lit up the sky and you could see the bright light for at least 30 miles away and this is honest but any way the source was only a couple miles east down the poposky road as we were traveling east we thaught we were getting ever so close and so we stopped and i got out to have a look and i was preatty much standing in the spot whereit was hovering above and there was a lake whare it was hovering over just a little lake and ther was houses in the area my girlfriend got out and we looked at each other and i said hey it moved away she agreed but we could still the flash so we kept going and we got up to it again then rounded a corner and the sourc was gone again so we kept going east  and come to a stop sign left was back north and right was south and i got out again looked up and the darn thing must have been 20 miles away cause the brightness dimmed down quit a bit my girl friend was then scared she said lets go home so we went left back home as we were going north we cou! ldent see the light but we had just drove about 15 miles north then took a left on a side road west got only about 1.5 miles and my girl frend said there it is so i slowed down looked up she no on the ground and i saw the damn thing had landed on the ground still mimicing a strob light but the srength of the light was weaker  compaired to before we saw it on the ground blinking i sped down the road went home i didnt look back the next night i retraced the whole route there was no light like that to be seen((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

It was like a camera flash, but it was from above our heads, there was no planes or helicopters in the area and a very thin cloud cover.  About 1 minute after the flash we were looking up into the sky and saw a small light in the thin clouds that looked like something was above the clouds with a  light and the light was moving around slowly in a circle and then disapeared.", "Triangle shaped object  flying across the sky VERY FAST.A very fast triangle shaped object colored red, blue and green flew across the sky.

As I came into town, I watched for a policeman to stop but there were none, my son watched the object as I drove.  It remained stationary altho a couple planes were also in the sky.  We went into the store and when we came out about 45 min. later, it was gone.  As I drove home, watching to see if I could spot it again, I saw it, originally in the western sky, now in the northern sky, same height and still hovering.  We are 30 miles from an airport and I see planes all day and night but this was not a plane nor helicopter.  I tried to find our telescope to see if I could focus it, but it was unavailable.  After about an hour of checking back and forth, the object was no longer anywhere that I could see.  But the entire time I did see it, it never seemed to change altitude or position, when it was in the west or in the north.  There are  many planes here and in the morning and early evening, the sun reflects off them and they shine like a bright orange cigar traveling across the sky.  This was not the case.", "white light that seemed to disapear then reapear further down. plane spotted in same area.At about 10:15 p.m. I was driving down old Q when i spotted a light moving slowly above the tree line. I&apos;m not sure about the direction but as I turned onto Shoto road it(the light) was on my left. I live on Shoto road about a half mile from where I saw the u.f.o. It was a constant light with no blinking lights or anything of that sort. I actually pulled over on Shoto road to watchas I was a little bewildered. There was a high flying plane in the same direction as the u.f.o. I could see the two crafts out my left window as I pulled over. On the plane I could make out the two flashing wing lights, but the u.f.o. was a constant white light. I watched it above the tree line for about 3 to 4 minutes then it seemed to disapear, only to reapear not far away. I lost sight of it so I turned around and followed shoto down to Q(not old Q). I turned onto highway Q but couldn&apos;t find it again. The craft moved at a constant speed never speeding up or slowing down. I&apos;m interested to see if the pilot in this area reports it. I&apos;m not easily excited and I&apos;m also not a u.f.o. buff or necessarily interested in the paranormal.

Up in the sky to the south was 13-14 bright trianglar shapes in the sky.  They were moving fast, taking turns almost into a dive.  I pulled into our driveway and watched for approx. 6-7 mins, and one by one they dived and disappeared.  The last one seemed to dive a couple of times before it disappeared.  What was strange is that the closeness and the speed of these objects.  There was no noise.  I am used to seeing airplanes and such go over our house, but these were not airplanes.  They were too close and too fast to be airplanes.", "looking up in the sky I saw a very bright light.About a week ago (say Sept 10, 2003) around 5:00 a.m., I saw the same thing in the west, southwest sky.  I woke up and let my dog out;  looking up in the sky I saw a very bright light, like a star but a bit larger, and every so often it flashed different colors - red, green blue.  At first I thought it was a plane but it did not move. Then suddenly it shifted sideways quite a distance, then moved in a straight line back to where it was.  I watched on and off for quite a while and the flashing lights continued but it did not seem to change position in the sky, though it seemed to shift around once in a while.  The irregular flashing of the different colored lights and the movement was unlike anything I have ever seen or heard of until I read the post from Courtenay.

About 2100 we were star gazing with my binoculars. The conditions were perfect, no moon and very dark cloudless skies. The Milky Way was overhead and very bright and distint. My wife put down the binoculars and and was pointing out an airplane in the distance. I looked up..so we were both now looking in the same part of the sky and at that instant an object flew by about 1000&apos;(?) overhead from north to south. It was traveling very fast and was completely silent. The object was very dark, the only reason you could see it was that it blocked the stars as it went. the size was hard to judge. There were no lights on it but there was a faint glint like star light reflecting off of metal. It was gone in just a few seconds. We talked about it and we both described the same object. I camp alot and enjoy star gazing. I am very familiar with meteors, Iridium flares, sattelites and normal atmospheric phenomena. I have seen other things in the past but was always able to explain then away ( I thought ). This is one I can&apos;t explain.", "Dark object in the sky over Michigan, reflecting sunlight.An object of irregular shape moving slowly from west to east, slightly to the north of our position, moving more slowly than an aircraft, no lights on the object, but with irregular flashes of reflected sunlight. When the object was not reflecting light, the body of the object could be seen, but no details were vivible, no wings or any protrusions, just the dark object. While it was impossible to determine the actual height of the object, I estimate that it was more than one and less than five miles above the ground. No sounds were heard, no alterations in velocity were seen, and it moved slowly out of sight.", "Huge bluish black delta  wing 50 feet or less  over my head while deer hunting from my tree stand in FL !!I was hunting deer from my tree stand that is about 15 feet up on a palm tree in a very remote part of the state in a place called Tiger Island on the mainland portion of Cedar Key.  I have about 49 acres of my own and after sitting completely motion less for just over 5 hours I all of a suddon started to hear a vaccum cleaner noise or a sucking air with no motor sound comming from all around me , since I couldent tell the direction of the sound I remained motionless.  After about 4 or 5 minutes I noticed the noise was above me along with the sky getting darker as thou something was above my head,  I looked up and changed direction in my seat to get a better look at what looked like a flying delta shapped wing which was only about 50 feet above me.  I was able to view it in great detail before it just shot off in a fraction of a second.  The &quot;V&quot; shapped wing looked much like a modern B2 bomber except it was only flying about 2 miles per hour and had no engine sound.  The nose was missing or it was concave at the front portion with what looked like air &quot;vaperizeing&quot; all around the front of it and &quot;falling&quot; into the front of it.  The size was probabaly 200 feet across and 50 feet long, and was blackish blue in color.  It was about 5 pm and I noticed no lights although I could hear over the sucking noise a &quot;tinkling&quot; sound coming from the rear wing portion.  This sound was accompanied my an electrical or a shiny foil which seemed to be some sort of a discharge all along the rear of the wing, in other words it looked like sparkling foil?  It&apos;s hard to put into words since there is nothing to really compare it to.  I noticed no landing gear doors and no panels or rivets. I did see a few non typical panels whitch were outlined by darker lines.  It seemed to detect my movement when I shifted and I also pointed my rifle at it becasue I panicked in thinking it was not going to continue to move on. When I did so it just shot off without leaving any trail or sound, in fact it was far away -so fas! t the noise of the &quot;vacuum&quot; was sudenly gone. I have never seen a UFO in my life except for this occasion and the very next night 125 miles back home in St. Petersburg Fl.  My wife and I were both sleeping next to the bedroom window which was open when we were both awakened at exactly 4:20 am by an electrical &quot;humming&quot; sound,  we both got up and sat on out knees in bed and looked out the window and saw a large orange reddish sphere that looked like a miniture sun that was not very bright sitting on the grass just out side our home.  It was about 8 to 10 feet across and about 10 feet from the window.  As we looked at it it began to lift up and very slowly fly up and further away until it was gone from sight.  This sighting was about 10 to 12 minutes baybe much longer I dident time it.  It rose only about 2 feet every 20 feet it drifted away til it drifted over our street and a busy 12 lane street and disappeared about a mile away.  My wife now my &quot;x&quot; wife turned to me and said &quot;What the He&amp;% did you bring back with you from the property?!!&quot;  This was her exact words. I was in my mid twentys back then. I never offically reported this since no matter where I looked, phone book, information etc..  I couldent find any place to listen or take the info, and back then I wasent on the net.Last night we saw the same lights from Cedar Key the lady in L.A filmed on 8-31-03 , and also got them on video tape, possibly the same ones since her footage on CNN looked pretty much like ours did. From what I could tell, and since we were able to see them also I think what ever that was, was going on in space.  The thing that haunts me after all those years about my tree stand sighting is the fact that I remeber clearing my mind and foucusing on a single leaf on the ground and starring at it for over 5 hours before I heard the &quot;sucking &quot;sound coming.  The strange thing about this is I have never sat in a deer stand for more then 3 hours since then or before that instance. I remember never moving or blinking!  I sometimes ponder if what I experienced was missing time and the last part of a sighting-  the craft departing the scene and I awakening and seeing it leave when I was supose to be out for another few minutes?!((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.

The objects when first observed trapezoid with a craft at each corner during the observation, rear two objects seem to accelerate into the front two seemingly touching.

Which was in stark contrast to a helicopter which appeared within 2mins of the objects disappearing.", "As we starred into the eastern sky, we saw several moving &apos;things&apos;.Most traveled in a straight direction.  One made a left turn.Then all of a sudden, a bright light flashed, instantly, and it blinded all of us, and we closed our eyes for a second.  It appeared to be so close, like right above the tall pine tree.  But in a flash it was gone.  We didn&apos;t see anything where the flash took place.", "The light split into 4 lights which formed a square .Dear Brian Vike,  I too saw something strange in the sky, however this was the night of August 7th, 2003.  Here&apos;s my story:  My husband and I have a summer home at Sakinaw Lake which is on the Sunshine Coast in BC.  One of my favorite things to do at night is to star gaze from the middle of the lake.  The sky is so clear there compared to the city.  Anyways, on August 7th, I took my star gazing gear (blanket, pillow and flashlight) with me on my peddle boat and like usual snuggled down once I got to the middle of the lake.  I usually stay out for a couple of hours and watch the shooting stars before peddling back to our home.  On this night approximately 10:15 p.m. or so, I spotted what I thought was another shooting star.  It streaked across the sky heading southward then stopped.  I thought the shooting star might burn out, but it didn&apos;t.  Instead, the light split into 4 lights which formed a square (1 light in each corner).  One of the lights was brighter than the other 3; made me think it might be bigger than the others.  It stayed in the square formation for 2 to 5 seconds before  it changed forms again.  2 lights stayed in place while the other 2 lights moved slightly away, then stopped. The 4 lights together looked like a rectangle and stayed this way for 1 to 2 seconds.  Then all of a sudden the 2 lights that moved to form the rectangle shot off northward, like parallel shooting stars, while the other 2 lights only separated slightly and remained stationary.  One of the 2 lights that remained was the bright one.  I was shocked and couldn&apos;t believe what I saw. I stayed there until 1:30 a.m. to see if the other 2 would come back.  Then I tried to memorize the location of the 2 remaining lights before heading in, but they looked like stars amongst so many other stars.  It was useless, so I peddled back home. I told my husband and he suggested I look up UFO sightings on the internet.  There are so many skeptics and believe me I would have been one too, that I said I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll bother.  My husband printed a copy of your article for me to read and that&apos;s how I read about the other sighting on July 28th, 2003 and also why I&apos;m emailing you.If you know or hear of any one else that saw what I did that night, please let me know.  I would appreciate any information you can provide.  Thank you!  Yours truly, (name &amp; personal information deleted by HBCC UFO). I would like to thank the witness for the report.

Front had 4 rod shaped flourescent lights,  2 back corners, transparent center. Hand size at arms lengthI was on my second story balcony smoking a cigarette while looking up at a clear sky with bright stars as I always do. There was a storm coming in quickly to my right. My area of view is blocked to my left from my roof and trees block my view to my right leaving me a large patch of viewing sky in the middle. From my left a massive object appeared into my view and moved at a rapid pace towards the storm on my right. I got a great look at this object. It was shaped like an Indian arrow head. The front part of the triagle had 4 rod shaped glowing flourescent lights in a wedge shape and 2 on the back corners. The lights did not project. The center of this object looked transparent as it passed. For 15 seconds it sped across the sky without a sound. I held my hand up at arm&apos;s length and the object was slightly larger than it. I thought because of the massive size that it was flying by at a low altittude but when it reached the storm to my right I saw it go above the storm out of my view, not through it. I have a video camea with night vision and I&apos;ll be ready. I should of known better being a UFO enthusiast and neck kinking sky watcher. Thank you.", "Object zig zagging east to west and stopping in distance turned out to be huge triangle with many lights when it flew directly overheadI was headed to dinner break with my partner (i was driving) heading downtown on Ninth Avenue around 56th Street when we both noticed a light behaving strangely in the sky. It was just around dusk and must have been in late summer. We took our break at 7:00 pm and were about three miles from our destination in heavy traffic. We were both used to seeing planes and helicopters in the sky as NYC gets a lot of air traffic and the area where we were looking in lower Manhattan was a popular flight path. But this thing was zig zagging in the sky and then coming to a complete stop. It seemed impossible. My partner is a veteran of the armed forces and he and i had never discussed the subject of ufo&apos;s. We kept our eye on the object while speculating as to what kind of plane could be capable of that kind of flight and why it would be doing that in what is a heavy air traffic corridor but could come up with nothing. We continued to drive south, in the direction of the object when we saw it change path. While it had been zig zagging from east to west and back again it suddenly started to head north in our direction. We were stopped at the red light and i cannot tell you how but it must have been moving very fast because it just seemed like all of sudden it went from an indistinguishable bright object to a huge triangle with many, many round lights on the bottom of it and it was directly overhead. My partner and i each had our heads out our respective windows just saying &apos;what the @#&amp;@!% is that thing!?&apos;. There so many lights. There must have been three rows of lights following the shape of the triangle. The lights were completely round, big and gave no glare. We could make out no landing gear, no windows and it made no sound. It was dark silver or gray-silver in color. No one on the street was looking up but this woman in a jeep who was stopped at the light next to us (we were high up in a van) looked up when she saw our expressions and she got the same look we must have had, laughing and yet dumbfou! nded at the same time. The light changed and the object continued north overhead and we went to work and told our supervisor who didn&apos;t really believe us. But i swear this really happened. To this day, if you walk on the streets of NYC you will see that New Yorkers just do not look up. I can&apos;t explain why neither my partner or i didn&apos;t yell at people to look up, but i think we were just too shocked and trying to make sense of what were seeing and then the light changed and it was gone behind us. I think it was huge because we could see it so clearly when it passed over us, yet we hadn&apos;t seen it descend and must have been fairly high up. It&apos;s hard for me to speculate on this as i have no clue about how to calculate distance and size in the sky. My partner and i were doing outreach with the homeless at the time this happened.

We presume the reports describes a daytime sighting.  PD))", "Bright stationary orange light of short duration near MarsMy wife and I were on Myrtle Beach at about 21:00 to observe Mars. The sky was very clear and many stars were visible over the ocean horizon. There was a slight haze over the water that obscured the horizon. As we sat on the beach watching the sky, there appeared a bright stationary light with a orange huge high in the sky. It was as intense as Mars and for a moment looked as though there were 2 Mars. The light persisted for several seconds and winked out. We continued to watch and the light appeared again in a different location, it appeared first on the left of Mars and then on the right and slightly lower in the sky. Again the light appeared and blinked out after 2 seconds. We were really excited as this was like nothing we had ever seen before, it changed position but not in a straight path.  After about 20 mins. 2 lights appeared together to the left of Mars both appeared and winked out after about 2 seconds. The last sighting was to the right of Mars and low on the horizon, the light was partially obscured by the layer of haze and shone more red in color. We observed Mars for several more nights and looked for the lights, they did not reappear. The night was quite and what aircraft traffic was in the sky was clearly visible. One thought I had was that the lights might be the afterburners on some military aircraft out over the ocean. I have never observed them at night and do not know how they would appear. I mention this because there is a military base near by and I did see 2 F-16&rsquo;s earlier that day. They were very load and flew out over the ocean. The lights we saw were stationary and we heard no aircraft noise.((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witnesses observed, but we believe one possibility to explore would be landing lights on approaching commercial or military aircraft.  Just a guess on our part.  PD))", "object was stationary for one min. then moved NW at a very slow slow speed then lights went out.Went outside to look at mars seen a stationary red lights to high for helicopters and not moving to be a plane. Clear night no clouds", "Unknown sphere seen in relatively close range moved rapidly and suddenly stopping and changing positions placement in the sky.Noticed a bright glowing object travelling along the front range of Colorado Springs, going north towards the Air Force Academy.Several minutes later, I heard several sirens in the area of Fountain Blvd. and Murray Blvd. These sirens, three to four sets were headed west on Fountain.I was outside taking a break, while at work, I turned to check the area west of my location.  Within one block, just over the Sand Creek Police Dept. I observed a very white sphere travelling from the west and heading towards my position.This sphere, started to go upwards from just above the Police station.building.  As this sphere rose rapidly, it started to glow to yellow and orange color. While rising the sphere was travelling towards my location.  A couple of people, co-workers, saw that I was intent on looking upwards and came out and observed the sphere travelling above our building.  We observed this object suddenly stop in the 11 o&apos; clock position. I walked into the building and one other guy stated that the object moved extremely fast to the 2 o&apos; clock position.  This took place within a few seconds of me walking into the building.  Within just the few seconds that I was away. The object seemed to be small in diameter and was completely still in the sky.About five of my co-workers saw the object at different stages of the sighting.", "It was treetop level and only 100 yards or less awayDriving to work early in the morning, it was still dark outside.  When I was about a mile or so from the local airport I noticed a bright light, brighter than I remember the beacon light to be.  I drove on not paying it much attention, assuming it was the airport beacon.  As I neared the airport, approximately 1/2 mile away, I noticed that there were two lights present.  There was the beacon and there was another, brighter light just behind and to the side of the beacon light.  When I  got to the point where the unidentified light was I was able to determine that it was a UFO.  I pulled to the side of the road and got out and stood by the side of the road looking at the craft.  It was just above the level of the trees, about 60 feet off the ground and it was less than 100 yards away.  I was saucer/ elliptically shaped, with bright white and other colored lights around it and underneath it.  It was making absolutely no sound.  It was about 100-200 feet in diameter.  As I was watching another vehicle drove by on the road which did not stop.  I would guess the object hadaa height of about 20-30 feet.  After watching it for about 1-2 minutes, I glanced down the road to see if another vehicle was coming so that I could possibly stop the vehicle and get a witness (no vehicle was coming)  My head was only turned for one or two seconds.  When I returned my gaze to the area of the UFO, it was gone.  I t never made a sound and when it left it must have left quite quickly and it MUST have known I was watching it, so I am under the impression that it waited until my gaze was averted before it left.((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))", "4 elliptical lit objects surrounded by a haze/halo, proceeding to individually dive, climb, zigzag. Lasted about 45 minutes.I went outside, to my backyard, at approximately 12:15 AM. I was sitting on a chair on my deck, facing east, towards Bellmore, when I noticed an elliptical shaped light/object moving at a high rate of speed across the sky, followed by another. It was not a shooting star, as I have seen those before. These were much, much larger! The objects were behind a haze that was in front of the objects. The sky had some cloud cover, but there was also clear patches of sky. The objects had a haze/halo in front of them, even in the portions of the sky that were not cloudy. At first, they passed in a straight line, with a short distance between them. One of them was brighter than the others, at times. They were larger, very much larger, than an aircraft. I called my husband to see them, and after about 2 seconds, he promptly dismissed the lights as the type of lights at a grand opening, and he went to bed. However, there was no beam going up to where the objects were, and the objects were not rounded, as grand opening large beams of light. I have seen grand opening beams, but never like what I witnessed in the sky, on Saturday night. I began to time the lights in the sky, to see if there was any kind of pattern to their movements, but there was no pattern. Another object then joined the other two, and several minutes later, a fourth object joined them. They appeared to be following each other. At this point, I didn&rsquo;t think much of it, but my curiosity riveted me to the spot, as I have never seen anything like it in my life. I live on the water, on the wide estuary that separates Merrick from Bellmore, a few hundred feet down from where Newbridge Park meets the water, so I had a clear view, with no tree line to obstruct my vision. The objects then switched from flying in more or less a straight line, to doing what I can only term as insane acrobatic type movements. They were individually zigzagging, diving, and going every which way, in steep ascents and descents. They weren&rsquo;t following each other, at this point, but each doing *their own thing*. I watched as they came together (all 4 objects seemed to meld into one), for a few seconds, and then they split apart and began diving, climbing, and crossing the sky in a way I have never seen anything fly, dive, climb, in my entire life. This scenario kept being repeated. I phoned the police, to see if there were any events that might have large lights being beamed into the sky. The police had no knowledge of any events, nor would such events be permitted at such a late hour, due to local ordinances. I went back outside and continued to watch the scenario playing before my eyes, totally fascinated. I did not feel fear, nor did I feel any strange sensations, other than an amazing curiosity. I called the police about 15- 20 minutes later, asking if anyone else had reported seeing what I saw, but no one reported it. (They probably thought I was nuts-I was beginning to think so, myself!) They asked if I wanted a car to come to my home, but I declined, as there was nothing to be done about whatever it was that was in the sky, and they would assume I was a real nut case.. Two airplanes flew over my house during this time, one small plane, and one commercial jetliner. That only served to confirm that what I was seeing was not an airplane.  The lights were as different in size and shape, as night and day, as was the altitude. I grabbed a regular flashlight, and one of those powerful beam flashlights, to see if I could duplicate what I was seeing, with the idea that perhaps it was kids playing with flashlights, across the water. With both the regular flashlight, and the beam flashlight, I could not shine a beam up without seeing the path of the beam. In another words, I saw a trail of light on the beam going up, as I was shining it, whereas, whatever was up there, had no beam leading up to it.  What ever the heck it was that I saw, seemed to be creating its own light. Furthermore, the light from the flashlight and the beam light would not go even a fraction as high as the light that was coming from these objects. My next thought was heat lightening, but this was not like any heat lightening I had ever seen. These were individual, specific lights, despite the halos around them. Heat lightening crossed my mind, as a possibility, due to the haze/halo around the objects, but then realized heat lightening was quite different than what I was observing, not being individual lights. About 12:45 I went upstairs and got into bed. My 6-foot bedroom casement windows faced the area of the sky in which the acrobatics were taking place, so I watched from my bed. At 1:08 A.M, I became so fascinated by what I was observing, that I decided to get my binoculars, so I could try to see more clearly, to try to solve the mystery that was playing out before my eyes. I went downstairs to get my binoculars, but when I came back upstairs, the objects had vanished. I am a mature adult, a 58-year-old woman, and had no drinks at dinner or after dinner, other than a diet coke. I rarely ever have a drink, and then, only a beer, on occasion. I feel like a fool reporting this, but I know what I saw, and have never seen anything like it in my entire life. I sure wish someone could find a rational explanation for what I observed.. I have not seen the objects again, since Saturday night, but I will tell you that I am very hesitant to go outside again, alone, late at night, after what I witnessed. I wasn&rsquo;t afraid, then, as my curiosity left no room for fear, that night, but now, I would not be comfortable being alone outside, late at night. I sure as heck hope you will tell me someone had an opening event with weird lights, despite the local ordinances, but I truly do not believe this was the case...", "Bright  stationary light in clear blue sky fading and reappearing in different locationsWhile driving south on 131 (St. Joseph Valley Parkway) on my way to work, the sun was just up and fully illuminating the sky.  The sky was completely clear and blue.  I noticed a very bright light brighter than a star at night to the left.  At first, I dismissed it and continued to watch the road.  Then I realized that that was not normal.  There were no stars in the sky, and it was so bright.  I looked back up to where I saw it and it was gone.  I kept watching the sky now, and then I saw it reappear on the right side of the highway.  It didn&apos;t move.  It just shone for a minute or so and then faded away.  I&apos;d keep watching and it would reappear in a different spot but in the same general vicinity, with the exception of going to the left side of the highway twice.  This happened about five or six times.  The strangest thing about it was that it was so bright and that it didn&apos;t move.  It was stationary until it would fade and reappear somewhere else.", "As large as the harvest moon on the ground,and the same colourIt&apos;s been many years since we saw this and it still bothers me.We were returning from an all night drivein movie .My sister and her husband my boyfriend and myself.We were all in one car ,they lived out on a farm in the country about  1mile outside of the city.There&apos;s a long laneway to the farmhouse about 1/4 mile.As you turn down the lane ,theres a small knoll to the right .As we turned in the lane we stopped very fast.----We sat there looking at what looked like the biggest harvest moon we&apos;d ever seen but it wasn&apos;t the moon because it was still in the sky where it&apos;s supposed to be.It was only 200-300 feet away !

The weird thing that happened was that this object swooped down in front of the SUV in front of me and the SUV broke hard.  I&apos;ve never seen an aircraft move that fast and change directions so quickly.  I woke up my wife immediately and told her that I thought I just saw a UFO.  I looked to the east to see if there was a neighboring airport in the vicnity and there was nothing out there.  I looked in my rear view mirror and saw the lights move upwards erratically zig-zagging throught the sky.  I knew for sure that was no ordinary aircraft.  Nothing to my knowledge, could move that fast and change directions so quickly.  I was hoping to catch the SUV at a gas station to ask him what he saw because it looked like he got a better view of it than I did, since he had to brake in order on to collide with it.

Although the sighting only lasted for a split second or so, he was still able to observe the light doing some very unusual things. The location for this sighting was at around Kitsilano at 4th Avenue and Maple. The witness was walking west on forth Avenue on the north side of the street when he just happened to looked up and caught sight of what looked like a star, white in color. The fellow did not want to make any assumptions, but he thought it may have been reflected sunlight. The object was rather high up in the sky. The light was traveling from north to the south and the sighting lasted approx: a second. He also mentioned that whatever it was moved incredibly fast, like a shooting star. But the unusual thing about it, the light moved very erratic. In other words the witness said it did not move in a straight line. He also mentioned if the light had of traveled in a straight line, he would not have called me to make the report. Only because it behaved so strange, he thought he would file a report. The man felt that the sighting was so strange, he wanted to know if anyone had reported seeing this. Also, if one looks at the last report I just posted for around the Vancouver area, there are some similarities and a day a part. Any connection, who knows but I think it is still worth noting. No sound was heard. Again his impression was that the light was very high up. Due to him being around a lot of large buildings in the area, he did not have a good field of view.

I went with my mom and dad to Atlantic city on a travel bus. When we were going back to where I am from (that&apos;s Elizabeth, New jersey) the bus lights went off so that everyone could sleep (it was 6:40 when we left) My mom and I tryed to sleep but couldn&apos;t, at the end my mom fell asleep but I kept looking out the window. Finally I got some sleep and woke up about 8:40 or 8:48 PM. It was night and the sky was dark, wind was blowing from the looks of it (All the windows were closed) and the cars were passing by fast. When I look at the sky, I see the moon and far away from it one star, one lonely star, I told my mom and she looked at it. Indeed it was a star... but then all of a sudden two flashing lights appear above it, way above it. The lights were blinking and I didn&apos;t take them for importance because I thought they were planes... but then 3 more appeared to the left of them, below them. I was surprised and started watching closely... Not wanting to tell my mom because she was sleeping. One of the lights that appeared earlier stopped blinking and become very bright, then went upwards into the sky, VERY fast. It was going fast and far away into the clouds. By this time I didn&apos;t think it was a plane...They had no sound (but we had the windows closed so we couldn&apos;t know.) Then the other 2 that appeared earlier went right, very fast and the others who appeared later stopped blinking and disappeared completely... Anyways... they disappeared and I went back to sleep, then woke up again and was (8:58 PM) ...and the freaking bus still didn&apos;t make it to Elizabeth... when I look out the window, there was a blinking light... and it was going down on some bushes/forest. I looked closely and 3 more blinking lights appeared near it and went upwards then to the right and finally disappeared into the clouds... I made my mom look and she was surprised that anything could move like that... There was also two jet-like planes (or maybe the same lights but closer?...) that were chasing those lights.. They were only two and they passed right above the bus... they moved like planes... so I thought they were jet-planes... they disappeared into the clouds in the direction of the &quot;light&quot; objects. I just shrugged and went back to sleep. By the time I woke up we were already back. Personally, I have never seen such sighting in my life. I mean... Maybe sometimes I see a ball of light moving then disappearing but I have never seen groups and appearances like that... I was scared! hehe... We got out of the bus, bought something to eat, went home, ate and we slept happily ever after... Then I woke up and came to this site... started writing. That&apos;s my sighting and how I left atlantic city.", "Darker than night rectangle with dim lightsStanding in fairly dark backyard in town.  Moon was rising in the east causing the sky to be less than black.  Could see quite a few stars and just a faint hint of the milky-way glow.  Mars was nice and bright in the sky to the south-east. My girlfriend and I had just seen a group of geese flying off to the west, lit up by the city lights. There were two normal aircraft in the sky, with easily recognizable marker lights.  I was looking to the north at about a forty-five degree angle when I say what I thought at first was another group of geese. I quickly figured that this was not the case by the speed of the lights.  I immediately started to track the lights by pointing with my finger so my girlfriend could see them also.  Within a few seconds the &apos;lights&apos; were straight over head.  At this point I could make out a &apos;darker than night sky&apos; shape of what seemed to be a rectangle. The rectangle had a dim / non-distinct light at each corner and one in the center. A few moments later the lights had travel far enough south as to go behind a tree in my yard. The object was approximately the size of a two finger tips at arms length.  No noise was heard (it was very still, 50 degrees, clear night).  Object was moving very quickly, esp. in comparision to other aircraft visible in the sky. Object was traveling fast enough so that my girlfriend was not able to track and see it. Was very discerning.

After the desert sun went down I began to notice a red glow in the Northeast sky that seemed to be eminating from behind the mountains.  As the sky got darker, the glow got brighter and brighter.  It was a bright blood red.  The glow covered maybe an 8th of the sky and had no defined cut-off line, but instead faded from bright to normal sky color further up.

I did not call the hotline since it may have been planes (but it must have been a huge plane and I don&apos;t know where such a plane would land) and I don&apos;t know how to check with the local airports to see if it was in fact a plane (somebody would have been tracking it, I assume). We have been going to this piece of property for 3 years and I have never seen similar air traffic- which is why I thought I would report it.", "sliver orb, seen flying with air force onei must go back to a year before this siteting,,,to explain what i originaly thought i saw. It was a sunny clear day,,i was out on the patio laying on a lounge chair and i happend to look up to a very clear blue sky,,,and saw a strange,,,oval silver object floating is best way i can describe this,,,,,it was floating fast from north to south,,,,,i watched it because i am out there all the time ,for twenty years or more and have never seen anything like this,,,it waw mesmerizing,,,,well i just told myself this must be a weather baloon, since i hadn&apos;t ever seen one before.The dates i have given are approximate,,it was during the last part of the &quot;clinton&quot; administration. The president was comming here to stay at a place called, &quot;Chautauqua Instution&quot;, this is a place he had visited in the past as govenor. This was to be some kind of meeting with dignitaries, i am not sure of the excate reason for this visit. The president flew in a day or so before the first lady, and came in on &quot;air force one&quot; hellichopter. A day or two later, Hillary flew in. I was home that day,,,,,and as the chopper carrying the first lady flew towards my home,,,,i went outside,,,on my front walkway to try to get a look at it, as this is not something that normally happens. I saw the chopper , which was realy loud come into clear view,,,,,on another clear sky day,,,,not a cloud in the sky that day,,,so i could see this , and it was flying very low,,,what i saw next,,,,was what realy caught my attention,,,,,and i couldnt stop looking at this shiney silver,,,,orb,,flying directly above the &apos;air force one&quot; chopper, that is when i thought to myself,,,this couldnt possibly be a weather balloon as i had thought the first time i saw one of these in the sky. What realy bothered me,was that i would have thought that the air space in our area would have been closed , with the first lady and airforce one flying.  I went into the house,,,,,and i couldnt help but wonder,,,,,what in hell had i just seen. How is it possible, that something would be allowed to fly,,,this close,,,,to air force one. I thought about calling someone,,,but i didnt know who,,,so i let it go,,,thinking that ,,,i couldnt possibly be the only person to see this. Its just not possible. I never heard any reports on our news about anything seen by anyone that day. All i can say,,,,,,is that god as my witness,,,,i did see a sliver oval object flying with that chopper,, right over the first lady. If it werent for that, i think i would just ignore it,,,but i felt i had to say something to someone,,,the thought of this just doesnt totaly fade awa! y. I am sure that the dates i gave that are not excate, as i dont remember excately when it was,,,,but it was in the last part of his administration. I am sure that this date can be checked in the archives of our local news paper,&quot; the jamestown post journal&quot; I have to say,,,i said nothing for fear of being ridiculed,,,,this is not something that i realy belevied in. In all the years since,,,it has bothered me to not know if anyone else had reported this that day. If there is a chance that weather balloons would have been allowed to fly that day i sure wish i knew..so i would not think about the strange siteing. This is the first time i have ever in my life seen anything odd in the sky, i hope its the last.", "Two lights in eastern sky.Friday,09/05/2003    On Thursday September 4,2003,four of us saw a big green ball of what looked like fire in the sky. Location was in Forestville CA, in the eastern sky. We were talking about what we saw to my friends husband , when we saw another light in the sky, also in the east. This one was a white light. The light  was bigger than a helicopter or an airplane light. The planet mars was in the sky to the far right. In comparison to size the green ball and the white light was double the size to mars. The ball was traveling south. Movement was slower than a shooting star. The white light was moving very slow. Location was just to the left of where the ball was, it went left, then seemed to go up real slow, then looked like it was either moving in a west direction or east. Then it went straight up very fast, and then stopped, then it just disappeared.", "Triangle or V of lights traveling fast and low with no sound at all.&quot;I was laying on my back in the backyard watching for meteors when suddenly I saw a triangle or V of lights travel from south to north at a very high rate of speed. I estimate that the craft was less than 1,000 feet in altitude but it made absolutely no sound. The lights were yellow/white in the center and red on the outside. The lights were on the sides or wings of the triangle but not on the base. There were about six or seven lights in all. It was a large object, about the size of a B-52 flying at that altitude. I did not see any surface features, all I could make out were the lights. I was laying between two houses so I only saw the craft for about 3 or 4 seconds.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Sept 13 2003 in the afternoon, between 2 or 3 pm, I was laying in my hammok in my backyard talking to my mother on the phone as I was starring into the clear blue sky.  The sky was clear, no clouds.  I was looking to the east and saw an object traveling in a  north to south direction at a constant speed, really high up.  First I thought it could be a plane but I thought it was really high and the object had no wings that I could see, it was light blue in color and it looked kind of circular I was watching it with my naked eye (realiseing I couldn&apos;t see detail), asking my mother how high planes fly at. A few minutes later, traveling in the same north to south direction as I am looking to the east, a second oject, silver in color and lower in elevation, it looked like it was traveling at the same speed as the higher blue object. I told my mother that these two objects just did not look like planes and suddenly the two objects stopped and became stationary in the sky at the elevevations they were traveling at.  I ran into my house to get my binoculars, came back out and saw they were still in the same position in the sky.  I saw with my binoculars that both objects were spheres with a glow to them.  The first light blue sphere had a slightly lighter bluish glow and the silver sphere had a white hot glow with a bit of red in it.  The silver sphere seemed to change shape alittle as it  looked like it was rotating.  The sun was reflecting off the silver object the blue sphere was really high to see any reflections from the sun.   A courious situation happened soon after the two objects had become stationary, I noticed a  red balloon that had come loose from one of the car lots by my house, it was traveling up to the position of the silver object.  It was almost like the object had seen the balloon too.  The balloon went close to the silver object and as it passed I saw that it never went higher in the sky, the silver sphere seemed to stop it from going higher.  I&apos;m guessing now but silver! sphere seemed to grab it because the baloon was not visible any more.  I watched the two spheres for what seemed to be a good 20 to 30 minutes.  I noticed the objects seemed to getting smaller but they were still in their stationary positions.  Then I lost sight of them, but remember I said courious about the balloon?  The red balloon was comming back down towards the ground,  then I lost sight of the baloon behind some houses.  I kept looking in the sky hopeing to catch sight of the two objects again and to my surprise I saw that the blue shpere (the same one or different) was now in a more northern position in the sky, still about as high as I saw it earlier.  I saw it, then it was gone again.  I could see these object with my naked eye still.  Then as I was laying on my hammok again starring stairght up into the sky,  I saw the silver shere again straight over my position flying north to south at a lower elevation then I had seen it earlier.  I don&apos;t know if it was another sphere or the same one but it was silver with the same red white hot glow.  I could see it better the second time even with my naked eye but used my binoculars too.  I was watching the silver object for a few minutes then I lost sight of it.  I know what I saw was not planes, hellicopters, balloons, swamp gas, or any other man made object.  I even entertained ball lightning but these objects acted like they were in flight and also were stationary.  My mother is a phone witness that I was seeing the objects because I was talking to her when it all started and I almost had a second eye witness, my neighbor was in his back yard while I was watching the two objects but he couldn&apos;t see them, it was about the time they were becomming even too small for me to see.  My next door neighbor said he saw a blueish sphere across the street the week before from our houses, he said is was hovering below some power lines and caused them to spark.  I looked at the power lines and they are blackened and scortched where the sparking happened.  He thin! ks he saw ball lightning.  His discription  seems kind of like  my blue sphere but I think I was looking at more than ball lightning by the way the 2 objects acted, like something or some one was piloting them.  I live by McChord AFB and Fort Lewis  I see lots of planes every day, I did see a plane flying in the area at the time, it didn&apos;t seem to see them. I know these objects are out of this world.", "UFO SPOTTED THEN CROP CIRCLE APPEARSMY DAUGHTER AND HER FRIEND WERE STANDING IN OUR DRIVEWAY FRIDAY EVENING ON THIS DATE AND MY DAUGHTER LOOKED UP AND SAW AN ENORMOUS UFO THE SHAPE OF A SAUCER/DISK.

Then about six helicopters, presumably from Edwards Airforce Base, came from our left (we were going south) and went over us and chased after it.

I asked a friend if he seen that thing over on the horizon. He looked a bit and I pointed it out. He did see it, and we both had a wierd feeling. It wasn&apos;t a helicoptor or a plane. It did spend some time moving up and down, and around the same area. Now we do have a coast guard station at the airport, and a kid who saw us looking started looking for the object. we pointed it out to him, and he just couldn&apos;t see it.I could still see the shifting of it and moving up and down. the one kid who just couldn&apos;t see it turned sour grapes and said it was a coast guard helecoptor practicing his touch and goes. I guess It could have been, but I seen something that looked like a translucent football. Almost like a floater in your eye. One other kid seen it and a few others around seemed to be watching the area but didn&apos;t say anything.To this day I have asked a few people what they thought, and nobody has ever heard of a football translucent colored ship that was seen around traverse city airport, and I probably never will.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

There was no moon and the stars were shining brilliantly.  In the same location as before, approximately 3 miles west of I-10 and some 3-5000 feet high, were 4 orange orbs, hovering.  They would occassionally disappear and reappear in the same location.  This went on for about 10 minutes when the one on the far left (south) reappeared even further south.  The second one from the north did not reappear.  Eventually, and I&apos;m not sure when, the one on the far south could no longer be seen.  I am not sure if it is due to obstruction or if it had disappeared.  I did get some pictures which are not developed yet, I will at my earliest convenience.  However, I was using an SLR and the film that was loaded.  At 400 and without a tripod at night, I can&apos;t imagine the photos turning out, but we&apos;ll see.  Anyway... I watched the two orange orbs for around 20 minutes while I took pictures.  At one point, it appeared as if there was a string of lights beneath the one remaining to the north.  The string appeared to be in parallel with my angle of view as they were extremely close together and slightly at an angle going from upper-right to lower-left.  I am guessing there were 4 or 5 in the string.  As in my previous post, they seemed to disappear when known man-made aircraft entered their airspace.  But when the aircraft left, they would reappear.  I ran out of film and turned my back on the lights to get my other camera, when I emerged the string was gone.  The single orb to the north was now very low on the horizon, lower than the mountains to the west so I know for sure they are closer.  I managed a few more photos using my truck as a resting point for the camera.  I also forgot to mention that at one point two of the orbs were very close together.  I&apos;m still a little excited by this, but hopefully my pictures will help me piece the order! of things together.  Unfortunately I have no other witnesses to corroborate my story.  Suffice it to say, they were exactly the same in shape, size, brightness, and activity as the orbs of my previous post. I am sorry that I do not have images right now, I am actually hoping that others have seen the same and can confirm what I have seen as either man-made or not.", "Flying Disk seen in Fl PanhandleI was just a child, around 8 or so, and playing in my parents backyard.  I live in a rural area, but the neighborhood I live in is fairly built up.  Because of my age, most people think that it was simply an overactive imagination, or a vivid dream that simply seemed real, but it wasn&apos;t a dream.  It was in the afternoon, about 2 hours before sunset, so there was plenty of light.  To my left were two tall pine trees, probably 80 - 120 feet high, and too my right was my house.  I was simply standing in my backyard, which is probably a tenth of an acre in size, and fairly clear, with only a few trees and grass.  I happened to look up, and coming from the west, moving east, approximately 300 ft up I saw a round, saucer shaped craft, colored like a copper penny.  It wasn&apos;t moving fast at all, maybe half the speed of a single engine plane, and making absolutely no noise at all, at least not that I could hear.  Being so young, I didn&apos;t have a very good perception of sizes, or distances, so everything is very approximate, but should be close, because I remember the event vividly.  It was probably around 30 - 50 feet in diameter, as far as I could tell and had what looked to be windows on the bottom.  Now, the windows could&apos;ve been something else, but that is what they looked like to me. There were 3 on each side of the bottom of the craft, and the reason I say they were windows is because they looked opaque...their coloration was drastically different than the actual copper color of the disk itself.  There are realistically a number of things they could&apos;ve been other than windows, but that is the best description I can give.  It simply moved from the west to the east, never moving very fast, in a straight line until it disappeared over the eastern horizon.  I&apos;ve told people about this encounter, and because I was so young, everyone feels like it was simply the overactive imagination of a child.  It wasn&apos;t, and I&apos;d take a lie detector test any day to prove it.  It was never scary, eerie, or creep! y.  It never did anything spectacular...it just flew from one side of the sky to another, in a straight line, never moving at a high speed, or defying the laws of physics by darting around.  It could&apos;ve been earthly, but I had not, nor have I ever seen anything resembling it.  I do live near both Tyndall and Eglin airforce bases, so it could&apos;ve been something from there, but again, it didn&apos;t look like anything I&apos;ve ever seen.  I know it was real.  I&apos;d be very interested in knowing whether or not anyone else in this area saw anything like I&apos;m describing in this area about the time I mention.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I remember that specifically. Victorville is 30 miles SE of Edwards AFB. While laying on the patio with my dog watching the thunderheads blowing to the NNE I noticed a dark grey, sometimes shiny object bobbing in and out of the clouds to the NW. It was stationary relative to my patio eaves so I could see it was not moving with the clouds. It was bobbing. It was stationary relative to its position over the ground, but lost and gained altitude. Here&apos;s the cool thing. Since I am a geological engineer, I know directions, relative velocities, etc., etc. I have vision so good at that time it was better than 20/10. Anyhow, I could see this object  would have been flying near and over the SE part of Edwards AFB, which is not inhabited. Here it was in BROAD DAYLIGHT!  So I got my binoculars (15 power) and was stunned to see a saturn shaped metal obect making gyroscopic manuevers in place. It was almost at the top of the thunderheads (the top of them being probably about 45,000 feet). The object turned on its side with the flat side toward me and I could see it was round with the profile being saturned shaped. Like that famous UFO photo that those goes took in South America decades ago. It had a black circumscribed ring in the bottom. Then, I noticed 3, then 4, little wispy &quot;blobs&quot; flying around it and seeming to merge with it and also fade in and out! Since the sky was crystal clear (due to the strong jet stream wind. This thing just stayed there for about 3 hours spinning (apparently), then turning verically, then sideways, etc. like it had no particular preference for what direction was considered level relative to the ground. The wispy blobs (slightly rectangular) seemed to have some kind of light energy coming out of them. As the orbs bobbed around the object they would &quot;smear&quot; themselves. Like when you move a candle and looke at it from a distance in a dark room. An Southwest Airlines (?) airliner flew on its designated flightline (maybe about 35,000 feet AGL) below the object which was about 40,000 feet. I could not believe the airliner pilots did not see this or that this flying saucer and companions did not fly away. Relative to the jetliner this think would have multiple times the size of the jet. I&apos;d say at least 6 times the length of the jetliner. Keep in mind I saw all this in binoculars very clearly. Finally, I looked for my instamatic camera and it had two pictures left. This camera did not have a zoom unfortunately. I took two pictures. Eventually, the clouds thickened and I could no longer see the object and its campaions again. The whole sighting was about 2 hours. When my wife came home I  told her about it and she did not believe me. Well, I developed the pictures and you can see the object in the photos but it is real small.  I ran the photos through Photoshop to see if I could pull up some detail and you can see it looks similar to a toy top and you can see the blobs which appear to be more like rectangles.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We had already noticed a few shooting stars and satellites, when suddenly we spotted 2 lights which were maybe as bright as the the brightest stars, which travelled from east to west, traversing the part of the sky overhead (where we first caught them) to somewhere over the horizon, where they dissolved into the light-pollution which we have in this part of the country. The thing that amazed us about it was the speed at which they travelled.. they traversed the part of the sky (about 1/3 of the firmanent) in which we could see in a matter of 3 or 4 seconds, one following the other a little bit behind it, a little off to the left. The altitude at which they were is hard to determine, but they were definately at a few kilometers&apos; heigth. The colour seemed to be a bit orangy. They looked like they were sortof disklike, since they didn&apos;t look like regular stars, which to the naked eye resemble pinpoints of light.

It had a triangle shape to it and was sitting about 800 to 1000 feet up in the sky at the north east edge of the airfield.

The object was quite a distance away (very hard to tell how far) to the WNW of Las Vegas.  It was relatively flat, disc-shaped and dark in color, but otherwise, it was far enough away that I couldn&apos;t tell what I was looking at.  I ran back in my house and grabbed my video camera, absent-mindedly not planning to tape anything, but to use the zoom to get a better look at whatever it was.  After I went back out with the camera and got it zoomed in on the object, it occured to me that taping it might not be a bad idea.  I only got about a minute and a half of video.  The object moves like nothing I&apos;ve seen before...slowly tilting side to side and front and back on a center axis.  Unfortunately, the video looks &quot;wobbly&quot; in places because of the extreme amount of zoom used, but again, you can clearly tell it&apos;s disc-shaped and possibly had either a hole or faint light source in the middle...might&apos;ve also been a reflection, as the sun was to my southwest.

So we went out to take a look and he didnt even need to show me, I saw right away what he was talking about. There were about five with one of them being either larger then the others or just closer. They all eminated from first glance what appeared to be three lighted orbs in a triangular shape and flashing/sometimes sparking off blue red and yellow lights, the red lights seemed to be on the sides(vs. the apex of the structure) It was difficult to make out how many there were because they did resemble a bright star or a planet. But the give away was the red lights on the tips and the fact that they &quot;seemed&quot; to move around. The important one to talk about it the closer or larger one...this one was off to the right (south east) of the others. It was bizarre, it also had the tripod like shape from the naked eye but when you used binoculars, you couldn&apos;t make out a shape, just flashing red blue and yellow/white lights, flashing quickly and it seemed to look like panals of lights, like six panels three on top and three on bottem with no shape in between, but from the naked eye there seemed to be shape that changed sometimes it looked like probes would be circulating around the object it also seemed like there was a hazey white area that would extend out of it like fog or steam but it would be just for an instant...also you couldnt tell if the craft was moving or not and at one time it seemed to be moving quickly towards our direction only a few seconds later to seem evern farther away then it was before, it also seemed to be &quot;dipping&quot; part of itself in and out of the clouds or the haze that it was producing, at one point the object looked as if it turned on its side and without a doubt I made out two wing like shapes that were very long and pointed they were shaped like long d! iamond shaped swords, they were narrow it made the craft look sort of geese like, but then out of nowhere its shape became enigmatic again. with out a doubt, what we saw was not a natural part of the constellation (i.e. star, planet) we just thought it might be interesting to see if  others had similar sightings and from what we see, it looks like whatever we saw tonight others in the area and south. cal have been also sighting these red blue and yellow white flashing things. well if there is any thing we can do to help let us know. Thanks. Oh our background is, well we are all twenty somethings with 2 of us having B.A. degrees with some grad school classes. I personally am a very overworked and busy single mother of three who trust me doesnt need more drama in her life then what is already present. The things that we saw (they are still there right now, same place) they were definantly strange and not anything that we could explaing through our experiences.

As I kept driving the ligts kept flying south until they stopped above i40 approx 3 miles east of us. The craft started to ilumminate the road, I could see both sides of the high way ilumminated (east/west bound lanes). As I got closer the craft turned the lights off and started heading west towards us. As it got closer I could see the lights under the craft, nothing I had ever seen before. The lights look like diamond shape and soft yellow, violet and green iluminated from them with a red light in the middle. Triangular was the shape of the craft and could not hear a sound from it. It look like it was just floating in the air. As the craft kept getting closer it started going north west until it disappear in to the trees.I know there were other vehicles comming west and few going east on this Thursday August 28 at about 11:00 pm. and probably saw the same craft in the area.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and he sounded quite convincing and objective to us.

When I looked up there was a greenish-blueish, round, glowing orb whizing through the air at an incredible speed. The speed alone canceled out the possibility of a jet, not to mention that there was absolutely no sound involved. At first, I thought that maybe it was a comet fragment, but I quickly ruled that out, as there was no streak, and also because it didn&apos;t move in a straight path; it zig zaged. Comets don&apos;t zig zag. It didnt stay for long, and was almost immediately gone. I don&apos;t know how long it was visible for, only that i didn&apos;t see it until it was leaving the area. I was urgently trying to get the driver&apos;s attention to have her get a look at the craft, but by the time she actually lifted her eyes off the road, the strangely colored light had vanished..... I found it interesting to note that that same day a friend of mine had seen another in the air at a different time, and another group of friends saw many in Tennessee, including a large lenticular cloud with glowing orbs surrounding it, that following weekend. I have the pictures they took and will develope them as soon as possible. One more thing: there was a mysterious helicopter which seemed to be trailing in the direction of the ufo I saw as described above.

Whilst on the main road we came up to a junction. I was tired and looked up only to see a HUGE circle of light above us. It must have been about about 200m across. But all I could see was a continuous line of orange light in a circle.It is quite hard to explain but easy to understand.Nobody else believed me. I was in the back. Everybody else was asleep except my dad keeping and eye on the road.When I looked back up I saw it rise vertically, then when it must have been hovering at about 1000 ft many other lights turned on, some different colours.

My daughter and I had just stopped at McDonalds and were heading home on Main Street in Sumner, Washington. As we reached the traffic light at Wood Avenue, the light turned red. We were stopped behind one car and had a view of the down town area. I looked down the street and up to the sky and seen a silver sphere high in the sky. It was gleaming cuz the sun was reflecting off of it which had caught my eye. I&apos;m not sure if it was rotating but I got the feeling it was. I am not sure of the distance but seemed to be close to the flight pattern the airplanes travel on their way to Sea-Tac International Airport. Just as I was going to bring it to my daughter&apos;s attention - it disappeared. One minute it was there, shining brightly and the next it was gone. This is the second time I&apos;ve seen a bright silver, sphere disappear in the skies but the first time was in August of this year while we were in Dresslerville, Nevada. At that time, my daughter seen it too however it disappeared to me but she swears she still could see it at which time we turned left away from the object - that day was also clear, no clouds and around 90 degrees. I&apos;ve had many questionable sightings but one amazing sighting in June of 1975 in Bonney Lake, Washington coming down Highway 410 into Sumner. That also was a bright sunny day without any clouds. This craft was silverish and saucer shaped but with a dome on top. At the bottom of the dome was huge bright lights that reminded me of strobe lights, blinking around the bottom of the dome. My stepdad (non-believer) brought it to my attention and as I looked out of driver&apos;s side window I was totally astonished to see this. This craft stayed nearly parallel with us as we almost reached the 2nd exit to Sumner. It sped up and was over the Rivergrove apartments when it just vanished. This sighting lasted about 10 minutes and I&apos;ve been searching the skies ever since.((NUFORC Note:  One of five reports from same witness.

It looked like a thousand stars in a concurve line, moving south.  It was between me and Mars because for a split second Mars was gone.

Dec. 1st 2001 a heavily advertised meteor shower was to happen with its greatest show at approx. 02:00am from the east.  I stayed up for event and it was indeed a spectacle.  As I viewed the show I noticed to the NorthEast a stationary extremely bright star or planet.  It was so bright that I wondered what planet it could be this time or year.  I braced myself against the corner of my house and took a picture of it with my digital camera with a telephoto lens at the maximum.  When I viewed the image, it didn&apos;t really present change differently from the way I viewed it with the naked eye.  So, I decided to download to my computer and then digitally magnify it.  As I magnified it, it started taking on a shape up 200X before it became distorted.  It definitely was metallic and was saucer shape.  It appears that a light is on top but may be a reflection of the sun.  I thought maybe this could be a satellite but it remained stationary and didn&apos;t move for approx. 2 hours.  I, like most people didn&apos;t report it because of the possible stigmas attached to the person reporting such things.  I feel though that it is an important picture for those concerned.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I noticed two objects in the sky near the horizon line. Both appeared to be stationary at first. I thought they were just two planes in the distance, but then thought they were choppers cause they weren&apos;t moving.That&apos;s when the lights struck me as odd, they didn&apos;t blink on and off like on most planes and helicopters. They sort of pulsed from dim to bright like the rythm of a heart beat. And there were a lot more lights on these things than I&apos;ve ever seen on a plane. I asked my brother to come out and take a look, that&apos;s when they started to finally move. One stayed stationary just above the horizon and the other began an upward climb, but it didn&apos;t just go straight up. It curved on an arching path up and over the stationary one. I would put money on it being a perfect half circle of motion with the stable craft at the circle&apos;s center. After it completed it&apos;s trip up and over it started to move in our direction. At this point everyone in my house was on the deck watching. It moved real smooth like it was just gliding across the sky.We were all dead silent, just watching this thing coast toward us. We all swear that it didn&apos;t make a sound, I mean nothing. No rotor blades chopping through the air, no propeller sound, not even an engine- just dead quiet. and it just kept going, this thing flew right over my building and we watched it go. The one that had been stationary now started to move off towards the north-east and it glided silently as well, right on out of sight.

I am familar with aircraft dating back to WWII and this was unlike any I have ever seen... It looked like a building on its side with many lights... I say it looked like a building cause the lights resembled tiny windows... Kind of like a skyscraper on its side...

The date is not exact, it was in the summer but it could have been in 84 or 86.  Also, just to clarify, when I say UFO, I mean that as strictly an unidentified flying object because that is what I saw; I make absolutely no claim that it was military, extraterrestrial, or something else altogether. My mother and I where driving into Belleville at night.  A few miles from the small airfield at Mountainview we saw a large metallic disc flying towards us from the direction of Belleville.  We slowed to a stop and watched it.  It came to a stop about 100 feet in front of us and hovered about 50 feet in the air.  My mom and I were both speechless and just watched it for about 2 minutes.  It was very large (maybe 30 or 40 feet in diameter) and it didn&rsquo;t make a sound.  I could only hear the crickets chirping in the grass.  It didn&rsquo;t have any lights around it but (this sounds goofy, I know) it had what looked like a window or a windshield of some sort.  I remember looking in it trying to see if I could see anybody.  I couldn&rsquo;t.  It was like looking into a 2nd story window of a house, all I could see was the ceiling.  It wasn&rsquo;t frightening at all; I remember only a profound sense of awe. After it had hovered there for about 2 minutes it flew off in the direction of Trenton (it&rsquo;s probably relevant to point out that there is a large military base located there).  Its flight was very smooth and extremely fast&mdash;it was gone in seconds.  The flight path of the thing was like a &quot;V,&quot; coming from Belleville, stopping in front of us, then flying toward Trenton.  I personally have never heard of any aircraft that can fly that pattern, that fast, stopping in mid air, and never make a single sound.  When it was gone, I looked over to my mom in the passenger seat and asked her if she had seen it too.  She said, &quot;Yes, but let&rsquo;s never tell anybody.&quot;  I agreed. Years later I told my sister about it and she didn&rsquo;t believe me (no surprise), so I told her to phone mom and ask her for herself.  She did and my mom said quite plainly, &quot;I don&rsquo;t talk about that.&quot;  Not corroborating evidence that would hold up in court but the fact that my mother didn&rsquo;t deny it and at least implied that there was something to &lsquo;not&rsquo; talk about convinced my sister. So that&rsquo;s what I saw.  I can&rsquo;t prove it but I swear it&rsquo;s the truth.  No little green men, no lights in the sky that would more accurately fit the description of a LEO satellite, but one very large metallic disc just hanging there in the air in front of me.

The date of the incident was July 19, 2000 around 1:00 PM. My self and an accompanied employee stopped at our 1 O&apos;clock appointment on Robinson Street in Central El Paso. My employee and I approached the front door of the residence when he noticed up in the sky next to the sun a triangular formation of three spherical dots. We stood there in auh and wondered what they were. The customer of ours answered the door to greet us. She wondered what it was we were looking at so she looked up too. Her gesture was, &quot;maybe they are Harrier Jet planes Hovering&quot;. In response I told her, &quot;Yeah, but where are the wings&quot;. These dots just hovered in that triangular formation without moving for about 10 mins. My employee went inside to see what it was she needed and I stayed there looking at them. After those 10 minutes past, there was a first visible sign of movement. The dot north of the triangular formation moved through the formation in a southeasterly direction and did not stopped until all three dots were in a single line formation. There were two dots close to one another still in their orignal positions and the third dot which had moved southeastern was further in distance from the other two. I could not believe what I was seeing. I then went inside the home to help my employee with the work. I wondered what it was I was seeing and remebered thinking to myself, &quot;is this what I think they are&quot;. I went to the back yard of the house and looked up in the sky. The two dots that were next to each other were gone and the third dot in the south was still there. But the more I looked at it, it seemed to brighten up as the powerful reflection from the sun was bouncing off of it silvery in color. It almost seemed to grow in size because of the expansion of the reflection of light. I know El Paso fairly well. I&apos;ve lived here all my life. The path that the dot had taken southeasterly was in the direction towards lower southeast El Paso. I figured that the dot maybe ! was hovering between 15,000-to 30,000 feet above the ground. Because there patches of clouds in the vicnity of the dot. The direction I was looking in was towards southeast El Paso where Zaragosa Drive is, which is about 20 miles from where I was. That&apos;s about the distance the UFO was from me, I suppose. I stood there for about 15 minutes, after that I went inside through the house to go out the front door to our service vehicle. My employee was in the back of our truck changing the locks. I looked towards the southeastern sky again and notice the dot was gone. The way El Paso is divided is like any other city. We have sections like central, west, east and northeast. The very last tip of the Rocky Mountain chain stops in Central El Paso. The mountain divides the city in two major halves east and west. From there you get the rest of the sections here in El Paso I mentioned. Well, by now I was looking in all directions at the sky and could not see a thing. My employee asked me, &quot;what was that&quot;. I told him joking &quot;maybe they were UFO&apos;s&quot;. He laughed and so did I. We continued to work. The house faced south into Mexico and we had backed the truck in to have better access from the house. My employee was changing the locks and I was standing outside the truck with my back to the north. My employee looked over to me and then he noticed a dot moving from west to east from the north slowly under a cloud that was low in altitude. He screamed to me to look. I saw the dot moving in that direction and as it reached the mountain it just suddenly turned south, traveled a small distance and stopped below another dot we had not noticed was there. I thought, these cannot possibly be balloons because there was stiff breeze west to east that was moving through El Paso. Only something with some type of propoltion can change directions like that. Looking at the two dots they seemed to be getting smaller, both of them at the same time, which meant they were traveling upward towards space. Eventually they faded out into the blue! atmosphere. After that, all of a sudden, in the same path, position and direction, maybe atltitude west to east from the north a dot was traveling again. This time it went straight over the mountain to the east and disappeared. By this time I was feeling previledge at what I was witnessing. Hard to believe, Yes, but not impossible. As we were trying to finish that job I called my uncle and told him what I was seeing. He was shocked. At that same time I looked up in the sky, because a large circular cloud covered the sun. An aurora of light on the egde of cloud emitted. If you ever seen a desert sky during the summer, the sky is very bright and hard to look up without squinting. At the northern edge of the cloud two dots appeared and stayed a certain distance from the cloud. As the cloud moved east, so did the the two dots. They seemed to dance with the cloud, but at the same time the distance between tehmselves and the cloud never changed. If the cloud slowly rotated, so did they. This cloud as it was moving still covered the sun. I was still on the phone with my uncle telling him to look up in the sky towards that cloud where the sun was. I guess where he was he could see the dots. Anyways, when the sun was about to pierce out the egde of the cloud the most northern of the two dots seemed to have changed shape as it moved south above and over the cloud. It looked as if it were tumlbing. I could see this tumbling motion because of the reflection of the sunlight from it. Then, as it reached the south side of cloud still tumbling, it literally vanished from my eyes. I did not see it fly away up, down or sideways. It just vanished. We finally finished the job and traveled to another job site. As we were driving down the road from where we were, I could still see those dots traveling in all directions. I was dismayed and disarrayed but, I felt wonderful and previledged to have witnessed the most beautiful thing I have ever seen in my life (other than my child being born). Before this incident I always looke! d up in the sky, not because I was trying to find UFO&apos;s, but because I love jets. I never stop looking up, but now I know what to look for and where. The reason I say this, is because I have seen on eight different occasions after that day, the spherical type of UFO phenomenon. How beautiful!!", "Bright light seen above Los Angeles...fades and moves northerly at high speedThis sighting was in the eastern sky at approximately 45 degrees above the horizon.

I immediately ran out to see what everybody was looking at. I looked up and saw this large slow moving craft that made a low rumbling sound, like a passenger jet at 30,000 feet. The craft had a flying wing appearance with 4 red lights on the trailing edges, 2 on each side spaced evenly across its wingspan. 4 white lights in a diamond pattern were focused near the center and were equally as bright. It was flying slow enough and/or low enough that the sound was not delayed but seemed to emanate directly from the craft. Holding my hand out above me, the craft was about 2 inches wide in the sky and was moving at a rate of 1 inch per every 2 seconds, and seemed to be accelerating. After about 30 seconds of watching it move in a straight line across the sky, 2 aircraft which appeared to be F15&apos;s were moving in on its location at very high velocity. Once both reached the craft one F15 followed off the crafts left wing, and another directly behind it. Both of these F15&apos;s had noticeable wing tip lights and a center flashing light, standard to military aircraft. In the distant we could still hear the low rumble of the craft yet no sound from screaming the F15&apos;s, which suggests they were too far away too hear, which would also imply the scale of this craft was enormous. After another minute or so, we could still see the flashing lights of the following F15&rsquo;s in the distant, while another F15 flew overhead at very high velocity toward the craft in the distant. From then on we saw an occasional pair of F15&rsquo;s which looked to be in a search pattern across the sky. Not more than a half hour later 4 military aircraft flew over head in a formation that looked similar to the craft that flew over, yet only a single white light in the center, one red light to the right, and 2 red lights way too far off to the left. All had flashing lights. They looked as though they were trying to &ldquo;copy&rdquo; the lights of the first craft. A! lthough, it was obvious these were F15&rsquo;s or similar because they were traveling at much higher velocity and the delay of sound was very long. Within a time span of an hour, 2 more F15&rsquo;s had circled around and met up with yet another formation of five F-15&rsquo;s that closer matched the look of the first craft, yet even this time it was obvious again that these were more F15&rsquo;s in a V-formation at high altitude, high velocity, and long delay of sound.((NUFORC Note:  Second report from different witness.  PD))", "An elderly couple living on Bold Road, just off Buck Flats Road reported that they watched a very strange object hovering over top of Pea Cock mountain. The wife was alerted to it first, then called her husband to come and watch. They told me that lights would be seen running around the outside of the object, but it was hard to make out the actual shape of the craft. More round in shape they guessed. As the object was very close to their location, they said not a sound was heard coming from it. As they observed the object, it did move along the top of the mountain for approx: a kilometer. It stopped and dropped down behind the mountain rather quickly. That was the last time they saw the object that night. The on September 3, 2003 at approx: 11:45 p.m. the same object showed up over the mountain, but more towards the south. This time the object did not move in any direction and was observed for approx: 6 to 8 seconds before it dropped out of sight. Again no sound was heard, and the object, or light coming from it was extremely bright. Both of the witnessed said they have never witnessed anything like it before, and was really surprised to see this strange object which they have no explanation for. HBCC UFO Note: This was certainly not a star, or Mars. The second date of the sighting the object was a good height off the top ridge of the mountain, and if a star it would have taken sometime to drop down and out of sight. Also I asked the local helicopter businesses to see if they had any flying in the area at the time of this sighting. There was none flying at that time. Everything was shut down before dark. Thank you to the witnesses for their report.

I was contacted a while back by a gentleman by the name of Mark who had told me he had some excellent footage of a UFO, or an unknown object which he took on August 11, 2003 using his new JVC mini DV, GR-d90 camcorder. Mark&apos;s wife was the first to take notice of the unusual object.  She was standing in her kitchen at the time. She moved quickly onto the deck of the family&apos;s home and was surprised, or should I say shocked to see an unknown object hovering over the trees close by. She said it flipped over and it turned a bright blood red. She screamed to her husband to come quick to watch this strange thing in the sky. As he arrived on the deck he saw a cigar shaped object.  He thought quickly,  ran back into their home and grabbing his brand new camcorder he scanned the sky for the object and began filming. Eventually when he lost sight of the object he went back inside and played the tape over and over.  To his surprise and everyone else&apos;s .. what he saw completely shocked him. Mark quickly contacted Peter Davenport at the NUFORC in Seattle, Washington in the United States to file a report and told Peter what he had caught on tape. Mr. Davenport passed the report onto myself (HBCC UFO Research) and Gavin McLeod. Gavin made arrangements with Mark to visit him  and take his report and to view the video footage. A couple of days after speaking with Gavin, Mark sent out a portion of the footage to myself, Gavin McLeod, Mr. Jeff Rense and a number of others who may have found the Quick Time Player UFO footage of some interest.  Many did find it interesting but one  immediately ruled it as &quot;a helium filled foil balloon&quot;. &quot;This material below is from my observations of this tape.&quot;  Mark and I corresponded and discussed the video footage. In one of our telephone conversations he mentioned that he&apos;d not bothered to slow the tape down. When the running speed of the footage was slowed down greatly, some interesting things started to appear. Mark suggested sending me a copy of the original tape he&apos;d filmed so that I could have a better look at it.   When it was slowed down it was apparent that this was no ordinary &quot;helium filled balloon&quot;. As the fellow started filming, the object drops down from the sky, then enters from the top of the screen.  Mark at this point has the camcorder zoomed in and catches the object making sharp turns as it goes down, moving to the right, then back to the left, drops down, moves right and back to the left, always making sharp movements downwards until it disappears very quickly........ Mark was still filming when the object left his view.... however when the film was seen slowed down .... it was still there. It had moved rapidly across the sky. One blink and it would be missed !   Suddenly in the distance one can clearly see it re-appearing and entering the camera&apos;s field of view looking like a white dot in the sky. As it travels a great distance to the east, over a good portion of the sky, with a reflection that could have been caused by the sun ...  it finally disappears. What it does next is very interesting.  From out of the east (its position where it disappeared) .. it reappears, still glistening, and travels west at a steady pace.  At one point it makes a complete stop.!!!  Then it moves south towards Mark&apos;s position.   When using the Quick Time Player to view his footage one can notice that Mark zooms in on the object and catches what looks like an aura surrounding it ... for a short period of time.  He also films what may be the underside of it, until it slowly moves away, turning on its side, taking on a clear saucer shape and  it appears to be discharging a dark unknown substance.  The strange discharge occurs  twice.  One from the left side of the object and the other from the right. Again Mark tries to find the object in the sky but can&apos;t seem to locate it. He zooms back out and finds nothing.  He continues his search  zooming out and in and for a split second he captures it once again in the very spot he was searching and where previously there was nothing.  The camera again picked the object up and it seemed to come out of nowhere and was gone again as quickly as it appeared. Regarding the Quick Time Player internet clip..... I have heard a number of things about the footage, but not once have I heard anyone mention the discharge which comes off the object just after it flattens out and before it disappears from view  (or when the object is lost due to Mark trying to focus in on it). If you take a good close look at the internet footage, you will notice two of these types of discharges , one to it&apos;s left and the other to its right. )  I found it interesting when viewing the footage that the day before, on August 10, 2003, Mark was filming his family&apos;s visit to the Abbotsford Airshow, which is a major happening every year and draws aircraft from all over the world.  The video footage clearly shows an aerial display of known aircraft  taking place the day before the sighting happened. One other note I would like to make, which I found to be very important also, was the remark made by Mark&apos;s mother-in-law who was speaking in her native Romanian tongue as she watched the object perform in the sky.  She made a comment and Mark translated for me... &quot;the bottom of it has turned brilliant bright red&quot;. Conclusion:  1. The object makes extreme sharp maneuvers.2. The object travels at a great distance and then returns from the direction it came from.3. At one point in the video, the object comes to a complete stop and hovers.4. The bottom of the object changes it&apos;s color to almost a blood red.5. The object ejects  a black substance on two occasions.6. In some parts of the film it travels at an extreme rate of speed.7. In one portion of the tape the object looks like it has an aura around it.8. There were a number of witnesses to this sighting. What the object is for sure I am not certain.   It was extremely interesting, extremely puzzling, and who knows what it was.??  I spent hours viewing the video .. over and over again.... at all types of speed to try and determine what it might have been .. all to no avail.   I enjoyed it immensely and found it very exciting.   With Mark&apos;s permission I will be forwarding it on for further examination.

I was about 10-15 miles outside of Monroe heading into Monroe.  There is a couple of stoplights at this point on 522 that is famous for traffic backing up, and I was approaching one of these stoplights around 4pm or so, slowing down, when I witnessed the sighting.  At first glance, I thought it was a shooting star (thinking to myself, &apos;but in the middle of the day, so visible?)  when I quickly realized that instead of streaking across the sky in the upper atmosphere, this was much closer, as low you might expect a small airplane to be that was starting a landing approach (5-10k feet?).  It was a massive fireball, a large burning mass followed be a long tail of fiery debris burning off. It was falling to the earth, and lasted only several seconds before it dissapeared over the trees on the horizon.  This highway is well wooded in this area, almost a path or corridor cut into the forest, and anything moving in the sky would dissapear out of your line of sight beyond the trees on either side, unless the object was heading the same direction as the highway, in which case you&apos;d be able to see it longer until it disappeared over the horizon ahead beyond the trees rather than either side of the highway&apos;s close forested sides. this object&apos;s falling path did indeed follow the corridor of sight of the highway stretching out ahead of me, until disappeared over the treetops of the horizon. So I got a good 5 second look at it, luckily as it traveled the same direction overhead of the stretch of highway I was on.Were I not in a car, I probably would&apos;ve seen it much longer from behind me as well, as opposed to just when it just got ahead of me and cleared into the view of my windshield.  From my vantage point, as it streaked and fell and disappeared beyond the trees on the horizon, the trajectory to me looked like it was falling only 10-15 miles ahead of me, like in dowtown Monroe!  In retrospect however, given my untrained eye, what looked like falling in front of me could&apos;ve really been a much flatter slope and just streaking across horizontally out in front of me, and really hitting earth 100 miles away or more.  I am not real good at judging the three dimensional trajectory when I&apos;m below it looking up at it in really a two dimensional perspective.  Either way, it was extremely low to the ground and like nothing I&apos;ve ever seen before.  After my initial reaction of a shooting star was exluded, my next thought was that it was a meteorite falling to earth, basically like a shooting star that made it all the way down to here. I also entertained the idea that it was a plane crash or other air disaster (army experiment gone wrong, bad rocket launch, poorly aimed satelite or other man made space device falling from orbit, my imagination really took off in that small instant!), as the fiery mass trailing smoke, flame, and burning off pieces of debris reminded me of some of the pictures I saw with the recent space shuttle tragedy where pieces or wreckage were scattered, falling to the earth in a fiery mass trailing fire and debris with striking similarity to the object I witnessed.  However, it mostly resembled a meteorite to me.  It moved at an incredible rate of speed, a speed that I never thought possible, faster than any plane I&apos;ve ever seen, including the Blue Angels fighter jets that do an annual airshow in seattle.  The main fireball mass also seemed very large, too large to really be any sort of plane or wreckage.  It was a jaw dropping experience, one that made me cry out &quot;what the #@%$ was that?  Holy *#&amp;$! ! Did you see that?&quot; only I was the only one in the car, so I began looking around to other motorists as someone to share this incredible experience if any of them saw it too, but by them traffic started to move and I couldn&apos;t get a good look at anyone&apos;s face to sense anyone with similarly astonished expressions.  Wherever this thing fell, I wish I was there to see it, as it would be incredibly interesting I&apos;m sure.((NUFORC Note:  Many reports about this event.  The object is thought to have been a dramatic meteor over central or northern British Columbia.  PD))", "Observed bright object increase in luminosity and fade(like explosion)At 9:02cst I was looking up off of my balcony while I was smoking a ciggarette and saw what appeared to be a very bright star at about 60 to 75 degrees in the southern part of the sky. This &apos;Star&apos; was very bright, as bright as Mars is at the present time, which is what attracted me to it. I thought that this &apos;Star&apos; was Mars but I knew that mars was more to the SE, as I found on a quick look in that direction. The &apos;Star was also a bright Blue-White color. As I watched, the luminocity of this &apos;Star&apos; doubled and then tripled, all in the space of less than a second. after that it seemed to fade inward, with the center of it being the last to disappear. All of this happened in the space of 1 to 4 seconds. It looked like an explosion at an extremely high altitude. I heard no report or concussion.((NUFORC Note:  We have checked the &lt;www.heavens-above.com&gt; website, and no Iridium satellite was visible from Omaha, NE, for the time and date indicated.  PD))", "I am a TRUCK DRIVER ( HAY HAULER ) ..  I had just got loaded with hay in Tacna and ingressed onto the freeway ( INTERSTATE 8 ) and instantaneously i noticed bright balls of bright pumpkin orange-colored balls of light over in the southeast part of the sky. They were maybe 10-30 degrees above the horizon and almost always under the planet MARS !!  These ships put on a spectacular light show for me. They would dim out then light up very brightly then dim out and continue doing this. I witnessed this MAJOR SIGHTING for 1 hour and 25-minutes for a span of approx. 45-miles !!!!  The most spectacular light show occurred at EXIT 78 (AZTEC EXIT ) .  I contacted Highway Patrol(TUCSON) and I was informed that multiple reports of these UFOs were being called in.. H.P. called Luke Air Force Base and was informed that the military was out in that area conducting training exercises but always remember how much we can trust the AIR FORCE, right ??  When i stopped my rig at the AZTEC exit 4 of these craft were EXTREMELY close to me and absolutely NO SOUND emanated from them and they all dimmed out in sequence. At the time I was witnessing most of this event, I was on my cell phone with a famous UFO researcher up in Wisconsin and based upon what I was telling him, he said I was seeing the real thing ( authentic Extraterrestrial craft ).((NUFORC Note:  Several other reports of yellow, or orange, lights seen in Arizona.  The AZ Highway Patrol units in Yuma and Tucson have reported that their facilities had contacted the U. S. Air Force, and that they had been told that military units had been conducting exercises.  Whether the observed lights were over military facilities, or not, we do not know, but we doubt that the military would be launching pyrotechnic devices over dry desert terrain.  PD))", "One large bright light, very low, in the Southwest part of sky, light dimmed, then seemed to turn into 3 smaller black craft that followed tree lines and the tops of rooves silently and slowly.  This was witnessed by myself and my husband.", "I am an Internal Medicine physician and my girlfriend ownes a linen business. For some reason we awoke around 2:30 am we awoke and sat on our oceanview balcony looking at the stars and shrmp boats on the water. We enventually ended up walking on the beach. Around 3:15am we witnessed 3 lights closely spaced in a vertical position then a few minitutes later it was in a horizontal position. It did not move or give off any noise. I felt as though we were being watched so I said we needed towalk back to our room which wass 30 min away. The object we observed then turned and flew silently over the lowland country of South Carolina. When we saw it fromthe side it appeared tiangular with a white light in each corner. A red light seemed to blink alternately from top to bottom. I estimmate we probably a mile away from this object and it was around a half mile above the ground. After it dissapeared over the horizen we wittnessed a dozen shooting meteors in the shy. We are convinced we saw some sort of UFO.((NUFORC Note:  We will attempt to contact the witness to confirm the report.  PD))", "-1MAG or brighter object low in north/northwestern sky moves downward about 2 to 3 deg growing fainter then disappearsObserved bright light (-1MAG or brighter) in north/northwest sky about 8-10deg above horizon. Instantly caught my attention because I was unaware of any star or celestial object approaching that illumination so far north of the ecliptic this time of year. Object was white to light blue in coloring and, initially, appeared to be stationary relative to landmarks and visible stars. After several seconds of viewing noticed object (very) slowly drifting downward. Initially thought object was aircraft (Arlington Regional Airport is about 5 miles South of my location) as I often see approaching aircraft displaying landing lights. The object slowly moved roughly 2deg to 3deg downward toward the horizon rapidly becoming dimmer as it moved. After approximately 20 seconds it was too dim to be visible to the naked eye. The object was not flashing, I could see no other lights of any color. The object did display a slight &quot;twinkle&quot; but it was not a prominent flicker. I could not discern a visible trail of any kind.", "family and i seen objects of light moving and hovering south west of downtown light had a tail the first object looked like a tear drop then it change smaller like the  others objects in the air but it was way different in activeties. color i noticed goldish yellow,red ,and white . some photo&apos;s were takin also", "Fireball above Spokane AirportThis was not a UFO sighting, but a huge fireball in the sky, close to the ground.  It was the largest meteor I have ever seen (by at least ten times), or it may have been a sattelite.  It appeared out of the left corner of my eye as I was driving in the dark, bright enough to draw my attention away from the road.  It appeared to be directly over Spokane Airport, or possibly to the south of the airport.", "I had a telephone call from a couple who resides in Airdrie, Alberta and they have informed me that they saw a very strange object over a two night period. It also came back on another occasion a few days later but did not stay in the vicinity very long. I talked with the fellow (retied military man) first of all and this is his report he gave me. The object at one point sat straight over top of their home and was the size of a baseball. The witnesses location is a little south west from Airdrie on the west side of Highway #2. The color on the object changed from white to orange and back again. The object did turn a brilliant blue at one time. The fellow said it was stationary over his home for minutes, then could move from east to west and continue carrying out these types of maneuvers. The fellow actually thought the object was intrigued with the fire they had going in the backyard. He told me the total amount of time the couple watched the object was around two hours. (HBCC UFO Note: Due to the large amount of time the object was witnessed, I asked if the object moved with other astronomical bodies in the sky, and the fellow said no !) He said whatever it was, was moving all over the sky. To make it clear, whatever they were looking at, I was told when they looked away, then looked back at the object, it was in a different part of the sky. Then would make it&apos;s move back to where it came from. Both of the witness thought it moved to get out of the way of air traffic as there were aircraft active in that area. They also watched the object move up and down, then move far over to the right, drop down a ways, then move back to the left. (HBCC UFO Note: Both of the folks used the roof of their home as a referrerence point so they knew how far the object moved to the left, right and up and down. At some points in this sighting, they would lose sight of it due to it dropping behind the roof, but it would rise back up again. He took a guess and figured the object was sitting at approx: 5000 feet and could see the roundness of it. He told me there was sound coming from it. He described it like being a vent people have on the top of their roofs. (the rotating kind, but the sound was at a very low level). Also when the sound was heard, lights would come on around the circumference of it. I also asked if they had any pets who were with them at the time of the sighting. He said yes. The fellow told me in his words, the three cats went a little squirrelly. He said they seem to cower down, ears fell back and two of then started to hiss. HBCC UFO Note: The below information comes from the gentleman&apos;s wife. I will not give out what her occupation is as it could cause problems if this information came out. The wife told me the object would have been located approx: 5,000 feet in altitude as she has knowledge of how the aircraft fly in and out of the airport. She said it was certainly hovering around the airport area and the night was very calm and silent. She also confirmed the object did make a strange low pitched noise which she thought was rather eerie. From what she observed, she could see white lights running around the object and another light sitting at the bottom of the craft and it would change from orange to blue. When the object moved in any direction all the white lights went out, but the light at the bottom did stay on, when the object came to a complete stop, the white lights running around it came back on. She said it was definitely round in shape. She said they both thought they were seeing things and did not want to tell anyone about it due to others thinking they were crazy. But it sounds like to me the witnesses had a good seat for an exciting display. Thank you to both of the witnesses for their report.

Circa 0500 on Saturday 16 August 2003 I was picking up a loaded trailer from a warehouse at McClellan AFB / Industrial Park in northeast Sacramento, California.  At the time it was still dark, there were no other persons or traffic observed inside McClellan, and the industrial parking lot area where this happened was very well lit. I had picked up my load and was driving out slowly when I noticed an unexpected light formation in my left mirror.  I watched for a short time.  I am accustomed to commercial airline traffic from Sacramento International, and the now sparse military traffic into and over McClellan.  This one caught my attention because it was on the wrong course for normal traffic out of SAC, the wrong time of day for traffic into McClellan, and too low and slow and too bright.  It was unusual enough that I stopped the truck, shut down the engine, and got out to have a look. The aircraft or UFO approached from NW, bearing est. 315 degrees, directly for McClellan.  This is east and north of normal flight paths for departing traffic out of SAC.  It was also too low for departing SAC traffic, and not climbing.  As it approached, I could see that it was low, est. altitude no more than 1,000-1,500 feet, and slow, est. speed about 100 kts.  It approached and made a button-hook turn south, then east, then est. due north, over the south part of McClellan, with a turn radius est. 1/2 mile, then departed est. due north until it was out of sight without climbing. While over McClellan it was for approximately 30 seconds sufficiently well lit by the parking lot lighting to get a good clear look.  The AC/UFO was a flying wing - no fuselage, no empennage.  The wings were swept at an angle of 90 degrees at the apex, and very long, est. 200-300 feet, with a high aspect ratio.  Near the tip of each wing were two very bright white lights shining directly down, and at the apex were two very bright white lights shining directly down, one of each pair near the leading edge, one near the trailing edge.  There were no position lights visible (green and red on right and left wing tips, respectively, red and white at tail - since there was no tail), which I believe conclusively proves that this was not an &quot;ordinary&quot; AC, since all are required to display position lights at all times (except military ops in restricted airspace).  There were no strobe lights, and the visible lights were not landing lights, since they pointed straight down, not forward. There was enough ambient light from the very bright parking lot industrial lighting, and the AC/UFO was low enough, that the underside of the wings could be clearly seen to be either white, or light gray or light blue. The AC/UFO flew nearly directly overhead, at a straightline distance of no more than est. 1,500 feet from where I stood, and was silent - or at least inaudible at 1,500 feet.  No engine noise of any kind.  Definitely not a helicopter!  My hearing is very good, my vision is 20/15 as of my last physical, June 2003.  Total time of observation est. 3-4 minutes.  When I got back in the truck the clock time was 0506.((FOLLOW UP COMMUNICATION FROM WITNESS))PeterDidn&apos;t share with anyone there, just several friends.  McClellan is decomissioned and is now an industrial park, the only remaining military activity is a clinic and civilian contractor aircraft maintenance.  Nobody else around as far as I could tell while I was there.It was an interesting siting.  I have a private pilot&apos;s license, and have been an airplane watcher as long as I can remember.  It didn&apos;t take long to realize that this was something I hadn&apos;t seen before.  Whether it was a &quot;real&quot; ET UFO, or a classified military or experimental type, I have no way of knowing.  But big, slow, and silent, without position lights, and on an unusual flight path, sure got my attention.((END))", "Object chased by military helicopters.I just posted a sighting report for September 3, 2003 which came from a witness who resides in Barriere, British Columbia. A witnessed watched a extremely large craft fly quickly overhead. Just tonight I had a telephone call from the same folks. The man&apos;s wife was outside tending the farm animals and her husband was with her. He takes his video equipment with him on many occasions as he is a sky watcher and does catch some good footage of different things. He also caught some great footage of the forest fires which were burning in the Barriere area. Tonight on September 10, 2003 at 8:50 p.m. the couple heard a sound coming from the north, when they looked towards that area of the sky they saw a bright white light heading directly in their direction and it passed soundless over top their farm. Both stood speechless ! They looked again towards the north where they could still hear the sound coming from, which at this point was growing louder and louder as it approached their location. Seeing the fellow was so shocked to see what just went over top of them, meaning a large silent bright white light, he never thought to &quot;try&quot; to take a bit of footage. But he did say the white moved very quickly and was soon out of their line of sight due to the surrounding area. But as the sound from &quot;something&quot; else drew closer and at this point was at the edge of the farm, he started rolling video tape and was surprised to see two large military helicopters fly low over head. He said I don&apos;t know what one would call the make of the helicopters, but the two of them were really large and flying in the same direction the light was heading. The witness also told me he has good equipment for his camera and did catch the two helicopters on film. (The footage will be making it&apos;s way to me as soon as he can get a copy made up). (HBCC UFO Note: Due to myself knowing there is a fire in that area, I asked if the aircraft the witnesses saw were anywhere near the fire. The fellow said the helicopters were not even close to the area where the fire is burning. The fire is burning way up on the Bonaparte area and the two helicopters should have been way west of these peoples farm. I also asked one of the witnesses if he knew of any helicopters flying at night due to the fire activity in the area. He said he knew of none flying at night. He did say the run of the mill helicopters are seen a lot during the daylight hours but no military helicopters have been seen in the area. He also added there are military personal in the area and many of us would have heard of this on the news. There are a good number of Canadian troops on the ground fighting these awful fires through the province. I also asked the witness how bad was the fire in the area, and he told me it wasn&apos;t bad at all. (There is a bit of important information I cannot give out as it could lead back to one of these witnesses. This bit of information is key to knowing what is flying and isn&apos;t). Something else which stuck me as odd. A shor time ago the media, along with the general public were at one location taking pictures of the forest fire. I was told the RCMP showed up and took everyone&apos;s film away from them. I also have heard from people in the Vernon area that the military is buzzing around. Matter of fact the witnesses in Vernon, B.C. said it was if they were on some kind of alert. I telephoned the Kamloops airport tower just after I talked with the witness, but the airport operations were closed for the night as all I got was an answering machine telling me the hours they operated in. So I will be calling them back first thing in the morning to see if I can get any information on aircraft flying in that area at the time of the sighting. I will also try the Comox military base on Vancouver Island to see if they are flying military choppers in the Barriere area. So what we have is a bright white light/object flying low over top of the witnesses farm, followed by two military helicopters following at a distance behind the soundless light. ------  I was just typing this report up, and in came another from Cranbrook, British Columbia and a number of people saw something very strange in the sky September 9, 2003. So I should have the information on this very soon and posted.

It was silver in color and had extremely bright lights.  One of the lights was yellow.  While driving I called a family member on my cell phone.  I stopped to look at it and describe what i was seeing.  Then the disk took off.  But, while I was still on the phone my uncle went outside to look for it and he spotted it.  When i approached the street that it was on, to look at it again it disappeared.  I drove around town to look for it, but could not find it, 4 other people (including my uncle witnessed this event)", "Shifting formation of amber lightsA little bit of background info:  This experience happened in about mid-summer of &apos;01, before we moved out of our old house.  It was situated on a nice, high hill, with a beautiful view of rural PA and a very dark western sky.  I was a hobbyist stargazer growing up in such a nice dark sky, so I have a rudimentary knowledge of sky measurement. I occasionally liked to look out my window and stargaze for a bit before going to bed.  Around 11 pm or so one night, I happened to look out and notice an odd sight:  5 or 6 bright amber lights, ranged widely-spaced line on a rising angle of perhaps 15-20 degrees to the horizon.  The lowest, most southern light was perhaps one fingerwidth from the horizon, while the highest northern one was about three fingerwidths. The lights were all sort of.. drifting in their line, upwards and northern slowly in their line.  Then, the most northern light suddenly speeded up and faded off into apparent nothingness.  The rest of the lights continued to move along the path, until the second light was in the position of where the first had been.  A new light then faded in in the southern end, apparently slowing down from come speed, and took the hindmost position. I watched this, and another shifting, for perhaps five minutes, then went down the hall and knocked on my parents&apos; door.  They called my brother, and all four of us watched this for another five or ten minutes or so out of their large bedroom window.  I went and got my pair of binoculars to try and see if there were any other identifying lights on the objects.  I could see none, but I noticed either some sort of odd fuzziness or atmospheric distortion, as if they were at least a good few miles away. My parents got bored and shooed my brother and I out of the room.  So I went back to my own room and watched the &apos;scene&apos; for another few minutes, the objects rotating in their line another two times, until all of the lights sped up and faded out of view from their then-present positions, and not returning. Between the first sighting in &apos;01, and when we moved in spring &apos;03, I&apos;ve seen the same objects doing various boring things (cruising slowly just over the horizon and fading in and out, speeding up etc, singly and in pairs) four or five times.  I&apos;d grown a bit used to it, but the memory still sends my hackles up, as they say.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "Red &amp; White TriangleAs I was driving on the freeway between Gilroy and San Jose, Ca. I saw a bright white object (plane) on the side of the freeway. It was bright with several lights and looked like an odd lobster shape. The lights were at varying intensities of white light, sometimes becoming more intense and then a lighter dull and changing (very slowly). It was flying at such odd pace (kind of stopping and starting and very slow). Then as it made it&apos;s way over the freeway it turned and came towards the cars on the freeway. It stopped and hovered over the freeway. It was very close! with bright white and red lights. Then I saw it was triangular in shape. It was very still as it hovered the freeway and then I passed underneath it, the red lights were illuminating the entire bottom of the triangle and at each corner of the triangle was a bright white light. I saw directly underneath it as I drove underneath this hovering triangle and after I passed underneath it I turned around to look back at it and it disappeared. All that I saw was one bright white light that became bright in intensity and then flickered out. Also there were many other planes (objects) in the sky.", "I was looking up in the night sky, when I noticed some objects moveing of to the left of rio casino.I focused on them thinking they were birds, I relized that the objects were moveing faster than I think birds move. It was the way they moved, jeting back and forth kind of like they were danceing,or playing together in a small pattern. The color of these object&apos;s was kind of silver metallic,or gray. It was hard to tell because of the fact that they jeted around so fast. I would say they were about 1/2 mile up at the most,and egg shaped.And they stayed in a tight pattern. They never came to complete stop. And they were solid, could not aany lights comeing from them. You know that vegas has a lot of light and distraction, I just happen to be looking i the right area.

Some stars were beginning to appear in night sky. A bright light caught the corner of my eye. It was in the North, maybe 2 miles from me, higher and larger than a helicopter could be but lower than any planes would fly in that area. It really just looked like a bright shinning blob. It was moving very slowly upward and away from me. I looked at it at least 20 seconds. Then it flew away FAST heading North and sligthly upward, getting smaller very quickly and finally disappeared. I really can&apos;t explain it. Sometimes you think &quot;gee was that a UFO?&quot; but there is logic that brings on doubt. This one has no logic.", "3 triangular shaped ufos over an empty field in Riverside, CA with beams of light searching the field; no noise, no wind, not coptersOn the way home from grocery store, saw lights going off an on over an empty field in Riverside, just outside our housing tract.  pulled to side of road to try to see what it was; window was down and there was no noise, as from a helicopter.  Looked up and saw 3 triangular shaped ufos, looked like very heavy metal, no noise, no wind, just beams coming from one going off and on as if searching for something in the field.  All 3 started moving very slowly across the field and I watched them as they crossed over the highway below and slowly disappeared.  I can draw what they looked like, rough sketch, but saw another drawing by someone else many years later on a television special, not same time or area though.  My daughter was with me at the time but she was only 5 or 6, don&apos;t remember exactly, and she only has vague memory of this happening.  Went home right afterward and told my husband about it; he believed me because he knows me.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "My partner and I were working late one evening and arrived at our house at 3:00 am. Every night we put out cat food for the wildlife that live behind our house. As we were standing outside smoking a cigarette and waiting for the raccoons to come out, my partner mentioned how nice and clear the sky was. She told me to look at a particular star that was much bigger and brighter than the others. As we both looked at this star, we noticed that it was glowing. I had never seen a star glow like this...all of a sudden this star turns a red color and then a greenish color and then back to a white glow. We start trying to figure out whether this may be a weather balloon or some kind of plane but it&apos;s not moving. As we are talking we see much much higher up....another star doing the same. Automatically we assume this may be some kind of satelite giving off signals..which is really interesting to us, being that we had just moved from a big city and have never seen anything like this. We kept our eyes on this communication for about 5 minutes....all of a sudden this star starts to move from left to right. I think for a moment that it can be our eyes playing tricks on us....and I quickly position my self under a tree. I know for sure that this star was moving because I have a tree branch to help me figure that out. The object or star is moving while the tree branch is still. The bigger and closest star quickly dissapears and then reappears...I tell my partner not to move that I&apos;m going in to get a camera because what we were watching didn&apos;t seem normal. I come out and take at least a dozen pictures on a digital camera. We were out a total of 35 minutes watching this. Watching these 2 stars communicating, moving etc....I don&apos;t know what it is we were watching..but the reason why I am posting this experience is because there are 2 things that don&apos;t make sense. #1 the objects/stars disappeared a minute from each other. #2 The camera only picked up the stars (although very blurry) surrounding the one cha! nging colors, but not the one that was changing colors.", "Lights in the sky over CuracaoThe 4 of us were on vacation this last week in Curacao, a Carribean island approx. 50+ miles off the coast of Venezuela. We were staying on the east/south east side of the island. Sitting on the beach at about 10-10:30 pm we all four noticed what we thought were 2 falling stars traveling downward from north-west to east-south-east at approximately a 50-60 degree angle. We watched these white stars/lights fall for several (5-8)seconds, long enough for everyone to comment how cool it was to see 2 falling stars at the same time traveling parrell to one another. Then, faster than I have ever seen any object in the sky move before, these 2 light-objects simultaneously changed direction and headed upward (south) at approximately a 120+ degree angle, &quot;bowed-out&quot; away from each other then joined back parallell to each other, then in what was literally a blink of an eye the lower-left object shot outward (east) at an approximate 95-110 degree angle away from the 2nd object, then both objects were gone. As the four of us were discussing what we&apos;d just witnessed and debating what the objects could have been, a single light came out of the sky from the south heading northward and shot across the sky in a waivering-undulating pattern.I am a 44 y/o man who works for a major telecommunications corportation as a Corporate Account Manager, my wife is 43 y/o and works in accounting for a fortune 500 company, my best friend is a 38 y/o professional real-estate agent and his wife is a 44 y/o registered nurse. None of us has ever witnessed anything like this before in our lives or know of anyone else who has. We all agree that these lights/objects traveled and moved at speeds, patterns, and angles much differently from anything we have ever seen before.", "Rotating, opaque sphere, bright and dark side, moving rapidly on a path curving downwards like curvature of &quot;sky dome&quot;UFO Report  Where:  Ottawa, Ontario, Canada   Bridge over Canal between National Arts Centre and the Convention Centre, facing South, directly over centre of Canal Date:  August 30, 2003 Time:  About 5:20-5:25 p.m. Local Time Weather:  Mostly clear with a few mid-altitude clouds; Calm: No wind on ground.   No movement of leaves; No movement of cloud cover. Note on Weather:  An article in the OTTAWA CITIZEN newspaper, on August 31 reported that the Hot Air Balloons from the Balloon Festival were forced down in the South End of the city at dusk due to insufficient wind to carry them to better landing sites. I was walking past the Convention Centre when I noticed a movement and stopped to watch a bright sphere move in a South West direction. When first seen, I was at about 45 degrees above the horizon, or about the height of the National Defence building. It was directly over the Canal and curved down towards the trees between the Canal and the National Arts Centre. It was moving at a very rapid pace, faster than city traffic, and was only seen briefly, 2;about a minute at most but probably about 15-30 seconds. There were tourists and other passers-by but it did not occur to me to point out the object to them. The object was a perfect sphere, very bright, probably from reflected light, as I watched it intently and it changed from bright to black. There was an intermediate quarter moon phase, so it was probably dark on one side and highly reflective on the other. It was probably not one of the hot-air balloons from the Hot Air Festival as it had no basket, was not the usual tear-drop or fanciful shape or colour, and would have distinctly varied in size if it was passing over or coming down near enough to me to be framed by the National Defence Building and the National Arts Centre. Because it was perfectly spherical, opaque to light, showed no sign of colour and changed from bright to dark, I eliminated the possibility of a toy balloon on the spot. I made a point of trying to determine if it was one of those round pillow shaped greeting balloons which have a printed sight and a shiny metal side but it did not appear to change shape at all. If it was a balloon of that size (one foot, 30 centimetres diameter)  it was closer to me on the ground than either the National Arts Centre or the National Defence building when I observed it, so a change in shape should have been visible. At one point, I considered the possibility that it might be a helicopter or a large balloon (in the range,  two to six foot diameter, one to two metres). It was difficult to determine scale as it was against a background of clear sky. The curve in its flight suggests that it was distant enough to appear to move along the curvature of the sky, but in that case it must have been bigger than a house. I don&apos;t recall seeing it actually pass behind the trees, so I may have been momentarily distracted at that point. The next day I revisited the site to attempt to determine where I was standing while I stopped and watched the balloon. I remembered that the canal was directly before me the day before but acquired no new information on my exact position. I did notice a couple of large advertising balloons attached to the stroller/perambulator of a child in the Rideau Centre Shopping Mall. They were advertising a story called Richards or something like (it definitely started with an &quot;R.&quot; They were about 1.5 feet or 50 centimetres in diameter, transparent and green. It is unlikely that a metallic, two-coloured balloon was being used as a promotional giveaway as well, but they were within the possible size-range of the object which I saw. I have to call this object a U.F.O. because the only evidence that it was a balloon was its shape and change of brightness, while the total absence of wind on the ground or at cloud level does not permit me to suppose that it was moving under wind power. Also, its path seemed curved with the curvature of the sky and if it was a wind it was taking a highly anomalous downward curve path.  Do high speed air currents curve to the ground?  I did, however, have the impression that the sphere was not much larger than a small aircraft, or smaller than a very large balloon, also that it may have passed lower than the National Defence Building, although I do not positively recall it passing in front of the building. Being of a scientific turn of mind, I believe that the most probably explanation would be a balloon, but not a toy or greetings balloon but something larger than those and smaller than a Hot Air Balloon. To conclude this positively, I would have to assume, however, that there was a brisk, but invisible wind at an altitude in excess of the height of the National Arts Centre and the Convention Centre on the opposite side of the Canal (4 to 6 stories), a wind which was curving downward over a short distance, perhaps less than the distance to Confederation Park beyond the National Arts Centre. I noticed not the slightest breeze where I stood, no wind in the branches of the trees by the National Arts Centre (some of which are nearly as tall as the building), and no cloud movement.", "Two objects looking like regular stars crossing the night skies way too fast to be satellites or airplaines. No trailLocation: Dun sur Meuse, app. 20 miles north of Verdun, France.Just before midnight (8th-9th aug.)I saw two objects, looking like regular stars or satelites, moving rapidly towards the southwest. They came in from the northeast and moved in a straight line, at an angle of about 40 degrees upward.They appeared to be regular stars or satelites: small white lights that would never have caught my eyes had they not been moving at such a strange speed. There where moving much too fast for satelites (besides, I&apos;ve never heard of satelites traveling in unison) and way too slow for meteorites, which I&apos;ve seen many times. I most certainly saw no trail of bright glowing material behind these two travelers. They where also moving way too fast for a couple of airplaines in the night. I saw no red of green navigationlights on portside or starboard, nore any blinking lights. Had it been two plaines (fighterjets in formation?) then I would have heard the noise, considering the speed and therefore low altitude. I have seen thousands of airplaines in the night, so I know what they look and sound like. Airplaines at cruising speed move about five times slower then the two objects I saw. Otherwise they must have been about 1500 feet up in the air. What a roar that would haven given! It&apos;s almost impossible to estimate the distance between these two &apos;stars&apos; since I don&apos;t know their actual size and altitude. If I where to draw out the night sky on a big piece of paper and hold it at an arms lenght in front of my eyes, I would pinpoint these two &apos;stars&apos; about an inch apart.Another thing puzzles me too. The first few seconds I noticed that one &apos;star&apos; was a little behind the other. During the entire passage (about seven seconds) they never changed places. Normaly they should moved right next to each other, because of the change of perspective. Like two racing cars that come in from the left, one a little behind the other, but seemingly driving neck-to-neck when getting out of sight on the right. However, this is only the case with two moving objects at fairly close range. Big objects very far away - like real stars - would not look differently to an observer on eaerth if there where to be on the move. At least not within seven seconds.At this particulair night I was not drunk or tired. I&apos;m a freelance copywriter in the Netherlands. At the time I was having a vacation in France with my wife and 2,5 year old son. This is the first time I report an unidentified flying object, knowing I may look stupid to all of my friends.((NUFORC Note:  Report was, in fact, submitted from The Netherlands.  Some satellites are reported to orbit in formation, e.g. the U. S. Navy &quot;NOSS&quot; satellites, but we agree with the witness that an object that moves across most of the sky in six-seconds almost certainly is not a man-made satellite.

Immediately I thought it was a shooting star because of its speed, however there was a low cloud cover over the city that night and there were two lights, not one.  One was directly above the other and then they started weaving in and out of each others path.  I knew then this was no shooting star as I knew this was no aircraft.  There was no noise coming from the lights and they were too fast and could manouver unlike anything I have ever seen before.  The lights were slightly yellow in colour and would have been about 5km away at less than 1km off the ground. I heard a caller on the radio a few days later describe seeing the exact same lights around the same time fly over in a town about 200km away heading in my direction.  A friend of mine has told me he has seen the same lights a number of times over our region.  He also told me that one time he and some friends were travelling from a nearby city at about 5:30am and stopped in a remote area when one of the passengers saw a light moving in the sky.  They all got out of the car and saw hundreds of lights, like stars, in the night sky moving like they were alive.

The second time I saw it, as it moved across the sky, it would blink off for about a second and a half and appear at a further distance and as it moved, it seemd to move in a sliding motion as it seemed to pause for about 2 seconds and then move some more.

We both had open minds to the possibilty of UFO&apos;S. As we drove to Melaney, there was a substantial break in the clouds as we came over a ridge. To the east of us and at about 1 oclock in the sky, we clearly saw three blue triangles in close formation. We stopped and they appeared to remain in that formation for a short time. There was no noise assosiated with the objects. They stayed in that spot until we lost sight due to cloud cover. I lived for many years near a large Airforce Base and in that time saw many and varied aircraft. I also worked on the base at various times. I have never seen any aircraft that could come close to what we saw.((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.

Edwards AFB call-forwarded the witness to NUFORC.   The witness reported that he had just opened a garage door at approximately between 11:00 a.m to noon., he thought, when his attention was immediately drawn to the sky by a humming or buzzing noise, which he at first thought was caused by an aircraft engine.  Very quickly, as he visually scanned the sky to locate the source of the sound, he spotted its apparent source, a peculiar looking luminous sphere, which looked somewhat like &quot;the head of a (straight) pin.&quot;  It appeared to the witness to be self-luminous, rather than reflective, he thought, and the object was in the northern sky, moving slowly to the south, and executing a steady turn to the southwest.  Its apparent size he equated to noticably larger than that of a large star in the night sky. As the witness watched the object, it completed its turn to the west, and it accelerated and disappeared from his sight over the mountain range to the west of Palmdale. The witness spent several decades working in the aerospace industry, and in other technically oriented industries, as well.  He served in the U. S. military, during which time he flew aboard many different types of military aircraft.  He emphasized that the object he witnessed was not any type of conventional, or aerodynamic, craft, in his opinion, and the sound it seemed to come from it was unusual, something he had never heard before.", "the object was watched for 4-6min. and made no apparent sound,from ground it appeared brown/no zoomMy friend was on the front porch {facing North}and saw someting and called me out to look.

But then two more lights came on at either end of the row and then the object turned into a V-shape and sped off at a high rate of speed in an eastern direction.  I had no witnesses though for by the time I said, &quot;Hey look at that!&quot;  The object had already disappeared from sight.  A couple years later I mentioned this to my grandma and she told me that my great-aunt had seen the same sort of object.

Affter about 15 min. it just vanished.My 18 year old son returned home with 4 of his friends at approximately 12:15 am, when they spotted a large red light moveing across the sky and stopping on the north side of our home.  My son came into my room and woke me up to use the camcorder to film the light.  I thought he was talking about a red light about the size of a star, but when I went out with him, the red light, it was huge and a dark red.  It appeared to be the size of maybe a red light signal, or slightly larger.  I was so amazed that I went inside to call my oldest son on the phone.  I dialed his number, and got a recording to a business that my deceased husband worked for prior to his death, in July of 1999.  I could not believe my ears, so I hung up and pressed redial and looked at the number on the display.  It was my sons number, and again the recording came on.  I let my son and daugher listen to the recording, each time pressing the redial button and looking at the displayed number.  I have never memorized his work number, nor have I called that number since 1999.  This was a shock to me, because, even if I had dialed a wrong number, what were that chances that I would get that business.  As my son continued to record this light it appeard to come closser and then it went further out, pulsed a few times and then just dissapeared.  We all went inside to see what was filmed on tv.  At approximately 12:40 am, I called channel 11 news, tip desk.  I told them what we had seen, and the gentlemen informed me that there were 3 other calls out of Motebello reporting the same red light.  I told him that we had footage, and he took my information and said that someone would call us in the morning.  By noon on Aug. 24th, we still had not heard from channel 11, so I called channel 5, who suggested that we take the tape to the studio so that they could make a copy of it.  The gentleman that spoke to my son, told him that it was probbably mars, but after reviewing and copying the tape, he said that it was not mars, labled the t! ape UFO and told my son that they would call him if they used it.

The object was a brilliantly lit white, with two slighlty darker spots about 1/3 the way in from each end.  The lighting remiscent of the glow of a neon light.  It traveled from south/southeast to north/northwest, at a very high rate of speed, which I would estimate to be 2 times that of an airliner, maybe 600-650 mph.  It must have been low in the sky, because I first notice that it lit up the parking lot somewhat, however, it was above the low clouds as I saw it disappear behing a cloud; it did not re-emerge.  No sound at all.  Direction appeared to be a straight line.  I&apos;ve seen plenty of meteors and other objects in the sky before, but I was always able to satisfy myself that they were normal occurrences.  This was not a normal aerial object.

Location: Eastern Kern County, near Ridgecrest, CA.Observer Coordinates: 35deg.,35min N Lat.; 117deg.,42min W Long.Vehicle Flight Path: Over undeveloped desert, managed by US Bureau of Land Management (BLM). The time was late afternoon, about 1 hour before sunset, clear visibility. The day had been blustery - moderate wind, partial cloud cover. I was inside, sitting at my computer when gunshots from a wash about 1/4 mile away diverted my attention. I gazed out my 8&apos;W x 4&apos;H picture window to the south to see if I could see the shooters. My house borders undeveloped BLM desert land; the view is unobstructed except for some low-lying bushes in the foreground. The desert floor slopes gently upward on an alluvial fan for about 2/3 to 3/4 mile, backed by low hills known locally as the Rademachers; a topographical map of the area indicates the crest of the nearest peak is 1.1 mile distant and 430 feet higher in elevation than my vantage point inside my house. I couldn&apos;t see the shooters, but after a few seconds my attention was drawn to a rapidly moving object at the right-hand-side of the window. My first thought in the first fraction of a second was that it was a bird. Quickly I realized it was not a bird, but rather some sort of aircraft. It followed a straight horizontal path - no flapping or deviation which would be typical of birds in flight. We do have soaring birds in this area, but this was obviously no soaring bird either. The object traveled from right to left (generally west to east) across my field of view defined by the window. It was low in altitude, staying below the crest of the hills at all times, so lower and closer to me than the 1.1 mile, 430 foot elevation peak mentioned earlier; but apparently near the base of the hills where they transition to the alluvial fan. So with the aid of the topo map I have been able to make a good estimate of the object&apos;s distance and elevation: I estimate it was 2/3 to 3/4 mile distant and no more than 100 - 200 feet above the terrain it was flying over.  It is unusual for an aircraft to be flying so low in that area - certainly in violation of FAA regulations. Since I saw only a profile view at a distance, I can&apos;t say much about the appearance of the craft. My sense is it more closely resembled a small private plane than a military jet in size and profile. But it seemed thinner in profile than a private plane. My sense is there was a vertical stabilizer at the rear; I am not very sure of that. I can make a rough guess of the length of the craft. Its angular length was no less than 1/8&quot;, no more than 1/4&quot; at arm&apos;s length (30&quot;). At an estimated distance of 3/4 mile, this would be equivalent to 16.5 to 30 feet in length for the object or about 23 feet +/-7; at 2/3 mile the estimated object length would be about 21 feet +/-6. Field of View: My view through the window can be determined quite accurately from the dimensions of the window and my vantage point. It is close to 36 degrees. Scaling this on the topo map yields a distance of about 2500 feet or just under half a mile that the object was in my field of view, assuming a nearly west-to-east flight path near the base of the hills. Duration of the sighting: This is my worst data point. It was all over in a few seconds. But was it 4 seconds, was it 8? I guess 5 to 6 seconds from when I first noticed the moving object on the west end of my window until it reached the east end. Let us assume a time of 5.5 seconds in my field of view. For a 2500 foot flight path this results in an estimated speed of 455FPS or 310MPH for the craft. After a short lapse (2 - 4 seconds?) I thought: &quot;I must get outside to see if I can see this thing continue its path.&quot; I rushed out of the house to look toward the east (have timed it since - takes about 8 - 10 seconds). I saw no more evidence of the craft, nor was I aware of any aircraft noise in the vicinity. My biggest regret is that I didn&apos;t hurry over to see if the shooters had seen the craft. They were closer to it, and of course outside so could have heard sound during its passage. Sadly, I did not attempt to contact them. Observer is a retired physicist, amateur astronomer and one-time private pilot. He is a long-time resident of the area and is well aquainted with the terrain over which the craft was observed to fly. Observer has 20-20 vision when wearing corrective lenses, was wearing glasses at time of sighting.  NOTE added 23 Sept. 2003: It wasn&apos;t until 16 Sept. 2003 while starting to document this sighting that I realized it has characteristics similar to a Tomahawk cruise missile; in other words, perhaps it was a Tomahawk at low altitude. Since the sighting occurred a short distance from the boundaries of the China Lake Naval Air Weapons Station (NAWS), this may not be an unreasonable hypothesis. A web search revealed several unclassified press releases of Tomahawk flight tests which have terminated at China Lake, but none were found for any time in February 2000.", "Bright light  flashed and moved up(vertical)I was sitting on a bench at Alki Beach around 20;30  on September 1st.

A huge triangular object at least two football fields in size suddenly appeared from the south above my house.  It was coming from the south direction near NORAD in Colo. Spgs.  It was Triangular in shape, and definitely had cloaking or stealth capability.  It was travelling at a slow rate of speed over my house, and following the I225 corridore parallel to Buckley AFB.

First I saw what I tried to tell myself was either a small airplane or fireworks.  Multi-colored lights twinkled overhead for just 4-5 seconds and disappeared.  I told myself, there must be a haze in the sky that caused it to disappear, but then observed the sky and noticed there wasn&apos;t a cloud in the sky and stars shining brightly.  I blew off the multi-colored twinkling lights as possible small airplane or fireworks.  I traveled approx. 3 miles, turned to go south-east and suddenly an orange, brillant, glassy, shimmering light appears above the treetops looking south.  I saw it actually develope, like from nothing grew to the size it was.  Looking through the windshield, the perfect circle was about the size of a silver dollar that appeared to be approx. 3 miles away from me at about a 50 degree angle.  Suddenly the orange circle divided into two, like you see a cell divide under a microscope.  The two orange circles stay motionless for a few seconds, then suddenly appeared to drop towards each other, diminish and disappear. I witnessed this event for approx. 8-10 seconds.  There were two vehicles behind me an one honked their horn after the lights divided.  There was no beam of light, aura or haze, trail, or sound, just perfect orange circle of lights, that I tend to describe like the color of a burning cigarette, hot coals from a fire.", "More green red lights in FalmouthThis is our second report. We also saw something very similar on the 12th. This time, my cousin and I were outside to see if the light was there that night. It was very cloudy that night. We looked to the same area where my father, mother and I had saw it a couple nights earlier. We saw it again, underneath the clouds. It stood there for about 30 seconds and disappeared. We went inside to turn off the outside light. When we came back out it was still gone. Around 10 seconds later, it reappeared. It stood in the same area for about a minute. It then zig-zagged very fast and disappeared. We have not seen it again.", "Point of Light spotted in denver on 9/01/03At about 6:15 pm on 09/01/03 at a park at Evans and Platte river drive, a guest at a family barbecue (no alcohol present) spotted an object in the sky.  He was watching an obect in the sky, but no one else was paying attention to him.  then he described it as a UFO.  I looked up to spot it, but couldn&apos;t.  Then a plane passed and he was trying to spot it with someone else and said, &quot;there, to the right of the plane&quot;.  At that point, I was able to spot the point of light he was referring to.  I would describe the color as brilliant pink.  TA first I was skeptical and thought that possibly it was a child&apos;s baloon because of the color.  But since it was stationary, I soon felt that it wasn&apos;t a baloon.  I continued interacting with people at the party and would occasionallylook up at the object.  It was so small, that it was very difficult to locate.  Time and time again, as I spotted it, it seemed very high and stationary.  afterabout ten minutes from the first time I spotted it, I could not see it any longer.  It was deifnitely not like any other object I had seen in the sky before.", "While driving north on the DVP at 1:35pm and we looked up in the sky and saw a white cylindrical object flying east.We were driving North on the DVP (around Lawrence Ave) at 1:35pm and we looked up in the sky and saw a white cylindrical object flying east.

I was watching, what I thought was the planet Mars, as it was the brightest light in the sky to the left of the road. I was wondering where the moon was in relation to it, as I had recently observed them together and this made me start to wonder if this was Mars?  As I was watching this &apos;light&apos; a large object, either a disk at an angle, or a cigar shape, appeared out of nowhere just below the light. It was bright blue and as quickly as it appeared, blew up? shooting out a blue light toward the ground.  There appeared to be dust or particles left in the area it had just occupied?  All this happened in a very short period of time- almost instantly and startled me so badly, I pulled off on the shoulder of the road to regain my composure. I still kept looking at the light which now appeared to be pulsing and of different colors. I took out my digital camera and filmed the pulsing light for a few seconds. I took some stills that later showed orbs in the vicinity also.

We were just sitting there on a picnic table and talking. We enjoyed staying outside all night since we were all only 14 or 15 years old. Well anyways it was a fairly chilly morning. As we talked we were looking towards some woods. The woods were roughly northeast from the house. We noticed the sun had come up over the trees directly in a straight line from or view. We didn&apos;t think much of it and just continued to talk. Then one of us (I don&apos;t remember who) happened to look over to our right and more in a easterly direction. And the sun was coming up over there! We then being somewhat more confused then shocked looked back at what we had assumed was the sun. It was a huge round, bright orange sphere. We all were just flabbergasted and couldn&apos;t figure out what it was. It then dissapeared. It sort of imploded,kind of like the circle the cartoon characters stick there heads out of at the end of the cartoon. You know it goes whooop. A few things became apparent looking back on it after having time to think about it. The object was of course too far to the north rather than east to be the sun. Also it couldn&apos;t have been near as bright as the sun or we couldn&apos;t have stared straight at it like that. It was definitley very close to us and above the woods. I realized as well that light reflected off the trees as if the object were directly above them. Not a celestial body thousands or millions of miles away. It was very bright and very orange. The only explanation i can give for us thinking it was the sun at first would be that we just werent really paying attention to it. During this whole episode a fog had rolled in. We didn&apos;t really feel any fear but we felt enough apprehension to head inside. We don&apos;t really talk about this much. In fact the two of them sort of denied this happened for years after the fact. Me and ((Witness #1)) had several strange things happen to us in those woods throughout later years.In fact i&apos;m a little scared of them.

We ran out to my back porch to see if we could see what it was but it was gone. Then we saw another, what looked to be a fireball, light up again and then disappeared. When i got to work the next day, i told my story to some co-workers then i found out that two other people that i work with saw the same thing. I have no idea what i was seeing that night.

We drove back roads through Sharon, Amenia Union and Amenia/ Millerton area.  At some point this object would meet us and follow and play with us as we drove to work.  The craft would parallel our car, stop when we did, cross over the top of the car stopping when we did and waiting for, it had intention.

For weeks and seemed follow/paralleled our car with intention, when we stopped at the 7/11 like store it would disappear and return.  One evening it followed us closely to the turn off to the center complex.  It hovered very close above a high tree for at least several minutes.  It crossed over the top of our car, it shot up straight and appeared to be circular with the circles or outlines changing shape as the colors changed.  It moved staright up, I think we watched it for a few more minutes before we went to work.  I remember being terrified and ((name deleted--witness #2)) assuring me it was okay, that they were friendly.  She was insistent of there friendliness as I was terrified.  We went to work and I told others at work about it.  I also called the State police and asked if there had been any reports.  It would be almost impossible to have been working the 11:00 - 7:00 shift and not seen this huge glowing object at the bottom of the road or driveway.  Many cars were pulled over and were watching.  Most recently I read a book about the Gulf Breeze Sightings, I think the craft I saw was similar to the craft and rings of lights in some of the photos noted.  I have also felt compelled in the past year or so to seek out others who may refute or confirm this incident.  There were many vehicles parked at the driveway to Wasaiic Developmental Center that evening.  I believe this incident occured! in the fall or earl spring.  We also saw this craft for miles along the back roads between Falls Village and Wasaiic.((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.  Ordinarily, the first possibility to be ruled out in a case like this, in which a night-time light is perceived to be &quot;following&quot; a moving vehicle, a celestial body is the first possibility that has to be ruled out.  However, in this case, if in fact the object flew over the vehicle, a celestial body seems unlikely to us.

I was informed that the divers had remarked that this incident was another &quot;Shag Harbor&quot;.

We never were told anymore about the result of this mission other than that it had been determined that a natural phenomenon of undetermined origin had been studied, that was capable of mysteriously eluding detection at will only to reappear again.

We drove down Hwy. 59 to get a better view, and all the while keeping our eyes on the lights.  Soon, we noticed that a couple of helicopters from ft. chaffee took off in pursuit. They seemed to be going around in circles, as if they were looking for something. Then what my husband identified as F-16 fighters took off next. They were chasing the lights in the sky. It was rather comical to watch because it seemed like a game of cat and mouse, but the strange lights were too fast to catch. We pulled into the lock and dam to watch this spectacle for a while, and soon there were no more strange lights in the sky.  The duration lasted for about an hour at that time.  When we returned home, my neighbor asked me if we had seen any strange lights, and of course we had.

The idea was to take a series of shots of the Ottawa skyline panning right to left, from East to North East, snapping the pictures in quick succession less than a second apart. The sun was behind me in the West and  high in the sky creating perfect lighting conditions for photography. It should be noted here that I saw absolutely no craft, bird, balloon, kite or anything that could explain what showed up on one of the pictures.When I got back downstairs to our apartment I downloaded the pictures to our computer and proceeded to go over them one by one.

I checked all of the other pictures in case it was a hair on the lens or some other such anomally and found nothing, all the pictures were crystal clear. This &quot;object&quot; appeared to be about two kilometers from my position and at an altitude of about one hundred and fifty feet, our building is about one hundred and ten feet high and it appeared to be slightly higher than my line of sight. What interests me is the fact that I didn&apos;t see it with my own eyes, secondly, that the pictures taken right before and immediately after, less than a second apart, on the same plane do not have the same image on them. I can only surmise that if this was indeed a UFO it had to be going so incredibly fast that the human eye would not be able to capture or register mentally the image but that the camera did. Given that it is not an expensive digital camera the resolving power is much less than that of a more expensive camera with more pixels.

I could not find any information on any meteors appearing in the local news today.", "object moved fast and in a straight linewe saw a light moving from north to south, moving real fast, the object did&apos;nt show any other lights, for example : lights from the cabin, from the body or frame of an aircraft, there was no exhaust given like jet aircraft. Also the flight path was straight not curving like when meteors enter the atmosphere and start to fall. There were no sparks from friction. I estimate this object to be flying about 1500-3000 ft.We lost sight of it when some hills got between us.", "Round blue circular object hovers and dissolves in Maine.I was about 12 years old delivering newspapers early in the morning in late September 1965(?). It was completely dark. I was standing at the entrance road to the old Averill School on Oakland St. when I looked up in the sky toward the south and saw a round blue circular object. At first I thought it was the moon but it was 3 or 4 times larger than the moon appears in the sky and it was a solid blue color. It did not move at all and there was no sound coming from it. There were no lights on it but it seemed to produce its own light. In other words, it didn&apos;t seem as if it were illuminated by any kind of reflected light. The object was a perfect circle and completely opaque. As I saw it, it appeared two-dimensional in the sky as the moon does. After a few minutes it began to dissolve. I&apos;m pretty sure that it maintained its shape while it dissolved. I noticed at one point while it was dissolving that I could see stars behind it which I couldn&apos;t see a few minutes before. It eventually dissolved completely. I wondered if it might be a natural organic phenomenon of some kind but it seems to me such a thing would not be perfectly round. I would like to know if anyone else has ever seen anything like this.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Please see articles about the Incident in Exeter, NH, which occurred on September 03, 1965.

The first time it apeared it was not along there were two red lights in the sky.

I looked up at the sky and saw two stars in the sky. I assumed that it could have been some sort of solar flare reflecting off the stars. then about 2 hours later it came back. this time only one bright red light appeared. and this time i had my video camera and recorded it all on tape. the light just stayed sationary it didn&apos;t move. then after a few mins the started to blink almost like morose code. then it dissapeared. after we recorded it we viewed it in slow motion. what was really strange was that at one point towards the end we saw a stream of light moving upwards from the ground up into the sky. how weird is that.

PD))", "Moon-like object spotted up in the sky next to the sun during the afternoonOn Tuesday afternoon, while I was belaying some kids (some form rope and hook sport where you are secured with a rope to climb) I happened to look up at the sky. There were dark clouds gathered and they seem to be moving. I guess it was because it was going to rain soon, although it was kinda weird that the clouds were dark since it was a very sunny day. I was wearing my sunglasses and squinting at the Sun. Then I saw this Moon-like object high up in the clouds, about an inch away from the Sun (from my position). It looked like the Moon, or a planet, only it&apos;s a little bigger then the Moon when it&apos;s full. I couldn&apos;t believe what I was seeing because this was during the afternoon, about 2-3+pm. At first I thought it might be the Moon but how could the Moon and the Sun be in the sky next to each other at the same time? I told my friend to look up and she saw it too, she thought it was the Moon but that&apos;s impossible. It wasn&apos;t as bright as the Sun, it looked disc-like, I even saw some dark patches on it, kinda like the Moon with its craters. on it.  What&apos;s even more surprising is that this &apos;Moon&apos; was moving. I couldn&apos;t remember which direction, but I think it was revolving around the Sun. At the same time the dark clouds were moving pass it, sort of like it was trying to hide the appearance of this object. Every few momens I would stare at it again to make sure it was still there and not a trick of the eye. I was holding the life of a kid in my hands since I was belaying. Wouldn&apos;t be too good if I had to explain why I was careless enough to let a kid drop 15 feet to his death. Haha. Ok back to the topic. After a while, the object moved towards the sun, at a very high speed I guess, from the ground it looked like it was moving 1 cm a second, but multiply it by the distance this object is away from us, I think that&apos;s a very high speed. And moments later, the object seemed to merged with the Sun, sort of like an eclispe, except without the Sun darkening or whatever.", "Witnessed a bright green silent light traveling from the north towards the south.My wife and I saw what appeared to be a green light traveling from the north to the south. We first observed from in our home through the window and ran outside immediately. We noted that there were no other flashing lights of any kind or color, and it made no sound. We live in Burien, WA., a few miles from Sea-Tac airport and are used to seeing various aircraft in the sky. We also see King Co. police helecopter Gurdian One, frequently. We both noticed this object as it was so different in appearance from anything else we have seen. When we ran outside, my neighor was talking to her daughter and son in law who were about to depart. I called it to there attention and they witnessed it also.The object appeared as a bright green glowing light about the size of a pea at arms length. It seemed to zig-zag some as it traveled and to be going faster than typical aircraft. Perhaps 30 seconds total time we observed it. It made no noticable sound.", "Early 60&apos;s Triangle CraftWhile laying on our backs on the sidewalk and talking, I suddenly noticed what I first too to bwe a searchligh sweeping across the sky. Even in the clear desert air a searchlight such as those used at grand openings can be discerned. As I focused on the light it resolved into a V-shape. I could see six points of light and I thought it was six seperate ships but now I believe it might well have been one triangular craft with six light showing. It traveled from a little right of straight up to off the horizon in about 5 seconds. This occured over Davis-Monthan AFB and the craft(s) travelled south toward Mexico. Having been raised in the Air Force and knowing a lot about aircraft, I am sure that it was travelling at least ten times as fast as anything we had in the air at that time.((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

I never saw anything like it, it had 3 arms so to say, it wasnt circle or oval or big, it had 3 lights and each light was attatched to an arm type of thing.

The sky was clear and cloudless At the corner of Hogan and Division I noticed an unusually bright light to the west.  At first I thought it might be an airplane, but it was not traveling on a flight path that would have taken it to or from the Portland International Airport. Continuing on Division St. I noted that the light had not moved, and what I first took for a plane was actually stationary. I could now see that in addition to the bright white light, a smaller blinking red light was visible parallel to the white light. Was it a helicopter hovering? I live about three miles from where this light was and am familiar with the area, and I knew that there was no antennae tower of any kind on this hill that would account for a stationary light.On August 29, 2003 at 10:30 PM I was traveling east to west on SE Division St. in Gresham Oregon, towards Portland.  At the corner of Hogan and Division I noticed an unusually bright light to the west.  At first I thought it might be an airplane, but it was not traveling on a flight path that would have taken it to or from the Portland International Airport.Continuing on Division St. I noted that the light had not moved, and what I first took for a plane was actually stationary.

I live about three miles from where this light was and am familiar with the area, and I knew that there was no antennae tower of any kind on this hill that would account for a stationary light.The closer I got to the light I could definitely tell it was not moving at all.  I decided to find the first turn to the left (south) to see how close I could get.  I had my digital camera with me and it was my intention to photograph.  I turned from Division onto NW Angeline St. (southbound)  The street was lined with many tall fir trees and I could still see the light intermittently through the trees. Hoping to hear if what I was seeing was just a hovering helicopter, I turned off the radio and fan, and rolled down all of the car windows. I contiuned south on Angeline until I came to NW 5th where I then turned left (east).Now I had a very clear view of the object.  I could now see that it was triangular in shape with two bright lights on two of the corners and the red light was on the third corner. Luckily I wasn&apos;t the only one to see this thing.Two men who were standing on the left side of the street (NW 5th) were looking up at the object.  Further down the street, a car was slowly moving toward the object with the driver looking up towards the triangle.  Two girls, who were running down the street behind the car, were also looking up and pointing.With the windows rolled down, I tried to hear what, if any sound the object was making.  It was absolutely silent.  Over the years I have seen Police, News, and Rescue helicopters flying all over the Portland area.  If this were a helicopter hovering over a quiet residential neighborhood it would have been terrifically loud at its altitude.  The most striking thing besides the silence, was the incredible stability of the object.  It sat so still you would think it was affixed to the top of a tower. Helicopters hovering have a bit of wobble and drift, however slight.  This was rock solid.  I can&apos;t stress this point enough.I have seen pictures of the Phoenix lights, the Belgium Triangle, Lubbock lights, etc, and this was very similar.  While it was not possible from my point of view to discern surface details, it appeared to be very large (fifty to one hundred feet or more across) and an equilateral triangle.  Since I was looking up at the object, it was not possible to estimate the height or thickness of the triangle.As I moved further east on NW 5th, the triangle suddenly started to move. It may have been a reaction to so many people all moving towards it at once. But it may have been a coincidence. It pivoted on its center to face to the Northeast.  As is turned it began to accelerate.  Again, it was absolutely silent.   And what was the most striking was the weirdly perfect precision of the turn.  Not like a helicopter that will wobble slightly while turning, then tilt forward to accelerate.  This move reminded me of the too precise way a computer simulation can be. (If done wrong)  In film and television computer animation, an animator will intentionally add small bumps, tilts, or wobbles to make the animation seem more &quot;real&quot; or lifelike.  This thing turned and began moving in one smooth perfect motion.  If an animator produced a motion like this, it would be rejected as too smooth and fake looking.I tried to follow it by taking the next available left turn (onto Towle Rd) and continued north.  The street was lined with fir trees and it was rapidly moving to the NE making it difficult to see.  Towle road has numerous speed bumps, so it was not possible to keep up.  As I reached Division St. (the street I was originally travelling on when I first sighted the object) I could see two bright white lights of the back of the triangle.  The red light was no longer visible, so I assumed it was either off, or that it was on the corner pointed away from me.  (Was it the &apos;front&apos;?)  I turned left on Division St. and was now traveling east to west again.  As there are houses and trees along this part of Division it was difficult to keep track of the triangle.  As I approached the intersection of Birdsdale and Division I could see that it was now what appeared to be two to four miles away moving faster to the NE.  If it continued in that direction it would have come very close to Portland International Airport and the Air National Guard.  Within a few seconds it was gone from sight.  It was now 10:37.I am certain it was not a plane or helicopter.  The complete lack of any sound would rule those out as possibilities. A Harrier Jet might be able to stay relatively still and then accelerate something like this did, but not stay completely motionless.  Plus the Harrier is quite loud hovering.Was it a blimp or some sort of balloon?   Even blimps and balloons hovering make some movement.  This was sitting rock steady in one spot.  And the speed at which it accelerated would have required some sort of jet or prop engine.  This was silent.  Absolutely, completely silent.((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION FROM WITNESS))Peter,Feel free to pass my report along to ((investigator)).

A full report has been submitted in writing to P. Davenport and to MUFON. A second independent witness was located who apparently saw the same object.  This is a probable unconventional or unidentified aerial object (UFO).  Although conventional aircraft were positively in the area, this is near the PDX approach pattern, and also near the Troutdale airport.  Conventional aircraft are in this area all the time, and local residents are accustomed to seeing them.  One witness also observed and clearly identified a commercial airliner that flew over minutes after the sighting of the unknown object.  Both witnesses agree on basic details, essentially that a triangular object with lights near the corners, hovered over a residential area at well under 1,000 feet (the FAA mandated minimum altitude above terrain).  This craft hovered silently for several seconds, then departed rapidly in a northerly or northwesterly direction.

Once to get my wife and the once to get binocculars. As it got nearer, the object appeared brighter (no doubt because of its proximity) and also other colors were evident. I waited too long to look at it with binocculars but when I did was suprised at the richness of the color. The &quot;front&quot; was a deep blue approaching violet. The center was a brilliant green and the back was a deep red. It was difficult to perceive any definite shape. There appeared to be at least a dozen lights within the colors but didn&apos;t appear to be the source of the color. It&apos;s important to note that the colors I saw didn&apos;t look like a reflection off of any kind of fusalage but rather appeared as a glow like one would observe from neon. The object made no noise, didn&apos;t change direction, speed or altitude. The lights didn&apos;t change in intensity nor did they blink.

From what I was told there were a number of other witnesses who watched an object, orange in color move strangely in the sky. From the description I received I believe this sighting was of the planet Mars. A bunch of folks were observing the Moon and Mars in the Cranbrook, B.C. area. There were some clouds which moved in front of the Moon and the planet Mars, as the clouds moved out of the way before the next batch roll by all the witnesses observed a orange colored moving around the night sky, but where the light was located was in exactly the same position Mars was. I believe when everyone lost sight of the planet due to clouds, and then seeing it again as the clouds passed by, it gave the illusion of the planet moving, or an object as reported to me. Also due to the length of time the light was seen, my conclusion after talking with the witness is that everyone was watching the planet Mars.

The area where this event took place is mainly a Matee community. The fellow I talked to said he and his wife bought a business  and have lived in the community for thirteen years and know many of the area residents. In the last week of August, 2003 four youths were driving south of St. Laurent towards the golf course on golf course road (as many folks there call it). The road runs by Francis Lake and the golf course is on the left hand side of the road when traveling south. As they drove along they noticed an abandoned vehicle off to the side of the road across from the golf course. At this point they all saw flashing lights over and above one of the buildings on the course. The lights seemed to be sitting stationary in one spot and low over the sheds. They assumed, after seeing the car pulled off to the side of the road and the lights flashing,  that someone may have been breaking into the sheds. Two of the young men decided to sneak in to see if they might catch someone causing damage, the other two  went back home to get their parents and have them come down to the area where all this was taking place. As the two youths were approximately half way into the course and as they approached a small road which passed by one of the dugouts, they heard a very loud, piercing scream. As they kept walking for approx: another 100 feet, all of a sudden this &quot;thing&quot; was right in front of them and screaming out this loud screeching noise. A three foot high creature ran in front of them and it was only about 25 feet away. Both witnesses were taken totally by surprise and very frightened as they had no idea what this thing was. It didn&apos;t help that it was dark outside. Both of them ran back towards the road where they had been dropped off, but seeing they did not have a vehicle they cowered in the ditch which ran along side the road hoping that whatever it was they saw would not find them. Finally their two friends returned with a couple of the parents and when the vehicle stopped the two guys who witnessed the creature, hurridly  jumped  into the vehicle. &quot;Let&apos;s get out of here&quot; they said .... however the parents did go and check the buildings and found nothing had been disturbed.   They all talked about the event on their way home. The lights which were seen hovering over the buildings were a red, greenish and white colour.  The witnesses  mentioned that not a sound could be heard coming from where the lights were seen. Also they  claimed seeing another light hovering over Francis Lake which was totally red.  Again not a sound could be heard. On the same night, shortly after the above sighting ......another man, driving his van, had to slam on his brakes to avoid hitting  a similar creature. He claimed that it was about 10 feet in front of him when he finally came to a complete stop. It moved to the driver&apos;s side of the van and squatted down, bending slightly to one side, looked up at the frightened driver.  The man described the creature as being small and having a protruding jaw filled with a number of teeth. He put the truck into reverse and headed out of there as fast as he could.  After thinking about what just happened, and what he saw, he broke down and started to cry. Another series of events have taken place in the same general area. A local resident who had some 27 chickens well penned up in a &quot;heavy steel wired&quot; area, found on the following day, that 20 of his poultry had disappeared.  A large hole had been ripped in the strong wire fence. The resident looked around the area and found one chicken still partly alive in the bushes behind their home  and it had two puncture holes at the base of its neck.  No other chickens were found.  Strangely, also there has been a large number of domestic cats which have gone missing just over the same time period, which is definitely not normal and there does not seem to be any explanation for their disappearance. The fellow claims that there is a lot of history of unknown objects being seen in and around the community. He also said that the creature had been spotted on other occasions throughout the St. Laurent area. The lights were strange, the creature was strange...  what they were and whether or not they were connected is anyone&apos;s guess.   There does seem to be something very weird happening in this particular part of Canada.   I will continue to look into this and see what, if anything more , I can discover about it.  Due to the community being tight lipped about such strange events its not going to be an easy task.

Geroge Nori had a guest on, talking about UFOs. I have never really given much thought to whether there are really UFOs visiting our planet. I guess you can say that I am skeptical of the idea. However, I do have an instance that happened to my family and me about 12 years ago. I have only told a few people about this incident because I still believe that there is probably some explanation for what we saw that night. In 1991 I was 35 years old, my wife 32 and our sons 9 and 12. We had moved into our new home on 40 acres only a few months before. Our place was in a very rural part of the County. Our closest neighbor was approx. 2 miles away and it was 8 miles to the closest small town of 1000 residents. The largest city, and the only major airport was about 70 miles south of our place. On this particular night we had just returned home from our 12 year old son&apos;s little league baseball game. It was around 11:00 pm and He had immediatly went upstairs to his room because he was upset that they had lost their game. My wife and other son were in the family room and I went up to try and cheer my 12 year old up. Our house was built on a hill in the middle of our 40 acres and my son&apos;s room faced the west. There were 3 six foot windows side by side in his room. The back door to our home was right at the bottom of the staircase. As I sat down on his bed I just happened to glance out of his window to the western sky. That is when I saw something in the distance headed right toward our house. This thing was very large with many lights and at a low altitude. My first thought was that a commercial jet was about to crash on our land. I yelled to my wife that a jet was about to crash into our field. My son and I got down the stairs very quickly and we met my wife and my other son at the back door. We all ran out into the back yard. I was expecting to hear a plane in trouble. instead, we all stood there and watched this thing with many lights and a string of lights behind it go right above our heads. As it traveled over us there was no noise at all and it was moving very slowly. We just stood there and watched it as it disapeared to the east. The next morning I was really expecting to hear some kind of news about it, but I heard nothing. To this day, I have no idea what this was that we saw, but I know that I will never forget that moment as we stood in our backyard and watched this string of lights silently fly overhead.((NUFORC Note:  Date os incident is approximate.

( unfortunately i had no camera at hand )", "Very LARGE  V shaped objects or objectsI had to return to Texas for a funeral and was staying with my sister.  My oldest daughter wanted to go swimming, so we all went out to the pool about 8PM or so.  I was sitting at the side of the pool when my sister started yelling the V is moving!!  I didn&apos;t quite understand what she was saying when she screamed at me to get over there because there was a V moving in the sky.  I looked up and seen the biggest object or collection of objects I have ever seen in my life.It was in the shape of a V but without the bottom line.  It was moving south at a slow pace, not super slow but I think too slow to be a formation of airplanes, besides I have never seen airplanes fly in a V formation.  If it was one object, at least 100 airplanes would have fit in this thing.  I am not sure what I seen but it was totally amazing and kept us in awe for a very long time.  I wanted to report this then but my sister told me I was crazy because nobody would believe us anyway, but I just felt the need to share this and would like to know if anyone else saw this that night.", "Witnesses saw a extremely bright green light sitting along side one of the local mountains.A lady from Kelowna, B.C. called to report that she saw a extremely bright green light sitting along side one of the local mountains in the area. It looked so strange she went back into the families home and got her husband from the den to come out to in hopes he could make some sense of what this green light may be. From their deck they watched it for a period of time. The light disappeared in front of them. Now later that night, or in the wee hours of the morning the lady woke up as she could not sleep, went to the sliding windows which leads onto their deck and looked out. Again a bright green light was witnessed. Not in the same location it was seen earlier that evening. She then woke her husband up and he looked and he thought it may have been a satellite. But the light just sat there, they both went back to bed, so no time was given for how long the event lasted for. HBCC UFO Note: There has been a number of these green lights flying around the area since the missing time event was reported. Thank you to the witness for the report.

I was riding shotgun. I had reciently bought a telescope and was watching the sky. I soptted a group of stars that were brighter than most and seemed to stand out in the sky. If you were looking at them like they were on a clock face the lights were at your 7 o clock and at your 1 o clock. They also were exactly the same color as most of they nearby stars, only brighter...about magnitude 1.5 to 2.0. All of the sudden they began to revolve around each other and i screamed to my wife to stop the car and she did. Just in time to see them stop spinning and shoot off in opposite directions. They were very fast, going from revolving to about the distance from saturn to jupiter (as viewed from earth) in no less than 1 second. As odd as this seems as soon as they reached their max distance from each other, without decelerating reversed course and began to slow until they reached their original places in the sky. My wife saw them revolving and watched them shoot off and return. The revolving part lasted about 20 seconds. We were able to see them in the sky until we went to bed about 1:30 am and never seen them since.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "object in sky with bright lightdriving in the rain going up to a stop sign when a bright light caught our eyes, the circular object was flying low and slow with the brightest light we&apos;ve ever seen! when it was flying over the car we could see red lights on the sides. we shut off the radio and turned the window down there was no sound. we tried to turn around and follow it but there were too many cars stopped on the road, and the object took off too fast to follow. 2 minutes later at our house we were watching out the door talking about what we had just seen and a fighter jet flew just over the house shaking everything going in the same direction we saw the object.", "My son, granddaughter and I were sitting on a bench facing north eating our ice cream outside a store in the Canyon Corners strip mall.  The afternoon sky was very clear with just a whisp of a cloud to the far norteast. Within a flash of possibly 5 seconds, coming from (southern direction towards the north) above traveling towards the northeast, I saw a ball of light with a tail streaming out of the sky in an arc heading towards the ground. The light appearded to me to look like a ball of shimmering mercury.  Then it just disappered. There was nothing lingering in the sky after it disappered.  There were no planes in the sky before or after the incident.  It also was not a somthing from a firework as there was absolutly no sound.((NUFORC Note:  Please see other reports for this time and date.  Object probably was a daytime meteor, which was seen over British Columbia, as well.  It was at least several hundred miles north of Seattle, we believe, and evidence suggests.  PD))", "((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witnesses might have been observing twinkling stars, although that is a guess on our part.  It is virtually impossible to determine whether an object is moving, or not, when the observer is moving in a vehicle.  PD))Star light objects strobing red then white moving at very fast speeds for the altitudeMy 7 year old son and I were traveling home from Terra Huate Indiana and left there at 20:00. We traveled South toward Vincennes Indiana on Highway 41. As we were driving my son said he saw a blinking star. I sang the song &quot;Twinkle Twinkle Little Star&quot; and said where do you think that song was made from. He said no dad this star blinks. I started looking around in the sky and saw 4 non moving flashing stars. My son stated he saw 2 that I could not see. These stars were flashing either a red and white combination or just a plain white combination. I told him they were stars and continued driving for 10 minuits. He then said that one of these &quot;stars&quot; were moving I looked over toward the passenger side window and sure enough this &quot;star&quot; object still flashing red and white was moving. I told him it must be an airplane and continued watching it as I drove. The &quot;star object was visible at all times to me starting from the back window and flew south staying at the same distance out my windows not moving up or down. Within a minuite I watched this object go from the West side to the South side then worked its way to my East. So to make this easier to visualize picture a bug crawl at the top of your windows so you could see it at all times from the back passengers window to the front passengers window then along the top of the front window from passengers side to the drivers side then along the drivers side door window. At all times this star object kept level with the ground. Once it was heading on the drivers side window I noticed that there was another &quot;star&quot; object and they stopped moving fairly close together they stopped making their red/white combination flashes and just started flashing white at a slow speed while not moving. The white flashes sincrinized flashing beep   beep   beep at the exact same time. This occered for several minuits still driving 60 mph with these object not moving to us. The objects then moved to appear to form one object and started their wild flashing again. This! happened for another minuite or so and then they moved again toward different directions. They did have a different magnitude of light one a bit softer than the other and I watched the same one fly back to its original spot on the west side of the sky. Again flying the same way I described before but backwards. We watched these dancing stars the whole 1 hour drive and even into out drive way. I told my wife who stuck her head out the window and she saw one not moving then it did to her suprise. I do not think she has the same understanding of these objects as we do since she jsut saw a glimps. We had watched these things from Terra Haute to Bicknell. A one hour drive.There was no trail behind these objects. If the object is far enough in the sky that as I drive 60mph and it appears to be non moving while its stationary. My guess would be that it is very far up there. The distance that an object would have traveled at that altitude would have been emmince and to be able to travel it in less than a minuit would be impossible. If it was an aircraft such as a plane I would call detail to the hovering together and the sincrinizing of the blinking lights. Then why would it travel back to the same spot.The other lights would disapeare and reapear but never saw them move from side to side.The altitude of this object off of the ground as I saw it. Was while sitting in the drivers seat the object was visible at the top of the windows.Other than the things stated in this box Im not sure what else I could do except explain its flight path a bit better.If you feel that this is not enough information feel free to contact me through email. But as wanting or needing to have some one contact me thats purly up to you. I just wanted to document what I saw just incase others saw it as well.", "Bright light moving irregularly.I was watching an extraordinarily bright light in the southeastern sky.  Suddenly,it moved straight up and stopped.  Then it began to do half figure-eights.  Eventually, it blinked out altogether.", "I saw 3 things wednesday.  2ufo&apos;s and one strange thing.I pull security at a parking garage in the the heart of downtown.  I pull watch on 2 connecting garages, both 7 levels high.  I generally have to walk through both levels periodically every hour.  While working I generally like to star watch, so over the 2 mth period that I have been working, I have learned the star patterns for that area.  This particular night wasn&apos;t all that different than any other night.  The night was clear and the stars were out.  Because this was on early Wed. morning, downtown was pretty empty.  Let me begin by stating I saw 3 different things that night, also I am a black woman early 30&apos;s and in all my life I have never seen anything out of the ordinary.  I am also a gulf war vet, who has pulled a lot of guard duty outside. Let me repeat I have never seen anything out of the ordinary until now!  The 1st sighting wasn&apos;t a vehicle, it was a thing.  It was reddish-brown, had a tail,  moved like a jelly-fish to elevate itself higher &amp; higher in the air. After clearing the building it than went sideways to the right and after something shot out at it, it faded away. The 2nd sighting happened 15 mins. later.  The was a triangular shaped vehicle that a light at each point, this one is commonly seen in magazines.  The ship appeared from nowhere stated to take off in mid-air and disappeared again.  By the way there was no sound with any of these events.  I then went down to the first level to take a break.  When I return on one of the rounds, I saw object number 3.  It appeared from nowhere, floated away from me then disappeared.  At first I thought it was a plane, because of the blinking night,  but there was no sound.  As close as it was, if it were a plane it would have made sound.  Then I thought that it might be a blimp.  But there was no larger upper body.  Also, the direction of the way if floated, a plane or a blimp would not have been able to move that way.  I also thought that it could have been a helicopter, but the lights weren&apos;t right and like I said, there! was no sound.  Well that&apos;s my report. tj.", "Bright lights that changed color seen on  ground with corresponding area power surge.My husband and I, both in our late 30&apos;s, were awakened by a power surge in our home.  The computer turned on, the radio turned on etc.  We live on the top of a mountain so we have a good view of the surrounding mountains and valleys.  In the valley adjacent tour home the sky was bright white, after a minute or 2, there was a green light glowing from the ground, that lasted about a minute, then the light turned orange.  At that point I ran to the telephone to call the police.  When I returned to my bedroom, the colored lights were gone.  After a couple of minutes it looked as if a car had come to investigate.  We saw the headlights of the car aimed at the spot where the occurrence had taken place.  We went to sleep quite agitated, but thought possibly it was some sort of accident that occurred.  This morning I contacted the local police, and local fire departments, they had no reports of an accident.  I have asked others around town if they knew of what may have happened.  One other man that I spoke with said that he also saw bright lights last night.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at length via telephone, and she sounded quite objective and credible.

PD))", "Clouds over small aircraft airport flashing coded laser light to ground or vice versa, animals making noiseThis is really mysterious. My 2 daughters and I were up in the middle of the night but I forgot what we were doing. My younger daughter (a teenager) went out to get something out of her car on the street of our subdivision culdesac and came back in afraid of something going on outside. She called her sister to go outside to see it with her. they didn&apos;t want to tell me because they knew I&apos;d get in the car and go investigate it. So they stayed out there for about 10 minutes and then came running in to get me to come look at it too. They were scared and shaking all over, talking fast, explaining to me that they were seeing some sort of coded message going on with light across the field from our subdivision at a small aircraft airfield. First of all, every animal for miles around was making noise. It was amazing to me that not one person got up to see what all the noise was about. Not one light went on in any houses around us. Every dog in all the neighborhoods we could hear were barking their heads off. The cows and sheep in the pastures around our subdivision for miles were mooing and baaing, without stopping. Constant. Something was going on, that was for sure. I&apos;d never before or since experienced such a thing with the animals. There was a slight fog in the air, so that sounds were sort of muted or diffused. Even though it was dark out and the sky was dark, we could see this cloud formation over at this little air field at the end of our subdivision, which was east of us. We were in farmland area. The airport was only supposed to be for small aircraft, yet many times in the middle of the night, we heard big, loud, jets coming in for landings that woke us up with the booming of the jet whining as it came down and I feared it would crash into our house. Or land on our house, it was so low and so close. I wondered about that all the time. Many times, also, I would wake up in the middle of the night to broad daylight, I thought, as helicopters were in my backyard with bright lights shining in my high ceiling windows that I didn&apos;t have blinds for, shining lights into our yard. The helicopters were so low, they shook the house and were so loud, they woke us up along with the lights. I wondered why the neighbors never complained about this as it was a constant source of aggravation to us. I always suspected something funny was going on at that little airport, because these big aircraft, helicopters and things weren&apos;t supposed to be coming in and landing there. I don&apos;t remember hearing any taking off, either. Only landing. This one night with all the animals raising a ruckus, tho, something even stranger was going on. The girls pointed out to me a light across from us, across the field and landing strips of the small airfield that was either coming up from the ground going into the clouds or coming from the clouds going to the ground. It was impossible to tell because it would suddenly be there and then gone, in a straight bright thin light between the ground and the clouds. But it was a single white light like a laser light that would flash really fast and then go out in very sequential patterns like morse code. We stood shivering on the lawn watching it and counted as it would go, one, two, three, stop. One two three, four, stop. One, two, stop. One two, stop. Sometimes it would go all the way up to 21 and stop. But it would have repeating patterns of numbers. I never knew morse code, but I remember WWII movies and how it sounded as they tapped it out. This looked like what it would sound like, or it was obviously some message or code being played out before our eyes. It would pause between sets of numbers and then do another round of them. We stood there in the damp darkness, watching for at least 15 minutes, counting and wondering if we should be writing this down to see if someone could figure it out later. Someone who knew codes. The fog was weird, too, because it wasn&apos;t everywhere. It was here and there in patches, otherwise, it was a clear night. The whole night and outside had a strange, surreal feel to it. Not quite right. Something weird going on here. There were no clouds anywhere else but over the airfield where the light was going on and off. It was no beacon to warn planes and no spotlight. I&apos;d never seen it before or after in the 7 years I lived there. I wanted to get in my car and drive over there and see what was going on, close up, but the girls were too afraid and wouldn&apos;t let me go. They made me come in the house after awhile and were afraid of what was there and what it was doing. We watched out our living room window for another hour or more and it continued, unabated, while the animals never stopped making noise. Finally, we got tired and closed up all the windows and went to bed. I don&apos;t know how long it went on before we saw it or how long after we went to bed with all the animals howling. I still can&apos;t figure out how it didn&apos;t wake up the rest of the neighborhood, but not one opened a window and told their dogs to shut up or anything else. It was like we were the only ones alive on the planet or in the neighborhood to see and witness it.  About a year before that, we were standing talking in the driveway at night in the dark, and we saw a triangular black object with lights underneath slowly and silently go overhead while we watched it cruise by. It was pretty high up and very dark. Nothing reflected off it and it seemed flat and triangular. It came from the east, where the airport was and kept on going west right by us. I thought it was probably one of our military planes. If anyone has ever heard of anything like these laser lights going from sky to ground or ground to sky of clouds, I would like to hear about it and figure out what it was. It&apos;s been on my mind and I keep wondering what it could have been, what we should have done differently to find out and to try to find out what we saw. Why we saw it and no one else woke up. Why the animals were carrying on. The helicopters bothered us the whole time we lived there. They also bothered us where we moved to where I saw another sighting I reported, in Santa Rosa. In fact, black helicopters have been bothering us ever since 1973, in every state and place we&apos;ve lived.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

This light resembled the light of an arc welder slowly moving to the North about at an altitude abput three fingers held out at arms length above the horizon.  As the jet approached, the light sped off to the North at an extremely high velocity with the jet in hot pursuit.

We all watched the formation float down the coast past the Kure Beach pier. What eludes me is the absence of any sound and the strict line of flashing red lights that must have stretched for a half mile.  All lights were flashing in sync. In my opinion, helicopters and/or planes could not have flown in a strict line especially without noise and the number of planes or helicopters it would have taken to make a formation that long would be huge.

We looked through the binoculars at the &quot;star&quot;, and realized it indeed DID have blinking lights on it - they were very clear to both the naked eye AND through the binoculars.  As we all stood wondering what the hell it was, we noticed it was moving very strangely - we were all mezmorized.  I was so perplexed that I ven woke up our next door neighbors and showed them as well - EVERYONE was completely amazed as it was obviously NOT a plane of any sort.  We live near a small airport, and see planes every day.  This was NOT a plane.  After leaving my neighbors, I returned to the backyard to join my husband and brother, who had noticed very clearly ANOTHER UFO hovering VERY close to the ground seemingly only a few streets away - it seemed to be looking right at us.  We videotaped ALL of it.  There was also a VERY unusual amount of military air traffic that night, and four HUGE lighted government jets I have never seen before zoomed over our house towards the objects while we watched.  Pretty freaky. When we went inside to watch our video, all of the close up footage was gone and almost ALL of the other coverage had also been erased, however we still have VERY clear footage of the first object we saw!((NUFORC Note:  We will request &quot;still&quot; images from the video.

Warren AFB Wyoming sightingsI was serving at F.E. Warren AFB in Wyoming, I was on duty in the Missile Field doing the night shift. I was actually at Romeo site which is an installation of F.E. Warren AFB. I went outside to smoke a cigarette and saw a extremely bright light in the sky. It wasn&apos;t huge, It looked about the size of a plane you&apos;d see in the air. The light moved around for about 20 seconds then all of the sudden it flew away very fast, leaving a white bright tail behind it. I thought I was going nuts or was just possably sleep deprived, but when I told another flight mate of mine, he told me that himself as well as many others had seen the exact same thing over the skies of Wyoming late at night on numerous occasions. I had only seen it once but it I know for a fact that it wasnt a plane and it wasnt a blimp and no shooting stars moves around slowly for approximately 20 seconds and then just shoots off.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It may have been a balloon but it would have to be very large because of the altitude,  I am guessing 30,000 - 50,000 feet high.  I could barley see it with my naked eye.  I got out the binockulars for a better look.  It appeared to be tear drop and looked as though the bottom was moving around.  I have never seen a weather balloon,  it was to high to be an ordinary hot air ballon,  and it was deffinetly metalic because the sun was reflecting off of it.  It moved slow from my vantage point,  it took about 5 minutes to go from 11:00 high to 1:00 high.   One other thing I noticed,  at the time I spotted this thing,  the birds all around we cherping loudly every where.  At about the time I lost sight of this thing the birds stoped as well,  maybe just a strange co-incidence.....  Did any body else see this thing??", "Very intense bright  and changing light with many colors very far away .We were on a dock at the shell mound park fishing, and it was about 10 pm or so and we were all looking at the stars with binoculars and we also had our video camera. We saw the one very bright star in the west it seemed to very akward because it looked to be moving and changeing colors,  We watched it move across the sky and get very bright and change colors to red and white yellow and green.  My two boys saw it shoot somthing down and appear to dreg a smaller light, I could not see this but my girlfreind could.  I was probally the same light that the lady in L.A could see on the same night as reported by CNN.,.It after about 10 minutes got dim and then stayed in one spot. What we were looking at was not a star. When we watche the video on the t.v  I zoomed in on the light 600x,s and of course it got blury with digital pixels but the lights were clearly visable and the shape was sorta like a hexagon.

I was 4-5 years old, lying in bed staring out the window up at the night sky, when I noticed an object circling above. It was boomerang-shaped, golden, and circling the duplex my family lived in and the home next door. After watching for a while, I got out of bed to tell my dad (who was watching the late news) about the &quot;ghost bird&quot; flying above the house. He told me to go back to bed. When I did, it had left. However, I woke up later on in the night, and it had returned. I called it the &quot;ghost bird&quot; for a long time, until I found out about UFOs. I hope this helps.

The first two flashes were brighter than any star in the sky, and approached the brightness of Mars in the eastern sky.  The object covered approximately 10-15 degrees of sky in about a minute, before the flashes, which grew steadily fainter over time, became invisible to the naked eye.  The time between the flashes was several seconds, and occurred at irregular intervals.", "We filmed this bright red light off and on for 45 minutes or longer.Though we could visibly see the light,you couldn&apos;t tell it was moving until you looked at the view finder on the cam corder.The light was pulsating changing colors from red to white and changing size as well.We filmed it with steady hands, but the objects seem to move so quickly it was difficult at times to keep up with it.We saw only one at first then a second one joined it, but that one was farther away from the first,and when second light appeared the original light disappeared.The second light faded after roughly 15-20 minutes after the original light had left.((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witnesses might have been observing celestial bodies, but that is only a guess.

My sister had and I had just left a toy auction in the tiny Delaware town of Delmar and were heading north on Alt. Route 13 toward Laurel (DE). As I was driving, I looked up at the sky and couldn&apos;t believe what I saw. There were six bright blue lights evenly spaced across the sky. Directly below the blue lights in the same perfect straight formation were six red lights. Needless to say, I called for my sister to look up. At that moment, the six red lights shot green lights up at the blue lights in perfect synchronization. We were speechless, and I know our mouths were hanging wide open! Then, just as quickly as they seemed to have appeared, the lights disappeared from view. When I got home, I called the DE State Police. Whoever answered the phone seemed agitated that I had called, but did tell me that a jet had been sent from Dover Air Force Base to investigate, and that there had been no word as yet as to what - if anything - had been discovered (Obviously others had seen what we had!). I never heard another word about the event, and my sister and I rarely talk about it!?.

I had just dropped my girlfriend off at work in Ann Arbor and was heading back to our apartment in southern Ann Arbor. I was driving East on Packard St, towards Ypsilanti. Just after crossing Carpenter road, I saw a large object in the sky, just above the treeline. At first I thought it was a blimp, but when I took a second look at it, it seemed to have corners along the edges rather than a smooth curving surface of a blimp. Curious about what it was I decided to try to follow it. Basically, describe its physical appearance, it was dark, but it was far away so I cannot describe it as any more than a silhouette. Its size was about as long as a quarter held at arms lenght, but it was very far away, maybe a mile, but I am not very good at estimating distance. It seemed rounghly rectangular or hexagonally shaped, being maybe four times longer than it was tall. Its first appearence made me think &quot;Blimp&quot; but once again, the outline had corners and it seemed a bit too large and skinny. As I headed south on Packard, the object seemed to be vertically positioned just above the treeline. It was much farther away than the treeline as it would move slightly and sometimes be partially occluded by the trees. It also seemed to move slightly South and East.As I got closer, it seemed to become more occluded by the trees so I decided to turn South on Hewitt Rd. The object  continued to become more and more occluded by the trees. Soon, it dipped below the treeline and I was no longer able to see it and by the time I reached Ellsworth, I had lost it. I am not sure what it was. It was too slow and too big to be an airplane, and its shape didn&apos;t seem right to be a blimp. I rarely see blimps in this area anyway, except during football games, which was not today. I will email a drawing of the object.", "Silver Sphere in Southern CaliforniaAt the time noted my self ((name deleted)), my brother, and our friend witnessed a spherical object hovering in the Eastern sky.

He pointed to the clear sky and we looked up and then walked off the porch onto the street to see up in the sky something that looked liked a hot air balloon but it was all lit up and moved much quicker than a hot air balloon.  On the bottom of the &quot;hot balloon image&quot;  was a blinking light.  We watched for awhile and tried to determine what it was. . .we couldn&apos;t figured it out. . .because it moved to quickly to be a hot air balloon and not the shape of a blimp and moved much too quickly for it to be one.  Was not the moon because there was a blinking light on the bottom of this aircraft. . .I said it must be an UFO. . .they laughed. . .I said, &quot;Well it is an unidentified flying object. . .none of us can tell what it is!&quot;  Could this be some kind of alien aircraft?", "The craft hovered directly over a resturant called pier 66 about 50 to 100 feet above it.It&apos;s been many years and I&apos;m not even sure if I have the right year , month and time but once I tell you of the sighting it may coincide with another report of the same sighting if someone else reported it. I know there were others that saw it because several years ago someone I met mentioned that thy knew someone that saw the same thing as I.It was a craft that was heading south over the intercoastal waterway in ft lauderdale. It looked like a bright light, kinda like a headlight on a plane. A friend and I were traveling east over the intercoastal on 17 st .Looking north I saw this thing and said to my friend, What the heck is that  ? I was driving so it was a little tricky for me to keep my eyes on it . Suddenly in a flash it moved to a different locaion which was directly above a resturant called Pier 66. Funny thing about this resturant is that it rotates , or at least it used to and it looks like a round ufo .Pier 66 is like 10 stories high so it looks like a space ship on top of a building. This made us think that whoever was in the ufo might have looked at the building because it really looks like a saucer shaped craft.Anyway when we were going over the bridge the ufo was roughly the same size as the top of the pier 66 round building and it hovered what looked to be something like 50 to 100 ft above it. It was there for just seconds then it traveled across the sky to a distant location (in a split second) to a point that it looked as small as a star. Then in a split second again it traveled to the top of pier 66 and hovered above it again.Let me tell you this all happened so fast that we were still crossing over the bridge when this happened. Once we crossed the bridge we were heading east towards the ocean and then the craft started to move slowly east . It flew at a slow speed so we were able to watch it as we headed towards the beach.I could only glance at it from time to time because I was driving.My friend was watching it all the way .It flew at an angle and had some what I seem to remember red lights at the bottom. ( my friend drew a picture of it that year , he is an excelent artist ).Once we got to the ocean I was trying to pull over into a parking area on the beach so I could stop driving and just concentrate on looking at this thing. I pulled over and the craft was just crossing over the road A1A and heading over the ocean. It got over the water and again it a split second traveled across the sky to the point that it looked like a tiny star in the distance and just as fast came right back to the same spot it was just at. Then it slowly started moving east again over the ocean and then there was a big flash of different colors at it was gone.I wish I could remember the exact date and time but I never wrote it down. I hope someone else has reported this sighting so I can have more eyewitness accounts of it. This sighting made me want to see another one but to this date that was the last time I saw one.

This person&apos;s description is exactly what we saw. I was driving home with my two daughters and first I noticed what appeared to be two close aircraft flying quite high together and a high speed. My daughter, who was in the front seat, then noticed that after they crossed the sky (coming from east and moving west) all of a sudden turned around (in perfect formation) and came right back what seemed to be toward us. I was curious, and didn&apos;t want to continue driving on the highway, so pulled over into a school parking lot just off the highway. The object was just above the tree line and that was when I saw the outer shape of it, we then realized it was one object and those two bright lights were on each end and an amber light in the center front point and the huge size (I went back in the daytime with a friend the next day just to figure out just how big this shape was) and it was the whole length of the parking lot plus almost the length of the school building...so maybe 200&apos;??. There was just enough light to see this shape of a &quot;long V or triangle shape. My girls were quite upset, one in the back kept saying she didn&apos;t want to die and I didn&apos;t want to drive &quot;under it&quot; as the exit was underneath what seemed to be the front of it. It had the light arrangement similar to the Washington state one and my observed object did stop and hover just above the treeline in front of my car. It too did on/off of lights especially in the center edge closest to us. Those lights were colored like the &quot;old computer screen green&quot; and I got the feeling as they were pulsating back and forth that it was taking pictures of us. It then abruptly made a right angle turn and departed south and accelerated up at a very rapid speed with absolutely no sound. About two weeks I went back again and noticed all the trees in the path of its departure were defoliated. To this day, they are dead still.My girls were in denial and didn&apos;t want me to go blabbing all around about it...and only a year later on the &quot;Today&quot; show was there a sighting in New York that around 400 people saw/called in and an artist drawing of the description was on TV and it looked exactly what we saw. My younger daughter finally after seeing that on TV opened up and we started talking about it again. I have never forgotten this incident (It is my second sighting...other one was back in 1960 in broad daylight and others saw it (people eating at a Sandy&apos;s drivein)...but it was a small metallic disk with something rotating and hovered just above the telephone in my back yard. I was out working in a tomato patch and again I had a feeling of &quot;pictures being taken&quot; and then it just moved vertically up at an incredible speed and disappeared. (amongst all the gaping people chomping on their hamburgers)...so I continue to search the skies, read other people&apos;s sightings and feel some comfort that my &quot;triangular&quot; object has been seen by others. Fortunately, we did not have any &quot;missing time&quot; or strange marks on us....just my mental imprint that &quot;other things are out there&quot;. I am a passenger in a Cessna 170 and many times we have flown over the area....at night there is a striking strobe light acorss Lake Winnebago...maybe the triangular craft was honing in on that or &quot;mapping in picture form of the area??.

Right before going to sleep, after spending several hours of reading, I often turn out the lights in my apartment and look out toward the woods bordering our property from my living room window.  Something, a flash of light or pinpoint of light with motion caught my eye.  Looking due North I saw a brilliant white light about a dime in circumfurance rise up from behind the tree line, stand stock still for perhaps 30 seconds, and then begin moving forward on a direct line apparently meant to intersect and pass over our apartment building.  Being stunned and slightly incredulous, I just sat there staring as it moved very, very slowly directly on a straight line probably a couple of hundred feet in altitude.  I saw it move directly overhead and pass from view.  I llstened very intently, turning off my floor fan as soon as I knew it was on the move!  Its light was intense, white, unwavering, and constant.  There was absolutely no sound, even after it passed overhead.  I continued to stand watch at the window another 10 or 15 minutes trying to clarify, for my own benefit, what I had just witnessed.  It definitely was not a plane, blimp, ultra-lite craft, heliocopter, or any other aerial craft I have ever seen, since its motion was more like floating than flying.  This is the clearest view, yet of what I have been seeing in the skies in this area since sometime in the Fall last year.  Did anyone else see this, is my first question?

We went to the window &amp; I saw it for maybe 2 seconds.  We then ran outside at 9:45 p.m. to look at the sky above our street.  The object emerged from behind houses into full view and continued traveling from northeast toward the southwest.  It was a clear , dark night and the moon was a sliver in the south,behind us.  A few stars were visible.  The object made no sound and looked evenly lit up bright white.  It was oval in shape with the ends of the oval parallel to the horizon.  Around the whole perimeter were evenly spaced lights that glowed with a brighter blue-white light.  Standing on our sidewalk we observed this clearly for about 20 seconds.   I&apos;d estimate that it moved thru 40 degrees of arc until it was again hidden by trees/houses.  Both my husband &amp; I felt it was very large.  It was at least as large as 10 full moons.As far as height , it may have been between 600 -1200 feet  altitude.  It was at about 30 degrees  to the horizon ( NNE).

I lived in Bisbee Arizona for about twenty years, moving to Erie in 1992. In looking for accounts of an extended sighting of an aerial object in Bisbee in, I believe, 1980, I came across ((name deleted)) account on your site of another set of sightings I am not very familiar with. I do know ((name deleted)), consider him a reliable witness and he is one of the many witnesses to the 1980 affair. This was reported, years later, 30 Nov 95, in a Bisbee newspaper in an article by their staff reporter. None of the published accounts were even remotely like what I saw and carefully noted in my mind. Doing further research and field work, I found that this reporter was known to be inaccurate- to be kind about it, and even prone to gross sensationalism, this being the likely cause of the bizarre accounts published. No intended reflection on the publisher. I didn&apos;t think to remember the date of this incident but memory serves perhaps well enough. It was not hot, just comfortable, breezy and my recall of the nature of the lighting and timing and bearing of the sunset would all together lead me to estimate the time to be late winter, early spring. The news account gives the year as 1981 but I think it had to be 1980 from my own reckoning. I don&apos;t know how to contact ((name deleted)) to verify his account in the newspaper article. I&apos;m surprised he didn&apos;t give you folks there at Citizens Against UFO Secrecy an account of the 1980 spectacle. It was truly stunning.  ((name deleted) was quite a ways further away from it but still had a good view. I and another fella, ((name #2 deleted)), stood nearly under it for quite some time. I cautiously state that we did so for 10 minutes (no watch) though it was likely quite a bit longer. ((name #2)) and I (my first name is ((name #2 deleted)) too) were Bisbee&apos;s two leading mechanical shop owners and good observers of physical/energy realities. I had worked previously as a telemetry collector/analyst in the ASA for the NSA and so was! quite familiar with spacecraft and their capabilities, even being able to make the dubiously embarrassing claim of being a rocket scientist! This event occurred at about 6pm at ((name of fuel station deleted)) station on the Bisbee traffic circle. The object was nearly directly overhead, stationary, clearly visible!! ((name #1 deleted))  was about a mile and a half away, in South Bisbee, I seem to recall him saying that when he came upon us after the object left. We were about 150-200 yards from the Lavender Pit copper mine. I arrived from Douglas Arizona as ((name #2 deleted)) was closing his station, which he customarily did at 6pm. He and I stood for a few minutes talking, each with one foot up on the front bumper of my white 53 Chev panel truck on the station parking lot in the waning sun. I then had an odd feeling, looked about, then almost straight up and was shocked to see an object had appeared and was absolutely still above us. It was over the back of the Chevron property, overlapping onto an area called the Shady Dell. The sun was just disappearing down behind the Phelps Dodge mine track embankment, as seen from where we were standing. The object itself was in full sunlight, being higher up. My hand, at arms length, would not cover it up. There was a slight breeze. ((name #2 deleted)) then looked up to see what had me agape and was himself riveted to the sight. I finally looked over at ((name #2 deleted)) and asked him, &quot;Do you see what I see?!&quot;. ((Name #2 deleted)) said &quot;I sure do!&quot; We then looked it over keenly, both of us comparing notes of our observations. We were in agreement about what we were looking at. I&apos;m sure we both had thoughts run through our minds about whether we should leave the area immediately. We didn&apos;t feel threatened at all. It was just so extraordinarily strange to be in near company with such a thing. We had no idea what was going to happen and waited with bated breath. I, at one point, cast about looking for a stone to throw up at it to try and get a clearer sense of its height above us, and it&apos;s size. Then decided my action might seem unfriendly (stone! age savages it would appear) and for that matter the stone might come down and cause some property damage. Or some antimatter reaction. I abandoned the idea. It was a fair sized object. I thought that perhaps a low humming I was hearing might be coming from the object. We talked it over and finally decided that the slight noise was 60hz hum coming from the nearby overhead electrical wires. We had a kind of feeling about the object&apos;s presence that I can&apos;t quite describe, sort of as though there were some being up there observing and aware of us. The fact is though, we never saw any sign of such a sentient being. Just the handiwork and actions thereof. We noted that many of the cars coming around the traffic circle were slowing down, somewhat dangerously, then most accelerating vigorously on through the mine track underpass, itself nearly under the edge of the object. The cars could then be heard accelerating hard away from it onto the pit circumference highway up to Old Bisbee. Nobody stopped although they could be seen leaning down and forward briefly trying to get a better look. I think a lot of those people wished they hadn&apos;t seen it, my judging their reactions as they exited the area. I remember pinching myself and slapping myself, almost jokingly, to make sure I wasn&apos;t dreaming. In fairness, I should now describe the object though there is little to be said even though it was likely within a stones throw of us. It was an oblate spheroid. In more common terms, it was like a flattened or squashed sphere. From the top or bottom it would appear to be perfectly round or circular. From the side aspect it had kind of a horizontal football shape except the ends weren&apos;t pointed but instead gently rounded. It appeared to have curvilinear symmetry above and below the arbitrary &lsquo;belt line&rsquo;. It did not revolve or move whatsoever in the gently gusting breeze. It appeared to be made of stainless steel or perhaps aluminum or titanium or beryllium with a finely brushed matte finish. The disturbing thing, to a couple! of good physical observers as us two ((name #2 deleted)), was that the thing was absolutely perfect. There were no seams, slight irregularities or distortions, plates, rivets or any other deviations from it&apos;s monolithic perfection. The nearest thing that I can call up from our technologies would be a metallic balloon somehow squashed into the oblate spheroid shape. This would have stress lines and wrinkles though. It could not possibly be perfect, as this was. It would also be bobbling in the breeze. As I stated, this object was rock steady. As well, our observer sense of it was that it was hard bodied. We peered intensely at it for a long time. It was not hard to see at all, the object was nearby in full late afternoon sunlight. Atmospheric conditions, late afternoon, were good, with some slight shadowing on the object on the side away from the sun. There was no significant cloud cover other than a little bit of scuddy, stringy stuff.  We were not in a position to see where the sun angle would have thrown the objects shadow, unfortunately. That would have been an astute observation to make. I also did not attempt to walk directly under it, which would have given us a good lateral distance and from that a better guess at height off the ground and, of course it&apos;s size. We were a little too awed, I think, to put that plan in motion, thinking that something could happen at any moment, though I thought it out at the time as I tried to estimate those parameters. Making this process even more nebulous was the fact that the object had absolutely no features except for it&apos;s shape, color and finish appearance. There were no rivets, as I said, no seams, plates, ports, lights, hatches, vents, doors, windows, antennas, pitot tubes...nada. Featureless. ((name #2 deleted)) and I both discussed this back and forth as we carefully looked it over. Nothing. Nothing by which one might then judge it&apos;s size, distance and nature. It couldn&apos;t have sat up there any stiller than it did. After quite some passage of time, it suddenly did a small maneuver, ! almost comical, like the wobble of a top as it spins down. I would relate this as being a precessional wobble as of the physics of a gyroscope spinning down through it&rsquo;s structural harmonics and beginning to lose it&apos;s stability. The object wasn&apos;t spinning though, just wobbling. It was over in about three seconds, a couple of wobbles, and was instantly and fluidly moving quite steadily in the direction of the copper pit at about 10-12 miles an hour for the first hundred or so feet, which took it out of our line of sight behind the ridged embankment which carried tracks for the copper operation. It then appeared to us, visible over the tracks, in the direction and going in the direction it had originally disappeared in, approximately a mile away and going fast. It was now proceeding upwards at a steep angle at probably a thousand miles an hour, clearing the mountain containing the Queen Mine next to old Bisbee, and proceeding straight on out of sight at that angle, roughly in the direction of the setting sun. Surprisingly, considering the great speed it was now moving at, it still made absolutely no sound. These movements gave some hint as to the elevation of the object and it&apos;s size though not too reliably so. I would then estimate that it had been stationary over our heads at about 250 feet and was probably 80 to 100 feet in diameter and about 35-40 feet in height or thickness. ((name #2 deleted)) and I were surprisingly tired out by the experience and could conclude little other than what I have related. No little green men. We don&apos;t know what we saw. But we know what we saw. Paradox. It was nothing that our technologies could do then or even now unless it was an extremely realistic hologram projected from a satellite in space, as in Ronald Raygun&apos;s space based missile defense technology projects or something of that nature. I don&apos;t think so. Whatever it was, I don&apos;t think man had any thing to do with it. My memory is a little fuzzy about this but possibly ((name #2 deleted)) wife arrived at which point ((name #3 deleted)), ((name #4 deleted)) and a friend of theirs drove up, greatly excited. I can&apos;t remember the details of what they said they saw but I&apos;m sure it wasn&apos;t what was reported in the Bisbee news 15 years later. I then left, heading out down the pit highway towards Old Bisbee. I had gotten only through the mine track underpass, through the first S turn and was just straightening out towards Bisbee Blue when I heard a tremendous, shattering roar, echoing wildly about. It kind of scared me, I hunkered down in the seat of my old truck and looked out the window to see the second astonishment of the day. A jet fighter plane on flaming afterburner, flying an extremely risque trajectory from over Warren out over the pit, to my left not a hundred feet above my elevation, going in the same direction and flight path the object had a couple of minutes before. This aircraft actually had to bank hard left to miss Sacramento hill, or what&apos;s left of it on the edge of the pit, then hard right back on track followed immediately by a hard pull up to clear Copper Queen mountain. It following the path the object had, moments previous. Obviously in pursuit. Our government knows about these things. Who is kidding who here. Breathtaking. End of story.", "Strange vanilla star-like light descends over yard.I was out on the deck star gazing around 9:20 PM. Suddenly, out of nowhere a beautiful bright vanilla star about the same size and color Mars is at the moment appeared very close overhead in the north sky and started to smoothly descend towards me. It was a steady light, moving deliberately and did not seem to be a falling star or comet. There was no noise. The speed at which it decended is hard to describe as it was as if it was a controlled speed, not really fast or slow but very smooth and deliberate. It came in so close to the yard it was level with the high treetops. Although at first I was mesmerized by it&apos;s beauty, the closer it got to me, I became terrified, ran to the glassed in deck door, tore it open and backed in, never taking my eyes off it. I know this sounds crazy but it was as if the light could sense my fear and retreated backwards until it faded from view. It looked like a bright star with a hard, almost diamond-like  brilliant center surrounded by a softer glow of the same color. Also, at the risk of sounding absolutely bonkers, the reason why I got so frightened was, I felt like it would have come right down to me if I hadn&apos;t gotten out of the way. I went out later several times to see if it was still in the area, but I didn&apos;t see it again.

We seen some that would fade in and out randomly.. You could see it then you couldn&apos;t then where you&apos;d expect it would be after continuing same path it would show up.   Within minutes of seeing all this activity of the lil dots in the sky which radiated white light,  Aircraft was popping.  So basically we didn&apos;t think it was normal for the first objects to fly that fast across sky and they didn&apos;t blink or have red light like alota air crafts are suppose to.  We also seen another that actually blinked white.  But it was very random.  It would be like blink then 10 secs later blink blink blink... No pattern what so ever.  One of the last events we can remember besides all the objects shootin around was we seen two moving that looked identical.  One stopped and the other head straight towards it then there was only one and it was moving??   So the objects moved very quickly, didn&apos;t flash like normal aircraft and if it did it was very random.  The objects would change course and path very easily.  3-5 planes were seen within 5-8 minutes of activity.

The object appeared to be no more than several hundred feet in the air. The reason we believe this to be the case is due to heavy clown cover on this particular evening and the object was below the clouds. While observing the object we kept commenting on the way the object was rectangular in shape and was a bright orange glow almost the color of a street lamp. However, the edges of the object appeared to be emitting what looked like flames also, we noticed the object did not dim nor brighten as it moved across the sky. The object also appeared to be rotating in a slight circular motion as it passed overhead.

It did not, but after about ten seconds two of the plane&apos;s engines/comtrails shut off, and then POOF the plane just DISAPPEARED!  It simply VANISHED!

It moved horizontally, in the opposite direction of the airplane.", "Red blinking high in the sky leading the way.On the way home from a weekly meeting on a Wednesday evening (9/15/75 is the closest I can come to the date) I observed a red blinking light which appeared to be leading the way or protecting me.  It darted around high in the sky at about 75 degrees. It moved quickly and lasted for about 10 minutes. It happened every week for as long as I traveled that way (about 2 months). I have a BA in psychology and minor in economics and have worked in aerospace.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

They were a sort of rusty/copper colour that glowed. they were flying where birds fly (as opposed to aeroplanes) and were very small, about an arms stretch in length. They were very like a saucer shape with a sphere in the middle but much more oval (more like a horizontal eye shape!). the middle one was rocking between the other two as they flew over us.their were four of us that saw them all of us musicians and in our middle age, I am an avid believer but two of them were a little skeptical before, they are not know!", "&quot;like someone had hung christmas deccy&apos;s in the sky&quot;It was at night and I was 12.I was sat outside on my own feeling fedup staring into the gutter when I noticed it was very bright, and felt immediately cheered by the prospect of a full moon so I looked up and got a big surprise. Directly across the road were four semi detached houses and a huge silver ball above them. It had the same kind of shine you get from turned aluminium, like someone had stuck christmas decorations in the sky. To the right was a lane filled with a small copse of trees and across the road on the skyline there stood a hirise block of flats, above the entire lenght of one of the blocks was a silver cigar/cylinder shaped object. There was no sound, and I guess I sat and stared at these things for about 3 mins. It wasn&apos;t scarey it felt kinda peaceful, but then it occured to me to go get a grown up so I ran inside but by the time I&apos;d convinced my mum to come and have a look they were gone.At the time we lived about 2 miles upwind from a chemical complex so theres no way you could ever smell anything but sulphur so I can&apos;t say if there were any accompanying smells.I&apos;ve read alot of ufo stuff over the years in order to try and solve this one for myself, but so far nope. The ball wasn&apos;t the moon and the cigar thingy wasn&apos;t quite the right shape for a zepplin, the closest descriptions I&apos;ve ever come across have been here so I&apos;ll share this now with more brains in the hope someone can work it out. Growing up where I have I&apos;ve seen the prototype probes and delta winged aircraft, so I&apos;m aware of some of the more peculiar objects in the sky at weird hours, but short of viewing a 5th dimensional object I can&apos;t explain this one.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

I was driving. Out in the country like we were, you dont see many lights, and the stars are always out on a clear night. I happened to notice what a thought were a bunch of really bright stars, but when i looked up i couldn;t beleive my eyes. three whitenlights in a perfect triangle moving relativly slowly through the sky, the lights much brighter and probably three times the size of stars. i started yelling at my friends to look and they got a little freaked out as we pulled over to watch. suddenly the lights just dimmed out and we didnt see them again. we never heard a sound from it, but then again we were in a rather large loud truck.", "I was at a corn roast at my cousin across the road from us. There would have been at 30 or mor people there between various relatives and neighbors. I was off in the corner of the yard talking with my younger brother and one of my male cousins when I had this eerie feeling come over me. I looked around and didn&apos;t see anything, then I looked up and directly over my brother cousin and I was this flying saucer that looked just like the one on the tv show &quot;Lost In Space&quot;. I said to everyone there &quot;hey look everyone there&apos;s a flying saucer over us&quot;. Nobody seemed to care. They just went on socializing. Nobody panicked. I kept talking with my cousin and my brother in the corner of the yard constantly looking up to see what the craft was doing and seeing if it was still over us. I was facinated by this craft. While watching it it almost looked like a window opened up just like the way the window would open up on the tv show. It looked like the window glided from right to left. It continued hovering over us for quite a while. I have to admit that I was starting to get a little nervous. Then my mom an aunt and a neighbor decided to walk back home by going around the block so I decided to go with them. The saucer started to follow us. It stayed with my mom my aunt my neighbor and I till we got to our house 5 minutes away from the party. I went in my house and came out the back door to see if it was still there. It was . Hovering right over our house. So I went back in the house and came out the front door and looked to see if it was still there and it was. So I said to my mom and aunt that its still here. They still didn&apos;t care. I went in and out of my house about 4 times like this when the last time I came out in the back yard it took oo straight up in the air at the speed of light without making a sound. I remember asking my brother and cousin if they remembered seeing the saucer and they both said no. I asked my mom also years later if she remembered seeing the saucer and she also said no. ! I also saw a space craft that looked just like the &quot;Us Eneterprise&quot;. I was 15 years old and it was prabably the end of January early February. The temperature was about minus 10 to minus 20 below farenheight. I was delivering my papers as I had a paper route at night that started about 16:00 to 18:00. It was a real clear night. There was a full moon out as well as stars in all direction. I was probably 2/3s done of my route when I started up the highway out of South Lancaster heading west to do the 5 houses out that way. I remembered getting this weird feeling that something wasn&apos;t right. I couldn&apos;t put my finger on it at the time. Then I realized that I wasn&apos;t hearing any traffic. The traffic on the 401 carries quite far on a clear crisp night. As I started to cross the stell frame bridge over the Raisin River I kept looking all around me. Something wasn&apos;t right. Ilooked up into the sky and didn&apos;t see anything. I looked up and down the road. I looked to the north and didn&apos;t see anything. Then I looked south and seeming to be just above the tree tops gliding silently and on the edge of the St lawrence River is this huge crimsom red space ship exactly like the &quot;Us Enterprise&quot;. Now I have to say that I was trying to convince myself that I really wasn&apos;t seeing it but there it was bigger than a jumbo jet. I tried to get my papers delivered quickly to try and follow it but it was soon out of my sight. When I couldn&apos;t see it anymore the sounds of the traffic could be heard. Cars came up and down the road. Prior that incident there wasn&apos;t a car to be found other than the ones on the 401 to the north of me. Again I told my parents but like I suspected the usual reaction was your seeing things. I said yes I saw a huge space ship just like the &quot;Us Enterprise&quot;. I mean right down to the two potoons and huge light in the middle of the ship. I mean this was the spittin image only it was red. I was absolutly in awe.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We had just got done eating and since it was a beautiful night out we decided to sit outside to talk.  The house we were staying at was in the woods and there were no street lights making the stars and sky as bright as ever.  As we sat there, someone said, &quot;look, a satelite!&quot; and pointed to an object that was moving across the sky...very high up.  It actually looked like a star that was moving.  As we watched it...it stopped moving...and traveled back in the opposite direction...disappeared for a few seconds, re-appeared and continuted traveling across the same path again.  As we watched in amazement, a second, then third then fourth object came across the same path.  As each reached a certain point in the sky they disappeared.   After discussing amongst ourselves we realized that they were too high up and traveling too fast to be any type of satelite.  Plus the fact that the first one actually stopped and reveresed direction at one point.   No alcohol or drugs are used by me or any of my friends.  Just the right place at the right time!", "extremely high altitude, medium bright light emitting faint, glittery orange streaks in all directionsI&rsquo;ve always been reluctant to outright accept the existence of extraterrestrial aerial craft, or UFOs.  Even after seeing something a little strange when I was a kid that I&rsquo;ve never really been able to explain.   I think I was about 14 or 15 (it was a long time ago, maybe 1970 or 71).  It was mid-Summer in my home town, Lansing, Michigan, and my best friend and I were playing softball with some other kids at the neighborhood school ground.  When it started getting too dark for softball, we walked back to our street.  When we got to my house, the stars had just begun to come out.  I went in the house and grabbed a couple sodas and went back outside.   We both laid back on the grass of the front lawn next to the driveway, looking up into the sky.  At the same time, we both saw a stationary point of light that was a blue-green color.  It wasn&rsquo;t overly bright, but it was larger than any &quot;star&quot; I had ever seen, so it was distinctly noticeable, yet it seemed to be way, way up there amongst all the other stars.  I would estimate (from memory) that a bee-bee held between the thumb and index finger at arm&rsquo;s length would represent the visually perceived size of the object from the ground.  Anyhow, we watched it for maybe fifteen minutes.  During that time, it wasn&rsquo;t doing much, other than pulsating slightly (twinkling).  Then, we started seeing faint orange glittery streaks of light shooting from it.   I remember saying something like, &quot;Woah!  Check that out!&quot; and my friend said, &quot;Yeah, man, I&rsquo;m seein&rsquo; it too!&quot;  They were shooting out from the object in all directions, and each streak ended in a tiny white sparkle, except for some of them that seemed to be actually impacting smaller &quot;stars&quot; surrounding the object, as if it was shooting some sort of weapon at them.  To a couple of imaginative teenage boys, this was pretty exciting stuff.  But even then, I remember thinking, maybe it&rsquo;s a satellite, or some other man-made spacecraft, and the streaks shooting from it are booster jets being used to man! euver the object or reposition its orbit.  If only I had a telescope.  The streaks were like fireworks right after they&rsquo;re launched, when you can just make out a faint spark trail as they shoot through the sky before they explode.  In fact, the scene was kind of like a miniature version of the finale of a major fireworks display where they shoot off a whole mess of fireworks all at once.  This &quot;stellar battle&quot; lasted for another fifteen minutes or so, and then the thing simply blinked out.  Just like that.  It was gone.  We told everybody we knew about what we had seen, and I&rsquo;m not sure who believed us and who didn&rsquo;t.  Like I said at the beginning of this accounting, I&rsquo;m a little skeptical about things like this.  I&rsquo;ve always figured that what we saw probably has some perfectly normal, &quot;down-to-earth&quot; explanation. (Not that I have any clue what that might be.) (???)  Anybody else ever seen anything similar?((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "Craft moves at least 43,200 miles per hourI was headed North bound on I85 coming from gastonia to charlotte .

Then all of a sudden it moved a distance of about 6 to 8 miles from beside of me to ahead of me in less than a half of a second and came to another dead stop as I watched for just another minute or so the light took off again and just litteraly vanished in thin air headed in a North East direction. I calculated the speed of this craft to be a minimum of 43,200 miles per hour.

There were three lights, all the same color: white, a little on the warm side, like tungsten.  They were close together, almost touching. It wasn&apos;t completely dark and I could not see a structure connecting or connected to the lights against the background sky.  I was answering my cell phone, and thus a little distracted during the sighting.  I initially thought the largest light was a bright interior light of the helicopter cabin, followed by a slightly smaller light on the rear rotor, topped by the third navigation light, a point source blinking at about 1 or 2 Hz.  After observing it for a second or two, it hit me that the pattern of lights didn&apos;t match a helicopter. I didn&apos;t hear a sound coming from it, which occurred to me after the event.  There also is a fair amount of freeway noise coming from the direction of the sighting, which may have been drowning out the motor if it were a helicopter.  This object was traveling east to west.  I viewed it directly from the north (ie., I was looking south).  It seemed to be coming from the Rose Bowl area and it headed off through Cresenta Valley going toward Sunland. I have logged many hours in small aircraft, including helicopters, and can identify many aircraft by make.  I actively search the sky for UFOs.  This is the third strange light I&apos;ve seen.  I&apos;d like to hear from anyone who may have seen this as well, or who can confirm it was simply a helicopter.

These bars of light are white, red, and blue . They seem to be pulsating in intensity.

Being so high in the air I would say that it was about 15 feet long and 7 feet wide in the biggest areas. This stretch of 101 has hills on both sides with no buildings or homes. The object caught my eye out of the front windshield and appeared to be going the same speed (70 mph) as the car for about 3-4 seconds. Then it shot off straight out leaving a white trail behind it for about 2 or so seconds and completely dissappeared.

On Friday, October 3, 2002 at 6:45 p.m. she was standing at her kitchen sink washing some dishes looking outside and admiring a beautiful blue sky. She said all of a sudden something dropped down from out of no where. She described it as being oblong in shape and traveling at an angle of approx: 30 degrees. She told me the front of it was kind of blunt, with a &quot;tiny&quot; tail behind it which went to a sharp point. She described the color as being white with a glow around it being an off white color. The sighting lasted for 8 minutes in length as she did check the clock on the wall. It traveled from the northwest heading northeast. The witness did open her window in case she might hear something from it, but no sound was heard at all. From her location, and &quot;guessing the approx: size, she said it would have been roughly the length of her outstretched arm. The witness did contact the local radio station to see if anyone else might have reported it, but no one had.

Moved in full view, low in the sky in less than 60 secondsI was on my front porch smoking and I noticed this long light, like a star that moved fast and kinda sparkled moving south.

I called my friend who lives one street over in hopes that he was also outside smoking and asked him if he saw it too.  He was not outside at that time so he did not, however he did go out and look and he saw three helicopters moving in from the south and they were circling and literally hovering in an area in the south west about 6 or so miles away. I was still on the phone with him while he was telling me about the helicopters and I hung up and walked (about a block) over to his house and I could see the helicopters myself.  They were too far away to have caused the &quot;light&quot; that I saw.  But they were certainly searching for something.  On the 11:00 news there was a report that there had been many calls into 911 about &quot;bright lights&quot; in the sky and &quot;rattling&quot; of houses.

And exactly what were those three helicopters investigating???", "My girlfriend and I saw an object that resembled a moving &quot;star&quot; for about 45 minutes.My girlfriend and I were attending the Bonnaroo music festival in manchester, TN.  At the time, and at no point during that day were we under the influence of any mind altering drug.  It was a clear night and we were sitting outside our tent looking at the stars.  I was looking at one area of the sky and I thought I saw a star move.  I asked my girlfriend if she saw the same thing I did.  She saw it as well.  The &quot;star&quot; dipped and began to move across the sky and do loops and twists.  At times it would drop down and the shoot back up and dart across the sky.  We watched this for about 45 minutes, then my girlfriend wanted to go to sleep so I went into the tent with her.  We couldn&apos;t have been the only ones who saw the object, as the festival had over 80,000 people there.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "small orange oblong craft seen over Charlotte, NC at 19:14 on October 02, 2003I saw 1 orange clearly glowing object moving horizontally from NW to SE at about the speed of a jet craft would go at that altitude, which could have been about 5-7 miles high.There were no unusual movements.  The craft got smaller and smaller but it was not possible to tell whether it was getting further away or getting smaller.  I&apos;m assuming that it was getting further away.  It seemed therefore to be moving horizontally and further away at the same time, so it&apos;s direction was more NNW to SSE from my vantage point.  I was walking exactly SE according to the map I just consulted.There was nothing on the craft that didn&apos;t glow, and the color of the light was uniformly orange, glowing orange (though not blinding).  Due to this fact I felt compelled to report it, as I&apos;m convinced that it wasn&apos;t &apos;one of ours&apos;.  The orange light wasn&apos;t a &apos;running light&apos; or anything.  The entire craft was glowing orange. It was shaped a bit oblong, like an ellipse with a very large major axis, almost to the point of not being an ellipse anymore, but a cigar.  Its size was such that if you held up your pinky (little finger) you could hide it from view (possibly requiring you to close one eye, although I didn&apos;t try this). The glow was slightly larger near the front I suppose indicating more volume or mass in the front of the craft.  And, this was definitely NOT Mars.  Although the craft wasn&apos;t moving at any &apos;fantastic&apos; speed, it was still moving quite a bit too much to be mistaken for a planet.", "I immediately noticed a bright yellow/red round object  in the sky.Hello Brian,  I&apos;ve decided to report a UFO sighting that took place on Friday  9:00 p.m., Sept  12, 2003 . I was leaving from the front of my apartment building on the south side of W.2nd ave and Maple st. in Kitsilano. I immediately noticed a bright yellow/red round object  in the sky, traveling from West to East at about the same height as Grouse mountain. It seemed to be over the Eastern North Shore mountains/Pitt Meadows area, or, even as close as the Second Narrows bridge vicinity.Very difficult to judge the locale, exactly.Anyhow, I watched it for a good 5 seconds before it disappeared behind obstructing buildings in the downtown. I would like to believe that it was a jet fighter going crazy, but ,no flashing lights or sound. A jet helicopter? Doubtful. Too large and fast, I&apos;m afraid. Again, it was covering a fair distance in the short time I saw, and was changing levels somewhat, giving me the impression that it was almost floating while traveling, rather than going in a directly straight line from West to East.Very interesting, indeed. I wish that I could add more to my story, but that is all I can really tell you. Thank you to the witness for the report.

Your other witness saw the object as she was entering I-5 southbound near Lombard St., about 4 miles sw of the tower at PDX.  My wife saw a white, circular object hovering in the direction of I-5 &amp; Lombard, but she saw it near the intersection of 102nd &amp; Sandy Blvd., about 3 miles se of the tower at PDX.  Could you verify the date with your other witness, because my wife is absolutely certain she saw this object at about the same time on the 5th (it was her day off work and she was running errands)?  Unlike you other witness, my wife did not see any fighter jets in the area, but it sounds like your first witness saw the object almost directly overhead, whereas my wife&apos;s line-of-sight was more like 45 degrees above the horizon.  Thanks and if I can answer any other questions, please feel free to contact me or my wife. Kind regards, ((name deleted)) Gresham, OR  Please note that I have completed the rest of this form based on what the witness (my wife) told me.  I haven&apos;t checked any of the boxes, because none of the characteristics apply to the object she saw (she said it was a brightly lit white object that never changed colors) and although she wouldn&apos;t be opposed to speaking to an investigator and having her name released, she doesn&apos;t necessarily require that one contact her.", "Triangular craft spotted over Venice, FLWhile stopped at a traffic light at the intersection of Jacaranda Blvd. and Rt. 776, I noticed a triangular shaped craft heading due west.  It was flying quite low at about 5,000-7,000 feet.  It was a cool night and I had the window open and there was no noticeable sound.  Although the sky had darkened, there was still enough light left to see that there was no vapor trail behind it.  It was definitely a triangle with 2 blinking slivery-blue lights on 2 of the apices and one white light on the front apex.  The 2 other lights blinked in synch with each other.  I am familiar with the usual flight patterns around here.  I also know that the airport in Venice, FL is only for small private plane.  This craft was not coming in for a landing as there is no airport in the direction in which is was heading.  Also there was no airport it could have taken off from that could explain its really low altitude.  I could tell it was black in color from what little light was left in the sky.  This thing must&apos;ve been seen by many others in that area because the intersection was really busy with traffic.  The fact that there was no sound and no vapor trail, its low altitude and relatively slow speed moving from east to west toward the Gulf tells me that this was no ordinary craft.", "Large Black TriangleI am from Welland but when my family went camping in Fonthill, my brother pointed out something strange in the sky. I am not sure if it was a ufo or not. It was hard to see because it was black, but if you looked closely in the sky you could see a large, dark triangle, darker than the sky, with shining white lights that looked like big stars at each point.", "Formation of  white lights moving in a random pattern in a northwesterly directionWas standing on my deck when i observed 6 white lights that did not change color in a circular pattern, equidistant from each other moving in a counterclockwise direction, then a clockwise direction very slowy.i would say that the altitude was less than 2000 feet. The pattern then changed to a v formation moving northwest very slowly.I went around my house to follow the lights and my neighbors parents were in the driveway unpacking their car.I asked the gentleman if he observed the lights also. He confirmed them and was as puzzled as I to what it could be.There was no sound associated with them. They continued Northwest in movement and we lost sight of them because of trees.", "Yellow/orange light in evening sky followed by military jet activityI was unloading my car at my apartment and I noticed a gold/orangey light in the sky, I was facing South. It was really bright, which caught my attention because normally Portland at night is really cloudy and you can&apos;t see much. Anyway, I noticed the object and I got an &quot;eerie&quot; feeling, for lack of a better word. It was just one light, no blinking. It came from the west, not terribly fast, then it seemed to slow down, but was still moving. No sound. There is lots of airplane activity around where I live, so usually it would be no big deal. I know what the commercial planes look like at night, and it wasn&apos;t one I am used to seeing. Just when I was ready to brush it off as a weird plane the object began to move erratically, &quot;jerking&quot; in strange ways. I turned around and shut the trunk of the car, which caused me to face north and then I turned back around and it was gone. I got a weird feeling and started walking back to the apartment. Just as I reached the door I heard military jets do a fly over, it was weird though because I couldn&apos;t see them when I just saw the light a moment ago. I have no idea if it was just one plane or what but it was really loud. I then went inside my apartment and told my husband, who seemed unimpressed. Also, NOT SURE on the time, I approximated.", "Falling star?I was out on my back porch last night, close to the intersection of Fillmore and Union. I was looking around like I usually do at night in hopes that I can see...something new. I noticed a light far off in the distance. It appeared to be right above a mountain peak ( which I have not yet determined the mountain) which was between Ft. Carson and the closest mountain by Hwy. 24 headed west. At first I thought it was just a star...but when I looked back no more than 1 minutes later, it had descended towards the top of the mountain...slowly but YES, it had moved. I thought not to much of it Yet... I continued my &quot;gazing&quot; around the sky. The next time I turned and looked at my &quot;star&quot; it was gone. I assume it either &quot;landed&quot; or impacted the mountain, or simply gone behind it. While this could have been a star, I have never noticed a &quot;star&quot; to move that distance in such a short time... I cant explain it...nor can I explain the fire balls me and my friend have seen near Ft. Carson before either... Thats another sighting though...", "White spheres connected with what had the flexiblity of rope.  Moved like a snake thru the sky.It was 12:30 PM on September 21, a very clear day.  The object was white, two round spheres connected with what had the flexiblility of rope (&quot;the connector&quot;).  It was being propelled through the sky by the rope-like connector.  The connector moved like a snake slithering through the sky.  It was moving faster than any plane I have seen.", "They were aligned in a triangle formation they appared to be rotating in a circle.There was a burst of green light then they disapeared.((NUFORC Note:  If this is a serious report, we wonder whether the lights observed might have been advertising lights.  PD))", "Opaque white beams of light that repeatedly  hit a lamp, turning it on and off...I dont recall the exact date of this, all i know is it was in the winter of 99-00, probably between January and February 00.  Its taken me awhile to come forward cuz it was a very scary experience, and many people would question my sanity.  It was shortly after 11:00 pm, and i was reading up in my living room by myself.  We lived on shore property of a lake at the time, and our living room was an upper story room directly overlooking our lake.  My recliner was right next to our huge picture windows, and it was a great view...anyways, i simply saw a beam of light shoot into my house.  It didnt just &quot;appear&quot;, it seemed to grow from a point i could not tell over the lake, and expand into the room.  It was about the diameter of a softball, and very opaque white in color.  The most incredible thing though, is that when it reached its furthest point, it actually hit the lamp kiddy-corner from me in the room!  Immediately the light turned OFF and the &quot;lazer beam&quot;  just withdrew.  I was so completely stunned that i just sat and stared-i mean this beam had passed no more than 2 feet directly in front of me and turned off one of my lights!  So i tried not to freak out, and decided to stay where i was and watch.  No more than a minute later the same beam shot back in, hit the lamp, and turned it on!  At this point, i was beyond scared.  So i got up and ran into my bathroom, crouching low to my floor so i wouldnt get hit.  The bathroom was directly to the right of the lamp that was being hit, so i partially closed the door to &quot;protect&quot; myself and still watch. For the next 5-6 minutes the beam continued to shoot in, turn on or off the light, then recede.  After those 5 or so minutes, it didnt happen again, the light just remained off.  So from there i booked it downstairs to my mother&apos;s room.  She was trying to sleep of course so when i frantically woke her and raved about &quot;lazer beams&quot;, naturally she  was a lil&apos; peeved! But my mom sat up with me to look out her window (same lake view as upstairs) ! for a couple minutes.  We actually saw different beams of white light shooting horizontally in various directions. By the time 10-ish minutes were done, the lights were done.  I (carefully) went upstairs to make sense of it all attempt sleep.  I must add to this that When i went back up there, i heard a very low-decibal sounding hum, that kind of vibrated inside my ears, and it seemed to be all around and above our house.  I figured i was only hearing the refridgerator, but i know how that sounds-quieter and higher piched than this new sound-plus i heard it shut off short after.  The low humming continued a few more minutes, but i was so spooked i went to bed!  I should also add that there were other instances when we lived on the lake that we had seen diagonal light beams, discs, and strange sattelite-type lights.  I was 15 at the time, just a home-school student getting ready to go to college early, and always an honest, intelligent person.  I was most definately not on any hallucinogenic drugs either!  My mother can vouche for what i saw, and i&apos;m happy to share it w/ u.  But i do have a ?:  has anyone else seen these?  I really havent heard anything quite like what i saw, inspite of the fact that i listen to Art Bell and Whitley Strieber religiously! O- almost forgot to add that the next morning when i examined the window the glass was fine, the screen looked sorta burnt, and there was a perfect circle melted out of the weather plastic!  WHY?", "Harvard, IL.  11/8/03 8:00 pm 5 minutes triangle shape no noise traveling to the south south east lights on side and rearwent out to watch the eclipse of the moon and noticed what appeared to be an low flying aircraft to the south east.  had a row of lights on what would be my left side with two large bright white lights at the rear.  there was a flashing light at the top of the aircraft. can not remember what color.  it made no noise i could hear.  from where i stood, as it turned to the south, the lights at the rear appeared to be 3/4 to an inch apart.  it was flying too low to be a commercial aircraft and appeared very large from my perspective.  at the time i did not notice any other aircraft in the area.  commercial aircraft the fly over my house from the west northwest are by my estimation are at approximately 20 thousand feet  and decending.  the object i have described appeared to be under 5 thousand feet", "UFO sighted by four people in Sidi Yahia, Morocco, North AfricaDear Sirs:  While stationed in Sidi Yahia Morocco, my wife and I were asked to go to the Receiver Site to witness a UFO that had partially exploded and then fl flew back up again.  We could not get past the Marine Sentries although they verified what had happened.  We were originally notified by phone by by a CT from the transmitter site. Later that night when the CT got off duty he came to our house with his wife (who worked for the Captain of the base) and had us come out and witness witness the UFO hovering silently up in the air.  It was a gray disc shape with red and green lights on the bottom and was completely silent.  Could not s see the top of it as it was overhead.  It was hard to judge the size but the night was sparkling clear that far out in the desert.  It was not a weather balloon as it was too big and did not move but hovered silently.  I did not stay up to witness it leaving as my wife and I both had to report to work early in the morning and we were conscientious workers and did not drink or smoke. This is an authentic report from a military e-9 (30 years service) and his wife who worked for the U.S. Government. My wife went to work at Supply the next morning and when she reported it, they all laughed at her. The E-8 or E-9 who worked at the Transmitter site was demoted the next day to Barracks Master at Arms. What does this tell us.  Were they flying a captured UFO in that remote area or was it from outer space and our government knows about it.Quite a mystery that I will never solve in my lifetime.((NUFORC Note:  We have requested more information about the event.  Date is approximate.  PD))", "a bright yellow object floating from the heavens.I was driving home from work as I approached a hill driving north on Pasco 41, I observed a bright yellow light to the west, it continued to drop to the earth at a slow speed, at about 300 feet, it remained stationary for a few seconds. Then it assended in a full circle and went north east at a high rate of speed, saw a red light in the center of its yellowish body. I heard no noise from any engines during this period", "Explosion of lights appear upon requestIt was New Year&apos;s Eve,1991 or 1992. I was 12 or 13-years-old, and my father was having a New Year&apos;s Eve Party at his house. One of the guests had two boy&apos;s about my age, so we were playing outside as young boys do.My father lives in a subdivision atop a hill in a culdesac surrounded by woods. As we were playing in the culdesac, we began to see strange lights at the bottom of the hill in the woods. I remeber atleast two sets of them. They were white and moved back and forth for atleast 30 to 45 minutes. The trees obstructed our line of sight, so all we could only see the glow of the lights some 200 yards away, and not what was causing them. We urged the adults to come outside and look, to which they resonded in typical adult fashion for us to go along and keep playing our little games.When we returned outside the lights were still there. Even in my pre-teens, I was quite the open minded individual. So, I dedcided we should try and communicate with them. By this point the two other boys with me were becoming quite scared, yet I was relaxed.We stood in the culdesac and I literally said, &quot;If there is something out there give us a sign.&quot; Nothing happened, at first. We had been outside in the cold December night for nearly an hour, and the others really wanted to go in at this point. But I urged them to wait just a few more minutes. Once again, I said, &quot;If there is something out there, give us a sign.&quot; Immediately following my second request, a bright &quot;star&quot; lit up in the apex of the sky directly above us. Though looking towards the woods, when the &quot;star&quot; appeared we all three simutaneously looked up.The &quot;star&quot; shot down from the sky, followed by a tail, and struck a wooded, rather large hill about a mile from our vantage point. It was silent- no boom when it hit- yet it cast the most brilliant display of colors I have ever seen across half of the horizon in that direction. The colors bloomed upward from where the &quot;star&quot; hit. I remember alot of green, red and orange. From the moment I asked for a sign for the second time up until the display of colors vanished was probablly only 10 to 15 seconds. But, without a doubt, the most memorable 15 seconds of my life.After this happened, even I was a little spooked. I in no way expected such an awe inspiring response. Needless to say, we all ran back inside and did not return to the culdesac again that night.I am sure someone else had to have seen this, but heard nothing. I was young, yet read the paper and watched the news for several days afterwards and found nothing about the explosion of color.About four years ago I ran into one of the boys that were with me. I mentioned to him the peculiar New year&apos;s Eve incident and he acted kind of like I was crazy. he literally forgotten- or subconciously omitted- the experience from his memory.((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken with this witness, and have found him to be exceptionally credible.  This is one of two reports submitted by the same witness.  The date is approximate.  PD))", "On October 18, 2003 at roughly 9:30 p.m., myself, my fiance and my next door neighbor were having a campfire in my backyard.  Suddenly, my fiance noticed an orange ball in the west sky.  All of us stood up and observed the orange ball come slowly over our heads and slowly fly in the distance. When I first saw it, I thought it was an asteroid and told everyone to get out of the way because it looked like it was heading right to us.  As it got closer, the orange ball got bigger in size.  I gestimate it was about 10 - 20 times the size of my thumb at arms length.  I estimate it was anywhere from 500 - 2,000 feet off the ground and moving about 200 mph.  It was the same color as fire.  All 3 of us heard no sound whatsoever. When we first saw the ball it was coming straight from the west.  Once it was over us it seemed to curve slightly to the south.  After it went over us, my fiance asked if she should get the camcorder.  I said by the time she got it, it would be gone.  Then it came to a stop in the distance and I told her to go and get the camcorder.  I set the camcorder on the tripod and recorded the orange ball for about 6 minutes.  The ball hovered in the distance for close to ten minutes.  When it was stationary, the ball of light turned off and on twice.  The first time for about 30 seconds and the second for about 5 seconds.  It was a very clear night.  After a few minutes of watching it stationary, it slowly drifted away while the ball was flickering or illuminating in and out.", "Suspected meteorite - glowing debris descending very fast and steepPretty sure this was a meteorite but anyway... driving home west on Marine Way near Byrne road at 17:11h, Nov 7 I observed (just for a moment) a streak of glowing debris in the NW sky, low to the horizon. It was coming in at a high rate of speed and at a very steep angle relative to the horizon. It looked as if it could made land fall not too far away.((NUFORC Note:  We presume the date of the alleged sighting was in the year 2003.  We have altered the date above to 2003.

As we were talking I saw what I thought to be a shooting star in the eastern sky baove the Sierra Madre Mountains.  However when the &quot;shooting star&quot; stopped, made a 90 degree turn, &amp; then dissappeared I pointed to the sky to show my friends where I had seen the weird sight.  Just as they looked, another light started zipping around in the same strange fashion.  At one point we had 4 lights moving at once in weird formations.  One of the objects strobbed its white light as it hung motionless in the sky before taking off again.  It generally looked like very bright shhoting stars, except for the way they moved, and interracted with each other.  (It sounds corny, but it looked like they were just having fun up there) Most of the time there were only two to three objects visable at a time, but there was one breif moment when we counted four objects at the same time.  This went on for 30-45 minutes and only stopped when a haze moved in.  We checked the sky every night afterwards, but never saw these objects again. I am just glad that I had 3 other people with me to see it, as I can hardly believe it myself!  It was very amazing!", "Red Object over my backyard.On this date, I was putting wood in my woodstove, which is located in my den. The den has a window which is level with the front yard. The ground was covered with snow, about an inch, maybe a bit more. As I was putting the wood in, I noticed the whole front yard was red. Assuming my chimminey was on fire, I ran upstairs and went to the deck which is located in the back of the house. As I went past my mother, which at that time was living with my wife and I, I told her, &quot;I think my chimminey is on fire!&quot; Once I opened the sliding door which leads to the deck, she was behind me. As I looked outside, the whole back yard was bright red. Looking toward the chimminey I realized it was not on fire. I looked around and saw a bright red round object over my backyard. It looked like a red spotlight, but big. I would say it was about 100 yards above the backyard. The exact size is hard to decribe due to the brightness of the light, as if looking into a spotlight. But it was bigger than, let&apos;s say, a full size van. It hovered there for a few seconds and shot straight up, faster then anything I have ever seen, a loud boom followed and it disappeared going up. It disappeared in less than a second or two. Being ex-U.S. Army, a Sgt (E-5) with the 82nd ABN, two combat tours, I know it was not a military plane or helicopter. The boom, it is my opinion was the sound barrier being broken due to the speed it went up. I have seen many weapons and planes/helicopters in action, I have seen F-15&apos;s and F-16&apos;s fly over my head low, but nothing will compare to how fast this object shot straight up, even faster than missiles being shot from a MRLS vehicle. The speed was undescribable. One curious thing is that it did not emit any sound, as in a motor running, only the boom as it went up. My next door neighbor came out to his deck and yelled at me, &quot;Did you shoot a shotgun?!&quot; I told him no, I didn&apos;t but had heard a noise, not figuring he would understand what I had just seen. My mother saw the object also. I know it ! was not a military plane.I am not sure about the exact date, but I am sure it was around December of &apos;93.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

My children and I were swimming at my mothers house. It was shortly after dinner time, but the sun was still above the trees. They live outside the city on and acre of land and recently had 5 very large trees removed from the backyard in order to put in the swimming pool. We are about 25 miles away from Akron/Canton Airport so we are used to seeing aircraft flying overhead. Those traffic lanes are generally East-West and NorthEast-West.  We also have several small airports nearby where little two-seaters and bi-planes take off and land. What made us stop and stare at this particular craft was that it was flying at about 2-3000 feet and going from North to South. The craft was shaped like a missle almost, but there were no wings, no lights, no landing gear, no sound, no CHEM TRAIL. The sun (which was in the west) appeared to be reflecting off the exterior of the craft, yet as it traveled south, the glare never stopped. If you have ever watched an aircraft pass overhead, there is always a point where the sun is no longer reflected off the aircraft and back in your eyes and you can get a better look. This was not the case. What I originally took to be sun glare (bright white) must have been lighting of some kind. My mother (58) and step-father (60) both saw it and we discussed it for almost an hour after it was gone.

Location: Gulf of Mexico; 20 nautical miles west of the Egmont Key entrance to Tampa Bay. We (two adults) were sailing back to Tampa from a deep Gulf run. From a distance of 2 miles we noted a tanker heading east towards Tampa Bay. The seas were calm and the sky only slightly cloudy. Directly behind or astern of the tanker were the two crafts. They were an estimated 500 yards behind and an estimated 1,000 feet above the tanker. The crafts, flying somewhat in formation, one slightly ahead of the other, decended until they were no more than 200 feet above the water, and as they decended they altered course, moving in our direction. I changed course so as to prevent the sails from blocking our view of them and as I did so the crafts begin to gain altitude and move off in a westernly direction. Their speed was an estimated 150 knots while in the area and continually increasing while leaving the area. I am very familiar with Military and civilian aircraft and could not identify either craft.Neither craft, seen very clearly through binoculars, displayed any semblence of a wing assembly, a tail section or visible engines. Neither craft displayed navigation lights, tail identification numbers, wings or a tail assembly; they were oval in shape with the &apos;forward&apos; section somewhat smaller in height to the &apos;tail&apos;.", "It was an object that changed shapes while seeming to be swooping down.

It has a small white light at each corner of the triangle, and in the middle of the bottom it had a light that glowed blood-red in color. Around the outide of the red light were 3 little white lights that rotated around it, staying the same distance apart as they rotated. I would guess when the craft floated overhead and away from us, it might of been going 30 mph or so, not very fast. What amazed me the most, was that this thing was huge and awesome, and was heading right over the main part of a town of 10,000 people. And unless you were looking up, you wouldnt even know it was passing over ! Three other people saw the craft also as it passed over us. One was a Nurse RN, the other a unit clerk, and my friend and I were janitors, we all worked at the same place.", "Cream (light tan) colored half circle  near Richmond Rd. Aurora Rd Intersection north of Hillcrest Memorial Park Cemetary.I was a passenger in a car driving North on Richmond Road just past Columbus Road when I noticed something slowly gliding across the sky straight ahead. It was approx. 100 ft. above the trees on the west side of Richmond Road past the Aurora Road Intersection (across from Hillcrest Memorial Park Cemetery). The object was going approx. 15 mph and went behind the trees. I did not see it after that. It was a half circle shaped cream (light tan) colored object. It was close enough to see it was not a helicopter (no propellers visible). It was also not a blimp (no motor on underside,no markings).", "large yellow fireball with long green tailMy friend and I were taking his mother home, driving across a field in a 4 wheel drive vehicle when we saw a giant round fiery yellow mass with a large green tail fall from the sky, down toward the earth, behind the trees in the woods west of us. I had never seen something as large as this or with such a long trailing bright green tail. It may have been falling longer than 10 or 15 seconds, we only viewed it as it appeared through the windshield. It was incredibly beautiful!", "10/23/03  9:30pm I saw a glowing blue object with a long blue tail hurtling towards the ground and disapearing after 5 seconds.North East in sky around 9:30pm. Blue, glowing with long tail and moving very fast like it was going to crash. After a few seconds of moving faster toward the ground than anything I have ever seen it disapeared. I am a Mmrried woman with 4 children and I was sitting in my hot tub relaxing after the kids had just gone to bed. My husband was on his way to a friends house and upon returning home he said he saw it too. A number of people called the news but they only reported it as a meteor. IT WAS BLUE... Today my son has informed me that on his way home from school there was a news crew in someones yard and they were looking at some peices of an object that fell from the sky last night and landed in his yard.((NUFORC Note:  Many reports were submitted for this event.  To the best of my knowledge, the event was caused by a meteor.  We have corrected the date above.

I thought as well they were too low, too silent and too large but still dismissed them as suspicious aircraft and not UFOs.. However, one week ago (10/18/03) I observed one through my telescope and it looked exactly like the drawing in the image provided in the aformentioned report. One thing eerie about the observation was how it seemed to &quot;react&quot; almost as if the occupants knew I was looking at it. This one was approximately 3 to 4 mi due south traveling at a constant rate of speed until I watched it. Then it became extremely bright (actually lit up me and everything around me in a diffused light similar to what you would get with a partial moon) like it was pointing a huge spot light of sorts. I could no longer observe it through the telescope due to this light and simply watched it for another 30 seconds or so with my naked eye when it &quot;really&quot; surprised me by reversing direction completely and abruptly, shooting away from my location to the south-south-east at a breathtaking speed especially given it&apos;s estimated distance from me. I do truly believe it&apos;s closest distance to be 2 mi from me before it reversed direction and disappeared behind the horizon. To put in my perspective..  The craft was to my direct south, traveling west-north-west.  Estimating by using some known markers (flashing tower lights) I would think the craft to be almost 3 to 4 miles to my south and moving west and towards me.  With one arm extended, the craft was about the size of an eraser head and approached at probably 1&quot; per 10 seconds.  At it&apos;s closest, the craft was probably 1 to 2 miles from me to my direct south-south-west and approximately 1/2&quot; in size.  When it reversed direction abruptly I do mean abruptly it traveled at probably 3&quot; per second.  When the lights were on it appeared much larger and it truely did seem to be directed at me unless the lights were omni-directional.  The craft took the same route it came, almost like (I know this sounds crazy) but it&apos;s almost like I scared it when I aimed my telescope at it. Anyway, I did want to share this with you to simply make note of it and hopefully give some additional information. As I recall the evening was very cool and visibility was excellent with no haze and very little light pollution. I was simply taking advantage of the atmospheric conditions to look at Mars which is why my telescope was handy. Some additional information.When I saw the object, I changed to a 1.5x Barlow lens lens and a 20mm eyepiece - I believe that makes a 125x zoom on my scope (which I purchased shortly after my completely life-changing experience before as read in my last report a couple of months ago)  When viewed through the scope, it appeared exactly (from memory) as the picture depicted and was approximately 6&quot; wide, 1/2~1/3&quot; high.", "saw a slow, low flying silver disk around 10 AM .I decided to post this after reading through other sighting reports and not reading daylight observations.  I have a 4 year college degree (crammed into 5 1/2 years of school) and I work with a local school.  I was driving to the Hoh Rain Forest with my fiance and cousin (not the same person, LOL). It was about 10 AM with a clear blue sky when I turned off Hwy 101 to go up the Hoh.  I was looking at the tops of the trees when I saw a silver disk about 100 yards away just above tree top level.  It was moving very slow in the opposite direction (east to west).  The sun reflected off the craft.  It was a silver disk with a round dome on top and bottom.  The top dome was bigger than the bottom one.  My guess is that it was maybe 30 feet wide.  I watched it for a few seconds (ten at the most) before I lost sight of it through the trees.  I though about stopping to get out but I thought that I&apos;d be able to get a better vantage point and look down across the area from a clear cut (logged off area).  One never came up.  We stopped at a store about 15 minutes up the road. When we got out of the car, two low flying military jets flew over head in the direction we had just come from.  When I saw it, I couldn&apos;t believe what I was seeing.  At first I told myself it was an airplane but there were no wings.  It just didn&apos;t belong in the picture. My fiance (now wife) and cousin did not see it.  They noticed that I was looking at something as I drove but they told me that they figured I was looking at a bird or something.  I didn&apos;t say anything to them until afterward (&quot;I just saw a flying saucer.&quot;) because I wasn&apos;t sure of what I was looking at.  I know it was a flying saucer but I couldn&apos;t say if it was one of ours or theirs.", "Metalic object seen near SydneyIt was about 1pm.I was taking photos of guttering for house renovations.I took the Photos from all angles of the house.When i was looking through the veiw-finder i noticed a hovering object above the guttering, faceing north west.I took the Photo and after this i herd a low fequency rumble for about 3 or 4 seconds, then this object shot north, towards an oncoming afternoon storm cloud, after this it was not seen again.There was no sounds of engines other than the low rumble.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It looked like a shiny egg lying on its side.Driving home from school, approximately a mile and a half from my home, I looked up at the sky and saw what I thought at first was a plane.  What got my attention was the fact that it was very shiny, like aluminum foil, and the sun glaring on it made it shine that much more.  I then realized that it was not like any plane that I had ever seen before.  It was more of an egg shape with the egg lying on its side.  As I was trying to see it better, it moved up and away from me.  The thing moved out of site within 3 - 4 seconds and was completely gone.  I tried to see it again, but didn&apos;t have any luck.  Any clues about what this might be???  I would love to know.", "Goldish fireball with green tail in Kentucky/TennesseeMy first officer and I were flying just north of Ft. Campbell at 17,000 feet, when we saw a goldish-white fireball with a green tail fall from the sky and &quot;burn out&quot; or disappear in front of our airplane.  I said, &quot;What was that?&quot;  He said, &quot;That was a falling star.&quot;  Me: &quot;That was NOT a falling star.  They&apos;re probably shooting at us.&quot;  We laughed and didn&apos;t think anything more of it until I saw the report on the internet about Raleigh.  Sounds like the same thing.  I&apos;ve seen a lot of falling stars and they&apos;ve all been white fireballs.  I&apos;m not convinced of UFOs, but this was definitely not normal.", "Bright light attracts 8 planesAt approximately 8:30 Wednsday night October 15, 2003 I was setting up my telescope and ccd with my daughter.  She noticed a bright light and asked me what it was.  It was below and to the left of mars(I was looking SE at the time)and shining at the same or slightly brighter magnitude than Mars.  I looked in my software to verify that there was not a star/object that bright in that area.  After I verified in my software(The Sky) that there was nothing of that magnitude other than Mars in that area of sky, I went to set my telescope up to try and photograph the object.  It was at this time that the object disappeared.  We then noticed approaching out of the east some red/blue blinking lights.  As they got closer we could tell that there was 8 planes flying two abreast.  Two continued heading west, two circled around overhead, two went south, and two more went north.  This continued on for about 30 minutes with the planes continuing to fly back and forth, always two side by side.  About 15 minutes after the first planes appeared, helicopters were heard but never seen.  The planes were witnessed by myself, my daughter, and my neighbor(who came out to water his dog); however my daughter and I were the only ones to see the initial light.", "Bright pulsating multi-colored light turning into disk shape with circle of red lights.A bright star like object - pulsating red, green &amp; yellow. Sharing binoculars with husband, the object turned disk like and had a red circle of lights on top. The red lights pulsated in a circle. My husband saw the light move up and down but by the time I got outside, it was somewhat stationary in the western sky. The movement was not like an airplane. No noise. It was the strangest thing I have ever seen. It seemed to be pulsating with energy. We watched it fade into distance.", "By now, I have read a number of accounts from others who witnessed what I did this night. (I am reporting this over one year following the sighting.) However, I have been very careful about reliving the actual event in my mind, just the way it happened, and I&apos;ve taken great care to not allow the reports of others to influence or haze my experience. In fact, what I view as the most fascinating component of my story has not been described in anyone else&apos;s reports about this supposed same craft my friend and I viewed on the night of July 23, 2002. Throughout this written account, I denote the significant differences in my report to the reports from other Angelinos who viewed a similar object on the same date and near the same time I did with ** surrounding those facts. On this night, I was helping my friend move his tools into my house, where he was to stay before flying to New York the next day. As we carried items toward my house from the curb, he asked, &quot;How&apos;s it going around here lately?&quot; Almost jokingly, I responded, &quot;Well...a lot of sky activity tonight, it&apos;s strange.&quot; (I had noticed many planes in the L.A. skies that particular evening, for some reason.)  Just as I made this comment, at 22:05 on this night, I looked up to an object that had caught my sight. It was positioned almost directly above my house, located in the heart of Los Angeles. At first, it seemed to me to possibly be a large blimp - with what I guessed to be ** white and bluish ** or ** white and greenish ** blinking lights along its **oblong shape** - traveling very slowly above my home. As I stood watching it (mouth agape), my friend came out of the house and joked at my expression. He said, &quot;Yeah, right,&quot; in reference to his knowing how I have always wanted to be witness to a UFO...he believed I was still passing a joke, attached to my previous comment. I told him to look at what I was looking at. He turned to see what I was seeing. My friend (who is in no way intrigued by the idea of alien spacecrafts exploring our planet) said, &quot;You&apos;re right. Oh my God, you&apos;re right.&quot;  I was in awe of the size of the object. By this time, I comprehended that the object was moving much too slowly to be even a blimp. I yelled excitedly for him to fetch any camera from inside my house. As I watched the object, I slowly and consciously concentrated on what I was seeing. I held my arm out to the coasting object. The best I could judge was that it would have been two feet in length if it were truly located at the edge of my fingertips. I concentrated on the lights I was seeing emitting from the object. As much as I tried, I simply could not decide for certain if the faint lights I saw around this thing were ** white, or if they were blue...I couldn&apos;t even detect if I was seeing green or red lights for sure **. It was strange to look directly at these lights and very consciously not understand what color they were. I finally decided that they cast themselves as a faint &quot;white and bluish&quot;. As I answered my friend who yelled from inside, &quot;Where is there a camera?&quot; I saw something else that challenged my concentration. Plainly, the object was beginning to alter its shape as I watched it. ** Slowly, the shape ebbed from an oblong form into a definite triangular figure. ** I watched this occur. I occupied my mind and thoughts on staying focused on these happenings that I had no time to be disbelieving of them. Yet, I was more than mildly curious to how this could be actually happening - to be watching something that was seemingly a structure change forms before my very eyes like this. At this time, it seemed the lights were becoming a little more clear in their emission. ** I was becoming more decided on white and green blinking lights now, with a steady red one located toward the anterior position of this thing, although I am not certain that this &quot;steady&quot; red light was &quot;on&quot; the entire rest of the time I watched the object. The blinking white and green lights seemed to also have some red in it as well during its slow trip over my neighborhood. **  My friend came out of the house with one of my cameras. To my dismay, it was a Polariod instant camera. He handed it to me and looked back up to the sky in the direction where I was looking. I realized then that I was still standing in my own front yard, and the object was still somewhere over my house. In about one minute and thirty seconds, the thing had not moved enough to even take the distance of my rooftop in the sky. My friend&apos;s question to me then verified that I had indeed watched this strange thing change shapes: &quot;Is that still the same thing?&quot;  I very kindly asked him to see if he could locate another one of my cameras (reminding him that this could very well have been an event I had longed for most of my life). He obliged and went back inside. I aimed at the shape with the camera and had trouble spotting it in the night sky any time I tried to view it from the viewfinder. Maybe the lights were too faint, and possibly the camera&apos;s little square viewfinder was caked with dust. Instead of losing viewing time for myself, I simply aimed the camera a number of times toward the slow-moving object and clicked, hoping for the best. I was in my neighbor&apos;s yard by the time I heard my friend clicking with another (disposable) camera from my yard. He said to me, frustrated, &quot;Anytime I look through the camera lens, I can&apos;t see it!&quot;  We both slowly walked southward on our street and through people&apos;s yards, trying to get a good shot of the thing. We did this for roughly ten minutes. I watched the thing continue to move southward, over Los Angeles (seemingly at a fairly close proximity to where LAX - the airport of Los Angeles - is). I remember my friend tiring of the event while I stood near the end of my street, then backing up, to still watch it until the last possible moment. I can not recall what I was viewing at that point in time - nor can I recall at all what it looked like from behind. I just remember being saddened that the sight of it was gone as it finally disappeared behind some tall trees, far in the distance. Summary:  Shape: Oblong, changed to traingular  Noise: None whatsoever  Speed: Incredibly slow (I&apos;m terrible at judging this to mph)  Size: If touching my fingertips, the object would have been two feet in diameter, and almost twelve inches in width, I believe  Lights: Blinking, faint at one point, difficult to discern color (best guess is white and bluish or white and greenish); when shape was altered, I recall seeing a red light at the front end of the object (a steady light, at least for a while) and the other colors were a blinking white and green, sprinkled with more red  Odd feelings during sighting: None whatsoever  Odd occurrences during sighting: None whatsoever  Other witnesses: Friend  Evidence: Photographs (see below)  Of course, we got to see the instantaneous developing pictures right away - they rendered nothing. I scanned those and tried using all sorts of filters and utilities from different computer imaging applications to no avail. Somehow, I lost the disposable camera with the photographs of the objects. That camera was not recovered until last week. It now sits in a desk drawer in my office, awaiting film processing. I work at a major motion picture studio in Hollywood, where there is a Camera Department (in my group), so I am hopeful of finally developing the images of this object we saw that night. I will update.", "Orange/bronze flare of light over ocean,  not moving.While vacationing in Lincoln City at the Westshore Ocean Front Motel, my wife and I were sitting near the big picture window of our hotel room on the beach looking out over the ocean. We were both staring at the same patch of sky high over the horizon when a sudden flare of light attracted our attention directly west. It suddenly grew in brilliance/size, a orange/bronze color, faded slightly, then grew again. It did not change location. Although their were military jets in the vicinity early in the day because of 9/11, being ex-military, I know what we saw was not afterburners or military style anti heat-seeking missile flares. By the time we went for our video camera the light was gone. Turning on the police scanner, there was some traffic regarding military activity in the area, but with no details.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

What I saw on that cold evening in the sky left me puzzeled.  This object was at my best guestimation 70 to 80 feet across with lights on the bottom of this disk. The lights were moving from the outer edge toward the center in the shapes of rectangles.  It appeared to have louvers toward the center.  When the light reached the center it would radiate back out toward the edge.  It appeared as if you were looking in a kaleidoscope.  The lights were a brilliant white.  I watched this for 3 minutes as it moved from northeast direction to a southwest direction.  I went to the house to get my husband.

I had anticipated the Moon rising around that time of the evening as it was almost a perfectly dark sky with vivid stars in appearance.  The planet Mars was already up in the east-south-east direction maybe 40+ degrees [10 oclock high] above the horizon.  I made an exit from the freeway and took a main road traveling back east and found an open hill area that I could set up my camera and take some time lapse photo&apos;s of the full Moon rising.  While waiting patently for this to transform [30 minutes]the planet Mars had two neighbors that I thought to be stars in the distance to the left of it, which was nothing unusual, just as bright as your brightest star in the sky but bold.  I kept notice of the two neighbors of Mars because they were easy to behold and I didn&apos;t recognize any star pattern that they belonged to, which I&apos;m not a serious avid star gazer.  As I was shooting the Moon rising photo&apos;s I looked serveral times at the lights [or stars] next to Mars [approx a minute at a time] and the final time I looked the two star lights begin to diminish in perfect sequence, exact correlating unison and vanished.  The receding of their light took about seven seconds to dimenish altogether in unison from their star like brightness to nothing. They never moved, completely stationary all the time, and that&apos;s why I thought they were bold bright stars setting in the sky.  I continued to check the sky to see if maybe a patch of high clouds were obscuring their visibility, and I looked for possible high fog patches passing through the sky as well, but I didn&apos;t see any of these effects. Neither of the other sky objects were affected, all the stars and the planet Mars which were within close radius of the two star lights were never affected and their brightness never diminished at all.  Th! e sky was basically clear during that time of the evening except for a few stray patches of clouds/fog sitting on the horizon when the moon begin to rise.  Although it has been over a week since I viewed this amazing specticle of objects in unison I continue to check the sky each night to make sure that the star lights I saw were not stars hidden by a sweep of the milky way and to my amazement I have yet to see those star lights or objects again, neither can I correlate any of the stars or planets in the sky to the placement of where the objects were. I&apos;m still looking each night but I have found no resemblance of distance or pattern of objects to relate.  The Moon was rising far to the left of the planet Mars which was already up in the sky, and Mars temporary neighbors were about two tenths of the distance from Mars judging from the the total distance between the Moon and Mars.  If anyone has an explanation I would appreciate being informed. I considered maybe a satelite or orbiting objects from earth, but the star lights I witnessed were stationary through out the duration [over 30 minutes].", "there was a haze around objectround light moving and bobing in southwest sky with a red tinge across bottom portion", "Artificial pulsating sound heard, no craft seen.The following report came from two friends of mine, &quot;George&quot; and &quot;Bob&quot; (pseudonyms). &quot;We were outside building a deck in the rain, not making any noise ourselves except for, occasionally, hammering.

It was brown, saucer shaped with a dome in the middle. It appeared to be as long as the roof of the house. Along the side of this craft there were windows, round ones and at one end of it a &quot;fin&quot;? or something slightly projecting upward like a tail or a shark fin.  It just hovered there at roof level and moved ever so slightly.  Underneath this craft there was some turbulence like the bushes appeared to be swaying bath and forth. I told my roomate about this and told her were to look and she took one long stare, turned to me and said....... &quot;If you tell anybody about this I will deny it!&quot; This scene lasted the entire time it took to pass from view. I never did tell anybody for years.  It still haunts me to this day so to tell someone who will listen is a cleansing moment for me.  I am truly not alone.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I called my wife on the cell phone and I asked her if she can see the lights, she said yes, we have never seen anything like this before. I was on the way to Edwards AFB where I work and am fimiliar with aircraft lights. The lights seemed to hover but were not stationary to each other. After watching for about 3 minutes the lights started to vanish one at a time starting with the long end.

In the sky, in my line of sight, I saw a bright spherical shapped object which was moving slowly to the SW. The ufo moved from straight above my position to a point about 35 degrees above the SW horizon, where it stopped. It remained stationary for about 30 seconds, then it began to move slowly towards the NW. As this ufo moved back towards my position, I noticed a second ufo of the same shape, size, and color and traveling on the same trajectory as the first ufo. The first ufo was beginning to dim as it moved to the NW. The ufo on the SW course remained bright. The two ufo&apos;s passed each other moving in opposite directions. As I was looking at the second ufo, I lost track of the first one. The second ufo also stopped in the same manner as the first, and then it also proceeded on a NW track. As the second ufo traveled NW, it too began to fade as though it were gaining altitude. I watched this ufo until it finally faded out. Both of these ufo&apos;s traveled on an identical triangular path in the sky,stopping at the same position, and turning to travel in the opposite transverse direction. The movement was very perfect, as though a designated flight pattern had been precalculated.  The entire sighting lasted for about 8 minutes.  Also, both ufo&apos;s had a soft, yet intense white luminescense.

Often they emit beams and one night I saw little crafts going off of what appeared to be the mother craft.  They are generally in the same area.

So we&apos;re out there just looking at stars and whatnot, and my brother sees what looks about the same size as a star, only reddish orangish, and its moving. It&apos;s going straight, and very fast. Like, there are a lot of low flying planes that go over our house, and they move pretty quickly, but this thing was very high and moving just as fast. We looked through some binoculars, and it just looked like a star.. we couldn&apos;t see the form of anything around the light, like you usually can even with really high flying planes. The light wasn&apos;t blinking at all either. It went straight from over our house, north, over our backyard and out of view. A few minutes later we saw another of the same type of thing, this time from a little right of where we saw the first one come. Then a few minutes after that, another, from left of where the first one came. No more after that, but we&apos;ve been in and out of the house since then.

He does not remember this. Maybe this is more interesting...That same yr 1962 around the last week in Aug. I was walking home from town, I have walked this road a million times so I know exactly how long it takes under many different circumstances. The point is...between 2 foot steps and 2 flashes of light...I lost 2:20 minutes of time. I am willing to give up the 20 minutes as just misplaced, however not the 2 hours. I went absolutly nutz for two days tring to figure out how and where I lost 2 hours, to the point of my head really hurting me. At this point I felt (somehow) that if I stoped thinking about it, the pain would stop, and it did. It was years before I could recall this without pain.  Between the 2 foot steps, I nearly stumbled and cough myself from falling at that point a drop of blood fell on  my right hand, I reached to my forhead and felt a small indentation (I&apos;ve often wondered about an implant). AND one night while watching TV, a very high pitched sound filled the room and the 1/4 inch plate glass over the picture tube...shattered, I was then that I realised/wondered if it came from me as I felt a strange sensation over my right eye.

Though there is a high, evening haze, and their altitudes estimated to be between 6,000 and 7,000 feet, the aircraft are sharp in outline and therefore easily identified as to type.

Something so unlike anything I have seen in the skys, that I do a &quot;double-take&quot;. For there, hanging stock still and silent, high-- very high in the haze, so high that only vague detail can be seen--is a huge, globe-shaped object! Perhaps pale yellowish-green, or a light copper color--dificult to tell through that haze. And, while in general it is a ball, the surface appears to be composed of a number of adjoining planes: either triangular in shape or rectangular, or perhaps some other geometric figure, or maybe all three. Again due to the altitude and haziness, I am not sure. In addition, some of the planes appear to protrude beyond their neighbors. Staring at the object for perhaps 20 to 25 seconds, I wish that I had my binoculars (I&apos;d gladly have given a $50 bill to&apos;ve had &apos;em with me). Then--&quot;Why not?

I return to the location, at the same time, for two successive evenings, thinking that perhaps I had actually seen a giant satellite of some kind. But, nothing is there. No, I did not see a satellite; what I did see (though ever so briefly) was a gigantic USO-- Unidentified Stationary Object--bigger than a football field. Heck, bigger even than the stadium, itself!

I&apos;m writing to report a UFO sighting. It&apos;s not that exciting, but here it is. On Wednesday night, October 1, 2003, I was taking a bath. I have a large window over the bathtub facing the Northwest and I like to look at the stars. At approximately 10:40 pm., a glowing white ball dropped from the sky. It did not descend at an angle as meteorites tend to do, nor did it have a green cast. It was absolutely white and it came straight down at very high speed with a white tail of light behind it. It appeared to be fairly close by in that I could see that the object was round. Looking at a map the next day, I determined the exact area my window faces.  It seems likely to me that it came down in the Southern half of the Little Slocan Valley, near Valican, unless the object was huge and therefore, further away.

They were very high up and moving North to South. The formation was shifting and changing in strange patterns, however, and after a few seconds it became clear that they were not birds- the shape appeared to be too high and was moving too quickly. They looked almost like long strands of toilet paper, really high up, that would separate and then re-connect. We saw several of these formations fly across the sky, all North to South (the opposite direction of the wind). Some appeared to be illuminated, although it&apos;s hard to tell if they were producing light or reflecting the light from the city below. There were no flashing lights.", "It was silent and metalic and reflective.Me and my brother were walking down a hill on a small peninsula of a lake outside Mexico City when e both noticed a metalic elongated egg or cigar that was hovering along side of us.  It appeared to do off in the distance 100yds or so depending on its size. It looked like it was matching our speed until we stopped and it continued slowly moving along. It dissappeared behind a tree and when we tried to see where it went it had gone without a trace. I am convinced I saw a UFO. I however, believe that UFO means Unidentified Flying Aircraft and not little green men in a spaceship.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We pulled off the highway along with about 40 other vehicles and we got out to have a better look.  The craft was like any other I had ever seen and I have seen plenty. I have worked in aviation for about 15 years including a tour in the U. S. Airforce. This massive craft just stopped and hovered over us for about 6 minutes. It was black or dark grey and had very few lights but there was enough residual light from the highway streeet lights to allow us to see the size and shape of the craft and some of its massive demensions. I would have some difficulty giving an exact lateral measurement except to say that it could have easily have contained a nuclear aircraft carrier. It was nearly as tall as it was long if you were to include the vertical projections. It was hexagonal in shape and had 3 vertical projections above the upper surface ending in a t tail formation located equidistant at the 120 240 and 360 degree locations if you were to look at the craft as a disk. there was one white light in the center of the bottom surface of the craft and a red and blue light on each side of the horizontal element of the vertical projections. The craft was completely silent. After about 8 minutes the craft moved suddenly and rapidly twards the northwest in the same direction that the other 2 craft had gone and was shortly followed by 5 F-16 fighters from I believe Otis ANG Base which is in close proximity to the south west near the towns of Sandwich and Falmouth. That base is no longer active. When I arived home I was shocked to find that the television news had reported that there had been sightings reported to be UFOs all up and down the east coast from Virginia to Newfoundland in Canada.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We observe that it would be the rare exception that the news would report UFO sightings, particularly so soon after the alleged sighting.  It usually takes days for the news media to awaken to a suspected UFO-related incident, and they usually ascribe the event to meteors, swamp gas, crash dummies, aurora displays, etc..

It lasted for quite a few seconds (10 maybe), and from the outside in quickly faded out of visibility.  The object seemed to be hovering and not moving and was very large, though seemingly distant (If I had held my index and thumb around the edges of the object, it would have been about two inches).  I have never in my life seen anything like this.  I do not believe it was a meteor, as it did not appear to be traveling.  My only speculation is that perhaps it was an airplane on fire, but then again, I did not see smoke, nor did I hear any report of a fallen aircraft.", "I am not sure of the exact date or time of this event but it took place in the early morning hours somtime in the late 40&apos;s to early 50&apos;s ,as told by my Grandmother.On this particular morning my Grandmother was busy preparing for the work day ahead. They lived on a farm in a rural area in the lowcountry of South Carolina. It was right at dawn just before daylight. My Grandmother noticed that the mule and the other animals in the stable outside seemed unusually agitated. As she stepped outside to investigate she observed a huge ball of light coming at tree top level toward the farm. As she stood watching the light descended but did not change speed. At this point it was headed straight toward the house. Frightened that the object was about to crash into the house, she ran inside to get my mother and aunt out. She proceeded outside and just before the light got to the house it went back up to tree top level and left as quickly as it had appeared. My mother at the time was only five to six years old, but was an eye witness to this and says it is the truth. Later that day several other people in the area say they saw the same light.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We have assigned an arbitrary date so that the report sorts to a date in 1949.

My mother brought my brother (15 yrs old) and I (12) at the time and now 37, out side to see this object hovering over the house. The UFO was shaped something like a foot ball the length of about 2 school busses but with many white and red lights on the underside. As all of us gathered outside I mentioned to my mother we should get a picture of this. At that moment I do believe we were taken aboard the craft. I don&apos;t remember being on board but we lost about 45 min. The last thing I remember was being inside our home with both my parents as they were looking a blank T.V. screen and my brother was later found at the front of the house outside. My brother didn&apos;t remember anything about this but has been visited many times to this day only saying that he was with a small girl in all cases and she has never revealed herself. My mother only remembers the craft as they were driving home. My father doesn&apos;t remember anything to this day. At the time that this happened none of us remember this ever happening until about 8 yrs later. We still talk about this when we see one another. There are not any markings on my parents or brother but I do have a scare on my left ankle about 4 in long that I or my family do not know how it got there and is still visible today that may have been made by a surgical device and now has something visible under the skin.

It had 3 whitish yellowish lighhts and a center red light that was fairly big. I couldn&apos;t believe my eyes. I then saw it fly upward at very high speeds and it was gone bfrore I knew it. It looked approximately 20 feet from edge to edge. I noticed when it flew away it didn&apos;t fly away like i thought it would, smoothly.

This occurred at night time. The UFO was traveling in a straight line and then suddenly made a strange turn in the shape of a &quot;S&quot; and then flew away at tremendous speed till it disappeared.", "Small dark speck paces airliner, seen from ground.One day in about the year 1989, I was helping a friend move a piano across town in his moving truck.  We were stopped at a red light, when I noticed an airliner flying far overhead.  I mentioned it to my friend, so he glanced up and said he could see a little dot next to it.  So I looked back, and sure enough, there it was:  a small dark speck perfectly pacing the jet.  It appeared to be behind and maybe a little below the plane, and was so small as to be virtually unnoticeable.  I had to look twice myself before I saw it.  I doubt anyone in the plane saw the object, based on its observed location relative to the plane.  I had read stories of UFOs pacing trains, planes, and ships, but from this time onward I had first-hand knowledge of this part of the pattern.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It appeared to be approximately one inch in diameter at arms length. A very clear night at dusk with the sun down in the west and night approaching in the east. The craft had lights circling the perimeter with no apparent consistency.  One followed by three followed by two followed by one and so on. The craft stayed in one place for maybe three minutes and then began moving at a constant speed. It traveled at a speed that allowed it to remain just as clear as it appeared when not moving.  It traveled some distance but I can not make a sound judgement as to that amount. It returned to the near vicinity of the first sighting and then turned ninety degrees and went over the houses and out of sight.   Entire viewing was somewhere around five minutes.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

North Bend is a small town, with the main street running only about four or five blocks. It was near the end of the day, not sunset yet, sometime in the late afternoon, when we noticed some dark object in the sky just beyond the town. From the start, we couldn&apos;t make out what it was. I have never seen anything like it. At first, I thought it might be some type of balloon, but I quickly ruled that out. Its shape was going from circular to flat, and it was zigzagging slowly up and north, rather than floating straight up. I could see it quite clearly, although it was pretty far away. After ruling out the balloon, I thought that it was a saucer shape, rotating with one end down at an angle, so that it would get flat and round looking intermittently, just like a garbage can lid does, or any disk shape, when you drop it and it rolls around its perimeter on the ground. We watched the object four about five minutes as it moved higher and north (or more northeast, sort of towards the mountain). I could see it quite clearly for a long time until it got to small and disappeared in the high clouds. I was wishing that I had binoculars when it was lower so that I tell for sure whether or not it was a saucer shape. But I am fairly sure that it was. That&apos;s about it.", "Objects that zip in and outI thought I saw a falling star.  I hurried to make a wish on it when I noticed that it did not fall, it zipped out of sight.  Then it zipped back in and out again.  I then saw several more appear zipping in and out at very high rates of speed.  I heard no sound.  I thought perhaps it was a search light or laser but there was no light trail.  I was amazed at these objects above or near downtown Houston.", "Unknown triangular (Kite-like) seen in sky over homeOn October 30, I went outside at 10:00 o&apos; clock to walk my dogs. I looked up in the sky because we had heard some people were seeing the Aurora lights. I was disappointed that I didn&apos;t see anything. Then coming out of the NW, I saw a strange looking object. It was a triangular like object (when I drew out what I had seen it was like an upside down kite in shape). There were 4 lights that were visible to me-one in the front, 1 in the back, and 1 on each side. They were yellow lights, and they were not blinking as in most commercial aircraft.It had come from the NW, and it appeared to be heading SE as it went over my home. As it went over my home, it appeared to quickly turn a little more the East instead of going just straight to the SE. The craft appeared to move like it was gliding, but it was so quick. There was no sound coming from it. It was a very clear night out. The stars were shining. There was a light breeze. The object was hard to estimate how high that it was. It appeared to be 500-1000 feet or so. If I held my fist up in the air, it appeared to cover it. That is the best way I can describe how high up.", "Distant craft in the same part of the sky for 3 nights, seen by a groupThis event occurred over several nights.  I was a university student, living in a dormitory. On the first night, I saw a distant craft.  The reason I knew it was a craft and not a star was that it did not move at all - and then at a certain point - it took off and disappeared quickly. The same thing occurred on the second night.  This time I had one or two friends with me. On the third night, I gathered a group of the other members in my dorm (perhaps 8-15 others), and we all watched it do the same exact thing. On the fourth night, I called the observatory on campus - and the craft did not appear.  I felt that the beings in the craft knew I had called the observatory, and that&apos;s why it didn&apos;t appear.

As it circled overhead I noticed what appeared to be a star 50 to 60 degrees above the horizon behind the airplane.  I first thought it might be a balloon as the local automobile dealerships use allot of them.  I noticed that it was not moving with the wind, which were 15 to 20 mph.  I then observed the object through 12X50 Bushnell binoculars.  Through binoculars the object resembled highly polished aluminum.  I then thought it was perhaps a milar balloon and continued to observe it.  It then rotated slowly in a clockwise direction to reveal that it was oblong.  It was shaped like a cylindar bisected lengthwise, slightly flared at the bottom edges.  I thought it might be a helicopter at high altitude but there were no rotors visible.

I was stopped at that intersection and was looking NNW over the North Point Mall toward the horizon.  On the horizon are two towers, a cell tower to the left and a radio tower just north of it.  I noticed what I thought was a globe on one of the guide wires, similar to the globes that are sometimes placed on high tension wires to prevent them from touching each other during high wind conditions.  I paused because this seemed unusual, but at that point, the traffic light changed and I had to continue driving.  Later upon reflection I realized that the size was completely off, and that the sphere was actually about 3 times the width of the radio tower.  It was approximately 1/2 of the way up the tower and about the same distance from the tower to the east.  The color of the sphere was tarnished bronze, bronze tarnished almost to the point of being brown.  It was motionless while it was under my observation.  I went back later to verify that my perception was correct and the sphere was no longer there.  I am certain that the sphere was not a tethered baloon of some type.", "circular square object with flagging movement w/no soundThis objects shape was a circular square shape which waved in like a flag would, but not flacid.

It lasted approximately 2 minuets and speed quessing 70 to 80 miles per hour. I didnt notice lights because of the sun position near the horizion but it was something I&apos;ve never seen before and the shape also was high more than wide.

As soon as we made a righthand turn onto the frontage road along 183 N., I noticed what appeared to be a teardrop or possibly a triangular silver object that was reflecting sunlight approximately 3000 to 5000 feet (it could have been as low as 1000 feet) above the surface looking to the south/southwest.  My buddy noticed it as well to confirm that I was not seeing a reflection in his side door window.  The sky was perfectly clear, so we were not mistaking a cloud formation, nor were we mistaking this for man made utility infrastruture because it was well above these in the sky. We were about 1000 yards from the intersection and my buddy decided to make a u-turn to get on the other side of the expressway to get a better look.  As we were heading towards the u-turn, the object appeared to be heading at a slower speed than usual for any type of aircraft that I know is possible barring a  helicopter.  It was moving steady from south/southeast to north/northwest.  At times, it appeared to be actually hovering.  It also appeared to be vectoring in about a 30 degree slow and steady ascent.  There appeared to be no wing or tail structure of any kind that I could detect.  The skin was smooth with no identifying features (windows, ports, markings, etc).  No propulsion of either propeller or jet type was visible.  There was no sign of a contrail or any kind of exhaust or distortion in the sky from the leading or trailing edges of the object.  Since we were in the car at the time of indentification, we could not determine if any sound was coming from the craft.  I am former military in communications/intelligence with top secret, so I DO know my aircraft recognition. By the time my buddy made his u-turn and we got to the other side of the expressway on the opposite frontage road, the object was nowhere to be seen in either direction of it&apos;s vector for next 3 to 5 minutes after making the u-turn.  It appeared to had just vanished without a trace.  There were other aircraft (commercial and private) in the nearby vicinity, but these were clearly recognizable as man made aircraft; and did not appear to be evading the object. This is very interesting, because this sighting is very similar to the sighting in Houston on 10/07/2003.  If I had to guess if this craft was noiseless, then I would say that it was.  A very interesting day for us indeed.", "Strange very bright lights moving faster that aircraft from west to east.My friend and I were driving north on a state highway on a clear moonlit night. I noticed a light or brightness over my left sholder and glanced that way and saw some really bright lights in the sky. I scared by buddy as I locked up my brakes and pulled over to the side of the road and I remember yelling &quot;what the hell is that&quot;? We both got out of the car and looked up. The lights were in a v shaped formation and there were 4 total and the one on the north side was a little offset from the rest but traveling at the same speed. The lights were moving west to east and as we watched them they flew right thru a partial moon but I could not see any outline nor were they pulling any contail behind them best I could tell. I did not see any navigaton lights as on a plane or any strobe lights. The lights continued on an easterly heading and did not change appearance in any way, it was hard to tell what altitude they were, but I did not hear any noise nor see any contails or nav lights. The lights were traveling at a fairly fast speed but hard to estimate, I guess the best way to describe would be when you see an airliner pulling a contrail these lights were moving about 3 or 4 times faster than that. My friend and I watched them until they went out of sight on the east horizon and at that point went on home. We did not think a whole lot about it until we saw in the paper a day later other people had seen strange lights in the sky. A little background on me at that time. I grew up close to a large airport and was always interested in aircraft and was very familiar with most aircraft by a very young age. I could tell with a quick glance a Boeing 707 from a 727 from a DC-9..etc and even at night I could usually tell by light configuration what kind of aircraft I was looking at. I was a student pilot at the time and have go on to become a pilot and have been in the aviation industry in airline operations for 22+ years.

Yes, they&rsquo;re from another world not like as ours. We smiled and standing each other to keep observe for about 30 minutes to 45 minutes. Those UFOs were swinging &amp; dancing around into the light beam. One was zoom off from the beam of light at the incredible speed than the bird&apos;s speed and then came back into the light beam was incredible speed as they appear &amp; disappear of their curiously surrounding the sky. Other UFO ships acted like played up and down and swayed. I told my new wife that wasn&rsquo;t an airplane, helicopter, satellite, balloon or other things what we have them on this earth. I knew those E.T. are from another home world. I am still believed everything the life from outer space. Why did our U.S. Government cover-up?? Damn it. I am interesting to fill out this report form of UFO sighting is for authorized friends to be the first whom that I trust. But that is no way to be trust with the officers of U.S. Government&rsquo;s military. I am allowed to cover-up against them as fair what have they done. She said that is right. I was going to make report to have the information paper from Roswell UFO museum and making some copies for our authorized friend. We were standing to watch those UFO almost longer as a lifetime. I saw one lady walked down pass by us before she enter the Luxor hotel as she turn to look up those UFOs there but her eyes blinks flashed and nearly rush to the door of the Luxor hotel. I giggled myself quietly. Next morning, we woke up from our bed to dress up. Set the tv on and checked the tv news, finally the news got report about the UFO at the same night time exactly many people saw. More people called to make reports on the news. How lucky we are and a lifetime memories. Believe me there&apos;s no birds playing around on this night of June 6th, 2002. We knew what birds acted like. Absolutely, we saw the UFOs at this very night. NOTE:  Event Date:  06/06/2002.((NUFORC Note:  Second report of apparently the same event.  We have looked at the graphics, provided by the witness, and our suspicion is that the two witnesses probably were looking at insectivore birds, perhaps nighthawks, pursuing insects, drawn to the bright lights.  Just a guess.

It was red and green - I think the ball was red and the cone behind it green, but it might have been the reverse - I was too astounded and it was too brief and unexpected for me to be sure.  The length of the cone (tail) was probably twice the diameter of the ball.  The whole thing - ball and cone - was about 2/3 the size of the moon.  The ball was about 20% the size of the moon.  There was no sound. It curved slightly downward toward the SE and suddenly disappeared.  Did not fade out - just disappeared as if someone turned off a switch.  It looked like a Christmas tree light going across the sky.  I assume it was a meteor.  I&apos;ve never seen anything like it before.", "Three Lights Form Triangle in Sky Near Russellville, AR on Evening of 10/29/03Traveling east on state highway 326 along the edge of Lake Dardanelle on the north side of Russellville, AR, my wife and I noticed three bright lights in the sky approximately 5-10 degrees above the horizon east of our location.  The three lights formed an equilateral triangular with two of the lights forming the base and the third light forming the peak.  They were white with a brightness approximately like headlights of an oncoming vehicle.  Based on nearby landmarks (e.g., edge of the lake, Interstate 40, etc.), it appeared that the lights were at least a mile away from our location, but it is impossible to estimate how far away they actually were.  To get an idea of how far apart the lights were from one another, if I had held a ruler with my arm extended toward the lights, I estimate that the distance between each light would have appeared to have been 2-3&quot; apart. The lights did not blink or move while we observed them.  We saw the lights for approximately 15 seconds before they instantly disappeared.  We could still see a few faint stars in that area of the sky but saw nothing at all that could possibly account for the three lights.  Based on these characteristics, we do not believe that the lights were produced from airplanes or helicopters.", "The object was cylinder shaped and had a light coming out of the bottomWell, this wasn&apos;t exactly an encounter, but...I was outside, and it was very cold. I had just bought a camera, and the night sky seemed extremely pretty so i thought I&apos;d take a picture of it. A couple of weeks passed and when i developed the film, I didn&apos;t notice anything at first. But when I looked at it some other time, in the bottom left hand corner of the photograph, a cylinder shaped object There is a light underneath the &quot;object&quot; and the light helps make out the image or body line of the object. I know for a fact that this wasn&apos;t a plane because I remember there being no planes in the area, and there were no light or anything else on outside my house or in the area.", "Short-lived white &quot;shooting star&quot;While driving west on a dark road I saw a white light move in a straight line in the sky for about 3 seconds.  The light was approximately 35 degrees to my left and maybe 25 degrees above the horizon (a mesa was to my left which blocked the actual horizon but the light was above the mesa).  The light traveled only a few degrees before suddenly &apos;going out.&apos;  The color appeared to me to be a neutral white and did not vary in brightness.  I did not see any trail behind the light. From my position the light had the appearance of traveling in a SW direction, assuming it was moving parallel to the ground. It was my opinion at the time, and still is, that I saw a partially memorable shooting star (meteor).  I was impressed enough by the sight to jot down what I saw in a notebook (later that night).  This evening, while perusing the recent additions to the NUFORC sighting reports, I noticed a number of meteor-like sighting reports for the night of 20 October 2003 and was reminded of my own experience of 21 October 2003. Please note that my stated time is approximate and probably accurate to +/- 5 minutes.", "30 years ago large ufo with stinger like object emitting sparks then sped away.Approx. july 1969 (before moon landing) My friend and I saw a craft slowly come into view making slow zig zag patterns in the south eastern sky above fresno. it came down to approx. 500--1000 feet. the shape was hard to make out but it looked part retangle and part saucer with a dome shape on top. As it seemed to stop moving we noticed the dark outline of what we called a stinger protruding from the bottom center of the craft. The craft looked to be about 125ft long and 35ft high, the stinger looked about 20ft long. after it stoped a lite shower of dull sparks (embers) emitted from the bottom of stinger in a cone shape. the glowing died out as the embers fell. (it looked like the embers from professionl fire works as they fall to the ground and slowly die out). the craft had lights and what looked like windows on different levels and most of the length of it. After the ember showers the craft started its zig zag pattern but going away from us. We would look at each other than look back up and everytime we did this the craft would start moving faster and further untill the last time we looked at each other and looked up-- it had diapeared.(we did not know at the time that this was a typical reported movement). We also swore to each other that we would not tell anybody because they would think we are crazy. today when I do tell the story to a select few all I get is rolled up eyes and looks that I am crazy.    My friend and I were about 17 years old at the time and we were not on alcohol or drugs. I have been a full time professional Firefighter for 30 years. I know airplanes, helicopters and weather balloons, obviously this was none of those. I forgot to say there was never any noise made by this craft and it was about 10 pm. We were not into ufo&apos;s back then and did not have any preconception of ufo&apos;s. one night about 5years ago I was listening to the art bell show and I thought I heard a caller say something about a ufo they saw with sparks emitting from the bottom but it was the end of ! the conversation and I was half asleep. Ive wanted to tell this story for along time. I hope to hear from somebody that has seen the same thing.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I KNEW I WASN&apos;T A BUG OR PLANE BECAUSE I WOULD HAVE SEEN IT GO SLOWLY. SO THAT IS HOW I KNEW IT WAS A UFO, BECAUSE IT FLEW AWAY FASTER THAN ANY PLANE OR BUG. THAT IS MY UFO SITING.", "A black triangle near the Naval Academy moved silently and would hover.I was driving east on Ridgely Ave in Annapolis not 100 yards from the Naval Academy.   Overhead to my left I saw a jet coming in the opposite direction from the area of the Academy.  I supposed it to be a commercial jetliner as there are many which fly in that path on their way to BWI (Baltimore Washington International Airport).   There were two white lights on either wingtip and one blue blinking one in the center as well as lights on the front.   It seemed to be flying rather low and unusually slowly, so I kept my eye on it.   When it slowed almost to a standstill, I knew something was not normal.  I broke my gaze just long enough to pull to the curb.   With the car in park I glanced over my shoulder and saw the craft just hovering in place.  Jets don&apos;t stand in one place or they&apos;d drop from the sky, (Harriers excepted), and it was too large for a helicopter.   Besides I had the window open and it was completely silent.   I was able to look more carefully now and saw that the front end was well lit; in fact the nose seemed to be composed entirely of glass panels reminiscent of some WWII bombers.   It was floating about a hundred feet up and was not large, maybe forty to sixty feet across.   I could not make out the exact shape, was it triangular, or fusalage and wings?   I did see that it was painted black.  I was straining to see if I could observe anything through the glass panels when it began to move again.   It floated slowly at first, perhaps ten miles per hour, then picked up a little more speed.   My window was open as I said, and it made no sound.   I started my engine and turned the car around in an effort to pursue the craft.  It was traveling exactly west in a straight line at level altitude.   The speed limit on the road there is 30mph, so it easily pulled away from me and disappeared beyond a stand of trees though it was not moving very fast.   It was out of view for a few seconds by the time my road went over U.S. Interstate 50.   I paused on the bridge and took a look down along Route 50.   There was no sign of it anywhere.   Had it turned north before reaching the highway?   That would mean it was over the Severn River.  I turned around again and went along my original route.   A minute or so later I was on the middle of the Naval Academy bridge which spans the Severn.   Again I looked, but the craft was no where to be seen.   I don&apos;t know what I saw, but my intuition tells me it was not extra-terrestrial, but one of &quot;ours&quot;, albeit using an unconventional form of propulsion.", "Four starlike objects, arranged in a quadrilateral formation seen over MiamiFour star-like objects were observed in a trapeziodal formation. All were moving in a South-Easterly direction. One of the four was also moving towards the other three. I proceeded to call someone else, and during this time I had lost visual contact with the objects. Shortly after I was able to reclaim visual contact. By this time the four objects had arranged themselves in a very close,linear format with one of the four slightly offcenter. The four objects continued in their southeastern direction.", "The disked hovered for over an hour then  moved slowly and rapidly accelerated.I was 11 or so years of age when I observed this event.My mother worked for TWA, and we lived just a few miles from SFO. I visited the airport alot,flew alot and had real interest in aviation for a kid of that age. I was attending a school student crossing guard year end picnic at Washington Park when I observed a dime sized silver object hovering in the sky approx NW of my position. It hovered for over an hour at what appeared to be the same position, making no sound I could hear. I pointed this out to a friend who also observed this. I confess that we both had read books about UFO&apos;s. Then whatever it was, began to slowly move across the sky and then accelerated at what appeared to be an extreme high rate of speed leaving a contrail that did not disipate as quickly as the departing airliners at SFO.

I was staying in a guest bedroom of my parents home.  The home lies in the midst of 78 acres with fields surrounding it.  I was sound asleep and then suddenly, I was wide awake.  One set of the bedroom windows faces what I belive is north to north-east and the four dogs that live outside were completely silent.  There were no highway sounds (the highway is about 5 miles away as the crow flies), no night-bird sounds, no insects, nothing.  I looked out the windows and my first thought was that there was going to be a commercial jet airplane smashing into the house.  All I could see in the adjoining field (about 1 &amp; 1/2 football field legnths away from the house) was a large rectangle &quot;window&quot; with a bright blue (neon style light - piercing - strobe level bright) and I thought it was a downed commercial jet and it was going to skid into the house. I could tell there was some massive shadow behind it, such as woudl work with a large jet body laying behind the &quot;pilot&apos;s window&quot;. I could only discern in bulk and what appeared to be delta style wings behind the brilliant blue lighted window. It was so eerie as there was no sound.  The rectangle shape of light was, I supposed the pilots&apos; front window.  But then, there was this super-intense bright little zipping ball of light that traveled so quickly my eyes could not even barely track it without &quot;trails&quot; of light refracting.  I did not know it at the time, but I had cataracts in both eyes, that may have caused the &quot;refraction&quot; of the light in the zipping ball (in comparison to the large light rectangle, in comparison to the enormity of the &quot;blue lighted window&quot; and the bulky craft behind the windown, this ball was about the size of a supersized beach ball or 100-plus pound pumpkin).  Anyhow, I watched it for what seemed like a half an hour at least, but I have no idea.  I blinked, stood up, drank some water from the bedside table, but yet it remained.  Then, I laid ba! ck in bed facing the field and the strange apparation and I just fell asleep or something.  I don&apos;t know. I was going to wake my younger sister (asleep in the adjoining first floor guest room) and have her look but I fell into sort of a trance or whatever.  Later that day, I went out to the field and could find no evidence of a burn or the weeds or crops that were left mashed down. The following weekend I watched my used copy of the movie, &quot;Signs&quot; the wonderful film by M. Night Shalalah (sp) with Mel Gibson.  I had terrifying nightmares and was extremely stressed and frightened.  That movie is frightening but I never made me so panicked before. Strange.

I work at Epcot, and was surprised one night to see small white objects flying erratically over Spaceship Earth (the huge white ball at the park).  It soon became apparent what they were:  The lights which illuminate Spaceship Earth shine up from the ground, and portions of the beams miss the building and continue into the sky.  This light is impossible to see, unless something in the sky enters a beam and is illuminated by it.  For reasons I still don&apos;t understand, sea gulls and bats make a habit of flying around this area after dark, entering and leaving the light beams continuously.  From a distance it appears as if small, brightly lit objects are performing impossible acrobatic maneuvers in the sky.  I&apos;m not surprised to see the few reports in your database that seem to refer to this phenomenon--I&apos;m an amateur astronomer used to observing the sky, and I found it quite startling the first time I saw it.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates the date of the sighting is approximate, even though the report is submitted on the date of the alleged sighting.

Something made us both lean forward and to look through the top of the winshield at the same time.  It was as if a door opened in the night sky, rectangular in shape.  The light coming from the door appeared to be white.  Out of the door dropped an orange beam of light that did not touch the ground.  Distance could not be determined, but it appeared to be overhead at a high altitude.  Don&apos;t remember how it disappeared, but remember we both leaned back in our seats at the same time and we were still driving on I-80.  Don&apos;t know how much time elapsed between first sighting and our leaning back and resuming the trip.  To me, the experience was not frightening, but the driver of the car became very aggitated and said he &quot;never wanted to discuss what had happened again.&quot; I found it odd, because, to me, nothing had happened.((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

He cut loose his lead tug and went to investigate, expecting to find debris.  He found nothing.  He then commented how he several times has seen sizable glowing orbs moving beneath his ships under the water in formation in this area.

A row of trees follow the road in front of her house, obstructing most of the sky in that direction. That&apos;s why I found it so unusual to see lights in the sky coming down the road from that direction. I immediately knew, from years of being on the porch, that you can not see airplanes in the sky from there when the tree&apos;s are full of leaves in the summer.I got up and walked out to the road so the trees would not obstruct my vision. One of my friends followed me. We saw a cigar shaped aircraft, flying from left to right in our direction. It was upright or vertical. We could not see the actual craft, but a red light on the top and bottom- solid, not blinking- gave us an idea of what shape it was. By the time we reached the road to see it, it was some 600 yards away, no more than 500 feet off the ground. It was silent and around 100 feet in height. We only got a full, unobstructed view for about five to ten seconds before it went behind a large hill directly across from our location.The friend that saw it with me was quite excited, and his loud exclamations of &quot;Holy ****!&quot; brought the other three people off of the porch to see what the commotion was all about. We told them what happened. As we were about to get in a car and drive down the road to the other side of the hill and see where the object had gone, a white light, about half the size of the original object, arose from behind the hill about 300 yards from where we were. It quickly shot directly up and disappeared into the night sky. Once again, there was no noise.We remained outside for several hours. With all of us excited about what we had seen, we spent much of that time gazing at the stars. Because of that, we observed two other strange objects that otherwise would have went unnoticed. They were like dim stars, seemingly not within the atmosphere. I originally thought they were satellites, as I had observed them before. The peculiar thing was there were two of them, with the second trailing the lead one closely. We watched them go halfway across the sky above us, at about the speed of a satelitte, when suddenly the lead light made a 90 degree turn to our right. The second followed accordingly. Their speed remained constant, and we watched them disappear over the western horizon. If there would only have been one, and it had not have turned, I would have thought it normal space debris. However, due to its maneuvering, I believe it obviously was not.((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken with this witness, and have found him to be exceptionally credible.

Southwest Ohio was having a very busy week in mid October. Note that the object left heading towards Oxford, Ohio and would have passed Collinsville on the way to Oxford. ====================================================================================  Subject: UFO SIGHTING LOCATION: Hamilton, OH (Butler County) DATE: October 15, 2003 - 8:45 p.m.SUMMARY  Stuart L***** (name used with permission in original site) telephoned the Cincinnati UFO Hotline (513-588-4548) to report sighting an unusual object. Within minutes, he was contacted at the phone number he provided (on file) and explained that around 8:45 p.m., he was at his Hamilton, Ohio residence and walking past a window (facing north) when he spotted an unusual object. The object, L***** said, was in the sky situated directly over the Hamilton High School in Hamilton, Ohio (Butler County) and was described as a multi-colored &quot;upside down diamond&quot; rotating in place very slow. L***** estimated the object was around 45 degrees above the horizon at a possible elevation of 25,000 feet, about the height of normal airplanes, he said, situated from his perspective &apos;directly over the High School.&apos;  The witness said that there were a few lights on the object, but for the most part, it was &quot;luminous.&quot; The witness described a mutli-colored, &quot;self emanating glow&quot; which the object seemed to radiate, making the shape of the object visible against a dark sky. L***** said the diamond-shaped object had changed color from red, green, blue, to white, and the lights were rotating, not flashing. He estimated the object was 1/4 mile long but said that, at arms length, the object was as big as his pinky fingernail. The object was visible for an estimated 10-minutes. L***** said he was about to grab a camcorder and the object &quot;took off&quot; at an incredible speed to his left, or west toward the Oxford area. &quot;This thing just sped away as if going into warp speed,&quot; L***** said. &quot;I couldn&apos;t believe it.&quot;  He described its acceleration as &apos;extreme.&apos;  L***** also said that two military jets had traveled overhead about 20-minutes after the sighting, probably flying from South to north. They were apparently flying high and out of sight, but L***** estimated they were military aircraft due to turbine sound of engines. Sky conditions were clear at the time with temperatures in the 50s. COMMENT  On September 24, 2003, a Franklin, Ohio resident contacted Wright Patterson Air Force Base to report sighting a pattern of green flashing lights around 10:30 p.m. near her home at the Heartland Subdivision. Franklin is around 17-miles northeast of Hamilton. Filed, October 15, 2003 KENNY YOUNG -- UFO Research http://home.fuse.net/ufo", "My background is with the Department of Defense Special Technical Operations.  I do not wish to mention which company or location for obvious reasons but all information can be verified by numerous witnesses that my statements are true and accurate.At approximately 10:30pm in the summer of 1973 myself and two other friends had just parked my car in a large field to have a few beers and talk and just basically enjoy the pleasant summer evening. There was a full moon that night and it seemed to be bigger and brighter than I had ever seen. The moon was so bright that even though we were parked in the middle of a large field where there were no lights anywhere for perhaps a mile or more, we could see well enough to read by. While passing out our first beers to my buddies I happened to notice an object in the night sky which I estimated to be at an altitude of between 2500 and 3500 ft.  I thought that I had seen the object move in a triangular pattern at such a speed that I was not sure if I had actually been correct in my initial observation.  Without mentioning what I thought I had seen to the other two people who were present with me, I continued to keep my eyes on the object.  After about fifteen or twenty seconds it did it again. After seeing this happen a second time, I pointed the object out to the others and asked them to keep their eyes on it.  They both laughed and started joking about how it was probably a flying saucer. Because none of us had ever before seen anything of the sort and didn&apos;t actually believe the stories of such reports, I suggested that it might be a new military heliocopter or something of the sort because it did not appear to have a comparable lighting arrangement to anything that I had seen before.  As the three of us kept our collective eyes on the object the craft made similar movements to the first that I had witnessed by myself. After seeing the speed at which this craft moved and the sharp angles at which it changed direction in mid flight, the two others who were with me became very excited and immediately decided that it was indeed a UFO.After the three of us had witnessed seeing the same such movements of the object, I decided to move my car so that my headlights would be pointing directly at it. I did not turn the headlights on until I was sure that they were pointing directly at the object after which, I began to flash them on and off and from high to low beam in a fashion similar to the old light signaling technics used by the navy. After flashing my lights in this fashion for about fifteen seconds or so, I turned them off and waited to see what would happen. At first I did not think that anything would come of it but, after about twenty or so seconds, we all noticed that the object had stopped flashing in the mannor that it had been and that instead it now appeared as a white light which remained on and didnot flash at all. As we continued to watch this object we noticed that it now appeared to be getting bigger and within a few more seconds it became obvious that it was heading in our direction at a fair rate of speed. The object had dropped in altitude and was now comming in just over tree top level. As the object moved closer to us it turned off it&apos;s lights or light and as it came within the last quarter mile or so it passed directly in front of the full moon which showed a very precise silouette of what was indeed a saucer shaped craft. The moonlight was being refracted off of the craft and it was now very clear that the craft was polished silver in color. As we continued to observe this craft during the last one hundred yards or so of it&apos;s approach, one of my friends became so terrified by the sight that he wet his pants and began to panic. This person is a large man and usually afraid of nothing. The friend of mine who became terrified was attempting to hide himself behind the back seat of my car and screaming that we were all going to die and that they were going to take us and disect us. As I stood there and watched this craft, it came directly over our heads at approximately 100 to 120 feet at which time it stopped moving and just hovered in mid air. There was no sound emitted from the craft at all and there was no wind being generated such as would be from a turbine or rotor blades. The craft was so close and the light from the moon was so bright that I could make out certain details of the saucer which struck me as interesting such as, rivots along where the apparent metal panels or sections of the craft were fitted together. I could also see that the lights which were around the entire outer edge of the craft rectangular shaped and were raised somewhat from the rest of the saucers surface area perhaps as much as two inches. The lights or light covers appeared to be somewhat opaque or semi-transparent and appeared to be fairly thick.  The closest thing that I have seen to describe this craft would be the saucer that was shown on the beginning of the old TV serial called THE INVADERS which was aired back around 1969 or 1970.  The saucer continued to hover directly over head for approximately 30 seconds and then shot off towards the west so fast that all I could see was a red trail leading to where it now hovered somewhere near HWY 5 which is also in burnsville, MN.  As we continued to watch the saucer dropped down below the tree line for about another 30 seconds and then lifted up to it&apos;s original altitude of about 100 to 120 feet. It then hovered for about 15 seconds in a stationary position after which it shined what appeared to be a red lazer beam aimed at an approximate 45 degree angle into space for about 2 to 3 seconds before taking off at the same extreme rate of speed previously witnessed. As it exited our atmosphere,it followed the same precise angle and direction as the red lazer that it had projected into space. About five minutes after the exit of this craft from our atmosphere, the other two friends who were with me said they saw what they described as a giant meteor or comet shooting directly in front of the moon. I did not see this other object but did make a note of the time. When I looked at my watch it was now 11:55pm. I cannot explain the missing time. Since this experience I have discovered many new technologies and have had many experiences which have opened my eyes to what actually happened that night. I cannot get into the details at this point and it would take volumes to tell it all. Also, the truth is now out there and it will soon be widely known to the rest of the world no matter what happens to me. I have given the description of this particular event simply because it is past time to bring this subject into the light of truth. Also, there is now to much that is becomming common knowledge for my past to continue to be a threat to the extent that it has for the last thirty years.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "On the night of 11 October 1989 I left Kewanee, Illinois and was driving home after a meeting. I was alone and driving west on IL rt 81. At a few minutes after 9:00pm I was approx 4 mi west of Kewanee on a section of rt 81 running north (near the intersection of Tower rd.) On the right (east) is hills and broken timber/pasture and on the left (west) are flat open tilled farm fields. I would have been traveling north. I suddenly noticed a red (red/orange) flashing light. At the time, I thought an emergency vehicle or deputy sheriff had suddenly come up behind me. This happened without warning and I thought the vehicle had approached me, possibly with no headlights on, or was so close I could not see the headlights. Here, I should elaborate and mention that I had just recently purchased a new (1989) Ford F150 pickup truck and had a fiberglass &quot;topper&quot; installed that day. I was unfamiliar with the somewhat obstructed field of view and the still new vehicle. I had not been drinking or using any drugs. I do recall being somewhat fatigued after a long and busy day. I slowed and moved over to the shoulder of the road. As I came to a stop on the shoulder I was still thinking I was being pulled over for some reason. I then realized the red or red/orange light was reflecting in the space between the back window of the truck and the topper. I shut the engine off at this point thinking I had some kind of electrical problem with some lights on the new and unfamiliar truck topper. I shut the engine off and opened the driver&apos;s door at about the same moment I realized the light was also reflected on the hood of the truck. I stepped out of the open drivers door to stand on the ground and realized that a large glowing sphere was positioned almost directly overhead. I estimated the object to be approx 50-70ft above ground and approx 20-25ft diameter. It was smooth and glassy appearing on its surface, which was most noticeable between the brighter intensity pulses. I want to emphasize that these &quot;pulses&quot; were not flashes as in on-off but were pulsations of brighter-dimmer, never shutting off completely. I also noticed a strong definite static field that increased in unison with the pulses of brighter light. I could not visualize the surface of the object when the light pulses were at peak intensity. During the less intense/dim phase of the light pulses the surface was clearly visible and totally featureless from my point of view. The surface was very smooth and glass-like transparent and within appeared a swirling, smoky or viscous liquid type substance against the inner surface. From what was visible to me, I would insist this object was a perfect globe or sphere and emitted light from its entire outside surface. Over the next 1-2 minutes the quality and duration of the bright/dim light cycle changed to a longer bright and shorter dim but the frequency of the light cycle seemed constant- it did not pulse faster, just longer and brighter pulses with shorter dim intervals until it approached constant bright &quot;ON&quot;. I hope I can make this clearly understood. I could feel the intensity of the static field intensify also. I did not move from my position next to the truck between the open door and cab. I had the feeling that something was going to happen with the changes in the light emissions and static field but did not know what to expect. When the light pulses became  a constant &quot;ON&quot; the object very suddenly shot west with a departure so rapid that there was a vacuum &quot;POP&quot;. I can only describe it as being like a huge cork violently pulled from a bottle. I was aware of no noise prior to this moment. The object stopped very suddenly in the western sky for a few seconds (3-5 miles away?) then seemed to change directions approx 90 degrees to due north for a couple miles, stopping suddenly again for only a moment then disappearing to the western horizon. My next recollection was the realization that I was sitting in my parked truck in my back yard (approx 2 miles north of the site described) with the truck pointing west and watching the western sky where the object disappeared. This was not an area where I would typically park. I walked into the house a few minutes before 11:00pm so I was evidently in the truck for some time. It was a very pleasant evening both temperature and weather and I recall an overall feeling of &quot;stunned amazement&quot;. I do not recall ever feeling fear or apprehension. I realize that some time is unaccounted for but I have attributed that to some kind of emotional shock. I have remained in excellent health. I would like to thank the witness for his report.

I automatically said &quot;It&apos;s one of those planes that leave streaks in the sky&quot; until I realized it wasn&apos;t moving at all, it was just a bright orange oval shape hovering in the sky. We stopped the car to get a better look, but then continued down the road to the house. My neice and I grabbed the binoculars and hopped on our bikes, but once we got back down the road where there were no trees obstructing our view, the object was totally gone without a trace. The wispy clouds hadn&apos;t changed much, so we&apos;re not sure if it was a trick of the light or what.", "A bluish-whitish glowing ragged line of light in the shape of a large &quot;W&quot; lying on its side.On a cloudless, moonless early morning back-roads drive from Morehead City, NC, to the Outer Banks on June 30, 2003 we observed at about 60 degrees up in the northeast sky a bluish-whitish glowing ragged line of light in the shape of a large &quot;W&quot; lying on its side, with the tops of the &quot;W&quot; facing east.  Connecting the tops of the &quot;W&quot; in the shape of a semi-circle which looped below the entire &quot;W&quot; was a fainter light of the same color.  The entire image measured roughly ten times the size of the moon when similarly positioned at other times of the month. We pulled off the road and got out our camera equipment, checking to see if clouds had developed in other areas of the night sky.  Other than the unusual blue trail of light, we saw only clear sky and bright stars from horizon to horizon.   By the time I dialed in the proper settings on my camera equipment, the light&apos;s intensity had diminished by roughly half, and I was able to capture only a few faint images.  By this time, the &quot;W&quot; had begun to dissipate by expanding outwards from the center in a uniform manner. Curiously, the trails of light did not behave as a jet contrail would behave as it is blown apart by high winds, with the entire trail moving down the sky uniformly as it disperses.  This &quot;W&quot; shaped light simply expanded out from the center, with the trails of light growing wider and fainter in intensity, until the entire image was no longer visible. We continued our drive back to Kill Devil Hills, where as we were unloading the car at around 3am we observed the same configuration of lights in the same location of the sky.  This time I was able to capture images immediately.  I also took a picture of the only clouds in the sky we were able to find -- due south along the horizon.  There was a distinct difference in the appearance of the clouds versus the &quot;W&quot; light -- in other words, the &quot;W&quot; light did not have the same characteristics as the clouds on the horizon. Over the following 20 minutes, we observed the &quot;W&quot; light as it dissipated just as the earlier sighting had.", "Big brilliant white fireball, size of full moon with long white tail falling from overhead to the South of Greensboro, NCI was sitting at the computer which is in our back room facing west.  There are large windows and a large glass patio door on the west wall of this room.  I looked up from the computer to my left and out the patio door--- I saw a large brilliant white fireball approximately the size of a full moon (if the moon was directly over head), and upon its appearance, it descended south with a brilliant trail also white and long following, it appeared that it may have fallen to the ground south of here.  It was stunning.  Probably a meteor or space debris, but I wonder if anyone else in the Greensboro area noticed it. Pretty big for a meteor. Did anyone else see this?", "I was actually staying up all night trying not to go to sleep 2 fireball shaped  ufos they were zig zaging all over then lights started to flash as if they were talking in morse code. they flew some more and bam they were just gone instantly you must remember I was half asleep but I saw what i saw.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "Quickly, I tugged the shade hold down. Previous experience had taught me not to get mesmerized!!I awoke at 3:30a.m. I sat up and lit a cigarette and I noticed a peculiar light reflecting on some furniture across from me. I recall thinking, that this was odd, because, there was no beam coming through the window. Just a dull vertical light reflecting on an upright cabinet. I finished my cigarette and lay down, once again. Then I heard a faint, electrical crackling sound. I arose, and went to the window. I dept my hand on the shade pull, because in 1991, while living in an adjacent town in an apartment situated on the perimeter, of the state forest I had experienced two traumatic experiences, which have left an indlible mind imprint. This, is why I approached the window in a cautionary manner. This, is the reason why I grasped the shade pull fully exposing myself, fully at the window to whatever, may be outside. i am glad that I made this descret maneuver, for above the next door house was a large, rectangular shape. It was a very, bright, very white glowing object. It gave the appearance of being created from New England milk glass, which was popular in these parts, during the 19th century. I got the distinct impression that this glowing object was very weighty. I am not good with eyeballing measurement, but I think that it was about the size of two, large, sized kitchen stoves placed side by side. The object was very still...not moving a hair...just sitting there hovering, above my neighbor&apos;s house.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))", "Swift hard-to-see triangular object moving in  a straight line across night sky with 3 luminous tips, one at front, two at rear.Observers were outside from 20:45 until 22:00. No meteors were seen in this duration. Craft was hard to see, as it appeared to be the same color as the night sky, which has a considerable amount of sky glow from the town lights below. There was one light at front, two in rear, but they appeared to be reflections on the tips of the craft from the city lights rather than actual self-luminous lights. They did not blink. Object moved much faster than any commercial or private jet or satellite that usually flies overhead, but slower than meteors. Object appeared out of the east with the 3 lights almost in a straight line, but one light clearly was at the front as it passed by and disappeared in the west. Object was about as big as the space between thumb and finger held one inch apart with hand held at arms length. The object emitted no sound. We did not notice any stars being occulted by the space in between the lights, but it did not travel by any of the brighter stars, either. We disagree on whether it was a large object high or a small object low. From our perspective it passed directly through the constellation Perseus, in the north.", "Orange light dripping flames.Looking from our house in Spring Valley (on hill) towards West Southwest over San Diego City. High up 5,000+ feet.  Orange dotlike light moving slowly southwest, the light began to drop flare type flame fire balls almost dipping several times until the light moved out of vision due to overcast conditions.  This only lasted about 45 seconds until completely out of sight.", "The object hovered over my bedroom window with spinning circular lightsI am ((deleted--thirties)) years old now and presently working at the ((deleted--senior legal position)) in San Francisco. I have never forgotten about what I believe to be a UFO experience that happened a long time ago around the year 1977 when I was about 11 years old. I&apos;m not too sure about the date since I was a young kid. But I figure it had to be between the years 1976-1978 because I was in Elementary School and around 10-12 years old during the time. My family and I lived on the 3rd floor of an apartment-housing complex during the time. It was one night about 9:30p.m. My three sisters and I were all sitting in my mom&apos;s bedroom in a half circle while we intently listened as my mom read to us a storybook. I was the only one directly facing my mom&apos;s bedroom window, which faces an outside courtyard with planted trees and grass near the main street of Valencia and Albion Street. During the reading, I saw what appeared to be a shadow of a large object with spinning rotating lights (red, yellow, blue, green) going around it. (Not to sure about the colors, but it had many different colors) The lights only shown dimly through the window shade and curtains but just strong enough to attract my attention. This object with the rotating lights went pass the window QUICKLY back and forth about 3-4 times totaling about 15 seconds. I wondered what that object with lights could be? After the 4th time when it passed (end of 15 seconds), I remembered calling out to everyone in the room, &quot;Wow, did you guys see that, those colorful light? Apparent no one noticed it except me. And unfortunately, back then when I was a kid (only boy in the family), I was always pulling jokes and teasing my sisters, therefore no one took me serious and went to the window. I must have told them at least 3 times to look at the window, because I seen something strange. But, I guess I told them to LATE, because by the 4th time (end of 15 seconds) when my brain finally registered what was happening to call out &quot;look&quot;, the object had made it&apos;s final pass from behind the window shade and curtains (I thing it was just hovering/hiding along the back left side of the cement building wall or high above the building roof, I don&apos;t know). Anyway, I tried telling my family I seen something, but my mom told me to stop interrupting the reading of the story. No one believed me. At that point I got up and lift the shade and curtains aside and looked out my mom&apos;s windows. I saw nothing through the trees but I was sure there was something there. Then I decided to get a better angle view so I quickly ran to my empty and dark bedroom and look out my bedroom window, which is to the right side of my mom&apos;s bedroom window. On the left side of the building I saw this round circular object. It was about the size of a car or van but it was completely circular in form. Beneath the bottom of the circular object it had many colored bright lights built all around it. The lights were spinning. The object did not have any sound as it moved and hovered. The technology was unlike anything that we had back then or now. It was the quietest thing I ever seen. There was a large glass window on one side of the craft. This is where it gets unbelievable and really weird. But this is honestly true! I saw only the shadowy outline of three skinny figures inside the craft. It appears as if they were passing their hands over lighted panels or some how using their hands on the front of the craft that appeared to be some kind of lighted control panel to maneuver the craft. I could NOT see their faces or inside the craft clearly because it was too dark inside the craft and the spinning lights obstructed my view. I started to call out to my family once AGAIN but changed my mind, because it looked as if this craft was going to depart and it would probably be gone by the time they got to the window in the next room. Anyhow, I doubted that I could somehow convinced them to at lease get to the window in time before it flew away, they seem more interested at listening to the read! ing of my mom&rsquo;s story. I was speechlessly staring at the object almost in deep wonderment for about five seconds. At that point, to my surprise, it did not fly away. In fact it flew closer to my bedroom window hovering there. At that point, although being an extremely curious and inquisitive kid, I remembered getting nervous (and it took a lot to make me nervous, I didn&rsquo;t scare easily as most people- not then and not now). I remembered letting the curtains and shade go and running back toward the room door about eight steps. Then I could see the hovering object lights through the shade and the curtains silently back away from my window at a distance. I could not help but to be so curious, no one will ever believe me I thought. I decided to run back a second time to my window and lift the shade and curtains. The object was still hovering at a distance, but when I came back to the window it flew close to my window a second time. I got frighten and ran away from the window again. The object seems to sense my reaction because it withdrew from the window again at a distance. I was amazed at the QUICK precise speed and exactness it moved between our building (without hitting or smashing the walls) and without making a sound at that close level. Therefore, although feeling a little nervous, I was filled with curiosity, I decided to go back to my empty bedroom window a third time. I looked at the object hovering at a safer distance for about 8 second. At that point, I heard the voices of children in our neighborhood running and playing. Although, it was around 9:30 p.m., I remember children in my poor neighborhood always stayed out playing hide and seek real late at night (especially during the summer months-if I got the month/date correct). Anyway, I think the children in the neighborhood also seen it because I heard one of them yell, &quot;There it is, up there.&quot;  Then the object begins to slowly depart higher and higher without a sound (it was weird how it did not speed off fast to conceal itself). I think it begin! s to fly toward the east of San Francisco near the freeway near Mission and Fourteen Street. I have never seen anything like that again my entire life. I was thinking, I had a pretty good unique view of the object. Since these objects usually fly in the sky, most people only see them when they have both feet on the ground. I was able to see the object eye level at my window around nine feet away. I was thinking, that is probably the reason why I was able to have a unique view of the figures inside the craft. Anyway, ever since that experience, whenever the subject of UFO comes up I always tell my wife and friends what I experienced. Since they know my characteristics, they know I seen something but they all say they find it very difficult to believe it was a UFO. I don&rsquo;t blame them, because if I did NOT see it myself I would find it very difficult to believe any one also. But I will tell you one thing, for some strange reason, I wish I could see it again! I have already searched your database to see if anyone else has experienced seeing a similar strange object in the sky around the time of 1976-1978. There is ONE other record in your database, which occurred on 7/15/78. I wonder if it is the same as my experience except either he or I was a little off with the date. Since the person who recorded the event on 7/15/78 was NOT detailed as to the street and area of San Francisco, can you please tell me if the experience in your database that occurred on 7/15/78 match my experience, meaning did it happen near the SAME area as me - the Mission Area, around Valencia and 15th and Albion Street?((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "Additional information (eyewitness account) of the Bentwaters IncidentI was the on-site ((deleted--senior technical position)) in RAF Woodbridge, UK, for a ((deleted)) year period from June 19XX to October 19XX. This reports relates to the &quot;Bentwaters Incident.&quot; I need to provide some background for you. About 5 years ago, I was watching the History channel, and I saw a man being interviewed....and I recognized him as an Airman I knew back in the late &apos;70&apos;s. He was (is) ((name deleted)). This was the first I had heard of the UFO sighting just east of the base, in the late fall of 1980. I have never told anyone of this story before, and I believe that I can shed some additional light on the situation....from the perspective of a weatherman, and one who has certain knowledge and experience in observation. To start. I do not know how familiar you are with this Bentwater Incident. Kind of pisses me off, it should be called the Woodbridge incident, as it occurred just east of RAF Woodbridge, not Bentwaters. Bear with me here. The base is oriented generally east to west...in fact, the runway orientation is exactly 09-27. This makes it very easy to observe the weather, and the direction from the center of the airport. For a several month period, all during the summer and fall of 1980, I and the ((deleted--technical personnel)) under my command observed lights to the east of the base, in Her Majesties Rendlesham forest. This is a rather large stand of trees BETWEEN RAF Woodbridge and Bentwaters, indeed, the east gate led to a small road which was a quick way to get to and from the base, from one base to the other. My ((deleted--family member)) was also in the ((deleted--military)) at the time, and she was assigned to the Bentwaters base weather station. Normally, we worked the same shift, and I would drop ((deleted--family member)) off at work, go on to my work, and reverse the process and the end of my shift. Woodbridge was south of Bentwaters, we lived north of Bentwaters, in a little town of Leiston...along the north sea. I digress. What I am about to write is something that I have been thinking a lot about. I am not about publicity, and will not leave my name. I will leave an e-mail address that you can contact me with, if you want. On the way from my work, to pick up my ((family member)), I went out the east gate, turned left, and headed on up to Bentwaters. I had gone about 200 yards, and was pretty deep in the woods. It was foggy, the visibility was less than a mile. This was pretty common in fall, there is a climatological maxima for fog along the north sea that time of year. I was driving my little ((deleted--foreign car)), doing about 40. There was no radio in the car, just tooling along. Up and off to my right, in the woods, about 50 feet into the woods I saw a bright, pulsating light. The frequency of pulsing was quick, and was an orangish-reddish color. This freaked me out pretty good, I didn&apos;t know what it was. The hair on the back of my neck went straight out, unexpectedly so...I became VERY frightened, and gunned the car, and left. Thinking back, I did not see a craft...but I remain convinced, to this day, that this was (is) something I can&apos;t explain. I talked to my wife about this, and gradually forgot about it...until this entire incident came back into my attention several years ago. About a year ago, the Halt tapes became more public, and this kinda freaked me out, too! I KNEW Lt. Col. Halt, and spoke with him many, many times in my capacity of providing ((deleted--information)), and the various on-base agencies. I have read several reports of this Incident, many contain innaccuracies, misjudgements, and many are just plain wrong. The people I worked with and I speculated for months as to the source of the lights to the east of the airfield. We considered, and rejected, the idea that it was the lights from the Orfordness lighthouse. We KNEW that one, bearing 140 degrees, at 7 miles. Little light, pause, big light, pause, little light, pause, rinse repeat. This light we saw was IMMEDIATELY off the base proper, within a half mile of where my unit was assigned. As is the practice of many ((deleted--units)), we were assigned on the ((deleted))  floor of the ((deleted--on the base)). Our job was to maintain a continuous ((deleted)) watch...we had no other duties other than to monitor the ((deleted)), and as such, we were outside a LOT...hours per day (and night) just looking around, and monitoring our ((deleted))  instruments. Something that isn&apos;t talked about much....when the Colonel and his staff measured radiation, they knew what they were doing. The base still had an active WSA (weapon storage area) for nuclear weapons on the base. We even had an armored personnel carrier, painted Air Force blue on the base....pretty cool, actually. This is why a Lieutenant Colonel and other security forces were in the woods outside a small tactical fighter base after midnight in December....the Air Force doesn&apos;t fool around with their nukes. Ever. I listened to George Khoury (sp?)  (sic--Noory) tonight, and heard this website, and thought....why not?  If anything, I have understated what I saw, but at this point, I am not prepared to say much more....I have a good job, I am now retired from the Air Force, and I think it is pretty safe here to put down a little of what I saw. Thanks for taking the time to read this. I will list a little used email address, if you have any questions.((NUFORC Note:  The dates of the incident, a suspected landing of a triangular-shaped UFO in Rendlesham Forest, are December 26 and 27.

I told her that I would take it to the mailbox for her.  It was night and already dark.  The sky was cloudy and as I was walking out of my doorway I looked up.  These clouds were very high in the sky and in them, or near them, I saw two lights.  The two lights were round and sort of yellowish, they were not very bright, about as bright as a flashlight.  I saw these two objects following each other.  One seemed to be leading the other.  They were moving in small circles around each other, also making figure eights and very semi-circle movements.  They continued this for about 10 seconds before they both shot off into the night.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "Slow moving &quot;rod?&quot; in a crystal clear skyI own a business at a local mall, and at around 2:00 in the afternoon I went outside to retrieve some inventory from my car.  It was a nice day, and I casually looked up at the cloudless sky as I was at my car, and noticed a weird craft a few hundred feet in the air.  I initially thought it may have been a rod. But from what I have heard, rods are extremely fast, and this thing was just slowly coasting through the sky.  I could cleary see the shape, and it was cylindrical, with what appeared to be two small fins at the very end.  There was absolutely no sound, and definitely a complete absence of what could be wings. It was white in color and I saw no lights. But in the daytime I probably wouldn&apos;t be able to see them anyway. I watched this object as it approached me, flew directly overhead, and gradually veered off making a slight curve until I could no longer see it.  It took about five minutes from the time I initially saw this thing before it faded out of view.  A plane could never move that slow. But don&apos;t get me wrong, there is no doubt in my mind that this thing was not a plane. As I stated before, there were no wings. I do not want to speculate about what it may have been, so I figured I would report it to you, and you can compare it to other reports you may have received.  Also, as I walked back into the mall a few minutes after I could no longer see the object, I noticed a helicopter flying in the same general dircetion as the object I saw.  I could clearly see every aspect of the helicopter, and hear the sound of its engines and rotors. It may have been unrelated, but was interesting nonetheless.", "Electrical failure of my reliable vehicle and some missing time.My ex wife and I  were driving from a gig. I thought that I would visit some relatives in Almena, Wisc. and thought I would get there about 9 pm. In actuality I got into town about 1030pm an decided to keep on driving south.It seems to me that I went under a hiway bridge and within 5 mins/5 miles my truck was losing power, lights dimmed, radio lost station, and within 1 min the truck stalled and coasted to a stop. I tried repeatedly to start the vehicle and it was totaly dead, not enough juice for interior lights. I thought we were there for less than an hour . A guy going the other way turnrd around and asked if he could help. He was a wrecker driver just off work at 3 am. Told him the truck was dead. He looked under the hood for a moment and asked me to crank it. It fired right up. I expressed wonder and continued on. To this day I cant explain the trucks failure, or the time discrepency. I would be irate if I had to sit around for 4 hours, yet I felt lucky because I thought the sameritan found us right away. I know it sounds bogus but I am sure of all of these facts.((NUFORC Note:  Date of event is approximate.

It was moving very slowly, and appeared to stop for brief periods of time.  It was an Oval/disk shape and had an aura of bright white light around it, that occasionally shot of short beams of white light.  It was a totally clear day, blue sky, with absolutely no other aircraft, or clouds in the sky.  It also seemed to appear,disappear, then reappear, becoming dark, and then brilliant light and aura. It took me several minutes to figure out what was going on, then I ran and got my camera.  But the camera didn&apos;t have a card in it! So I had to go back, get a card out of the package, turn camera off and on, and then go back and refocus-this process took me about 7 minutes.  When I took the photo the object was further away, and I had to wait in between it&apos;s disappearing and appearing. I managed to get 4 consecutive photos, and sometimes when it reappeared it seemed closer and then further away. I sit on my deck quite a lot, and I&apos;ve seen a lot of aircraft,blimps, etc.  But this object was very unusual.  I hope the photos are good enough to be magnified and analyzed, allowing identification of this object.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was going from south to north.. over Barrard Inlet  ... It seemed to land in the mountains. It was large and had a long flaming/ sparking tail. It was a bright white or yellow in color. Only lasted a few seconds as it was moving fast...I have seen similar pictures of other things like it lately in the news......... It was really neat to see... I was sure some one else had to have seen it but have found no reports any where. Thank you to the witness for the report.

I had gone into our back yard on the east side of our house and noticed a bright light above the foothills to the east about 7 or 8 miles from me. The light looked like an aircraft landing light, staying stationary in the air, about 1000 feet above the hills. I stared at the light because it wasn&apos;t moving and wondered why it was so still if it were a small airplane. It was too bright to be a star. All of a sudden, the light took off with no accelleration toward the north. The best way I can describe how fast it took off is if you were looking at one frame of a moving film and then started the movie, you would see instant motion. The light flew horizontally and covered about 10 miles less than a second. As it flew further to the north it got farther away and I couldn&apos;t see it anymore.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I could see it plain as day in front of meIt was the last day of hunting season in Mass. i was waiting on my grandmother&apos;s steps for it to lighten up a little so i could hunt. She has 110 acres in Lenox, Ma. I was just looking around when i noticed what seemed to be red flashing lights in the trees. I kept watching and it was moving upwards. This saucer came straight up. It didn&apos;t have flashing lights but stable red lights kinda spaced out around the disk. It&apos;s hard for me to tell you how big it was or how far. It was pretty big though. This is not a case of just &quot;seeing&quot; something in the sky. It was , as plain as day, right spack dab in front of me, a complete flying saucer. I didn&apos;t know what to do. I mean, i was scared but also excited a the same time. i then heard a car coming down the road. I began running towards the road. It&apos;s very hard to explain what I was thinking. I was planning on flagging down the car but decided against. A man in full camo with a gun before 6am jumping out in front of a stranger yelling &quot;flying saucer, flying saucer&quot; I would&apos;ve probably run myself over and not looked back. Anyway, i stopped running towards the road and headed back to the steps. It was still there but looked like it moved a little west. It then moved down like it was going to land or something. I watched as hard as i could. It didn&apos;t land but moved low to the ground back to where i saw it first. It came up in the same spot i saw it the first time. This time while rising above the trees, it seemed to have trouble and looked like it wobbled on its way up. Then there it was again directly in front of me, clearing the trees, it just hovered therefor about 20 seconds i guess, and poof. Like a snap of your fingers it was gone. It literly left a streak of red in the sky. I know some may be reading this thinking that i&apos;m crazy. My friends even said the same thing! But when i insisted that a bunch of us go out there and walk a straight line through the woods they knew i was DEAD serious. And we did. There was probably 15 of us and found nothing at all. I was hoping for burned grass or something. I mean it had to have been landed back there . Hell, i don&apos;t know. Listen it was the LAST day of shotgun season in Mass in 92. Wish i knew the exact day. I will find out.  I believe that someone else HAD to have seen it. They just had to!  My grandmother&apos;s property borders the Lenox sportman&apos;s club. I was hoping that when i searched &quot;sightings by the state&quot; i would see one in there around the same time on the same day. Who knows, maybe someone will contact me with the same sighting. I really hope so. You wanna know something funny? I went to the library immediately after my sighting and got a few books. Of course everybody&apos;s first question was,&quot;what did it look like?&quot; In the book, UFO&apos;s and how to see them, there is the same exact saucer i saw in that book. If anyone is interested in contacting me please do. ((e-address deleted))   Thank you!!((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Driving home from work (South on US220) I saw in the SSE sky what appeared to be a very large and shiny cylinder.  It appeared to be at a fairly high altitude (my best guess between 25,000 and 40,000 feet).  If my height guesstimate is correct then I would guess the length to be between 300 and 600 feet (this is based on what a commercial airliner looks like at cruising altitude).  The length to diameter ratio was probably between 4 and 5.  The sky was totally clear, and the sun was at a late afternoon angle so the object was reflecting greatly.  I&apos;m sure it wasn&apos;t some reflection/glare from my windshield, because the car was shaded by the trees along the road.  During the entire time I was watching, the object did not appear to move at all.  After I took my exit, which is basically a clover leaf, I was unable to find the object again.  My first thought when I saw it was that it was a sattelite reflecting the low angle sunlight, but it was just too large.  Like I said, this image has really stayed with me.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "i dont know what it was but i saw something it wasnt any form of aircraft  that ive ever seni got up to use the bathroom  and looked out the window it was really clear that night i saw a round shaped object with lights moving around it i wasnt lookimg for anything in paticular it just caught my eye than as fast as i looked it flew in an upward and outward direction  this was in the northeast sky im noe sure of the dat i know it was in the beggining of the month and the weather was rather warm((NUFORC Note:  We have requested that the witness clarify the date of the event.  PD))", "Bright star like object overhead that went dim, then disappeared from the sky.Approx. 730pm I ventured outside my home in a suburban neighborhood and looked up. I immediately noticed a very bright blue/white star above about 80 degrees. I thought gee, I didn&apos;t know Jupiter was visible this time of evening. As I stared at it for several seconds and pondered of retrieving my telescope, it suddenly got dimmer. I thought, this is what a pulsar or binary might look like, when suddenly the object began moving towards the north becoming dimmer every second until no longer visible. I have seen many jets, major pathways are overhead, I have seen satellites that move across the sky, but I have never seen an object such as this move like it did. Someone please tell me what I saw, I am very curious?", "2 more fast, noiseless, triangular objects seen above Scappoose, OR within 1 week of first sightingThe description of these 2 events are similar to that which we reported last week. Both craft were fast moving, much faster than a small prop plane low or a jet plane high, but much slower than a meteor. No prop or jet sound was heard. Both craft were hard to track, because again it appeared that the &apos;lights&apos; on the craft were more reflective than self-luminous. No Northern Lights were seen all night, probably due to the skyglow from Scappoose, of which we live on the southern end. The first craft was traveling from NW to SE towards Portland. The second craft was seen about 1 minute later traveling from SW to NE. Both were seen as they travelled away from us. The first craft had a &apos;light&apos; at the front and 4 or 5 on each of the swept sides, but the trailing edge, if it was there, was completely dark. The second craft had only three lights, one at the front, the others at the trailing tips. The sky last week was overcast, the sky this week was completely clear, yet neither time did we actually see a shape to these craft. The shape was determined by the placement of the lights only. They could have been triangular or chevron shaped. We both find it quite odd that with as much time as we spend outdoors at night, we have 3 sightings within a week, yet none for the previous 8 years here. As a side note, my dad, who is an published astronomer and recently gave a talk on Mars at Princeton, told me a few days ago that he saw an identical object in 1956 in Pennsylvania. He saw the same, quiet triangular craft moving noiselessly at extreme speed with a pale light at each tip. He says it was translucent and observed stars through it.", "Round green sphere, dropping beind the mountains, and landing.I was driving on hwy94, and in the middle of the night about 12:00 midnight I saw a &quot;greenish&quot;round fireball, over some mountains.  It just &quot;materialized&quot; and did not show as a meteor or anything.  It was a definate &quot;round&quot; object that went &quot;straight down&quot; behind the mountains, doted with small cabins. Its was a clear night and the moon a full.  It had a flame, above the round green sphere.  It went down straight.  No, fireworks, or show, but a weird glow.  There was a few trucks on the why94, at the time.  It was large, as big as a two story home, at arms leagth it was as large as a nickle.  The flame was, white, and the green object clear. It went down, very fast, not at an angle.  I was alone, and it did not, come into the air, like a shooting star, would, this was very different. I live in North Dakota, and see these things but not, like this one.  Needless to say, it was interesting.((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a meteor may have been the cause of the sighing.  Other reports received.  PD))", "Bright green light streaks twice in Ohio sky between Waverly and Chillicothe on clear night.While traveling south on US 23 between Chillicothe and Waverly, Ohio, and ascending Divide Hill, my son and I witnessed a brilliant green light that appeared in the sky and dropped from northwest to southeast before extinguishing. Immediately after it went out, the same event occurred which made this very unusual.", "Saw a 6&quot; red ball flying from south to north about 3&apos; off the ground on US 20 in Yellowstone National Park on September 29, 2003.I was driving west on US 20 approximately 10 miles east of the west entrance to Yellowstone National Park. My wife was in the front passenger seat. The time was 20:35 (8:35 PM Mountain time) on Friday night September 29, 2003. The sun had already set, so it was quite dark. This is a wilderness area that we were in, no lights what so ever for miles. No other vehicles were in the area. The skies were clear. One could practically reach up and touch the stars. The landscape on each side of the two lane road had new pine tree growth with a height of 4 to 10 feet.We were traveling about 30MPH with the windows rolled down so we could hear the elk bugling in the not so far distance. Suddenly and without warning, approximately 3 feet off the ground and 30 feet in front of us, a red sphere darted across the road from left to right (south to north). The color was that of a lit tail light lens, but not bright as if brakes were applied. This completely circular object, about 6&quot; in diameter, flew straight for the short duration that we saw it. Sighting was lost as it entered the trees. This was not a flash of light bouncing off an object and again, no other vehicles were within sight. Nothing was said to each other until I stopped at a pull-off a couple of miles down the road. We then looked at each other and I asked my wife, &quot;Did you see that back there?&quot; Her reply was, &quot;I wasn&apos;t going to say anything until you did. What was that red ball?&quot; We compared notes. We indeed did see a 6&quot; red ball flying from left to right about 3&apos; off the ground. No sound was noted.", "Lights flying in the formation of the shape of a small aircraft, split into 3-4 seperate and different colored orbs and flew off fast!I&apos;m a truck driver and I was driving up a fairly steep hill out of the &apos;Hondo Valley&apos;.  I was not going very fast, so I had time to see this.  There were no other vehicles in front of, or behind, me.  I was just starting the climb, when, over the crown of the hill, came what appeared to be a very low-/slow-flying small aircraft, like a Cessna.  It got about (line-of-sight distance) 40&apos; past the crown &amp; split into 3 or 4 small orbs. Each was a different color.  Then they went in different directions so fast, I couldn&apos;t keep track of them &amp; safely drive at the same time.  The setting is VERY rural.  One of the darker areas in the picture of the map of the United States taken by a satellite from 450 miles up, showing population centers by the amount of light at night.  When I reached the top of the hill, I looked for an airport or small landing strip, but found none.  Kept looking for one all the way into Roswell.  Never found one.((NUFORC Note:  Date of event is approximate.  PD))", "((NUFORC Note:  We cannot be certain as to what the witnesses observed in Las Vegas, but our suspicion is that they may have observed insectavore birds, preying on the flying insects that are attracted to the bright lights.  However, that is just a guess, based on the fact that we have received many such reports from Las Vegas.  We presume that the year of the sighting is 2002, and we have amended the date above.  PD))Our Honeeymoon at the Luxor  We had our wedding June and our honeymoon trip to Luxor in Las Vegas, after the Disneyland Hotel.  Was really a good time around the Luxor Pyramid.  We would delightful to go outside and walk around the street out of pyramid  was about 10:30 PM would be nice night better than on daytime from the excessive hot day. We holding together our walk to looking around the light from the top of pyramid where there is so powerful search light that beam upward very high in the sky, it a ways up high, very impressive to look the light beam. Then we walks back and so she pat my shoulder to look up the light.Suddenly, we saw three UFOs dances into the light beam, that looks like as housefly dance at any theirs house. They&rsquo;re so luminous brighter and it is oval shape. she ask me what do I think of those, maybe we know what are those. Yes, that they&rsquo;re from another world not like as ours. We&rsquo;re smile and stand stay to keep  observe for about 20 minutes.  Those UFOs were swing &amp; dancing around into the light beam, one was zoom taken off from the beam of light as its incredible speed, and then coming back into the light beam was incredible speed too that they looks like appear &amp; disappear as like as theirs poof in speed. They&apos;re acts like as crazy speeds that they&rsquo;re back &amp; forth.  I told my new wife  that wasn&rsquo;t airplane, helicopter, satellite, balloon or other things what we have them in this earth, but it wasn&rsquo;t our or their at anything on this earth. I know those E.T. were from another home world.  I still believe everything the life in outer space, why did our U.S. Government cover-up, damn it.  I am interesting to fill out the report form of UFO sighting is for authorized friends to be the first who that I trust. But that is no way to be trust in officers of U.S. Government&rsquo;s military. I am allowed to cover-up against them as fair what have they done. She said that is right and I was going to make report to have the information paper from Roswell UFO museum and making some copies for our authorized friend.  We were standing to watch those UFO almost longer and I saw one lady walked down pass by us before going to Luxor hotel, she turn to look up those UFOs there but her eyes blinks flashed and nearly rush at door into Luxor hotel. I got giggle myself in quietly. Next morning, we woke up from our bed and to dress up.  Set tv on and get me to see the tv news, final the news got report about the UFO at the same night time what many peoples saw. More people called to make reports on the news.  How lucky are we and happy as she saw the first time, but I have seen that before. Written by"]
