But this evening i received a call from my father and a number of my neighbours claiming they were looking at a UFO. They explained as being within the atmosphere, but pretty high up as they felt that it was infact about 100 KM&apos;s out towards Bass Strait. I continued to recieve phone calls from neighbours. And trust me, these are people from the most privlidged  suburb in Melbourne, and i believe that before tonight they weren&apos;t believers! They guessed the size to be anywhere between 5 - 15 football stadiums! With the flashing lights and everything. It was too far to get a photo, bit like taking a photo of an eclipse with a normal camera... i called a friend living 2kms east of my house, and he had a look out, and saw it, as did his family. However, he described it as a really big star with a disco going off on it! I called another mate who lives about 20 kms towards the UFO, but he dismissed it as bull shit and reckoned it was a US air force test on a new X35 or something... AVOL, NASSA? stuff like that, are these things that big??!! I found a sight on something to do with what he was on about, but they looked the size of ordinary fighter jets!", "Small Silver Floating Eggs seen in NCSmall silvery egg shaped sphere was seen that almost looked like an insect but moved about like a hovering craft.

I believe it was between 8:50 PM or 15 minutes after 9.   I had not long turned off of FM 457 on to FM 2611 which becomes FM 2004 N.  I am not sure how long I had been driving, when all of a sudden the lights in my car blinked twice and then the car went dead.  I coasted to a stop at the top of a slight hill that was a curve.   I was frightened, for one I am female and was traveling alone and I was out in the middle of no where.  I thought that the reason for my power going out in the car was because my brother had been using my car battery early that day and may not have tightened the battery cables properly and the cables had slipped lose.  I didn&rsquo;t have a flash light on me so I grabbed my cell phone to call home and let someone know what had happened,  then I decided to get out of the car knowing that my cell phone had a  bright light on it and I was going to check the battery cables.  Before I could open my cell phone to turn it on a bright bluish glow started to light up a thick wooded area across the highway from me.  At first I thought it was another vehicle coming up behind me and I panicked for a moment because my car had stopped at the top of this hill in a curve and if the vehicle coming up took the curve to fast it would hit me. But I quickly realized that it wasn&rsquo;t another vehicle I sat still watching the light in the woods get slightly brighter.  The light wasn&rsquo;t bright like a blue white light bulb, it was more like the light from a giant blue flood light or helicopter flood light and I mean giant and the light didn&rsquo;t hurt your eyes it wasn&rsquo;t that sort of light.  I watched it slowly start moving upwards through the trees.  I sat in complete silence and watched it rise up out of the trees until it was above the trees and clearly in the sky with the stars for its back ground.   It was a huge bluish translucent ball of light with the center of the ball much darker then the outer edges.  It made no sound.  The outer edges of the ball seem to vibrate or tremble slightly.  It continuously rose up into the sky at first slowly, but the higher it got the faster it went.  Which was straight up into the sky until it disappeared.   I sat in the silent darkness for a few seconds then turned my car keys which I had never taken out of the ignition switch and the car started right up. This is a true account of what I saw I have no reason to lie.", "Unexplained Lights in the SkyWe were out night fishing, and I kept noticing strange lights in the sky.  Suddenly out of nowhere this large light starts moving from South to North across the western sky.  It was moving too fast to be a plane, and too slow to be a meteor.  There were no blinking lights on this, and no sound what so ever.  When it had disappeard out of sight, I looked up again, and saw one even higher in the sky heading East and then abruptly change course and head south.  Once again no noise or sound.

She described the circular part as gray or black in color, but she wasn&apos;t sure because of the white light &quot;spinning&quot; around it (in the ring).  She described the object as large and slow moving.  She says it made a humming noise.

The sky was clear. I had just got done watching a high flying jet that was going from North to South leaving a trail. About 30 seconds later a VERY bright light caught my eye. It was 80 degrees above the horizon SSW of my position. At first I thought it was a planet that I had somehow missed, but it was atleast 10 times the brightness of Venus and was moving slowly in a Northerly direction. It then began to dim to the brightness of the dimmest stars I could see, so I naturally thought that this was an Irridium flare. I then opened the window to get an unobstructed view with the binoculars. All of the sudden it was now moving in a Southerly direction, exactly opposite of what it was at first doing. I saw the direction change, it did not turn at all, but instead just instantly was going in the opposite direction.

The lights on the underside were NOT flashing or pulsating.  The craft was darker than the night sky.  It appeared to be heading from east to southwest from the ocean, i.e. from Fort Lauderdale area towards the Everglades. The altitude appeared to be no more than one mile.  What impressed us both was the speed, shape, lights, haze, and silence of this craft. It was observed from our rear yard at night. ((END TEXT OF WRITTEN REPORT))  ((ADDENDUM FROM LETTER, WRITTEN BY WITNESS))  ..Prior to contacting you, I watched the Peter Jennings Special on television and your Reporting Center was shown.  My reason for calling was to learn if others had observed the craft similar to the one my wife and I observed in 1989.  I have agreed to submit the sighting forms, as you suggested, and I would appreciate a telephone response as promised.  After all these years, I really desire an answer as to the question of were we the only persons to observe this type of unidentified craft. One evening in 1989 (month not remembered), my wife and I were sitting in our open back yard patio hoping to observe the fire trail of a launching at Cape Kennedy, which could be visible unobstructed, as we reside on a lake.  For reasons unknown, we did not see the flame tail and were returning to the house.  Suddenly, my wife became very excited and pointed towards the Eastern sky. Approaching us east to west from the ocean/Fort Lauderdale area, was a strange flying vehicle.  It was moving very quickly at a low altitude and turning southwest directly towards our home.  We both observed a very large triangle, or arrowhead shaped craft, surrounded by a haze at approximately 3/4, or a mile, altitude.  As it passed above us, it made no sound.  It was completely silent.  Clearly visible were circular white lights, seven in number, on the underside, beginning at the nose, and evenly spaced towards the rear.  It disappeared from view, going towards the Everglades.  I build model aircraft as a hobby, and this vehicle was not shaped like anything I have ever seen, including the stealth F-117, or the B2 Bomber. My wife and I mentioned this incident to several of our friends and neighbors immediately; however, they expressed no interest.  We did not contact any official agency for obvious reasons.  I hope that this information will be useful. Please keep our identities confidential, as my former work in Law enforcement raised certain hostilities. I would appreciate a short collect telephone response.  I now have great interest in determining whether my wife and I were the only persons that observed this triangle type of UFO.

It was about 8:00 p.m., and as we made a turn around a corner I saw an object in the sky.  I looked at the object a few seconds expecting it to turn out to be a helicopter but it looked like it was tumbling and spinning at the same time as this motion was going on it seemed like it was changing shape. I&apos;m guessing the shape shifting effect was due to the tumbling motion or maybe the shape shifting was causing it to look like it was tumbling.  I looked at my friend and asked her if she saw what I saw and she told me she did then asked me what it was. The object was close enough that I could make out some detail as it turned, but none of the shapes made sense.  Sometimes I could make out what looked like an aircraft rudder then a second later it looked like it had an oval like sphere on the one end there were not lights on the object that I could see. Overall the object had an elongated shape that as I said seemed to be out of control and tumbling and flipping.  I am an ex Air Force aircraft mechanic and the person I was with is a paralegal.  I have seen many planes and helicopters and I have never seen anything that moved like this object.  It was black and did not reflect light, despite the fact that the sun was shining directly on it.  I could also see a perfect translucent circle around the object as it tumbled in the sky.  I could see the circle because the part of the sky that was visible inside the circle was a different shade.  Also, the object never made a sound that we could hear.The object seemed to be stationary at first then seemed to move away from us and up.  Shortly after it moved a passenger jet flew over the apartment complex and as the jet liner passed over I could still see the object above and further away than the jet and I would say the object was a third to half the size of the jet from my perspective. I watched the object for about thirty to forty-five minutes and the longer I watched it the further up it went.  Fortunately there was not a cloud in the sky and I saw the object climb until it was only a black speck and then it disappeared.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and we found him to be quite objective in his description of the event.

The lights were perfectly synchronized when they began to appear, the first one then about two seconds later the second and two seconds later the third and then the forth one was visable. The first three lights were all in a perfectly straight line and the fourth one was above them but offset a little. They did not move at all for about ten to twenty seconds then they just faded out. A couple of minutes went by and they began to appear again in the same fashion as they did the first time one right after the other except this time only three of the lights appeared, not four and they were visiable for about ten seconds then they also faded out. These lights were identical to the first ones I saw and were in the same area of the sky as the first ones. Immediately after the second appearance faded out I saw a faint white light from the exact spot of the sky where the last three lights faded out shoot across the sky at an incredible rate of speed heading east and it was gone.

This thing had people pulling over to the side of the road to view it.  It was obvious that it was not trying to hide because it seemed to just be observing the traffic.  Now for the detail...  This thing was so close I could have hit it with a rock.  It was the dim&apos;s of a saucer but with 4 large bubble shaped lights cross dividing it into somewhat of a pie shape, 2 of the the lights were turning blue while the other 2 lights were turning red.

There were vegetable fields / farms on both sides of the road. That was when I noticed what looked like small planes flying around the fields, taking off and landing. I asked my husband which airport it was and he said that there was no airport there. He said he has been seeing those lighted things flying around the fields for a while. He thought that they were lighted windmills. When I looked carefully, I realized that they were free flying aircrafts. They all had amber lights underneath and very bright white search light like head lights turned on / off frequently. We assumed that someone was practicing night flying. But it didn&apos;t fly like regular planes or helicopters. 3 of them were V shaped and flying one behind another with perfect sync.

I don&apos;t remember the exact date but know it was winter and during the one year period I dated the passenger in my car during the sighting. I was driving northeast on I-43 in Wisconsin from the University of Wisconsin - Whitewater via East Troy and heading to a restaurant in the suburbs of Milwaukee. This section of the highway is &quot;in the middle of nowhere&quot; and quite dark with only farm houses and the stars for illumination. You would see another car maybe every minute or two. The girl I was dating at the time, who attended UWW, was the passenger. As we drove on I-43, we noticed directly ahead, maybe 5-10 miles distant, a single white spotlight heading towards us at a low altitude, as if it was a helicopter flying low with a bright spotlight on it, but the light was only aimed straight ahead - not sweeping the ground. The light was moving towards us as we drove towards it, and it was also following the highway - but in the opposite direction. As we got closer more details revealed themselves, and we could now discern three lights, a red blinking on one &quot;wing-tip&quot; and either blue or green blinking on the other, with the white light in the center-front edge. We now thought it was an airplane, due to the light pattern, but were curious as to why it was so low and flying very slowly. As it got closer yet (within a mile?) we could see more and more lights in a &quot;V&quot; shape and began to think it might be an advertising blimp. When we were moments away from driving under the aircraft, we could see all of the details. I was a huge (300&apos; wide?) bommerang shaped craft. It was a dark color, and the shape could only be ascertained by it&apos;s blotting out of stars, it&apos;s slightly different shade of black from the night sky, and a small amount of residual glow on it&apos;s surface from it&apos;s own lights. All of the visible lights were on the front leading edge of the object. There were the previously mentioned red and green/blue blinking lights on each wingtip, the white spotlight-type light shining forward from the point in front of the boomerang, and many, many small christmas tree-like white lights along the leading edges of both wings and filling the spaces between the three principle lights. These white lights were all evenly spaced from each other. My recollection is there were maybe 25 or so of these tiny white lights giving shape to the front edge of the boomerang shape. At this point we knew we were seeing something extraordinary. As we came underneath it I pulled to the left hand shoulder of I-43 and slowed to a stop. We both opened our doors and leaned out of the car. The craft had stopped directly over us! I turned off the engine and our lights, the craft was completely silent and hovering right over us. If you took your arms and put them straight over you and at 45 degree angles, that is how much of the sky it took up - enormous. After maybe a minute it dawned on us that if it was stopped directly over us, then it was aware of us and watching us. We were torn between fear and a &quot;deer-in-the-headlights&quot; urge to keep watching. Suddenly, this huge craft started doing what I could only describe as &quot;tumbling&quot; while directly above us. The lights started moving in a way that suggested it was either majestically pirouetting in place or doing some sort of extreme manuever. This lasted about 15-30 seconds. Just as we were deciding we should get the heck out of there, the craft righted itself and started slowly, silently &quot;drifing&quot; off at about a 70 degree heading from the direction we were pointed up the highway, which means it changed it&apos;s course from following I-43 southwest to heading almost straight east across the farm fields. As it started drifting off and was maybe only a quarter of a mile away, I started slowly driving again and trying to watch it out the passenger window. As I was weaving and driving very erratically from trying to watch it, my friend said I should keep my eyes on the road and she would keep watching it. Just after she said this, a huge flash of white light, like a lightning flash or a huge flashbulb, lit up the road and countryside all around us. It was just a single flash, like a single strobe flash. I looked at my friend and started to say &quot;Did that come from the...?&quot; and she nodded yes! She said she was looking straight at it when it happened, and it looked like a searchlight was beamed at us, but only flashed instead of staying on. She didn&apos;t say exactly from where on the craft the light came. Immediately after this light flash the craft did the next, very odd manuever - and one that makes me think there may have been two of them traveling parallel and side by side. As it drifted off, the lights would suddenly wink out entirely and simultaneoulsly come on again on an identical object flying next to it and perhaps 200 yards away. Then the second craft&apos;s lights would wink out and the first craft&apos;s lights would wink on again. This would happen perhaps every 5 seconds and the visual effect was like there was one craft that could somehow instantaeously displace itself from side to side a few hundred yards, but all the while continuing it&apos;s slow forward airspeed uninterrupted. It was a very weird sight and that night, and for perhaps a year after, I believed there was only one craft that was somehow &quot;displacing&quot; itself as it flew. It was only later that I figured out it could have been done with two craft, and that maybe the weird &quot;tumbling&quot; that I saw was the visual effect of two craft doing manuevers while one was directly above the other. As the object got further and further away, we finally arrived at our restaurant destination about 30 minutes later. The craft was in view the entire time, but was now very far away, maybe 15-20 miles, and appeared to be circling some radio or tv towers in the far distance. We watched from the parking lot of the restaurant and pointed out the lights to some other patrons getting in and out of their cars, but at this point the lights were far away and very mundane looking and the people must have thought we were crazy. In the restaurant my friend and I compared notes and that is when many of the details of that night became cemented in my memory. We were trying to figure out what to do and I ended up calling some agency, on the lobby pay phone, but I don&apos;t remember who I called. My recollection is that it was the tower at Milwaukee&apos;s Billy Mitchell Airport, but for some reason I can&apos;t remember. As the years have gone by I have told this story to many friends and by pure chance saw the book NIGHT SIEGE in a bookstore in St.Paul, MN over a decade later. I passed on buying it that day, but finally did in the late 90&apos;s. I am now fascinated by any TV shows I see on UFO&apos;s - especially boomerang or triangle shaped ones. I&apos;ve also noted that my sighting pre-dates many of these other sightings. If this is some military craft, I can assure you that it was already in full operation in Wisconsin in the mid-70&apos;s!((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD))", "In Paradise,California I observed 2 parallel lines of light  at an angle between 3am and 4am in the west not moving or changing.I was awake at 3am to give my sister her medicine. When I went into the kitchen to rinse the medical supplies I saw due west 2 parallel thick lines of yellow white light at a slight angle. The light was not the same bright white color of the stars. The one on top appeared to have a ball of light at the head of the line. They did not move. I watched them for about 10 minutes to see if there was any movement. There was none. I thought they might be shooting stars or comets with tails. The lines were uniformly thick though and the same length. The outlines were fuzzy and not sharp. I went outside in front to get a closer look and then went into the backyard to see if I could still see them. They did not move or change. I watched for about 30 minutes and then went back inside the house. I watched them from my bedroom window which is in the front of the house where the kitchen is. They never moved or changed. I finally fell asleep and when I woke up it was still dark and they were gone.", "rectangular bright object in a hover shots straight up and disappears.I was working third shift as a security officer in a industrial district of chicago heights.  On this  night i was called outside  to  a police  vehicle blocking off the intersection directly in front of our building.   After a few minutes of watching to see  if anything was going to happen a large number of police vehicle chasing a civilian building flew by the intersection.   About twenty seconds after the chase went by i looked caty corner from our building to the large factory across the street.  About a thousand of feet it seemed a rectangular shaped outlined by an extremely bright lights seemed to hover over the factory.  My first thoughts were that it was a helicopter involved in the police chase.  I pointed the object out to my partner and we began to talk about.  I was airborne in the army and he was a navy seals boat operator in the navy and we were both puzzled because it looked like no helicopter we had ever seen.  I will have to say we couldn&apos;t see any details of the craft due to the brightness of the lights sorrounding it.  However we were talking for about a minute when we heard the sounds of the police sirens coming back towards our position.   We looked around for the police cars and then both looked back up at the object and about ten seconds later, the vehicle seemed to shoot directly straight up at an extremely high rate of speed, faster than anything i ever saw in the military.  The lights dissappeared within seconds.  I was wondering if you had any explanation of what it could be?", "There were bright white objects in the afternoon moving slowly in  the sky one of them emitted a smaller object.These objects was seen by two persons and I, the sky was clear with abright sun. First object that I saw was round and bright white. It almost look like staror planet but this seemed strange, a star or planet doesn&apos;t shine that bright after 6PM with a sunny sky. The object moved from west to east (and from east to west) slowly and sometimes I could not tell if it was moving because it moved so slowly.When it moved back and forth the object faintedto the point it was hard to relocate it.  Usually it fainted when it got closer to the sun but when it got further from the sun it begun to shine more.  After observing it for more than ten minutes this thing got my real attention and my jaw dropped. It emitted an object smaller than itself. The smaller object traveled northeast slowly but faster than the bigger object.  After that I did not know what happened to the two objects because I got distracted by a soccer game that my father was in. When I look up again to the sky I could not relocate them. However after ten minutes I saw another object that looked the same at the same location of the sky. It&apos;s behavior moved the same (west to east and east to west slowly). A few minutes later it traveled only west not going back to east.(note:as it traveled west to the sun it kept its white color it didn&apos;t look like it reflected any orange,yellow colors caused by the sun) As it traveled west it fainted and then another object heading toward it appeared about the same size but brighter coming from the northwest and traveling southeast. As I focus my eyes on this brighter object I could describe it had a faint red color, I could bearly tell it had a red color,if I didn&apos;t focus on it the color would be a bright white. The objects looked like they were at the same altitude and almost made contact to each other as they got closer to each other . The object going west fainted and I observed it until my eyes couldn&apos;t see it.  The other object fainted as it traveled slowly southeast and kept my eyes on it until I couldn&apos;t see it. About twenty minutes later the sky was a little dark but still bright, it was between 7:30 PM and 8:00 PM, I looked up to see any more sightings of more objects and just as I looked up a saw one. This object was bigger and I could distinguish another shape. At first it looked between a bent cigar and a small moon crescent then looked like a straight small cigar. It&apos;s color was a bright white,it&apos;s altitude looked the same as the other objects that I saw before and moved west slowly, its location was further northwest from the other objects that I saw.My father saw it as I told him about it and the other objects. There was another person that I told them about the first object that I saw and they also saw it. The objects could not be ballons because at the altitude to which they looked they were at had to burst by the sun rays. A high-altitude airliner, those planes that are way up high in the sky and leave a smog white trail, was able to travel under one of the objects and I was able to campare that the unknown object was about twice as high in the sky than the airliner&apos;s altitude.(The aircraft passed under the third object that I saw). I hope that this sighting  is somehow useful and I give many thanks for the people for putting an easy  source to reach for the public to report ufos.", "On 07-04-05 at about midnight, we saw a bright white sphere of light in clear skies.Heading east on highway 92 out of Granite Falls we drove out of town to the &quot;Green Mountain Road&quot; also known as &quot;Three Fingers&quot; mountain. Drove up the road approx. 2 miles to a extremely dark and secluded overlook of the valley below. We were there trying to get a broad view of all the fireworks down in the cities and towns below us. As my father and I stood around looking at all the fireworks, my father asked &quot;hey, what&apos;s that up there?&quot; I turn left and look up and spot a very bright, intense, white sphere of light. This &quot;ball&quot; of light appeared to be a satellite at first moving extermely fast from west to south east. Then as we watched, it suddenly started to move about unlike ANY conventional aircraft we&apos;ve EVER seen. It veered left at extraordinary velocity, then right, then arched in a rainbow type trajectory at incredible speed. Maneuvers completely unseen and probably impossible in any traditional aircraft we know of. We watched this &quot;ball&quot; for about 60 seconds after which is darted behind a mountain, not to be seen by us again that night. The &quot;ball&quot; made no noise at all and put my father and I in a state of excitement unmatched by any fireworks. Very remarkable holiday.", "a slow moving light too far to be an airplane that faded awayI went outside to smoke my last cigarette of the day and i was staring up into the nights sky when i noticed an object that resembled an airplanes flight pattern. It was moving slow and in a straight line. But the first thing i noticed funny about it was that it was soooo far away. Even a plane traveling at its highest distance from the surface of the earth has some distinctive shape to it. and usually has a few lights on it to where you can make out the wings. Well this object I saw looked as if it was a very distant star. It was faint but definately visible with the naked eye. I just followed its flight until it just faded away very slowly. At first i thought mabye it was a very high plane that just went into some cloudy haze and that was the reason for it fading away, but when you look over a little more i could see every other star in the sky with the naked eye. I waited to see if it was going to come out of this unseen cloud but it never resurfaced . It simply went away. Now I&apos;m not saying it was a UFO but for one its distance, its speed, and it just fading away makes it a little suspicious. It could have been an asteroid or some large rock or ice flying through space having the suns light reflected on it. But unless there is documentation of such an event it will still remain a mystery to me.", "Three  bright blue lights, fading to lighter blue, turning red when changing direction, flashing white when accelerating.We were on our rooftop to watch the variety of Phoenix and surrounding area firework shows, and got more than we expected. We saw three bright blue lights, fading to lighter blue, turning red when changing direction, flashing white when accelerating. They looked to me to be playing with each other, turning around each other, chasing, diving and floating. At times the were out of sight due to tree tops, and we presumed they might have landed. This was observed facing South from South Scottsdale, they were probably flying over Tempe.  At the time there was flight traffic in the area and fireworks shows.  I have a photo depicting an airplane, the strange lights and  fireworks.  We spotted a fighter jet flying into the area, and the lights hid and remained hidden.", "Moving star-like objects and Red Flashing LightsMy husband called me outside to see a light that was hovering and changing colors in the northwestern sky. We called our children (ages 12 and 10) outside to view the light. We brought out our binoculars to get a better view. While I was looking through the binculars, my son (12)saw a red streak go down to the right of the object and screamed &quot;Did you see that?&quot;. I didn&apos;t, but when we searched for the first light that was chaning colors it had disappeared. We continued to look up at the sky. We saw two star-like objects move together from left to right in the north western sky and then they disappeared. Then there were two star-like objects in the northeastern sky that would appear and disappear in slightly different areas than they were before, but their distance from each other remained the same. Then we saw a star like object move over head from north to south. It passed another starlike object and made an immediate turn back and joined with the object it had just passed. It appeared to form a tiangle with two other star-like items. Finally, we saw three red flashing lights go across the sky from the south east part of town over to the northwest part of town. Using binoculars we tracked it as it went across the sky. The three red lights flashed randomly in a triangle formation. There was absolutely no sound coming from the object. Shortly after it had passed an airplace passed in the distance and it could clearly be heard! It was an exciting two hours we spent looking up at the sky!  We also saw several shooting stars through out the night. We hope others in the Tucson area saw the same thing!((NUFORC Note:  Likely sighting of Sirius.  PD))", "round  object, greyish whiteish  in  colorMoving faster  than  a  jet  then hid  behind  clouds. Then  did  not  see  it  come  out  from  clouds.  Day  was  mostly  clear  partly  cloudy.

Iwas coming back from the bathroom when me and my Mom saw a EGG shaped object in the sky.!. It was flashing red, blue, and Green colors. It was about 10,000 feet in the sky were pretty sure its egg shaped but it was hard to see. It was also slightly moving.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))", "It was Sunday night and quite clear at the time.  My sister and I were in our back yard looking at the stars and one object caught our attention.  It was bright red and seemed stationary.  I actually thought it was Mars at first and so did she but it was too big to be so and as we soon found out it moved too fast as well.  I should note that three of us saw the object at first but my other sister went inside so she did not actually witness it move away as it eventually did, to our surprise, at about 11:40 PM.  When we first noticed it, which didn&apos;t take long, it was positioned about NNW.  I estimate at about 25-30 degrees in the sky, 90 degrees being looking straight up into the sky between the East and West horizons.  It moved up into the sky seemingly orbiting at first.  Like I have stated it came off as Mars at first but too big.  We were alarmed to actually see it move before our very eyes, again too fast for a planet or a space station which NASA proclaimed.  Maybe a sattelite but no because sattelites don&apos;t move up in the night sky and all of a sudden change directions within a 20 minute period of time seeming to change its mind or course.  Well again it moved up to about a 40 degree angle if you were to say east to west was 180 degrees- 90 being looking directly up in the sky.  Now here is what gets strange My sister took a flashlight that she had and turned it on and off.  At once, as if it was responding, started to blink and moved more noticeably faster but back towards the West moving slightly south as it did so and vanished over the horizon. I did not notice any dancing around, I would just like to add that Cleveland Hopkins International Airport is just a couple of miles away also to our NNW. Coincidence? This is no hoax!  Sorry if this description was too long.", "Triangle shaped object with red and blue lights hovered for sometime.We were having a gathering outside our home Sunday May 28th, 2005 when my wife noticed an object in the sky giving off a purpleish light. I looked at it and thought it was only a star, because it wasn&apos;t moving so I didn&apos;t feel it was an airplane or other aircraft. The object continue to hover for about another 20 minutes and by now more people were looking at it so I decided to get a pair of binoculars to take a closer.  My heart drop when I focused in and discovered that it was some sort of aircraft, but none like I had ever seen before.  It was a triangle shape with a series of bright blue and red lights (really bright lights). The object hover a few moments more before it started moving in a side to side motion while dropping lower in the sky at the same time. It finally flew out of view after we watched it for about 15 minutes. It was too far away to photograph.", "Heard humming. Went outside. 75 ft rectangle shaped object  30 ft. above my house. Hovered silently  5 mins.then headed North.I was in my living room &amp; heard a humming noise, so I went out on my front porch &amp; looked up but didn&apos;t see anything.  I went back inside &amp; a few minutes later I heard the humming again. Outside at the end of my porch I looked up &amp; there was this object directly over the top of my house.  If I had a 30 foot extension ladder, I could have climbed on board.  It was long,about 75 feet long,with windows, amber colored light coming through the windows. To me,it looked like an office building flipped on its side.  I stood there in awe--spiritually moved by seeing this.  It was just there,not moving,stationary, over top of part my house &amp; part of my neighbor&apos;s house to the left. Finally it moved &amp; slowly headed north. What didn&apos;t make sense to me afterwards was that I didn&apos;t hop in my car &amp; follow it. I just went back inside my house. My sons, who were 9 and 7 years old at that time, had a different story to tell later. They said they were out back playing (it was dark out &amp; they wouldn&apos;t be outside that late at night)...and they saw a red beam of light come down from this object.  They got scared and hid in a shed we had in the back yard.  I have no memory of any red beam.  But I was really &quot;spaced out&quot;...no pun intended.  I was in total awe &amp; amazement! I may have had missing time, I don&apos;t know. The only after effect I had was that my hair got kind of thin on the top not long after this happened. I was afraid to report it because I just don&apos;t trust our government.  Because this sighting was SO close up...just 30 feet over my head..I can state for a fact it was not a plane or any known vehicle. I mean what kind of object can hover silently right over top of your house? I&apos;ve had lots of dreams of alien babies after this happened. One time I dreamed that a black helicopter landed in my back yard &amp; I was deathly afraid of it.  The word &quot;Kraft&quot; was coming into my mind when I saw it.  I would love to go under hypnosis to see if I could remember more details, but I don&apos;t know of anyone who does that. I have a small little bump with a red mark about the size of a B-B on my right shin area.  I&apos;ve had it for years but don&apos;t really know when it appeared.

I saids to myself belive belive in what Then something came over me Ahh I said UFO&apos;s Yes I repided in my head Then a Yellow light was in my room like a strobe light I felt weird but never noticed, It ask me questions as I asked also The first think I saw in my mind was the Earth from above the sky (In space) they were pointing out Itally I told them what the country was, I ask to see there world and many other things what I saw was The bigest Sun and 2 planets I did not see the ground.I know this sounds strange but as we got into the conversation I noticed a Red light come in my window this was strange then back to Yellow I then noticed the light and woundered What is this light and I saw a Caution Sign with 2 lights flahing Thinking I was close to a 4 way stop but in fact I thought wait I live 2 blocks away from that 4 way stop and it dose not have any caution lights flashing (Ilived on Chole) away from Fletcher Parkway In La Measa California) I jumped out of my bed and looked right at it It was still flashing its yellow light (It had 3 by the way red yellow I belive Blue) I ask it not to go away I had givin some wrong information the light suddenly stoped they looked like head lights But when it closed it round smooth metal door it sealed without a trace of anything being there like it was not even there.It had no sound as it hover over a empty lot it was very small it backed up and took off with no sound what so ever no motor sound at all.I went and ran to the front door screaming UFO no one ever belive me untill the La Measa Journal published reports of UFO&apos;s sightings by 2 Guards at Grossmont Hospital hovering over the Hosptial (My mother said the lights where very low and all Hospital&apos;s has emegancie back ups)I was 13 Years old when this happen I have never forgot the storys I had talk about with the UFO &amp; has stuck with me and bothered me, I am propblie the only one to have spoken to an allen or saw a ship so small that a normal human can not fit into.I know what I saw now at age 16 I saw 3 lights in the sky circles shapes way up I was in a very dark park and at that time I ask my girl what time it was it was 9:14pm we saw them desend into what look like three ways of going but in the form of a cross I told my girl about the story above and all of a sudden I saw a bright light in a Dark Dark park the grass was lit up white I turn to my girl we both said wow and woundered what just happen I ask what time it was as I remembered asking brfore it was now 10:14pm and I just turn my head towards her and lost 1hour and fourteen min.

Last year same apx time, there were two lights traveling side by side for apx 45 minutes to one hour. This year only one object was present, and it appeared in apx the same location, and disappeared within a couple of miles, and was viewable for apx 45 minutes or less. A semi solid looking fuzzy red light (to the human eye), moving along an extremely slow pace that no know man made aircraft could maintain. No running or flashing lights, no noises made either. It looked like it would take 15 minutes to go just one mile. For the most part it maintained a consitant light source, but would on ocassion alter in intensity, and also seemed to vibrate or move strangely for a moment from time to time. This happened again just before all the scheduled fireworks were to go off, so there should be hundreds or thousands of people seeing what my girlfriend and I saw. I stayed until the object vanished, it basically started to ascend to a higher altitude, and disappeared. I headed back home (we had gone out for a walk with our dog), my girlfriend had already went home, upon me arriving home, she pointed out in another location south of El Cajon, CA, another strange unidentified object in the sky. This one was very far away compared to the one over head in El Cajon. It was only visible to the eye for apx 3 minutes, and was not as red as the one described earlier. It  had the same characteristics as the other described object, etc. I am a professional photographer and graphic artist, and have a good grasp of the visual world around me. I am sure there will be more reports concerning this sighting by others. I believe that this is the 3rd year in a row, that this event has happened over El Cajon. The images I took were done in order, starting with the bottom one first. You can see that the object is revolving from a horizontal position to an almost 90 degree turn. Unfortunately 90% of my images got corrupted in the camera at the time of filming this. My camera was malfunctioning out of the blue, I have heard such things have happened to other people filming UFO&apos;s.", "Camping out on a clear night, I saw a white cone of light touch the ground from outer space.In 2002 I hiked the length of the Appalachian Trail. It was around the first or second week in May when myself and four other friends where camped out close to Mt. Rogers. We were hiking north, but on that particular night we had been dropped of down the trail so we could hike south into Damasus, VA for the annual TrailDays Festival. We had set up camp out on an open field atop of a ridge where cows were grazing, a place which someone had named &apos;the boomer trail&apos; (the words were carved on a wooden fence post at the end of the field). The view from ridge - essentially you could see for miles down into the valley in front of you, and miles in the opposite direction, down into the valleys behind (probably north and south views). A small part of our side to side (east and west) views were obstructed by hilltops along the ridgeline we were on. It was not too long after sunset when all of us were sitting in a circle chatting and drinking tea. I was looking up at the stars. It was an amazingly clear night. Not one cloud in the sky. And since we were kind of isolated from any civilization, the stars were extremely prevalent. I believe there was also a full moon that night which was rising behind me, towards the south. I was looking up and towards the northwest when, in almost the exact spot I was checking out, an amazingly bright light caught my attention. It was a white light and atleast as bright as moon, if not brighter. when I finally focused on the light, I saw that it was aimed somewhere behind me. A couple seconds went by when the light panned over top of us and down through the valley directly in front of me. It was then that I realized the light was in the shape of a perfect cone. It&apos;s hard to say how far across the light at the bottom of the cone was, but i would guess no more than 1/4 of a mile (pretty narrow). When the spotlight had shut off it had already moved maybe two miles away from us. This whole process had lasted about 5 seconds. Although it appeared that the light had been shut off, there was still 2-3 seconds where you could see light coming from the source, kind of like the was fading out. However, I dont think the light was dimming. Rather I believe the beam had come from so far away that it just took a while for the light to finally dissipitate. When the white light had finally burnt completely out, it became obvious that the source was in outer space. What this light finally amounted too after this event was a near miniscule, dim, red dot that was slowly tracking across the sky. One probably would not have noticed it if the had not seen the powerful white beam that shot from it. It would appear that it was a type of satellite, but I have never heard of any satellites that shoot perfect cones of light that touch the ground... About 5 minutes had past before the tiny red dot had tracked to the east and was no longer in our view....We all saw the red dot tracking, but only one other witness had seen nearly the entire length of the white-light incident. And, atleast one other person in the group, besides he, caught the tail end of the event. All in all it was an amazing site to see and I have yet to tell the story to anyone that has any idea of what could have created such a powerful light. We were near a military base, so it may not be so suprising that something weird like that took place... The following day we were hiking across an open ridge and saw two planes doing manuevers coming toward us down in the valley below. One of the planes flew right over my head and it was so low I swear I could just about see the features of pilots face in the cockpit....Anyway, I would much like to learn what that light was and what purpose it has.......", "Football sized craft passed over my home in 1992It was the night of my prom and very dark out. I just went inside to get changed and go out to the car that was waiting for me. I came back out and I was just getting into the car when I noticed a lot of wind blowing around a very big tree that we had in the front yard.  I happened to glance upward when I saw something about the size of a football field moving very very slowly about 100 ft above the tree line.  It had lights that blinked and some that didnt change or blink.  I remember that I was frozen in my place I couldnt even speak.  I finally got my bearings and ran into the house to tell my mom about my sighting and franticly yell for a camera.  I was in the house for a matter of like 10 seconds and ran back out to look up and it moved clear across the sky but I could still see it moving about like I would have to guess 1 mile away and up the same distance from the treeline that I had seen it in the first place.  All I could think was INCREDIBLE, it moved that amount of distance in a matter of seconds.  I spent the night telling my friends about what I had seen and them not believing me.  It was when we were listening to the radio that night that when the announcer mentioned the object in the sky and asking anyone that had seen it to call the station.  I kept telling my friends that THAT was what I saw!  It is so very vivid in my head...I close my eyes and still see the craft and how it didnt make any noice when it moved over my house.  It made a ton of wind to make my huge tree just rock and sway all over the place.", "sphere,or orb of dim light passes over followed by a passing jetback in late may or early june i saw a sphere of very dim light. the orb was low in the sky as it travelled east west. it did not last long. just as it vas gone i heard a jet passing over. i looked at the jet and saw it.the jet was higher in the sky. jet was in a flight vone far from an airport.((NUFOR Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))", "I work late hours and had just returned home. It had been a hot day, so I went out on my balcony to water the plants. There I saw coming from my left side - it&apos;s southeast - an orange light shining so bright, that it looked starshaped - like the kind of star you put on the top of a christmas-tree.The object was about 7 to 10 meters(30 feet)above me, who lives at the top floor of a five-floor building. That would make the altitude of the light about 25 meter (75-80 feet).That early in the morning my neighbourhood is totally quiet, so I am absolutely sure that the object was soundless. It flew slowly right above the middle of the street making the darkened roofs glow in the light.It was not a flare. There was no wind, and a flare would have a downwards glide. The thing flew silently keeping its altitude on a north-western course across the port of Copenhagen, and after a kilometer or so it turned westwards. I was so busy watching it, that I hadn,t noticed the other one, until it was right above my head. The second one was looking the same and took the exact course of the first one. My estimate is, that there was about 1000 to 1500 meters between them. The velocity was about 8 mph. It too turned westwards.I&apos;ve reported it to the danish ufo reporting center, but so far no other observations have been made.I am quite stunned about this and was sure, when I watched them, that they were not man-made.One thing make me wonder though. President George W. Bush is visiting Denmark july 5. to thank the danes for participating in the Iraqi war. So every spot of Copenhagen is virtually vacuum-cleaned, and there is a swarm of american security-agents around. Maybe these &apos;ufo&apos;es are new military reconnaissance aircrafts. If they are, the lack of sound is astonishing. But if they don&apos;t want to be seen, it&apos;s odd, that they shine so bright.", "Starlike, could have been satellite but doesn&apos;t match Heaven&apos;s Above info.I was outside taking a look at what few stars were visible from downtown Toronto on a clearer night than most. I first spotted a slow-moving starlike object to the south west just before midnight at about 45 degrees up from the horizon moving towards me. I assumed it was a satellite although it was very bright (brighter than the dozen or so stars I could see) and was slower moving than most satellites I&apos;ve seen. When directly overhead the light disappeared, as one would expect a satellite to do when moving into the earth&apos;s shadow. With my head bent back as far as it could go I had to wheel round to look for the object as it continued on its north-easterly heading. After a couple of seconds I saw a very dim light moving where I expected it to be and after a few more seconds the light disappeared again as it continued to head north-east in a straight line. When I checked the Heaven&apos;s Above website, the info given for the ISS, or any other object, satellite or booster for that matter, didn&apos;t match the criteria. The ISS was due over at that time but the course was different and it would have appeared at its highest point low in the sky, not directly overhead.

The objects were moving at a speed I&apos;d say was much slower than a satellite.The objects were by my estimates to be at a very high altitude.The objects moved directly over my location and continued on to the south a little ways, that is when they stopped and after about 20 to 30 seconds there was a slow orangish flash and they were gone.This is not like me to report something like this,but I thought I should share this incident.I work in a medical field and am also a pilot I&apos;ve been married 23yrs.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.

It was the eighth anniversary of the Apollo 11 lunar landing.  As darkness descended I was chatting over the fence, as it were, with a neighbor who was approaching retirement age; we often spoke like this.  Housing in our south-side neighborhood was modest single-family residences on smaller urban lots, with narrow driveways leading from backyard garages to the public street.  Lighting was typical of what one may find in an urban area in the late 1970s, that being mercury vapor street lamps. I do not know why we each paused in our conversation, what may have attracted our eyes, but we both halted at the same point and looked skyward toward the west, and perhaps 20&deg; above the horizon.  The best I may describe what we saw was a small group of intensely colored lights, moving steadily and in formation, east by southeasterly.  As the group of lights approached what would be due southwest of our position, they halted suddenly.  And then the fun began. The lights no longer remained in formation.  They darted.  Here.  There.  Then there.  Changing position.  Appearing in this part of the southwesterly sky.  Then there.  The rapidity of movement, the intensity with which each craft changed direction, was absolutely startling.  The lights would dart and flash in the sky almost as if wishing to convey a message that could not be readily understood. Then the sky again was absent of these lights.  For a moment.  They reappeared again in the formation that initially caught my eyes and that of my neighbor.  In formation they resumed the same path at the same rate of speed as when we first observed these and before their awesome light show.  There was no audible sound. With a modest separation after the formation of lighted objects, we then observed two military jet aircraft on the same path as the formation and following at the same pace. My neighbor and I looked at each other.  &quot;What the heck was that?&quot; we both said to the other.  &quot;I guess we&apos;ll never know.&quot;", "Triangle shaped Craft.object had 3 lights spaced at 120 degress apart in the form of triangle and was moving from the south to north at a slow speed.

We were chatting with each other, singing songs, etc, and took no special notice of the night sky. After about an hour or so, after we had chatted and sung ourselves out, I layed back and was looking up at all the constellations. The big dipper was directly above me and I remember looking at it for about 5 minutes, not noticing anything odd, when all of a sudden one of the stars in its handle shot off at a high speed in an eastward direction, stopped, shot off again in a nothern direction and disappeared. Needless to say my neighbor and I were stunned.The thing that amazes me to this day was how well the object disguised itself. I knew the big dipper handle only has three stars but I didn&apos;t think anything of the fourth because it was spaced perfectly between two others, was sized perfectly, and was twinkling like the other stars. Nothing looked unordinary until it took off. Til this day I like to think that it waited for me and my neighbor to look up and conentrate before it took off.I realize that this may not even be labled a Close encounter of the first kind because no object shape, texture, etc. was visible. Still it changed my view of the universe and life in it forever.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.

I saw a faint far away light that was traveling across the sky.  at first I thought it was a satelite because i&apos;ve seen it a few times but then I noticed that it stopped for a moment and then i saw another faint light that was heading towards the first one as if to meet.  the first light veered to the left and then the other followed after it for a few seconds.  the lights seemed to have an irratic path, but i was concentrating on them for a while so i don&apos;t know if it was my eyes that were getting shaky.

The light was white in color.", "The object was hovering and moving slowly toward the field.I was nine years old at the time, We lived in a rural area outside of Rolla, Missouri. There was this older gentleman and his wife that lived accross the street from us. He had just purchased a new Kodak One Step Camera for a trip that he and his wife were going to take, and asked some of us kids that were playing nearby at the time if he could take our pictures, he wanted to try out the camera. We were standing in his driveway waiting for the first picture to develop when this huge shadow blocked out the sunlight. I looked up and saw this object, it wasn&apos;t emitting any sound what so ever, it was like one of the smaller ones in close encounters, with lights spining all around it. This took place &quot;before&quot; I saw the movie. I still do not understand how I could see the lights so brightly, in daylight! The older gentleman, my eleven year old brother, myself, two twin boy&apos;s that were around 7 if I recall corretly and one other 10 year old girl all took off in the direction that the object headed. It wasn&apos;t going fast at all, kind of hovering and slowly moving off toward a fenced field that we picked blackberries in. We went as far as the bob wire fence and then stopped. The object just hovered in the middle of the field, about 3 stories above the ground. The older man snaped a shot of it, and my older brother wanted to climb over the fence and get closer, I stopped him. I don&apos;t remember feeling afraid, I wasn&apos;t even shocked, I just didn&apos;t want him going any closer. I was only nine, If I saw one now I would probably freak out! We all crowded in as the picture was developing, it turned out pure &quot;white&quot; Like when you try to take a photo of something too bright. Now this is all that I can remember happening, we were looking at the photo and then our backs were turned away from the field and we were heading home, the sun was going down. My brother and I went home and told our mom what had happened, my oldest brother placed a call to the radio station and asked if anyone else had reported seeing anything... he was told,&quot;It must have been a weather balloon&quot; We never talked about that evening with the older man accross the street, the other children and even my brother and myself didn&apos;t discuss it until years later. He can&apos;t remember anything after looking at the photo either.

PD))", "Red lights along the side, white light in front,  in a search-like pattern: slow over water, very fast over land.I&apos;m filing this because of a History Channel program that referred me to this site, and I stumbled upon a sighting listed here that confirmed one I&apos;ve been wondering about for almost forty years. Camper park near Homestead, FL AFB.  Saw something with red lights along the side and a white light in front rise from trees a half mile away.  Rose slowly, then moved horizontally out over the water for about ten minutes at a slow pace.  When it came over land, it moved extremely fast, then slowed down again over water.  It kept up this circular pattern the whole time.  It was visible for over an hour. Made a jet engine whine, but very faint. There was a gravel road built up out of the water (the way they do down there) and the ship seemed to cross it a mile away. My dad drove us down to look. We found an Air Force car and a uniformed man who refused to acknowledge the thing we were pointing at.  He said there were just &apos;some boys out here drinking beer&apos;, and he wouldn&apos;t let us go any farther.  The craft was clearly visible, but he wouldn&apos;t even look over his shoulder.  We drove back to camp, and my boyfriend took a walkie-talkie with him and walked back down the road to see if he could get closer on foot.  The craft crossed over the road above him when I was talking to him on the radio. The radio cut out, and he came running back in a panic.  The radio worked again as soon as the craft moved on. Eventually, the craft dropped down, out of sight, like a balloon landing. It was no balloon. When we asked the campground manager the next day, he shrugged it off. &quot;We see a lot of things around here. Nobody pays any attention anymore.&quot;((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.  PD))", "Triangular aircraft with bright white light hovered silently over houses.I was driving home from work along the south frontage road that parallels I-70 near Troy, IL.  It was approx. 0400 in the am and I was traveling east at a speed of 35-40 mph.  I always drive slowly at that hour since it is prime time for certain wildlife on the roads (deer, raccoon, possums, rabbits).  There were only a few cars and trucks on the interstate and my husband was following in a vehicle behind me.  As I hit the crest of a hill offering a panoramic view, my peripheral vision caught sight of a very bright white light in the north sky to the left and ahead of me.  It was moving slowly toward the south and would eventually intersect the interstate and the frontage road on which I was traveling.  I could not see the craft at this time, only the bright light as it moved through the dark sky.  At certain times of the month, this is a flight path for Lambert airport in St. Louis, Mo (I travel this road frequently).  I assumed it was a plane and drove on, returning my full attention to the road.  A couple more minutes up the road the white light again attracted my interest.  It now seemed somewhat larger in the sky, since we were closing distance.  I could now notice both a red and a blue light beneath the level of the white one.  The red light was blinking.  I realized that the craft had to be too low in the sky for a plane and that it was traveling too slowly.  I remember thinking that it must be a helicopter, but my brain did not seem to fully accept this idea because the relative sizes (positions) of the lights seemed to indicate that they were not lined up in a lateral fashion but instead were indicative of greater depth.  (Amazing how fast a brain can assess and conclude!)  But then it must be a helicopter, what else could it be?  I returned my attention to the road. I came to the place where a side road joins the two frontage roads and the interstate overpass crosses above.  I am always very careful here.  This is a spot where accidents tend to occur due to a very short visual field created by the interstate embankment.Suddenly and surprisingly, I caught sight of lights above my van and to the right.  There was a large craft hovering above the houses near the end of the residential lane just ahead and to the south.  There was illumination from nearby street lights.  Regarding its width, it seemed to stretch across at least two roofs.  It was grey in color and triangular in shape.  Judging by the houses and the trees it was only about 400 or 500 feet above the ground.  It was not moving at this time.  My windows were up, the radio was off.  You can easily hear the sound of cars as they pass on the interstate, but this craft was completely silent.  I was trying to lean over the steering wheel to look up and still look ahead to avoid going off the road.  There was no shoulder to pull off on so my viewing of the craft at this close range was intermittent and consisted of short bursts.  I remember thinking, &ldquo;Is that military?&rdquo;  (This sighting occurred approx. fifteen miles from Scott Air Force Base.)  It reminded me of the pictures I have seen on TV of stealth bombers, but my understanding is that they cannot hover.  It also reminded me of harrier jets, and although they can hover I thought they emitted an enormous amount of noise.  I was bewildered and trying to reach the cell phone in my purse to call my husband and ask if he was seeing this too.  This juggling proved too difficult and I decided to continue on and stop at the church parking lot several hundred yards ahead.  I said, &ldquo;Did you see that?&rdquo; To which he responded, &ldquo;See what?&rdquo;  (My husband does not generally look at the sky and additionally was tired from a long day at work.  He did not see the craft as he was preoccupied watching my taillights, assuming that I had come to a near-stop due to an animal ahead on the roadway.)  I pointed to the craft still hovering but having shifted just slightly south.  From this new vantage point, the craft itself was too far to be clearly seen but the red and blue lights were visible beyond a deciduous tree line (no leaves on the trees).  No other lights were noted from this angle.  My husband could see the lights and was in agreement on the estimation of height.  Then the craft began to move southwesterly over the fields of a rural area.  I got back in the van and we traveled along a south road with the intention of intersecting it again on the next west road so my husband could see the underside of it.  But to our amazement the craft picked up an incredible amount of speed and while we watched, disappeared rapidly into the southwestern sky past the city lights of Collinsville toward St. Louis, covering at least 20 miles in about two minutes. From the initial sighting of the white light to the moment the colored lights of the underside were gone from sight was approx. 10 minutes duration, although direct viewing of the craft itself from underneath lasted only about 30 seconds.", "Streaks of Light close to the ground, followed by odd sensationsI enjoy to take walks late at night as excercise, from 1am to 3am--having coffee and smoking while walking through the side streets. On one of the nights (yesterday), I was gazing far off into the night sky observing the constellations when I saw a streak of light, akin to a shooting star--though it appeared as if the light source came from behind a cloud. It looked as if whatever was zooming at high speed behind the cloud had casted its light onto the cloud--something which a shooting star is unlikely to do. I felt an odd sensation on the top of my head , almost like goosebumps or static electricity. I felt the need to run my fingers through my hair to make the feeling go away. I found this as odd, but passed it off as only a shooting star. However, the night after (tonight) I experienced something similar to the night before--only much closer...while walking along a sidestreet before getting to my home, I thought i heard an animal behind me, so i turned my head to take a cursory glance; almost half a kilometre away and a quarter kilometre above myself I saw a flash of light streaking across the sky horizontally, as if a firecracker went off; vibrant white, almost blinding. I could hear a hiss and a crackle (like a vinyl record player makes).  And again, that odd senstation occured--a static feeling on the top of my head followed by vibrations down throughout--stopping around my knees.  Though what is strikingly odd is how close it was to the ground and to myself.  I could hear it as well, so there is no mistaking the streak of light coming from within the earth&apos;s atmosphere.During my 3 years of walking during the night I have never seen anything like this--not to mention twice during two nights. I have seen a shooting star before several years ago, and I know enough to know that there must be another explanation for this. However, the sensations that have occured directly after the flashes were not caused by my inner body, as I have never felt this particular way ever before.", "I am a 45 year old ex teacher female the other person with me 24 manager female.cigar shape craft seen in sky above my garden clear night, very bright, silver in colour no flashing lights seen slowly heading east three aircraft seen coming from the south flashing red lights heading towards the cigar shape object object which seemed to hover as aircraft came in line the cigar shape object shot upwards and disapeared from sight.

As they rose, the three white objects stayed aligned with each other in a diagonal line, one silver to the left and and one silver to the right of the 3 white objects. While the two silver objects kept a little distance from the group, the three white objects would go from a straight line equal distances apart, like the famous star formation, to forming a triangle. They seemed to be drifting north and up and at one point i saw what looked like a bright orange airplane flying very close, just above or through,  the objects, it was about a millimeter long at arms length and the objects were like pinpoints. There were almost no clouds in the sky at this time and eventually the objects were too hard to see/follow. I thought it was weird that i could see the orange plane by the objects but couldn&apos;t really see the color of other planes that were much closer.", "Flashing Object Observed over Sonora, CA on Evening of June 4, 2005You recently received a report from Chris in Creston, North Carolina of a flashing object about two and a half hours before the event I&apos;m about to describe.

As my brother and I were watching the sky, a bright flashing object appeared directly overhead.  This object moved generally to the Northeast, but in an erratic manner, darting in different directions.  The object seemed to be made up of at least three lights in a triangular formation.

Directly overhead in the upper stratosphere we observed a satellite moving from west to east.  As the satellite disappeared from sight in the east, another brighter light (to the south of where the light had originated) was moving at a high rate of speed.  As the satellite disappeared from the east, an object from the southwest running parallel with the flat path of the satellite came across the sky at a high rate of speed.  Directly overhead the object made a right angle turn north for a few sconds, then another right angle turn to the east, then yet another right angle turn to the north, and yet finally  another right angle turn to the east on approximately the same flight plan as the satellite.

Then he looked up and said &quot;kinda like that?&quot;  I was amazed to see the same type of bright color-changing light that I saw in nearly the same area and same position in the sky as when I was young.  My friend lives about a block away from the house that I was in when I saw it the first time.  We stared for a long time and viewed many color change patterns.  We saw yellow, green, blue, red, purple, and white lights come from the object.  After looking for a few minutes, he ran inside and got binoculars and we looked closely to confirm that it wasn&apos;t a plane (I dismissed this idea immeadiately because it stayed in one spot in the sky for a long time) or a radio tower light.  Both possible explanations were impossible because planes only have one or two color blinking lights and it was not attached to a radio tower.  Soon after this, we spotted another color-changing light below and to the left of the first.  I saw what looked like fiery explosions coming from both of the objects and they moved in the sky, going from point to point and stopping rather than moving as a plane would.  We decided to go inside because we were afraid, but I kept checking to see if they were still there.  About ten minutes later, one of the objects had disappeared.  then, the other one left also, but possibly not for good.  I&apos;m not going to say either of the objects landed because I cannot confirm this next part.  My friend was pacing up and down the street when I heard a sound behind him.  It sounded like a car went speeding directly behind him at over 100 mph. This would be impossible as his house is in a position where no car could accelerate that quickly.  He asked &quot;Did you hear that?&quot; and &quot;Did you see anything behind me?&quot;  I did hear, but I did not see anything behind him.  He then told me that when he heard the sound, it felt like something ran directly behind him.  It was so close, he said, that he could feel the wind from it.  I have no idea if this second incident has anything to do with the lights in the sky, but it certainly made us believe that we were in the presence of something unsual.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD))", "I live in Sharsptown, a residential community located in the southwestern side of Houston, Texas. On Thursday, June 23rd 2005 at approximately 6:45 pm I noticed a very bright object in the southern sky traveling north to northwest at a very high rate of speed.I normally do not look up at the sky, but a pretty red cardinal caught my attention as it perched on a telephone wire in my backyard. I was wading in the swimming pool at the time and as I watched this bird I noticed a very tiny round or ball shaped object that looked like a typical star in illumination, but not as distinct because it was still daylight.The object was very tiny to the naked eye&mdash;no larger than the head of a shirt pin. Owing to its size, I presumed the object to be flying at a very high altitude&mdash;much higher than typical passenger jets that fly at 35,000 feet. The speed of the object I judged to be three to four times faster than passenger jets flying at this altitude. Usually when a passenger jet flies overhead at 35,000 feet or more you can watch them for a couple of minutes before they move out of your visual range. In the first twenty seconds I watched this object I believed it would move out of my visual range in less than one minute. At thirty seconds it changed to a westerly still maintaining its velocity and illumination which did not change. I lost sight of the object after 50 seconds as it faded into the brightness of the sun in the western sky. I experience a similar even in 1965 when I saw a similar object while living in the City of Orange near Santa Ana in southern California. This event was reported in The Register newspaper. At the time my father, a West Point graduate, was a lead aerospace engineer at North American working on Gemini space vehicle projects for NASA. I cannot say for certain what I saw over Houston, but as an ex military man I trust my instincts and whatever this objects was&mdash;it flew at a speed in excess on MACH I perhaps even MACH II.", "On 6-07-05 around 10:00pm there was a Jet going over head leaving a long trail at first I didnt think much of it, but I had my Camcord and the Jet was pretty far away so I tried to zoom in on it and to my surprise with the naked eye it looked like it had only 1 exhast, but when I zoom in it showed 2 with a blinker in the center that,s what it look like. While I was watching it go South to North along the West coast I saw a little object fly behind the Jet or Plane going up at around a 45degree angle and it was out of view in around 5 secounds while the Jet or Plane was still there for another 20 seconds or so,it was still going North West. I do have it on my Camcord.", "Green object on memorial day in the NJ skiesIt was around 1:30 PM, while sitting in my back yard under a clear beautiful blue sky on Memorial Day afternoon, my sister in-law and my husband called me outside to see what looked to be a round shaped, almost  neon green  colored object that changed shape from round to oval in about a minute and dissapeared into the clouds. I was just wondering if there were other reports around my neighborhood at the same time.", "NOT a sattelite.I was standing outside smoking a cigarette and watching the sky when I noticed what I thought was a sattelite.  Usually when I spot these I like to follow them across the sky, so as I was doing so I noticed it&apos;s trajectory wasn&apos;t straight.  Just as I was questioning this I raised my arm up to form a straight line of what should have been the trajectory if it were a sattelite.  When I did this I watched it turn about 45 degrees from what should have been it&apos;s straight line orbit.  As I took note of this I lowered my arm, and when I was done lowering my arm the object was then gone.  I checked the sky for a few more seconds for cloud cover, but there was none it was perfectly clear.", "BUBBLE IN THE SKYCraft was non-physical by metalic means. Appeared sphere-like shaped and composed of gas. Craft wobbled in diagnal form, slow pace towards my direction as I sat waiting for the bus in Orlando Florida&apos;s Unversity Blvd/Semoran Blvd intersection. As craft/object moved across the sky (about 6-9 building stories high), I could see a source of heat towards the back but no metals could be spotted. Object retained characteristics (skin) of the sky so it actually appeared like a bubble through the sky reflecting the sky.((NUFOR Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

As it moved at times the light was behind the object and I could see that it appeared to be a sphere with light behind it. It stayed in close proximity to where we first saw it and it never moved very quickly but it definitely moved while other objects in the night sky remained stationery. We watched it for over an hour then went on to bed. The next night June 8th we looked for it beginning about 2130 and didn&apos;t see anything, we checked again at 2300 and it was back in pretty much the same location as the previous night. We called my parents age 70 and 71 who live next door and they were able to see it. My daughters boyfriend age 16 who lives one mile west of it was also able to see it.I have lived on the same property most of my life and my Mother has lived on the property for 71 years.

I had just gotten off the highway.  As I traveled on the winding  back road, off to my left In the distance, I noticed a bright light low in the sky. My first thought was that it was a helicopter.  As I traveled along, I noticed it was going in the same direction as I was,West. I thought It was strange because it was very bright, and not very high in the sky.  I then thought, it must be a helicopter searching for someone.  I lost sight of it behind the trees on the winding road.  about 30 seconds later ,right in front of me just above the tree line I saw a triange shape craft with red and green lights underneath.  I stoped the car, because I could not beleive what I was seeing. It looked like a stealth, but was moving at a crawling speed.  I remember saying to myself it&apos;s not making any noise like plane.  I downed the car window to see if I could hear any noise coming from it , but I heard nothing.  It moved very slow and silent just above the trees toward the northeast.  I wanted to tell someone what I had seen but kept it to myself, because I knew they would think I was crazy.  that  was a little over a month ago.  Then I was on my way home from work again and heard a radio talk show on UFO&apos;s decribe exactly what I had seen.  I was bothered by it so much that I told my daughter and son-in-law. They searched for flying triangles on the internet and found your websight.  We couldn&apos;t beleive that what I had described to them was not only a true UFO sighting, but also had been seen by many others.  My son-in-law said that you had a UFO reporting center to help track sightings.  I decided to send you a report of my sighting. I hope it helps to find out what these flying triangles are.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.

We were driving on Arenal Rd West toward Rio Grande High School. When up ahead I noticed a bright spot light under what I thought was a helocopter. Alot of police helocopters hover over the area looking for criminals. I live a few blocks away and was wondering if they were looking for anyone I knew. As we approached the high school we noticed it wasnt a helocopter at all. It was a triangular object about 30 long and ten feet high. It hovered next to a street light in the high school parking lot. I immediately stopped the car and starred in amazement. It wobbled in the air next to the street light like it was about to crash. The wobbling reminded me of model held in the middle by a string. My girlfriend and her sister were very scared as they noticed it wasnt a helocopter at all. The object was about 50 feet away and about 30 feet off the ground, so we got a good view of the object. A few other cars had stopped and watched as well. The object had three small lights at each corner and a bright spot light under it which did not move all thought the craft was wobbling. We watched for about 10 minutes and then the object became stable and moved slowly and silently to the SE over trees and houses. Im sure someone saw the spot light over their homes as the object flew only feet above their houses. We stood and watched untill the object was half a mile away, when we drove after it. We folled it for a mile and the the object dissappeared. I immeadiately called the local news stations who said no one reported anything and I was crazy. Im not crazy and neither are my girlfriend and her sister.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.

I looked up into the sky to look at the Big Dipper and after looking at it for a few seconds I noticed a grey circle floating in the sky. It was the size of a pencil&apos;s eraser. Anyway, it was gliding across the sky in a perfect straight line, no wiggling at all, very steady, and at a constant speed.  I would also say that it was stayed at a continuous height because it didn&apos;t get smaller or larger while it moved. There was also no sound at all. It was completely silent. So I tried to show it to my grandfather but his eyesight isn&apos;t that great.  Then I banged on my brother&apos;s window to get him to come outside and bring me my binoculars. He came out but he was impatient and didn&apos;t see anything.  By this time it was going behind my roof so I decided to move in between my house and my next door neighbor&apos;s house to continue to watch it. Unfortunately, I lost it. I knew that it was NOT a bird because I&apos;ve seen birds at night before. And it was definitely NOT a plane because there were no lights whatsoever. I really wish I had had my binoculars!", "Bright, White ,Totally Silent Light  filmed in Portage.Me and a friend were out fishing on the Wisconsin River right outside of Portage.  It started out to be a cloudy night, but cleared up around 21:30.  The stars were very clear and bright.  We saw about four satellites right away.  We also saw a nice iridium flare which lasted about 5 seconds.  There was also alot of air traffic.  About 45 minutes later we saw a completly silent light; twice as big and twice as bright as any other star or planet.  It moved from horizon to horizon west to east in less than two minutes.  It moved alot faster than the rest of the visible air traffic.  There were no red blinking lights or strobe lights whatsoever on it.  You could clearly see all the other planes strobes and blinking red lights.  It also seemed alot lower, and closer to us than any other plane in the sky.  It was completly silent.  We could hear the other planes clearly.  I managed to get about 45 seconds of video of it; the video is kind of shaky because I did&apos;nt have a tripod; but there is a pretty still part that shows the backround stars for a speed and altitude comparison.  I also filmed some other planes to show how easy it is to see the strobes through a digital camcorder.", "Unknown stationary  shiny sphereOn thursday may 19 2005 approximitly 0600 , We all witness a silver shiny sphere about NW of the airport.

The amount of lights were 5. The object was hovering at a stagnant nature about 70- 80 feet above the street. The lights seemed to be 10 feet in diametar (all the same size) considering the distance we observed it from. Becasue there was no sound admitted from the craft we knew that it was not any flying object we were familiar with. We were not too far from the center of the city, so we assume that many others saw it. We now regret that we didn&apos;t stop the car to observe the craft for a longer amount of time.

The guys decided to do &quot;intermission&quot; about 9:45pm so they could get some water, and the kids could get something to drink.  My friends&apos; husband said &quot;That bad boy is moving&quot;..we all looked up and thought at first we were seeing a satellite or something.  It looked almost like a star it was so small and far away.  Then we realized, with it being that far away, it was REALLY moving fast.  It was coming from the North traveling toward the South.  We talked about it being a rocket of some sort because it was moving too fast for a satellite.  A few times we thought it zig-zagged a little, but, basically went in a straight line.  It was fairly close to a bright blinking star, and we noticed another one coming straight toward it from the south, we thought they were going to collide. Then, the first one we saw immediately stopped, the one moving from the south darted around the first one, that seemed to be when all of us went into shock.  At that point, NONE of us were sure about what we were really watching. None of us had ever seen anything stop so fast.  We watched the one that was traveling from the south move in approximately the same path to the north the first one from the north had traveled going south. When it got just about directly overhead, we noticed another tiny star/light moving in about the same speed coming from the west.  One of the neighbors started shooting fireworks, and we lost sight of the 3rd one, but, watched the one that was still traveling north until we couldn&apos;t see it anymore.  None of us drink, and we all knew if ALL of us had seen this we weren&apos;t all crazy.  Since I haven&apos;t ever really thought one way or another about life outside of ours, I decided today to see if I could find anything that would explain what we saw.  So far I haven&apos;t, but, am VERY curious about any suggestions of what we have seen.", "Four lights witnessed in West Weber countyWere heading north on I-15 in Layton and witnessed 4 lights in the north west horizon about 5 miles away two of which had disappered.  We continued to follow the other two lights one was bright and the other small.  The big light kept blinking different colors and the small one was moving parallel to the big one.   Over time they both slowly lowered into the horizon until they eventually disappeared.

There is lots of airplane activity over our house, as we are directly under a major flight pattern coming from JFK airport.  I always like looking up at the planes, especially when they are lower.At about 7:35pm, a plane flew directly overhead.  As I looked up to watch it, I saw what I first thought to be a star. The plane flew past, but I kept looking at this light.   My wife saw it too.  It was still very light out, and this star would have to have been very bright. After a few seconds, we noticed that it started moving towards the east.  At first, my wife thought it may be a balloon very high up, but it was moving too slow and too uniformly to be a balloon blown around by the winds. After about 3 minutes of very slow movement, the object stopped.  During the time it was moving, my wife ran inside real quick to get the digital camera.  She also witnessed it begin to move, and then stop moving.  Once it stopped, I took the camera, and tried to get a picture of it.  As I was training the camera on the object, it basically vanished.  We didn&apos;t see it zoom off, it just stopped being there.My wife is a bit of a skeptic, but even she thought it was weird looking.  She keeps saying it could have been a balloon, but she seems to be trying to convince herself more than me.  I&apos;m still not sure what it was, but it had the brightness and look of a star, but it didn&apos;t twinkle.  It was stationary, moved to the east slowly and in a straight line, and then stopped again, before disappearing.  By 7:40 it was gone (according to timestamp on the camera). I did take 3 pictures of the sky, but the object was gone at that point.  I thought a viwe of the sky might pick it up, even if I couldn&apos;t see it anymore (if it had moved to another location quickly).

I immediately said &quot;look at that&quot; and pointed to it. He did not see it as it lasted only 5 seconds,however I clearly saw this thing. It was a football shape with what looked like wings or some sort of appendages. It seemed to be self lit and gave off a pinkish light. It seemed to be translucent and I could see the &quot;wings&quot; vibrating very fast. It traveled in a straight line and did not deviate. It disappeared by vanishing.The next morning we looked at the newest crop circle from Silbury Hill in the UK. The formation was discovered on 7/9 and was remarkably similar in shape to the thing that I had seen. I belong to a group that researches crop circles here in the midwest so this was significant to me. Also there is a similar report on the Rense program. Itwas  on 7/6 at 1;30 am from his yard.

It was almost as though time had stood still for some others moved very slowly. The craft was the typical flying saucer shape it had portholes all around the centre and a blueish neon light came from under it, the portholes were bright as though a bright light was on i could see some of the windows looked darker than others, i thought someone was watching us. The disc then seemed to disappear but when i looked far into the distance i could see it. I looked at my boyfriend and asked him if he saw that, he said what, i looked at my friend and said did You see that she said yes.

That is how the teardrop type shape was seen.The object was rotating counter-clockwise on what appeared to be an asymmetrical axis at about 1 revolution every 3 or 4 seconds.  The revolutions and latteral speed were constant.  Though the defining lines of the object could not be seen clearly, I got a distinct view of the underside as I described it.I called my step-daughter out to see it but the only view of it that she briefly saw was a rotation seen in the distance as it left our field of vision.  Not nearly as clear as my view had been during the duration that I experienced.I wish I had my camera.  This would have made an incredible video- the likes of which I have never seen.

I was on the tail end of a cloudy sky (above me and to the East were clouds, a clear sky coming in from the west). Directly over my head, I saw a sphere moving under the clouds horizontal to the earth. The sphere was a translucent orange. I stood up immediately wondering what it was. My first thought was that some kid must have lost a balloon, but soon realized the object was traveling far too fast and in a strait line. I later determined with a compass it was traveling in the direction of 135 degrees SE. I watched it until it faded out of site on the far side of the horizon which took only a few seconds. I could see other planes in the sky at various altitudes. All were much slower than the sphere. It must have been traveling at a very high rate of speed. I stood out there on the patio trying to figure out what I had just witnessed and continued gazing up in the sky (this time looking for orange&apos;ish spheres). About 5 minutes after the first sphere, a 2nd sphere was spotted. This sphere was not directing overhead, but a distance to my East (maybe a mile). It also was traveling in the same direction as the first sphere and at the same apparent speed (same color). There was no sound at all. I continued looking up in the sky for the next hour, but no other sphere was seen. This is the first time I&apos;ve ever witnessed anything like this. Wouldn&apos;t believe it if I had not seen it for myself. These sphere&apos;s were definately &quot;not&quot; man-made.

Myself and two of my friends were at a campsite deep in the mountains in Suches Georgia. The campsite is located along an old dirt road called Old 41 that wonders through the southern appalachians. We were literally miles away from any other people. It was a quiet, clear night.  We first noticed something strange when we saw a brief flash of light that lit up the canopy of trees around us.  It almost seemed like lightning.  There was no following thunder.  All three of us noticed right away that the skies were completely clear.  About twenty seconds later as my companions and I pondered and verbally discussed the source of the mysterious flash of light.  A triangular shaped craft flew directly over head at an amazing speed. The craft must have only been about fifty to one hundred feet over the tops of the trees.  At that speed and altitude, a pilot in a coventional plane would of had to be insane.  The object hissed as it passed by.  There was no other sound. The object projected a sharp bright light (similar in brightness and color to a halogen spotlight) towards the ground and lit up every thing within my sight as it passed over.  The light was being emmitted from an area about 10 of 15 feet in diameter from the bottem center of the craft.  I think there might have been smaller more faint lights around the edges of the craft.  The &quot;fly-by&quot; only lasted a split second. After the craft passed the wind picked up and lasted a minute or two.

We were walking on a residential city block, in a populated area of town, near a couple of busy intersections.  I noticed two planes in the sky at the time.  One possibly private, coming from the east and closer to us, and one possibly commercial, coming up from the south west onto the scene slightly later, as the object was descending.We first noticed the object coming from south to north for several minutes.  It was moving very slowly. It made no noise, had no aura or beams projecting from it, and left no trail. It looked the shape of a round bowl covered with a top that had a small &quot;cabin&quot; area in the middle center of it. It was very large, appearing to be maybe the size of a large house.  It was uniformly and completely lumninous, as bright as the moon, but much whiter. (The moon came up over the trees about 15 minutes later, from the east, and was yellow.) The object then hovered for a couple of minutes, them &quot;wobbled&quot; a little,  giving the impression that it was turning.  I became aware of a very small white light, steadily shining, on the object&apos;s &quot;east side.&quot; The object started moving eastward a short distance.

My older brother and I were playing outside at the railroad tracks behind my Grandmother&apos;s house in the country. I remember it being very warm, and sunny that day. I don&apos;t recall who saw them first, but we stood there and watched in wonder. I was watching Unexplained Mysteries, Destination Earth today, and found out what we saw were rare, and called cluster UFO;s. At first it looked like one large craft with seperate, circular, bright red lights. It made no sound. They seemed to be following the railroad tracks at a slow speed. &quot;It&quot; then stopped, and hovered for a time. Then, to our amazement, it broke apart, and all but approx. 6 crafts sped off at high speed. Each of those that sped off didn&apos;t travel far because we could see them.  All once they stopped. The main group remained hovering in it&apos;s original spot. The crafts that sped off, and stopped abrubtly, also hovered for a short period of time, and then sped just a quickly, all in unison, back to the main group. This &quot;dance&quot; continued for a couple more times, and then began to move together at a slow speed, getting closer to us. I don&apos;t know how my Grandmother became aware of what we were watching, but she began yelling for us in a panicked voice to come into the house immediately. I don&apos;t recall how long she yelled for us, but we were mesmorized, and didn&apos;t move. The next thing I remember, my Grandmother came running for us, grabbed us, and ran panicked back into the house. She locked the doors, and then called my Aunt who lived 1/8 of a mile away, as well as an Uncle who lived the same distance away. All had children, and to listen to my Grandmother talking on the phone, it was obvious that everyone also saw what we were watching. We were not frightened in any way, but the adults were very frightened. I have no idea how long they stayed, how long they performed their &quot;dance&quot;, or where they went from there.

Many F-16 style jet fighters could be seen in our skies over those days. &quot;Most&quot; aircraft fly from west to east or east to west across the Rockford skies, it is very odd to see them fly in any other direction unless they are flying low to land at our very own airport.A few days into the 911 event, I was standing on my front deck and noticed a few lights in the distance to the south flying north. I figured it was military jets scouting our skies. I was half right. As the lights came closer (actually passing over my house to the north)I could see the objects very clearly. The chase plane was a military jet, I believe it was an F-16. The lead craft flying directly in front of teh jet was a &quot;ball of fire&quot; a little larger than the jet.

It came out of the southwest and moved in a northeast direction. It appeared to maintain level flight and constant speed throughout the sighting which lasted approximately 8-10 seconds. It appeared to be the size of a BB at arm&apos;s length. It was first viewed at 90 degrees elevation (overhead) then moved across the sky to the northeast to approximately 15-20 degrees elevation before disappearing behind a treeline. As I observed this sphere, I noticed it was below the clouds which were at 25,000 feet altitude (checked with The Weather Channel immediately after sighting). I estimate it was not far below the clouds, but can&apos;t be certain. There was no noise and no vapor trail. The object was comparable in apparent speed and flight as that of a satellite when seen at night. The speed seemed very fast, though.  At first, I thought it might be a bird or aircraft.  However, the unwavering direction of flight and rate of speed ruled out these possibilities. In addition, after the sighting, I was able to observe birds at high elevation and planes below and above the clouds.  All of these were clearly distinguishable for what they were. I also suspected a balloon, since I determined the wind was SSW at 12 mph (also from the Weather Channel).  However, the speed was simply too fast for a balloon. If I wasn&apos;t looking at that specific portion of the sky at that exact time, I wouldn&apos;t have even noticed it.((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Mr. Dave Marler, State Director of Illinois/MUFON, for sharing his sighting report with NUFORC.

Traveling east.  Didn&apos;t have any flashing lights.  Their was a full moon, I was facing the full moon observing an aircraft traveling in the same direction. The aircraft and the object could be seen at the same time.  They were perhaps 45 degrees apart from my position. The aircraft did have a beacon.  The object was moving slowly compare the to aircraft.  I wanted to observe it as it crossed the path between me and the Moon, but sense it was moving to slowly, I decided to wait untill it crossed the Moon.  I thought that perhaps I could see it&apos;s siloate against the Moon.  So, I resumed my observation of the aircraft.  And competely forgot about the object.  When I remembered, I looked in the direction of where it would be given it&apos;s speed.  But, I didn&apos;t find it.  So, I searched the sky.  Nothing.  So, I decided to observe the Moon.  It was larger this time of the year and I could see a lot of detail.  But, as I was watching the exact center began to brighten. I realized then that it was the object I was observing earlier.  It was not only coming in my direction, but coming at an angle toward me.  As it approached, the one light, became two.(like a car coming toward you) There was no sound coming from it, even when I first sited it, though I could clearly hear the aircraft. I then became excited and ran to the rear of my house to the back door to call my siblings out to see it.

On old Hwy 64 a half mile from the intersection of old and new 64.  We returned to the front of the house.  By that time it was clearing the three pine trees.  One of which was maybe 50 ft tall. The base is about 4ft in diameter.  It was maybe 60ft above that tree. It came to a stop above the front yard.  It was hard to see,  It almost blended perfectly with the night sky, though it had lights on each side, the lights didn&apos;t illuminate the craft.  If it wasn&apos;t for stary background of the sky, I wouldn&apos;t know it shape.  And the full moon didn&apos;t help.  My decision to call my family out, was a poor one.  They began to scream at it.   And soon, lights started to come on in the neighboring houses.  At that time the object rotated west, and began to slowly move away picking up speed.  I followed on the road which parolelled it&apos;s path.  I followed to the limits of our street lights, too scared to go beyond. There is farm land across the road in front of my house. Which allowed me to observe without obstructions. The craft looked to be about 30-35ft in diameter.  I was at the time intersted in science and technology.  And read and viewed many books on aircraft. And read a few books on astronomy.  There are two other events, I&apos;ll list them later.  My cousin had a close encounter of the third kind.

There was a steady white light from the center and I also noticed as it traveled across my view (from west to east) twice a sort of light purple wave (sort of like a corona) flash away in different directions from the craft.  It made no sound that I could hear but my dog could obviously hear it.  It was seemingly pretty high (mile???) but it&apos;s shape was still obvious so it must have been pretty large (guess of more than 100&apos; from tip to tip??)

Last Friday night at about 2AM my dog bogee got my attention by wanting to go out. So i got off the couch and walked to the back door to let him out. As soon as he hit the ground, he bolted towards the far backyard as if after something.(Our backyard is completely fenced in except on one corner of the house) I looked out ahead of him to maybe spot our cat, a stray cat, or some other kind of night animal. There is an old storage shed in the back yard about 25 feet from our back door. Behind it on the next street over is a streetlight. For a split second my eyes focused on something running along the inside of the fence towards the back of the shed. As it vanished behind the shed, bogee turned the corner to the shed RIGHT after the animal, and began to bark violently as if he has cornered something (he has done this countless times with the local cats)At this point I figure it&apos;s a racoon, at the MOST a stray dog. Bogee is a shitz-zeu? Anyway you get my point. He&apos;s small. so I go running out to make sure what ever it is, it doesn&apos;t begin attacking him. After about 15 feet I begin to hear the sound of something REALLY wanting to get through a chain-link fence by slamming into it over and over. As a round the corner bogee is standing at this end of the lane, (The back of the shed sits inside the fence about 2 1/2 feet so there is a small lane about 15 feet long that ends with blackberry bushes then the turn of the connecting fence.) and the animal was at the other end. It seemed to be tangled in the blackberry bush pretty good because it had stopped trying to go through the fence and became still. The streetlight from the other street helped me make out something. I could see what my mind told me was I guess skin. The animal was &quot;breathing&quot; with quick rasping gasps. And this &quot;skin&quot; rose and fell with these sounds. It was very reflective, as if wet, so I cant say what color it was. SO at this point I&apos;m kinda getting freaked out,so I squat down to lay my hand on bogee&apos;s back to quiet him down. At that moment the thing decides to bolt. But it doesn&apos;t come towards me (which in turn would make me scream like a woman) but takes a run at the back fence and slams into it. Now listen to this. It uses the recoil of the fence to jump up to the roof of the shed and scramble onto the shingles. YES, I was taking a few steps back. About 20. When, I started to dry heave. Alot. NOW I&apos;m scared.Bogee begins to howl as I run back towards the house. My eyes are watering so my vision is blured, but I dont smell or hear anything odd. (Well, except for me unexplainable puking my guts out in my backyard.) In between heaving i raise up and catch a glimps of it jumping from my shed&apos;s roof to my neighbor&apos;s shed roof. Not a long jump, about 6 feet wide, except his shed is a two story! It landed on the ROOF! It scurried over the top and was gone. I continued to gag for about 4 or 5 mins. As I made my way to the door I heard, felt? I low thooming, like thunder underground, that lasted maybe 2 seconds? then I was inside and closing the door. (yes I made sure bogee was with me) If I had to guess on the size and weight of the animal in question I would say anywhere from 50 to 65 lbs. As the size I can&apos;t actually say. I never really got a good like at it. But if I had to guess a size or shape I would say it was pretty close to a large chimp. Actually I think to this day that is what I saw. What else could it be? Yeah I know, the puking. I can&apos;t explain that. Probably never will. I never tell people about it, this is South Carolina.

BOURNEMOUTH, UKdont know if this will be of any interest to you.I have been fasinated by the subject of U.F.O.s since i was a small child, im 24 now. Around october time of 2003 i happened to have a sighting. It was probably around 9pm -9:30. I was walking back from the shops to the block of flats where i lived with my mother at the time, when an egg shaped object flew above me. It moved without sound, point forwards, with a tail of light (maybe as long as the craft itself), south-east-south over the road and disapeared above the flats where i lived. There are a number of variables that make this sighting hard to describe. Its speed, i suppose, could be comparable to the speed of a jet plane when viewed from the ground, namely very slow but if this thing was flying at the same height as a plane then it was about the size of a football feild. You see the problem. If i make a guess at size, speed, or altitude then all other factors have to change accordingly. Added to this is the fact that it happened two years ago and it was a clear night (no clouds = no frame of referance). If i had to guess though i would say it was moving at around ten miles an hour and was the size of a school bus, maybe 75ft high. My second problem is in actualy describing the object itself. As i have already said it was egg shapped flying silently point forwards with a tail of light following behind it. It was the way it was lit that is hard to describe. It was seemingly lit from with, white/orange and white/yellow but it was not transparent. Maybe a better description would be than it seemed to be superheated.Its my opinion that most of us, even those who want to believe are completely grounded in reality and not realy well equiped to deal with events dubbed paranormal. I dont mean to say that we panic but that we have a hard time with acceptance. maybe thats just me. As a result i have spent the last two years half doubting what i saw. You have to wonder how many people experience such things yet dont report them out of just such scepticism or fear of ridicule. Luckily i have faced no ridicule but i have faced incredulity from the people i have told. I cant blame them for this, i doubted myself after all.This morning came like a wakeupcall. What i saw was no conventional aircraft, it was not swampgass, venus, or streetlight reflecting of duck buts and pardon the expression but if that was a comet or meteor then we would all be fucked right now. What i saw was something else.In the spirit of exploration i have spent this morning surfing the net trying to find similar accounts. Incidently my mother is going to go nuts.

At around 12:15 I noticed a &apos;&apos;star&apos;&apos; I thought was different. At first glance I thought there was a good chance it was Venus. I have no idea what planets are visible right now. I began looking at other stars, but I always came back to check on the &quot;planet-star&quot;.

It was the exact same size and brightness, and color (white light gleaming with a slight green). When I got out of the pool to look at it, it was gone and I could not see it at all in the sky.

I&apos;d had a very strange dream that had woken me up. I turned on the light in my bedroom and lay there getting my wits about me.  I then got up  and went downstairs to use the bathroom and to get a drink of water. As I passed through the dining room in the dark, I glanced out the windows and saw a bright blinking white light about 100-150 feet over the road.  I continued into the kitchen, then bathroom. When I came out, I stopped and got a drink of water out of the refrigerator.  As I walked back through the dining room, I glanced out of the windows again and walked to the window to get a better look at the blinking light that was still there and saw the light moving from over the road towards the field between my house and my neighbor&apos;s. I stood there for a minute or two trying to figure out what it was when these blue bubble-like spheres began to fall from the light towards the ground in the field about 200 ft. from the house.  They seemed to tumble down and then sort of float a little way before landing on the ground.  They glowed bluish with a gold-like color interior, sort of translucent.  I think that about twelve or fifteen had fallen before I became very agitated as to what to do about it.  I then ran back into the kitchen and out into the enclosed porch off the kitchen facing them and turned on the outside lights on the porch roof that shown in the direction of the field. As I returned to the dining room windows (I looked at the kitchen clock and it was 11:22 p.m.) to see if I could see anymore of the bubbles or the blinking lights and I could see nothing.  I left on my outside lights all night long and didn&apos;t go to sleep until about 3:30 A.M  The next morning I walked the field but could find no evidence of what I had seen the night before. I have seen several strange things in  the sky here for several years now, but nothing as up close as this. I am a professional person and am very sensible, with a sound mind.   This incident was just too strange, even in light of the last several years&apos; sightings, some of which I have reported to you. Many I have not, though. The night was dead calm.  VERY HOT.

I was standing outside of the little barracks hut around 0300 hours awaiting the arrival of the motor pool to transport me to the flight line for a 0600 departure.  As I stood there waiting for the motor pool to arrive, I saw in the distance what I thought was an aircaft coming in to the base for a landing.  Usually, I would not have taken much notice of this because I had seen many different aircraft night landings.  But because this aircraft (object) had what I thought was a larger than normal white landing light, and was approaching the runway at an unusually slow speeed and wavering in such a manner as if though it were flying through a rough air pocket, I began to take notice of its approach.  Also, I could not hear any sound coming from the its engine.  I was certain that this aircraft was going to crash before it could land. My first reaction was that this object was a helicopter, and the helicopter had lost engine power and was trying to make the runway to land.  But, as the object appeared over the runway, it just stopped completely in mid air and didin&apos;t move for what seemed like two to three minutes.  The bright light was still shinning but I still could not hear any sound from the engine. All of a sudden, the object started bouncing up and down like a bouncing ball.  This bouncing lasted for about 5 seconds.  Then the object stopped bouncing and became stationary for about two seconds.  And, in another split second the object hurled itself about about 25 yards to its left and began bouncing up and down again for another five seconds.  The object then again stopped bouncing and remained stationary for about two seconds.  And again, in a split second, hurled itself seemingly back to where it had stopped in the beginning, and began again bouncing up and down.  But this time as the object bounced, it seemed to stop abruptly in mid-bounce (as if it had just noticed that I was watching it), and in another split second shot upwards into the atmosphere as if it had been shot out of a cannon.  It ascended upwards at maybe a 50 or 60 degree angle and at a speed faster than any aircraft I had ever seen before. I stood there for approximately three or four minutes and watched the bright light on this object ascend into the atmosphere and grow smaller and smaller until it became smaller than the few stars that were in the sky and finally disappearing from my view.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.

As this ball passed, it displayed a dimming and brightening quality,somewhat like a slow pulsing, and also had a slightly visible &quot;vapor trail&quot; following behind it, just as normally seen on the edges of fast moving jets. My stepson started to become concerned as i was about to explain to myself and him that it was most likely a falling star, and not a firework, as I have never seen a firework to originate from above and fall down at such kind of a trajectory.Although it did seem at first to look much like a fireball falling in from space, we never heard any noise whatsoever, and just before it passed to our north and continued descending below the visible line of our site,a smaller red ball suddenly, and very quickly,seemed to fly straight down,at no angle whatsoever from the larger ball and disappeared to the east and upwards within seconds.At this point physical laws and simple logical thought has to completely dismiss the possibility of any firework or falling star possibility.  I feel the real possibility that we have witnessed a disabled craft of some sort just before crashing, and never have seen any report to that effect, although many had to witness this event as it was on a very busy night of people outside during this event, and over top of a very busy highway.", "Until you see one it is hard to believeI had a conversation with a man who was showing a bar maid some pictures...

The rectangle was flying with the long sides leading and trailing. There was absolutely no sound, identifying features, or lights. Since it was just a black rectangle in silhouette it is extremely difficult to estimate the size of the object or the altitude. But I believe it was a large object that was quite high.

I was looking at the sky when I suddenly noticed a strange flying thing. It was definitely very far away, because I could only see a small circle moving quite fast from north west to east or south east. It couldn&apos;t be an airplane, because there was no sound, and it was too high. Moreover no planes fly that way. If u&apos;d look to the map, u would see that Kaunas is in the centre of Lithuania, and Vilnius, a capital, is in the east. So the biggest part of airplanes fly from east to west(and vice versa), or, if airplanes just cross Lithuania, they have to go from north to south. My father said it could have been a sattelite, although it was day and the sun was shining.

I used the biggest zoom (3X optical + 4X digital) to capture the object, so the quality isn&apos;t very good. It could look like a cloud to You, but I can asure You that it was much smaller and it was moving constantly and very fast. I could see it for 20-30 seconds, and then it hid over the clouds (which means it was moving higher than clouds)  Probably I was the only one witness, although there were 20-30 people some 100 metres away.

We have many airplanes (small ones, and big passenger jets) passing Kaunas, and I know how they look and sound like, so it couldn&apos;t have been an airplane.

I live in the NW area of Ocala FL and the lights were clearly west and south of my house. Honestly, I feel a little silly telling this, but it was quite amazing to witness: The four white circles flew in bizarre, clearly geometric patterns, seeming to &quot;smack&quot; together and become one larger ball of light and immediately disperse into four separat balls of light. It was like a dance--a square dance, one might say--where the four couples turn and return.  I couldn&apos;t believe my eyes and looked for a ground source of light, but there was none. The sky was clear, and it was easy to see them.  They flew in ways no normal craft can fly, faster than I can describe, stopping cold and turning back over and over again. Another metaphor I might use to describe this is to picture them as large white billiard balls smacking together and breaking into varied patterns, stopping, turning back and smacking together again.  There was absolutely no sound at all, just light. I watched them for about half an hour.  I realized I should perhaps be frightened of this odd sighting, but curiously, I felt elated; they seemed joyful somehow.

Said event occurred at extremely close range. This prompted the witnesses to locate and call a UFO investigator directly from the scene once the event terminated.  LOCATION   The precise location of this event is being described in a slightly vague manner. Certain factors dictate that we keep secure the exact location in order to protect the privacy of certain community facilities and nearby persons. The below described events occurred in RURAL ORANGE COUNTY, just north of ORLANDO FLORIDA &nbsp; The body of water described below is a typical small Florida freshwater lake with the attendant subtropical &quot;bushland&quot; growth in the area. This terrain DOES contain a number of alligators and snakes.  BACKGROUND   The Georgia UFO Group (GUFOG) sponsors a &quot;UFO Hotline&quot; for all of Georgia. On 22April05 at about 10:55PM, the GUFOG line received a phone call from rural ORANGE COUNTY FLORIDA. Tom Sheets of GUFOG answered the call and spoke with the complainant who identified himself completely and without hesitation, also providing his cell phone number. The caller was found to be the Primary Witness (PW), a 19YOA Orange County area resident. He sounded excited (but maintaining control) and related that he and two of his friends were currently at a local lake where they&apos;d been fishing since earlier in the evening. PW stated that about 15 minutes prior, he and his two associates had encountered at close range, a glowing round light that was so astounding the three of them concluded that a report MUST be made to someone and ASAP. The PW asked the 411 operator for contact information on UFO investigators.......&quot;ANY UFO INVESTIGATORS&quot;, thus the GUFOG Hotline was contacted. Thereafter, Tom Sheets referred the case on to Roberta Puhalski in Lakeland. Puhalski is the founder of the Central Florida UFO Group, and herself a colleague of numerous investigators in Georgia as well as other states.  The facts in this case were gathered by both investigators; Sheets conducting administrative chores at long range, with the field work and interviews falling to Puhalski and the Florida group. Sheets took the original phone call, plus conducted subsequent verifying phone conversations with the PW, and provided other consultation in this matter. Then Puhalski continued with additional phone conversations, leading up to her 24April05 meeting with all three witnesses at the scene of the occurrence.  EVENT DETAILS   As previously indicated, this party of anglers had been out since earlier in the evening, at this, their personal favorite fishing spot used for several years. (As far as the witnesses know, nothing unusual had ever been observed in this immediate area prior to 22April05). The PW&nbsp;stated that they were carrying Mag-Lites for illumination (heavy duty law enforcement-style flashlights), and were wary of the numerous alligators known to infest this sub-tropical area. At this point, witnesses observed what was first thought to be an animal&apos;s eye shining with reflected light i.e. an alligator&apos;s eye off in the bushes and undergrowth about 20 yards away. Suddenly it became apparent that this WAS NOT the case, as a ROUND, ORANGISH-RED, DIMLY GLOWING ORB-LIKE LIGHT, ABOUT THE SIZE OF A BASKETBALL (+) suddenly rose up into PLAIN VIEW ABOUT 20 YARDS AWAY. This round light continued UPWARDS AT A FAST RATE OF SPEED, described by witnesses as being perhaps 200MPH or almost FASTER THAN THE EYE COULD FOLLOW (at that close range). It was SILENT, and appeared to be SUBSTANTIAL in it&apos;s emission of light. Upon reaching about 150 feet in altitude, it hovered, then moved SIDEWAYS perhaps about 100 feet, then back DOWNWARDS, and then SIDEWAYS again, TRACING something like a TRIANGLE in it&apos;s flight path.This glowing light was ALSO described as possibly being ATTACHED to some sort of SOLID OBJECT OF UNKNOWN SHAPE that was DIFFICULT TO SEE as it was not emitting any LIGHT or GLOW i.e. the impression that this SOLID SHADOWY MASS was BEHIND the glowing light and as stated, moving extremely fast. This object/light eventually flew off behind the adjacent trees and vanished. ALL witnesses were impressed by the AMAZING SPEED demonstrated by this object at such CLOSE RANGE. The witnesses made unsuccessful attempts to relocate it, then called 411, and then the GUFOG Hotline.  INVESTIGATOR&apos;S COMMENTS   Tom Sheets indicates that the PW seemed very sincere during the initial phone conversation, with no reservations about providing continued cooperation. This party of young fishermen (senior teens) was obviously STILL searching the event area when the first conversation with GUFOG took place via cell phone. Additionally, after subsequent conversations, the 19 YOA PW seemed to impress Sheets as being more &quot;on the ball&quot; than the average older teenager, conversing on a mature level.  Roberta Puhalski went to great lengths in setting up the 24April05 witness interviews and the physical inspection of the event site. Puhalski received full cooperation from the three witnesses, each providing additional information in separate writings, along with their signatures. The event site being in rural ORANGE COUNTY, a sort of brief &quot;bush trek&quot; (!) was necessary for Puhalski and the witnesses to arrive at the lake shore.She conducted a thorough witness debriefing, which included a physical &quot;walk-through&quot; of the occurrence, along with supporting photographs.Puhalski maintains that these young men are credible witnesses, citing their body language and tendency to look her directly in the eyes when giving their account. Furthermore, witnesses were VERY forthright in their statements, using open handed gestures, as the details of what occurred during the event NEVER varied.  During subsequent discussions between Puhalski and Sheets, a mutual opinion was reached regarding the PW......a seemingly credible witness who was looking for answers........something aerial, something mysterious and unknown had invaded his long time, heretofore peaceful, fishing spot.  ADDITIONAL FINDINGS AND OBSERVATIONS BY INVESTIGATORS   WEATHER CONDITIONS   The weather at this rural event site was reportedly fair and mild on the evening of 22April05. Specific information was obtained from the NWS daily recap of conditions at the Orlando International Airport; 10:53PM-----Temperature 70 degrees; Visibility 10 miles; 5.8 WNW winds; Humidity 53%; Sea level pressure 29.91, General description being partly cloudy.  The moon on 22April05 was almost FULL, fullness being reached two days later on 24April.The investigators feel that even with the almost full moon, the HIGH SPEED and SHORT DURATION of actual flight time made any physical MASS behind the GLOWING light DIFFICULT to clearly see i.e. that part WAS NOT emitting light. (Note: Sheets indicates several other investigations where the witnesses reported similar circumstances).  DURATION OF EVENT   The investigation revealed that about 5 MINUTES elapsed FROM the initial observation of the glow off in the nearby brush, THEN it&apos;s aerial flight and departure, CONTINUING with the witness&apos; effort to search and relocate, THEN calling 411. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;ACTUAL FLIGHT TIME OF THE LIGHT/OBJECT WAS ABOUT 5 SECONDS&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.  ADDITIONAL DETAILS REGARDING SHORELINE AND EVENT AREA   As described above, the witnesses were fishing from the shore, and off to their right about 20 yards away was the denser brushy area where the light/object was first observed at ground level. This area has one portion that extends slightly out into the lake. Located by Puhalski very near this shoreline, and within the described brushy area, was an unusual looking grate structure in the ground, along with several short pipe like structures coming out of the soil. The witnesses called it a drain, but it looked out of place to Puhalski, being surrounded by small overgrowth, yet in a small cleared out area within the aforementioned brushy area. This grate is within just a few yards of where the light was first observed at ground level. Speculation regarding the short pipes and the grate currently tends to associate them with some sort of drainage or below-ground conduit, perhaps linking up with an underground spring or water source.  The event site inspection revealed NO signs of trace evidence. (Photographs and diagram contained in the investigative file).  OTHER PHENOMENON   Investigators Puhalski and Sheets have conducted numerous past inquiries where, perhaps not rare, but certainly uncommon and only slightly understood natural phenomenon might have been in play. These were explored in light of this reported incident. One sample of this speculation is described below, to wit;   Research Source- &quot;Remarkable Luminous Phenomena in Nature&quot;, compiled by William R. Corliss (Catalog of Geophysical Anomalies).  GLN1-----Low-Level Nocturnal Lights Outline and Brief Excerpts   Description; &quot;.......softly glowing globes..........other luminous apparitions.....hovering, drifting erratically.......range from candle-size to radiating masses several feet in diameter.......colors vary widely, white, blue, yellow being most common......bobbing, swooping, evasive antics seem to beckon observer, frequently vanish......appear nearby.....low-level nocturnal lights seem to prefer wet, swampy areas&quot;.  Background; &quot;.......standard explanation........spontaneously ignited gases escaping from swampy ground........this apparently reasonable explanation.......shut off all scientific research..........examples (provided in text) demonstrate the marsh gas theory will simply not do in many.........a complex, challenging phenomenon&quot;.  Corliss continues on to describe that no explanation has been found as to how escaping gases can spontaneously ignite and that they are actually COLD as opposed to what would NORMALLY be expected from burning methane. Furthermore, Corliss is perplexed that no one has been able to determine how clouds of luminous gas can perform all sorts of aerial maneuvers for extended periods without losing shape and size. Corliss provides some possible explanations related to a cold flame being some sort of unindentified phosphorescence that is related to electromagnetic fields that might help in the production of light and maintaining size/shape.Numerous examples of low-level nocturnal lights are given in Corliss&apos; text, which is compiled from MANY first hand reports. Some are in ways similar to this Florida event, but those cited examples DO NOT SEEM TO INVOLVE SUCH HIGH SPEED, DIRECT MOVEMENT and SOLIDITY as described by the Florida witnesses.  As indicated above, Investigators Puhalski and Sheets have spent years looking into various types of UFO reports, which include a number of possible natural &quot;spook lights&quot; (we use this term generically) as described by Corliss.......BUT.......at this time, it is UNKNOWN what was observed in ORANGE COUNTY on 22April05. The BLAZING SPEED described by the witnesses, plus the DIRECT MOVEMENT and SUBSTANTIAL GLOW is consistant with many other &quot;up close and personal&quot; UFO encounters. ALSO CONSISTANT is the description of an UNKNOWN and HARD TO SEE MASS being behind the more easily observed glowing light. UFO encounters such as this are OBVIOUSLY NOT a natural atmospheric phenomenon, &quot;spook light&quot; or other such glowing apparition. If this is the case in the ORANGE COUNTY investigation, the Corliss information described above simply does not apply.  It should be noted that these fishermen have returned to their fishing spot since 22April05 with no similar events being noticed.  ORANGE COUNTY and ORLANDO area residents that may have witnessed a similar event on or about 22April05 (or any other time frame) are urged to contact Roberta Puhalski, founder of the Central Florida UFO Group at &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;CUFOG@webtv.net&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   The IDENTITY of EACH witness is held strictly confidential by both the Florida and Georgia groups.

I would find out if there is any runways close by.", "UFO in trouble?I was 12 years old at the time. We lived on top of a small mountain, and from that vantage point you could see 360 degress unencumbered.  Occasionally when we were outside at night you could see satellites beeping by or planes of all descriptions.  You see, we lived close to Scott Air Force Base. So we were accustomed to these things.However, one night when I was outside I was looking into the night sky when suddenly there was a very bright orange object (noiseless) streaking across the sky. It stopped abruptly over the town in the distance and started to waver. First slowly to the left and then the right, then up and down. It would seem to start to fall, then rise again very shakily. By this time I had called my sister to come watch. While we were both out there watching this one, ANOTHER one came from out of no where.  When I say that I mean that again, there was no sound or noise, and it streaked by so fast that it was incomprehensible.  It then stopped dead in midair beside the other one, which was faltering badly in the air.  The second one lifted itself up and down accordingly and steadily to be close to the first one in trouble. It (the second one) then moved closer until they were &quot;joined&quot;. A few seconds passed and then the orange light was much brighter. They then split apart in opposite directions so fast that you couldn&apos;t see where they went.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.

However, several reports from the same subject on subsequent nights make us wonder whether the witness might have observed a satellite.  However, NUFORC received a second report from Oklahoma of an object that sounds similar to what the witness describes above.

It was still light out, though very cloudy. Shortly thereafter, I was in the neighborhood directly behind my parent&apos;s house when a helicopter streaked by, headed in the general direction of south. I was wearing headphones, and I could hear the helicopter over the music. It made a wide arc to the right, turned around, and passed directly over my head.  It was a black helicopter, which is more than a rarity in my area. It promptly turned around again, and began to circle directly above me. It circled 15-20 times, getting lower and lower, as if it was out of control or looking for a spot to land.  I then took my headphones off and got my cell phone out to call my fiancee.  At this time, the helicopter was 200 or so feet in the air, very low. It was approximately 7:40.  When I began to dial, the helicopter pulled out of its low circling routine and shot off south again, flying higher and eventually up into cloud cover.  I made calls to my fiancee and my sister, but neither of them was home. I began to run again, out of the neighborhood and on a major road at this point.  With my headphones on again, I could swear I heard more helicopters. To satisfy my curiosity, I took off the headphones once more, and sure enough, several helicopters could be heard, but they were not visible and were likely covered by clouds.  I reached a bypass in the road at a very busy intersection.  Waiting for a green light, I began to here much more air traffic, and I searched the skies convinced that I would see a helicopter.  At approximately 7:45, in the distance, due north, I thought I saw a helicopter headed in my direction. I stood and watched it for about 30 seconds until it was close enough for me to discern that this was not a helicopter.  3 triangles appeared to be traveling in formation, each one rotating on its own axis, all 3 of them rotating around eachother, with seeminly no laws of physics applying to the locomotion of these objects. At first, since they were headed toward me, I had no real sense of their speed, and I assumed that they were slow moving, perhaps floating the same way a kite might float. The strangest thing was that, the more I stared at them, the harder they were to focus on.  What appeared to be a bubble surrounded the 3 objects, similar to the ring you can see around a full moon. I called my fiancee and my sister again and left frantic and frustrated messages. I watched for about 2-3 minutes when they began to head off in a more westerly direction. It occurred to me to call my mother, who was back at the house I had just left. She answered, and I begged her to go out in the yard and look in the sky. She had no luck in seeing this object do to the combination of its distance, it being fairly low on the horizon, and the amount of trees surrounding my parents&apos; house. She did, however, say how strange that was considering that she and my father had just witnessed a black helicopter acting very peculiar over the neighborhood behind us. They said the helicopter sounded as if the engine had cut out or gone out of control, as if it was in a spin before a crash. She suggested that the helicopter may have been in pursuit. I suggested the opposite as a joke. We got off of the phone, and I was still stuck in my tracks, staring at three triangles moving highly unnaturally and surrounded by a ring of strange light in broad daylight. At one point, the bottom triangle appeared to push out smoke or a vapor trail but I believe it was most likely a low flying cloud, approximately the size of two of these objects. If I were to make a hypothesis as to the size of these objects, I would have to say they could have been anywhere between the size of a commercial airliner or the size of a football field. It was very unclear, due to the varying speeds at which they moved and the fact that they were fairly distant, possibly a mile or two away, maybe more, maybe less. Not being an expert on judging things like that, I&apos;m not exactly quick to make a concrete analysis. I was very tempted to get somebody out of their car at a red light, but I&apos;m a really big guy, and that probably wouldn&apos;t have gone over so well. This whole incident happened over the course of about 20 minutes, but I was able to watch the objects in the sky for about 10 minutes total. For the rest of my 5 mile run, I heard several more helicopters, which is very uncommon where I live. Beyond that, I can&apos;t say I remember ever seeing a black helicopter around here. I do live 15-20 minutes southwest of Trenton&apos;s airport, 40 minutes north of Philadelphia&apos;s airport. To top it off, Newtown is home to a branch of Lockheed Martin, and the field across from Lockheed Martin played host to a President Bush rally last year.I have yet to contact local authorities or local newspapers.", "Neighbor caught some UFOs  2 bright white circular round objects flying over Chicago on his new digital video camera Saturday evening.  He sees these things all the time and I thought he was nuts, because he thinks the government is keeping this a secret, but I previously witnessed what he finally captured on video.  Is homeland security behind this or is there a more technically advanced unknown?", "Black morphing triangular object.I was jogging in the park with my girlfriend in the Bronx, NY.  As we were leaving the track in the park I noticed a solid black object in the sky.  It was moving very slowly and flying extrememly low. Low enough to were I could make out the shape.  It was triangular in shape but had buldges coming out of it.  As I continued to jog I noticed it began to morph/change shape.  It then changed into what looked like a bunch if grapes.  As I was following it, my girlfriend then noticed it and wondered what it was.  We both began to slow down and watch the object.  As we approached a street intersection waiting for the light to change so we can proceed w/ our jog, another person who was waiting to cross the street also noticed it and asked us if we are seeing what he was seeing.  At that moment, a commercial aircraft passed underneath it.  However the object continued to move slowly across the sky.  We continued our jog but I kept an eye on the object.  As it continued to move,it turned into a red color.  Soon thereafter, it vanished.", "Small red dot zoomed in at high speeds, came up to us. Saw the craft in slight detail.Sometime in august a few years back, there was a meteor shower. My younger brother and I decided to watch the show. We were outside and watching the meteors when we noticed a red glow. We thought it was an airplane when it zoomed in at extreme speeds that no plane or helicopter could reproduce. It zoomed in, my brother and I were staring at it. It had red lights and something that looked to be windows, I dont know what exactly they were. The shape was a football kind of shape, maybe more oval, but It had to have been no further than 500 feet above us. It made no sound that I heard, and I couldnt see anything or anyone inside.

The only thing I can think of, was that it had a pressure wave well ahead of the craft.   At first we thought that it might have been two aircraft, one following the other at a distance, but none of us were able to see another craft.   It appeared as if the craft had a leading pressure wave that was disturbing the atmosphere ahead of it.   I was just curious if anyone has ever reported anything like this.

I was outside with my telescope at around 10:20pm... a nearby neighbour has a tree to the east and I was just lining up my scope with the Hercules Cluster (low in the north-east) when I glanced a rapidly moving bright light (about the same brightness as the star Arcturus) moving along the top of the tree. It looked like a bright meteor so I stopped and looked up. It had stopped moving though, it was just sitting there. After a few moments it shot forward again, to the north, then stopped and shot forward again at a dead right angle to the east before vanishing about a second later. It had a white and red light.

I was the only one home at the time too so I knew that som one had to have opened it. I lay there frozen, afraid to get up and see what was going on. then I looked over to my left and there were two beings standing at the side of my bed. I just couldnt belive it I thought I was dreaming or something. So they were kind of whiteish color and had a sort of a glow to them that was amazing.Then I looked over at the door and there was one there too like gaurding it or something. Then the one closest to me reached out and touched my ribs on my left side. All of the while the other two were just sort of standing around watching.The one touching my ribs looked at me right in the eyes and he said not be afraid ,they did not come to harm me. I was so scared I couldnt even yell or talk. It was like I was in a sort coma where I was aware of everything around me but couldnt speak or move. This lasted for about two or three minutes and the next thing I knew I woke up on the other side of my room on the floor, naked. It was really weird too becouse my side was really cold where I was being touched.My door was closed like normal, I looked at my clock and it was 400 am. I couldnt swallow or anything becouse my mouth and throat were so dry and I was curled up in a little ball. The beings were like I said before, whiteish in color and had a sort of glow around them. They had big black eyes and really big heads with no ears. Also I was able to notice they had really long fingers. I dont know but it scared me so bad I am having trouble sleeping. I dont even sleep in my room I have been stayin with a friend and dont even really try to sleep becouse I am scared it will happen again.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.

So we decided to stop and try to get them on video..  just as we though we were too late the large light reappeared and soon others started appearing around it ... then something amazing happened ... other lights started flying down from the sky and joining the formation of lights ... it was simply amazing to witness and even more amazing is that this has finally been caught on video ... the video was jawdropping and the objects are so clearly taped that its just a miracle that it was caught ... the camera was on the tripod during the first few seconds of taping and it caught the lights appearing and flying down perfectly..  i decided to turn on the higher zoom on the camera so i removed it from the tripod and changed settings and began taping again ... this time i was zoomed closer to the objects and they started flying back up in the sky and disappearing....  it was all caught on tape and this time NOBODY can ever say that flares are all that are flying up around here in phoenix Arizona..", "Disk like object sighted in IndiaI live in a campus surrounded by thick green forest and very close to international airport.  On this particular night in October, my friend, who was visiting me had to go back to his place which is farther away.  He left on his bike at about 11 pm, he had to cross a long stretch of forest before hi can hit the civilization.   While driving on a lonely deserted unlit road, he was disturbed by a slowing moving craft, at first he dismissed it as an aeroplane, but when the craft came closer, he didn&apos;t beleive what he saw.  A disk like object with flashes of color lights stopped momenterly.  He stopped the bike and couldn&apos;t beleive what he saw. He says the craft was in a static position for a couple of minutes before it zoomed away in vertical direction with amazing speed.  This friend was not aware of any UFOs.

Around 12 noon on 6/15/04, I was looking out the side of my parking garage at work (at Thomas Rd &amp; Central Ave, facing North/Northwest in Phoenix) and saw something very strange in the sky. There were about a dozen white/silver small discs flying sporadically in the sky. I tried to count them, but they were constantly in errantic motion &amp; I found it hard. I turned to a girl (who I don&apos;t know, but works in my building) who was near me in the parking garage. She was talking on her cellphone &amp; apologized for interrupting her conversation in fear of her thinking I was nuts, but I had to ask if she &quot;could see what I&apos;m seeing??&quot; (I was so glad I wasn&apos;t the only one out there)She said into the phone, &quot;Honey, where are you? There are weird things flying around in the sky out here.....yeah, right now!&quot;. We laughed, but didn&apos;t take our eyes off of the show. They seemed silverish &amp; turned really bright white (seeming to reflect the sun)  sometimes when they dipped &amp; flew in certain ways. You could definately see that they had a spinning motion also &amp; they were all moving at different speeds, up, down, left, right, looping, diagonally, you name it. They were definately NOT flying in unison, but they were all grouped together, a few were a little North of me, moving behind buildings &amp; back again, but most were NW. An airplane was ascending from Sky Harbor Airport too at that time &amp; flew right past them (plane was flying North/ Northwest). I was wondering if those people were looking out the window &amp; could they see them?? At first I thought maybe they were pieces of paper that got caught in the wind or something, but they were much bigger than that...and SPINNING. They didn&apos;t look like balloons, helicopters or planes of any kind as far as I could tell. Neither did they look (or fly) like birds. We stood &amp; watched them for about 10 minutes, when they all started going North at the same time until I couldn&apos;t see them anymore. I&apos;ve never seen anything like it. I am curious to know if anyone else caught the show? Someone here at work suggested I write to the newspaper to see, so I wrote that day, no response (shocker!)

Thanks so much.", "I saw several strange white lights moving in multiple directionsWhile I was out on my walk, I noticed several feint white lights which were about the same brightness of most stars, moving rather fast across the sky in multiple directions. I ruled out aircraft because I could clearly see them with their red/blue lights flashing on the wings at the same time I saw these strange lights which appeared to be much higher up. The skies were clear at the time and it was totally dark. I don&apos;t believe they were satellites either due to all the different directions these lights were moving.((NUFORC Note:  We not that the description of the objects witnessed is not inconsistent with a sighting of multiple satellites, coursing across the night sky in different directions.

We drove out on HWY 105 away from the city lights and pulled over to the side of the road and found a place to kick back and relaxe near some train tracks. We were looking in the sky towards the constellation Lyra when it appeared as though a star appeared out of nothing, then a second later it disapeared, then a second later appeared and disapeared. Then closer to Cygnus the same type of event occured about half a minute later except that it only flashed once. Then in the constellation of Cygnus about a minute later the same type of phenomena occured again except this time it flashed as such 10-12 times. About an hour later near the constellation of Ursa Major the same event occured again with 2 flashes. We stayed out there about another hour and saw no more activity...it was getting close to 3am and I wanted to go home and go to sleep. I have been researching and studying Irridium Flares for two weeks, what we saw was not an irridium flare. Sattelites move. These things flashed in the same exact spot. These could not have been airplanes, helicopters, balloons, meteors or shooting stars. I have been looking on the internet for anyone who have reported seeing anything like this and all I can find about similar events is on Unidentified Aerial Phenomena sights. I can not call these UFOs because although they were unidentified but not flying or necessarily objects. I will add here that this is not the first time we saw this phenomena at Palmer Lake...on July 6th close to 2am we saw the same type of phenomena also from the Palmer Lake area. The UAP we witnessed on July 6th was reported to coMUFON (colorado mufon) but I have not heard back from them.

I heard the sound of a helicopter or old prop plane.  I looked up and around to see what it was.  My house is under a well used fight path, so aircraft are not unusual.  I looked up and I saw a long straight white object moving in a purposeful way(not drifting), in the direction of its end. It was very thin, as if they was no way anyone could be inside.  There were no appendages or patterns of any kind. It moved as fast as a plane appears when it is below cloud level and coming into land but it seemed to be just above the level of the haze cloud which would have been about 20 000 feet. It became very hard to see as it blended into the cloud and got lost in the sunlight.  I lost sight of it but I continued to look South in the direction it had gone.  Then after a few seconds I saw it appear out of the bright white haze as something darker, but this was too brief to say anything else.  A few milliseconds after it reappeared as a darker object, it flashed brightly.  The flash was not like a white light but appeared to be a strong reflection off a metallic object or an electrical spark maybe.. It was the length of a dime or U.K. 5p piece held at arms length.  It had similar proportions to a matchstick. I should also mention that I did have my shiny new rebel xt&#x5C;350d at the time and I ran inside to get it.

It was roughly 2am and we were sitting around the camp fire when one of my friends pointed out the objects. We all looked up and noticed the objects were flying in formation. As the objects moved West over our position we immediately followed.  The objects came to a complete stop, hovering in the air about 200 feet above our position in a clearing in the woods.  We slowly backed into the forest and hid behind an old fallen log, as to hide ourselves. At that moment, one of the saucers began to decend from the formation. The saucer stopped dead about 3 meters from the ground and two of the overhead saucers emitted a beam of light on the lower saucer. At that moment, the saucer 3 meters off the ground emitted four pulses of light into the ground. The light was blinding and caused my friends and I to look away. When I finally opened my eyes and re-focused the 6 saucers were on their way East of our position. The saucers seemed to be speeding up and within seconds they were out of sight. My friends and I moved back to our camp site and immediately penned down what we had all experienced. I was charged with the task of making the report. 3 of my 4 friends made it clear that they never wanted to speak of the event again, but a close frind and I decided we needed to share our experience.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

We had returned to our room on the evening of Wednesday 5/17 and were standing on the balcony enjoying the waves and weather. The sky had a few clouds and we debated a few seconds whether the light we were seeing to the north east was a star or a plane. After a few minutes we concluded it was a star and had taken seats on the balcony furniture. From the corner of my eye I saw a small light shoot across the sky but lost sight of it as it was above the balcony top. My wife stood to see what it was and she immediately said &quot;stand up, you have got to see this; Hurry , Hurry!&quot;  I caught sight of the light (which had a red tint to it) racing across the sky. I immdediately thought that it was a shooting star, because that was exactly the speed that it was going (but it was clearly below cloud level, which is what alarmed my wife in the first place.) Then the light stopped dead still in the sky, within the same visual space as the star we had observed earlier. The object sat motionless for about 1 to 2 seconds, then moved left at about half the original speed for about 2 seconds. It appeared to make a quick circular motion then shot across the sky in front of the ship again at the speed of a shooting star.  We lost sight of it when it crossed the front of the ship. This all took place in a matter of about 5 to 10 seconds.I am a sceptic of all things mysterious by nature and prefer to believe that there is most likely a sound scientific explanation for what we saw.

I exited her house through the garage. My motorcycle was sitting in the driveway and I was approaching it to get on it and start it up. It was then I noticed a strange object in the sky. At first I mainly saw lights. Her house sat on the top of a hill. The object was not any more than a few hundred feet off of the ground. the area of the ground it was hovering over was down hill from me. It slowly moved closer to my location making no noise. I could then make out the shape. It was a saucer shaped object that was taller in the middle. classic flying saucer shape. Now, in the middle of the disk area on the side there where lights of a few different colors: red white green yellow and a brownish red. The colors seemed to alternate as it hovered there. I remember just standing there frozen staring at this thing. when it started to turn at an angle almost perpindicular to the ground but not quite perfectly perpendicular. as it moved to this angle there was a crude mechanical sound coming from it. it sounded alot like an espresso machine when it is pumping water through the coffee. once it was at the terminal point of its turn it was once again silent. then, no kidding, it emitted a beam of yellowish light onto the ground. at this point it was probably 50 feet in front of me. then the light stopped and the mechanical sound started again. As the sound was going it returned to a parallel position in respect to the ground. It hovered there for a little less than a minute then suddenley there was a sound that sounded like a bottle rocket when it takes off as it shot straight up into the air.

It left so quickly that I bareley saw it. so I looked around and noticed that about 15 feet away the neighbor, an older woman about my girlfriend&apos;s mom&apos;s age, was working in her garden and she was still staring in the direction of the very strange and very scary sight.

The lake is off the paved roads, rather rural, no electricity or water or sanitary facilities. It sets in a depression surrounded by low rolling hills.

This event took place 30 years ago.  The only part of the date I could be sure on was that it took place 1 to 2 days before a major holiday.I was very young then and the whole event seems like a story now, or more like something that I have watched on TV.  Its hard for me to believe that I really saw it.  And as time has passed it has become just a memory, but one of those memories that sticks out in your childhood. It was late at night.  I would wake up in the middle of the night and go into my parents bedroom to crawl in bed with them or to hang out in their room so that I would not be alone in my room late at night. (I was a kid...what do you want)  On this night I was in their room and was just looking out the window.  The apartment complex we lived in had 4 units per building(2 story) and probably 10 separate buildings.  As I was looking out my parents upstairs window, slowly and silently a metalic saucer shape approximatley 30 feet across moved into my eyesight from over another apartment complex.  The pace of the object was that of someone walking.  It flew just over the tree tops and the building and thats why I guess it was 30 feet high.  It was about 25-30 feet infront of the window/building that I was in. I have re-visited this place since to gage the height and size of the object.  I have drawn pictures of this object a couple of times in my life to better illustrate the object for a few freinds that I have shared the sighting with over the years.  The object looked like it was a rough polished metal. Light bronze/silver.  Flat on the bottom except for right in the center of the underside.  It had a 10 foot across inverted cone shaped area that went into the object.  As I watched, it continued to move over the building and over a small parking area (directly infront of me) and continued on in the same direction.  I watched it until it went our of sight.  I waited...it never came back.  As I was so young, the event at the time did not seem that remarkable.  I do not even remember sharing this event with any adult until later in life.  I did though in fact share the experience with my cousins at a holiday/family gathering the next day(or day after).  I remember telling them and them laughing at me.  They were all older than me.  I remember them distinctly asking me if it had lights and what color they were?  I told them it had no lights they continued laughing and asked how I saw it then?   That was the end of my credibility with them and they stopped listening.  It was true, it had no lights.  The moon light, street light or what ever light that was being emitted from the area just reflected off the object to reveal the detail of the metal.  It was so close I didn&apos;t need any other light.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that tdateof the event is approximate.

Shapes include triangle, diamond, square, and ring. A fifteen minute duration. About 700 ft or less in a distance from me (two big blocks from me) without my looking upward or neck movement. Possibly above the treetop level, about 100&apos; above the ground level. My first night UFO sighting. I think a helicopter saw the whole thing from the beginning, possibly before I saw it. The UFO location is in the city on a clear night sky. I wonder how many witnesses have reported the sighting. The actual sighting is more serious than what I have imagined from hearing the UFO stories through the internet and broadcasting. The sighting videos may not appear dramatic, but in real life, it&apos;s very different. If there is a daily alert article or column published in a daily newspaper based on the events, it can be most appreciated to the concerned ones.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

Then it appeared for only one second like a faded bluish gray image that looked like a military aircraft. Minutes later the second incident involved a military jet releasing a chemtrail for a short distance then going straight overhead. Two bright orange flares lit up on the wings and were released. Two faded bluish gray craft that looked more like long speed boats suddenly appeared in a clear blue sky and moved slowly around the still burning flares then disappeared again. All that was left was a smoke trail from the flares in a blue sky. There was heavy military aircraft activity in the area all day. Several aircraft released chemtrails during the day.

In the evening we were enjoying the beach around dark sitting and talking in the sand above the breaking waves. We were in the Little Lagoon area of Gulf Shores (address available upon request)   I noticed a twin-engine aircraft approach parallel to the beach at about several thousand feet above the water and about the same distance from shore. Immediately after the plane flew past us, three white lights appeared in the sky above the horizon and below where we had seen the airplane. They were connected in a horizontal line and were very distinct. They seemed to be about the size of aircraft lights that would be from a distant aircraft, perhaps slightly larger.  They were not moving at all and after about 10 seconds,immediately stopped shining. A few minutes later, they appeared again, and then again once more. There were no clouds in the sky except for some high, thin clouds. So it was not clouds which caused the lights to appear and reappear, etc.  Later, a somewhat full moon rose on the horizon to the left of where we spotted these strange lights. There are also several oil rigs out in the Gulf of Mexico below where were saw these lights, however the lights were NOT at sea level. Three of my family members witnessed the lights. We heard no sounds either.", "My son laid on our pick nick table and pointed above our apartment complex, and asked,&quot;What is that, is that a hot air balloon?  This is the 9th UFO sighting up close and the first with my kids and girl friend.  My daughter saw it to.  My girl friend was inside.  I stood in one place until my girl friend came outside (she walked in just for a moment?  At first their was a circular black thing in the sky.  Then another came out of it and another.  The three black circles moved into one and then in two, back to one and it transformed back into three seperate black circles.  It then took a vertical flight into the sky and it seemed to disappear and reappear.  My kids where kind of freaked out and so was my girl friend.  I have never saw that kind of movement before.  Has any one else?", "I have checked your log report and found that the sighting I reported shortly after December 6, 1976, was not filed. I am dismayed but have not forgotten a single detail. At about 5:30 AM on 12/06/1976, as was ususal I was heading West on Sterling Rd. in Davie, Florida, to drop my children 4 and 1 1/2 years old at a daycare center. I was enrolled in BCC and my wife worked at ((name deleted)) restaurant on ((deleted)) Rd. As I was passing a bicyclyst I noticed in the Northwest sky a fireball falling.  After a minute I pulled my car over and shut it off to say prayers as I thought it was a plane crashing.  I sat for several minutes after the fireball disappeared behind trees several miles away but I saw no flash, nor did I hear an explosion. Within two more minutes I and my wife observed a huge dull, grayish metalic looking object that was heading slowly toward us and southeast. The object was immense, did not emit any noise, smoke or any exhaust that would be noticable from thermal fluctuations of the air around it.  The object now appeared to be oblong or cigar shaped, more than 250 feet long and more than 30 feet high.  There seemed to be some sort of whitish light atop and a light at each end, front and rear but not white. As it approached our vehicle my wife&apos;s upper body leaned out the window to look up at it.  I observed it from the windshield inside. We kept asking what the he** it was and when I looked at her I noticed her back and the entire interior of the car was illuminated. I then noticed my 4 year old daughter leaning on the back window looking up. I then looked at my interior light and saw it was not lit.  I immediately looked out my side window and it was still pitch black outside the car. I then looked up as best I could to get a fix on the structure as it was now less than 50 feet from us. The surface was not metal at all.  It had a sandy texture similar to that of shark skin.  I could not locate any seams or a single area that would suggest any conventional assembly that I am or have ever been aware of.  The object became stationary for an undetermined period of time and we just stared at it for minutes. From the corner of my left eye I could see a small child-like figure run rapidly across the front of my headlights.  It was about to climb over the metal road barrier but hesitated and turned toward me.  I had immediately tried to get a glimpse of any articles that I might be able to identify but it had nothing.  No shoes, belt, tools, weapons or any other devices.  My first thought was to jump out and grabit and throw it in the trunk because no one would believe me if I didn&apos;t.  A voice of sorts told me not to move or I would be harmed.  I tried to lift my arm and was horrified that it looked as if it was cut off where the light ended inside the car. I looked at the figure again and thought that it was so small and having no weapons I could take it in a few seconds. The voice or whatever it was described the stretch cloth suit it was wearing carried 40,000 volts of piezoelectrical current.  This is a term I had never heard of and I knew I could not have imagined the thought.  The figure then hopped over the fence and went into a horse breeding ranch at about 140th st. My last memory of the incident was when I was looking behind me in my car and seeing a somewhat different shaped object about 1 mile south of me moving slowly at first but then as I watched it the object seemed to accelearte so fast it just vaporized. It was also after sunrise and without a word to my wife or a word from her to me I started my car, drove to the daycare center, dropped off the children and did not say a word to the people. I learned later that we were at the scene for more than 40 minutes. I never saw the bicyclist pass us. A also lost my eyesight for almost 2 days after the incident. After years of horrible dreams and nightmares I learned that the subjects who occupy the craft are from a parralel universe. Their craft are not built but actually grown by reconstructing the atomic anatomy of what we call a &quot;Diamond&quot; where the conditions exist for such. The suit (for lack of a better term) that the small figure was covere with is also a mineral which is genetically altered. I also learned that, just as a diamond, the outer shell adapts to the temperature changes the instant the craft becomes stablilized in whatever atmospheric temperature it is suspended in. One issue that has stuck in my mind for years is the fact that whatever the voice was that conveyed the images to me also mentioned repeatedly; m&quot; You can be violent.&quot; I   am not sure if it applied to me or the people of this planet as a whole. However, the occupants of the craft I saw are neither friendly nor inclined to become violent. They have almost no emotional state at all, yet they are certainly aware of ours. As for the interior of the craft; there was not a single sharp angle anywhere I could see and again, nothing to provide any evidence that the object was assembled. It looked more like something hollowed out areas of a huge iceberg with a torch. The area which was used to control it&apos;s speed and motion was a long, flat, glass-like surfce no more than 2 inches thick and less than 2 ft. wide but rather long. I also could not locate any source of light despite the entire interior ares I went being fully luminated.", "I woke to a dim green light a misshapen peanut  looking UFO in the sky and saw it once more a few days later.I wokeup to a dim green light outside my window. I drew back the curtains to see what it was ,and saw a strange shape in the sky it looked like a misshaped peanut. I stared at it for about five minutes and it started getting closer then suddenly it seemed to stop and hover and then it just streched and dissapered. I saw the same one, or what looked like the same one around 3:00 A.M. This time it stayed for about fifteen minutes then once more it streched and dissapered.

The object at first looked perfectly round and metallic but the more I stared it seemed to become transparent. I thought it was a weather balloon but I could not see any devices hanging from the bottom. I watched the object and soon there were trees that slightly blocked my view of the object but I kept my eyes fixed on it until the trees passed. The trees were only there for 10 seconds tops and I could still see the reflection through the trees. But by the time the trees passed, the object was gone completely. Planes were visible at the same time and traveled slowly in comparison to the dissappearence of the object. I was facing southeast at the time and if I am standing on the ground it would have been above me at an approximate 70-75 degree angle.

I looked over the road and beyond my Aunt&apos;s cornfield, midway between the tall pines trees and ground was a large anitque gold colored object, slim on both ends and large in center, rather like an oval stretched out.  Along the length (centered) was something that looked like port holes. The top was dome shaped.  I remember it just sat there, no movement, no nothing! I looked for about five minutes because I had never seen anything like it.  I knew it wasn&apos;t a blimp nor helicopter or plane.  Living about 40 miles from an air base I was use to blimps, planes and helicopters. What I saw wasn&apos;t any of those. This has haunted me for 54 years and whenever I go home for a visit I always ride over to just stare at the place where I saw that thing, trying to figure out what I saw and why.  Even when I&apos;m on the phone etc., I find myself doodling and ending up drawing the object without realizing it. Today I am 60 years old and always kept that moment like a secert.

What i saw, it did look like a circular object. Then it moved onto my side where I was driving. Then it seemed to have changed shape as it flew ahead of me over to my side. It then started to look like a rectangle that had two wings that looked like two block ends. There were no nose or tail on the object. The lights were not blinking, but they were solid and motionless. I turned to my friend to ask her to look at it and when she did it started flying toward a field at the end of the street. It flew into the field and started moving like it was bouncing up and down. While we were sitting in her driveway, it was still there.

I&apos;d say it was about as big as a tennis ball and it caught my eye as it was so bright against the stormy sky.  Before I could turn the camera back on a cloud came accrooss and covered it and I never saw it again as there was no break in the clouds.  I suppose it could have been an aircraft but was difficult to tell if there was any aircraft noise because of the storm passing northwards.

At first we thought they might be jet contrails, but they were very defined, without any broken up pattern in the line like contrails leave.

The object was a blue ball of translucent light, with the middle of the ball slightly darker then the outer part.  It made no sound and it just rose up from out of the wooded area across from the highway where my car stopped.  I couldn&rsquo;t move, and that was mostly because I was astonished.

I called her son out and he observed the one larger one as well. We stood and observed and then her and the son went in.

We made a stop at a rest area in louisville Kentucky.  After we had all gone to the bathroom and streched for a minute we headed back to the car.  We were on the road going on to the highway from the rest area when we noticed a huge object with lights way off in the distance.  Just joking my dad said &quot;Oh it&apos;s a UFO&quot;.  Just as my dad had finished saying that the object started moving towards us at a fast rate of speed. As it approached we could tell that this object was very very huge.  It kept coming towards us untill it was literally right on top of our car.  I was so scared I clung to my friend in the back seat.  I couldn&apos;t believe what was going on.  The object that we saw hovered above our car about 3-4 stories above it.  It followed us for quite some time.  I know that what we saw was not from this earth.  We got a really close look at the thing.  The shape of it was triangular and it looked to be at least the size of a football field.  It was really big.  It also made no sound, which I thought was really strange.  It had three bright lights that were shining on our car, on on each point of the triangle.  The thing that bothers me the most about all of this is that I remember that it was hovering on top of our car one minute and then it seems like not long after that it went up slightly and then took off at an incredible rate of speed and vanished.  When we first saw the object it was around 11:00 p.m. after it left it was about 2:30.  I remember only seeing it for minutes.  what happened with that other time? Is it possible that I could have been abducted? This event has changed my life in so many ways.  I have been brought up believing that these things are make believe and that crazy people make up these stories to get attention.  I had to change many of my views and include the possibility that we may not know the full story.  I thought I would share this story in hopes that it may help other people to consider that there may be something out there.  I didn&apos;t believe or go looking for them.  It is so hard because I have only told a few select people about this.  People think you are crazy if they here this.  I could send you a drawing if you want because it is very hard to describe all the details.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.

I first noticed the two smaller lights, they could have been redish in color, they were moving fast and in a diagonal pattern. When I had a more unobstructed view I then saw thata perhaps a purposeful diagonal flight pattern was being maintained and then noticed the large white bright oval shaped object flying between them. That one was much larger and brighter than the other two. They were moving fast, kept the same pattern and were staying low on the horizon. By the time I turned right onto West Haven Road which runs north, I could only get a glimpse now and then of the bright white object by looking to my left through the gaps in the trees and houses.

The sky had some clouds, mostly it was mostly clear. At 10:40 pm this shape started to move across the sky going North. You could see it was somekind of craft.

It was very independent and moved very smoothly, with power to move faster, then it seemed to stop by a cloud.

From the angle I was sitting it seemed to be quite a few travelling.  My first assumption was that it was a military convoy since there are usually groups of 3-4 choppers that will travel through here during the day on occasion.  I noticed they kept coming.  I walked down the street about 50 yards to get a better angle and noticed that 4 of the aircraft were circling the sky.  They were triangler in shape with flashing lights.  These were probably planes since they had red and blue flashing lights and they seemed to be moving in a standard pattern.  Another one or two were definately choppers because I could hear them as they flew closer and farther away.  One of the objects, however appeared to be brighter than the others.  It also did not follow the same patterns as the other aircrafts in the sky.  It seemed to glow bright white without flashing lights.  It moved awkwardly and faster than the others but interacting with the planes.  It was more sphere like and there were no real flashing lights.

The lights were red and were far out in the Pacific Ocean.  I thought it was a mast of a ship or large naval ship but everyone else thought they were too high above the horizon line to be a ship.  The lights didn&apos;t move.  It was like there was a string of lights and certain  ones would turn off while other ones would turn on.  At one point it looked like the outline of a bow of a ship sinking into the ocean but it would have to have been a ship about 800 feet tall and 400 feet long for it to have been as visible as it was to us.

We lived in South Marysburg, near the community of Black River, in Prince Edward County, Ontario(Canada) on the north shore of Lake Ontario. Our home overlooked Prince Edward Bay to the south and the spectacle witnessed appeared in the eastern sky above Waupoos Island and beyond over Lake Ontario. Orange/gold lights, brighter and much larger than the brightest, largest object in the sky at the time seemed to priodically wink in and out, each lasting at least five minutes, varying from 9 to 12 at a time. They seemed toform discernable geometric patterns appearing simultaneously as triangles, diamonds, crosses and other shapes. When a shape would emerge they would hold very still for great lengths of time, not moving but seeming to fade in and out to form new patterns. There was absolutely no movement, no sounds, no smoke and through binoculars no method of suspension or delivery as detected. After about 20 minutes, with my entire family outside watching all this we decided to go next door and alert the neighbors, an elderly couple. From the waterfront vantage point of their deck we all watched in amazement for a good houe trying to make sense of it all. With all the attention poised towards the east, we hadn&apos;t noticed until I glanced south towards the bay that an object was clearly hovering close to the surface of the water about halfway across the bay, aprox. 3/4 kilometre. It was too dark and the glare of its lights too bright to make out any shape but it appeared as a red and white flashing light group like the grouping of lights on top of a police car. It remained there until the orange/gold lights stopped appearing and then it simply vanished. The whole event lasted about two and a half hours and when it was over I got into my car and drove to the opposite side of the bay exactly where a police cruiser would have to be parked to provide the red and white flashing lights. There was no indication of a vehicle disturbing the vegetation any where in the area. I returned the next morning and still found nothing. We waited for the news to appear about the sighting by other witnesses but never heard a thing about it until much later when we heard about the phoenix lights which apparently happened about the same time as the ones we witnessed.

My friend I both saw the same thing. This sighting is our first and only. This happened only a few days after a young man (16y) drowned in mitchal pond/lake. I live in Lakehaven apartments and the lake is next door. This death was all over FOX news. I doubt a significants. I was showing him the candle light mural that was floating where the young man was found. There is a baseball park ajacent to the lake and a tree line dividing the two. As we walked I noticed a ball game in progress. I saw over the tree line on the horizon, an orange glow. I thought at first fireworks dieing out and blowing in the wind, but no. They kept moving, and there were six. Flying in formation, Three in front and three in rear. The front formation was a diagnal line of three. The rear was a triagle pointing to the front formation. It would have seemed a large single craft if they weren&apos;t oscelating freely. They moved slightly in an imperfect formation. This formation continued accross the sky, which was a clear dusk sky. The indivividual objects were a color that I can barely describe. Amber, blue, grey all put together. The light was not incandessant, nor hallogen. It was more irridessant, a glow. But a glow should not be able to be visable from the distance we saw them at. The distance is impossible to estimate because of the undetermined size of the craft. They appeared very high in the atmosphear, and were moving over the horizon very quickly, but soundless. There was no light bending or streaking, as a fast jet may cause if it flies fast enough and emmits a bright light it may streak to the observer. The only way to describe the apperance of the UFOs is they resembled a size magnified human egg. Round with an inner circumferance and an outer.

Only my friend and I saw it, that we know of. We did ask anyone and everyone we saw near the event only to our dismay, as we began to feel insane. As the Crafts continued across the dusk sky, we both observed them vanish one by one, front of the formation to the back. No sound, just dissapeared. I have no explaination as to how they dissapeared, other than they left the atmosphear or had some otherworldly technology. I&apos;m not saying these definately were visitors of another world, but what we saw was not military in my oppinion. I highly doubt humans have a craft as we observed. If this were millitia I would assume it to be top secret and would not be flown over a residential area. I know what I saw. It was not normal. We were frightened. I do believe us to not be alone in this universe, as it would not make sense if we weren&apos;t. But why would someone come here? Discovery? Warnings of impending self desctuction? War?

I obseved 3 dime size objects in a V formation. They seem to be rotating and changing formation. As they moved I could see them change brightness in the sun. At times they seem extremely shiny as they rotated. Then they formed a V pattern and started to move north, at wich point they just disappeard. It was like turning of the light. I was with a friend, and I stopped several college student walking by to see if they could see what I was seeing. They all saw the same thing. When I was 10yrs old and living in Argentina, I saw the exact same thing. Even then everyone on the street stopped and looked at the sky.

The objects looked like they were made of a cloth-like material. Each object had two firing retro rockets that were gold and each had a rectangular shaped L.E.D. screen in it near the same area.  The led&apos;s seemed to be displaying something. They looked like they were approaching Bob Hope Airport (formally Burbank Airport) The objects moved slowly and seemed to float as the sparks were emitted.  This sighting lasted ten minutes and only ended when the objects burned up in the west southwest sky.  It was a very clear evening.  I have been witness to at least two other sightings in the same area.  The last one was a rectangle shape that changed it&apos;s shape into a triangle. That time there were 4 witnesses with me.((NUFORC Note:  We have sent an e-mail to the witness, requesting clarification on a few of the points he cites above.

They were little circular dots in the sky. They were white in colour. They were sometimes still, and some times moveing. There must have been at least 5 or 6 of them.

We were travelling southbound on I-85.  We saw what appeared to be just 2 or 3 fireballs in the sky.  I thought at first that they were airplanes, but over the course of about 30 minutes, about 50 or more of these objects appeared in the sky.  They were going in all directions...up, down, side to side.  Some were stationary for a while, and then just shot up into the sky...or to the side...or straight down!  It was the most bizarre thing I have ever seen.  We saw cars parked on the side of the road observing this as well, but as yet I have been unable to find any newspaper article or other eyewitness account of the event.  It was so obvious and so clearly seen - I know there must be others who saw it as well.  The best way I can describe the appearance is that each one looked like a fireball.  They were very small, so I assume they were very far away but I don&apos;t know how far.  They were covering the whole horizon.  Since this happened right after September 11th, I was terrified that we were under a terrorist attack, but when we called someone to have them flip on the news, they saw nothing of the event on TV.  Once I got home after that weekend, I looked on the internet, posted to message boards - and found nothing.  I am certain that what I saw was NOT some natural light phenomenon, nor was it airplanes - unless there were 50+ experimental aircraft in the sky.  These did not move the way normal planes move - they were going in EVERY direction imaginable.  I can&apos;t explain it, but I would very much like to know if anyone else saw it.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

I said, &quot;Do you guys see that silver thing?&quot; both of my friends said they did see it. We kind of watched it for a few minutes, not knowing what it was. It didn&apos;t make any sound, there was no smoke trail or anything. It looked like as if it was flashing every now and then. I ran into my house, got my video camera and told my mother to come outside to see this thing. I filmed it until it dissapeared into some pink clouds with a flash.We went to the park down my street and stood in a soccer field trying to see it. We were there for a good 20 minutes, when we decided to go to a much bigger farmer&apos;s field to try and see it. Well about half a block away from the field, one friend spotted it again.

I saw them only at a glimpse as they started fading out. I do not know how long they had been there. They were to the North and slightly West of my location. This would mean the lights were roughly over I-17 freeway and perhaps Carefree Highway. I have seen these &quot;Phoenix Lights&quot; many times over the last couple of lights, so I continued to observe that portion of sky in case they would appear again. They did appear lower on the horizon; this time there was somewhere between 6 and 10 of them that appeared in a streak or straight line almost as if it were one that was in motion but only appeared in a series of dots of light. This second set of lights appeared about 5 minutes after the first set. The duration of this second set in a line formation was maybe 1 to 2 seconds. All of the lights in the second sighting were amber except for the last one which was red. They appeared from right to left at a slight angle from higher to lower (maybe 2 or 3 degrees off parallel with the ground). The lights were so low to the ground the second time that I could barely see them over the building to the North of this trucking yard.

The object was thin when viewed head-on.  I cannot estimate the size accurately, but given the range at least 500 feet, but less than 1000 feet long, and 100-200 feet wide.  The object flew over Astoria Queens at Astoria Boulevard, then made a wide circle and flew over the East River to the island of Manhattan, turning to fly south down its spine on Manhattan&apos;s west side.

Awesome what ever it was.....", "3 bright lights that moved and changed shapes and colors, and appeard to be checking us outin the early monring hours, under a serious tropical rain, my girlfriend were sitting in the hot-tub. the rain subsided just enough, and we were finally able to open our eyes, as the rain had been so hard that we literally could not open our eyes or it felt like someone shooting a hose in your face.  Once the rain died down, we got to kissing and somewhat fooling around. That&apos;s when I noticed an unusual light above the treetops from a forest area that borders my property (approx. 50 ft above ground and approx 100 yards away).  I pointed it out to her, and she did not realize that a light coming from that area was strange, she thought it was like a reflection of our lanai (porch) lights reflection off something up there. I said, no...not possible.  We got out and walked closer, and proceeded to see this light change colors, from red to blue, to bright white.  We were blown away by what we saw, and watched it for about 3-5 minutes.  Then we went away from it for a little while, when we did, she saw it move back into her sight at an alarming speed (she freeked out), and she hollered at me to come see.  I could not see it where she said it took off to, but she said it didn&apos;t move that far, and only moved to continue to check us out.  So we went back to the side of the house that allowed the best view, and I watched for about 30 seconds the area behind the trees that she said it moved to, and sure enough, it re-appeared as a dim light.  Then, in the original spot that we first saw it, two other lights appeared.  It was very hard to judge shape or size, however it did appear that they were changing shape, and they definately were changing color.  As the other two appeared, ALL 3 got really bright simultaneously. We were dumbfounded, as neither or us has encountered anything strange before and frankly were skeptical of this type of stuff.  The main light, the one that had moved, also appeared to have &quot;dancing&quot; white smaller lights around it.  All in all, they were &quot;around&quot; for about a half hour to 45 minutes.  I did not even think to grab my camera, as I was so overwhelmed by what I was witnessing.  It truly seemed to both of us that they were watching us, and somewhat using the treetops as cover, however when we went to the side of the house that they were near, the would like re-appear and even get brighter, changing from red to blue to white to bright white.  I would have heard aircraft, as it is really quiet where I live, and the fact that she saw it move super fast and then we saw three proves to me we saw something &quot;out of this world&quot;.  The objects appeared to change shapes, and one of them even kinda burned like a flair for a short time (a minute or so), but would then change to blue and white.

What we saw were 3 oval-shaped objects, of uniform size and description.  These ovals were somewhat bright.  They would appear in a bowed line, then disappear only to reappear in a triangular formation.  They would then disappear and reappear again in a line but slightly &quot;dancing&quot; in a snake-like manner.  This cycle continued for 5 or more minutes, with no set pattern as to how they would appear.  However, the patterns that the object or objects made appeared to be equal and precise.

Walton Beach, FL. http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/028/S28061.html) After the events depicted in that report, I was outside specifically looking for other strange behavior in the skies. First sighting: ~11pm ---------------------- I was outside my Breakers hotel room watching the low clouds from &quot;Hannah&quot; storm roll inland.  In one formation of the changing clouds, they were close to left and right, and significantly further out to see toward the middle.From the left, I saw a faint pinkish glow coming from just inside of the clouds.It travelled along the beach, remaining in the cloud cover, going very fast.The really weird part of this was that it remained just inside of the clouds the entire way - going out to sea in the middle, and back inland as it passed by the right.  It seemed to want to stay inside the clouds, and it also seemed to pick up speed as it passed by to the right.  In my notes, I wrote down that the speed was &quot;scary!&quot;  Both the surf and wind were very loud, so that was all I heard. Second sighting: ~11:50pm -------------------------- I was still on the balcony watching the clouds roll in.  At this point, they were more choppy.  2 glowing oval objects flew from behind me out to sea and eventually disappeared into the oncoming clouds.  I saw no structure, only glowing ovals - each about the size of nickel at arm&apos;s length.  They were flying together, yet independently.  Their flight paths were eratic as they flew straight out to the sea (directly toward the storm).  I tried to depict this scene in the enclosed rough sketch. I am an Electrical Engineer and I am fairly familiar with traditional airplane capabilities.  I believe that these ovals were intelligently controlled, were not based on air-foil technology, and that no person could have ridden in a vehicle that moved in such fashions. - Note to the moderator - Please excuse the lateness of this report, but I was waiting until I had drawn a better picture of it but I got busy with other things (the picture I&apos;m sending is not the quality I wanted to produce, but it gets the job done).I just read a recent report (http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/044/S44378.html) that depicted an object very similar to what I described here and my interest was renewed.

Too big, too low, too slow, too quiet, for a normal aircraft.Too big, too low, too slow. Me and my now husband were just outside walking, looking at the stars, and talking. We were in a residential neighborhood, the houses all being on at least one acre lots.  All the lots have trees on them.  We are 25 miles west of downtown Fort Worth, and there were no street lights, so you can see the stars very well.  From where we were standing, in the street, you couldn&apos;t really see the horizon, just the houses/trees around us.

No vibration, no air movement, no smell, no visible moving parts, no smoke, nothing!! I got the impression that it was either rectangular, or maybe triangular, and for some reason I was thinking that it had to be pretty flat. It moved, well hovered would be a better description, until it was directly over us. It was soo big that it totally filled our field of vision.  You could not see the stars/sky behind it.  It seems that there were some dull white lights on the edges of it, but me and my husband never did agree on what the lights looked like, or if there were even lights at all.  The whole encounter lasted under a minute.  I dont remember how it left our field of vision, and neither can my husband.

I have tried for years to pin point an exact time frame.  I know me and my now husband were just kids, so it had to be 91-92.  I am thinking it was early fall.

I don&apos;t know what they were, but I saw them. I&apos;ve seen similar lights in the past, but never a triangle or lights that stopped. It was very cool! I don&apos;t believe in UFO&apos;s, so they were probably military aircraft. There were no flashing lights, so I wonder. All of the lights were white.", "Pinpoint of light grows larger and shines bright blue/white and staggers it&apos;s course.Every year I go to the Owens river valley in Northern California with my Father and Cousin.  We were on glass mountain between Bishop and Mammoth Lakes.  Before going to sleep, we watch the sky for a few hours looking for satellites and ufo&apos;s.  On Saturday night, my cousin spotted a pinpoint of light traveling from west to east.  We assumed it was a satellite at first (object too high to be conventional aircraft).  After a few seconds of watching, it seemed to grow in size about like a dime held out at arms length and it lit up bright blue/white (like when someone is arc welding) and it&apos;s course became staggered for a few seconds untill it returned to a pinpoint of light.  After that it just continued on it&apos;s way.  Our elevation on the mountain was approx 8000ft. the sky was crystal clear, the temperature was around 51deg with a very light wind.  There were no other aircraft in the vicinity at that exact time.  We did see several satellites the entire week we were there.  I&apos;ve been a sky watcher since my first ufo sighting at age 7.  After seeing 12 now, I strongly believe we are not alone, never have been and never will be.", "Unknown object in the Mojave Desert (CA) midafternoon. Not noticed in the desert; only noticed when I looked at my pictures.At 1:00 PM PST, I took a picture of a desert scene in the Mojave National Preserve, at the entrance to the Gold Valley Ranch. As I took the snapshot, I did not hear or see any object; it was only after I returned home to South Carolina and reviewed my pictures (taken with a digital camera) that I noticed what appeared to be a dark spot in the picture. When I zoomed in on my computer, the spot began to take the shape of some form of aircraft. I thought maybe there was a spot or blemish on my camera lens, but checked the pictures taken just before and just after the subject snapshot and found no similar spots on those shots. The object is disc-shaped, with two distinct portions. the lower portion is disc-shaped and the upper part appears to be something like a cockpit. There is a reflection on the top part and the bottom is in a shadow. It is not clear from the photograph, but the object appears to be moving left to right, which would be heading west northwest. The reflection and shadow are consistent with shadows cast on the ground. I estimate the object was about 1 and 1/2 miles from me. This is a judgment call, referencing the mountains nearby. Please note that I am a skeptic regarding alien ships and such. I&apos;m sure there is a good explanation for what is in my picture. Upon request, I will submit the photograph.", "Strange object captured over Shanghai&apos;s Pearl Tower.I was in Shanghai with other American students in a bus travelling to the Shanghai Hotel for the first time.  I decided to take some pictures of the Shanghai skyline with my digital camera when I shot this photograph.  There were not any objects in the sky before or after I took this picture, at least none that I or anyone else in the bus noticed.  The tall tower building you see the object next to is the Pearl Tower, the tallest building in Shanghai, China.  This picture was taken in a moving bus without flash, mind you there is still a window between the camera and the outside.   The dark outline on the right of the picture is the curtain. The dark spot just left of the middle of the picture is a smudge that appeared in several of the pictures taken out of the same window overlooking the same area.  Strangely enough, I was never able to identify the location of this imperfection on the window but I give it enough doubt to believe that it was not anything outside.  If you zoom in on the object you can see its detail.  It is reflecting the sun from the same angle as the tower and you can even see a bit of a shadow on the bottom of the object.  I know it is not an aircraft because there weren&apos;t any in the air before and after taking the photo.  I had seen a few aircraft in the air that day but none had been so reflective and not one was even close to this shape.  I also know it is not a reflection of anything from the outside creating a glare on the window, because the glare would have bled out more on the dusty windows.  There is definitely something out there in this picture; the pinpoint detail that can be seen really shows it.  I showed this picture, instantly after taking it, to the other students in the bus.  There were mixed explanations.  I don&apos;t know what it is, so I leave it up to you to interpret what it may be.((NUFORC Note:  We see a bright glare in the sky, where the source indicates it should be, but we do not know what it is.  We have no reason to believe it is necessarily a genuine UFO, but it is unidentified.

Went out on my front porch to smoke, when I look up over the houses across the street and not to far off in the background was this craft, that had what appeared to be windows on the side square in shape and very noticable in the night sky, I thought maybe a plane, but in the big sky we have here within&apos; the time I tilted my head down to light my cigarette &lt;which took maybe 2 seconds&gt; and I looked back up and it was gone, theres nothing there to hide or obscure it view from me ..theres nothing but sky here ..I walked down to end of my block which isnt far maybe 30 ft since we live on the corner house and theres a field down there im guessing its a wheat field but im not sure ..then this white ball shot over the field at an amazing speed and that was it ..but I know what I saw and I know a plane cannot vanish in the sky we have here especially within&apos; a few second time frame ....it was crystal clear out many many stars were out ...I could draw a diagram but im not to fond of computers ..but I did draw one on paper here ..", "A triangular craft with a large white beam in front with a red flashing light in the middleObservers saw a triangle shaped craft going NNW in the night sky at about 10:30pm on Thursday July 7th, 2005. The craft made no noise whatsoever. It had a long white beam of light shinning in front of it, much like a headlight on a car. There was a red flashing light in the middle of the triangle shape craft, and white lights on the side, so that it was visibly a triangle shape. We observed this for craft for at least two minutes, it was not traveling fast but rather slow. Was witnessed by four adults.", "A close encounter with some backup.In the fall of 1979, my friend and I were playing with a ball outside of our apartment building.  A spere shaped Spacecraft with dome on top appeared about 100 feet in the air.  It was about the diameter of a DC-10.  Golden in color.  There were bright lights that rotated around it.  There were black windows that appeared to be absent of light.The ship made a soft hum, almost silent, and could move in any direction.  It slowly moved over us for 5-7 Minutes then shot of into the horizon.  We showed it to my friends Mom but she wasn&apos;t sure what she saw it was now so far away.  My parents wouldn&apos;t believe me until the next days news reported a sherif attacked the same night.  There is unaccounted for time in the middle of my encounter. I saw my friend in 1991.

In that exact area the summer earlier (late June or early July), My friend and I were getting out of my car after comming back from Saratoga. It was approximatley 11 pm, and we were at his house which is situated on the North side of Eastline only about a half a kilometer west of the Sweet Road, Eastline Road intersection. As we walked towards his house I casually glanced over his back yard (facing north). As I scanned the placid and quiet field that expanced an approximate distance of around 300-400 meters between his back porch and the wood line, I first noticed the light that was situated stationary just below the tops of and behind the trees at the forested area which border the edge of his property. At first I thought it was some kind of tower with an affixed light source, most likely a floodlight I assumed since the intensity of the light comming through the trees seemed like it was something like a helicopter searchlight, or some other kind of spotlight. I did not however hear any type of engine noises that would accompany a conventional aircraft at such a close distance... I swear it was so quiet I dont even think there we any animal noises or even car noises for that matter. Being perplexed, I brought the unusual light to my buddie&apos;s attention and inquired if that was a normal occurance, he replied he had never seen it before. We stared at it and became even more curious when it appeared to move and then stop MOTIONLESS, then reverse direction, move and stop motionless again to a location that couldn&apos;t have been tens of meters from its original location. During it&apos;s transverse I saw what looked like the beam of the afor-mentioned light scan through the tops of the trees, now motionless again and still without sound. Thats when we became incredibly exited, we ran to a picnic table close by and stood on top to get a better look. After another few minutes it silently but quickly moved back to its original location, it then rose from behind the tops of the trees. There we could see other less brillient lights located to the right and in line on what appeared to be the physical structure of the craft with the main light still visible as what I will call the &quot;nose of the craft. Although we couldnt make out a definate shape it&apos;s structure seemed to change while producing other lights sporatically (it could have been just changing its orientation in relation to us) This is when the UFO semmed to dip it&apos;s &quot;nose&quot; Towards the ground and move very rapidly to the south, it then stoped, more like hovered and decended towards the ground around the vacinity of the Sweets Road, Eastline Road intersection. We imediatley jumped into my car to attempt some sort of persuit, but even at 80mph when we reached the estimated &quot;landing site&quot; of whatever this thing was there was absolutley nothing, not even a plane in the sky. We remain clueless. As an afternote I would like to say there are no airports in the vicinty, or anything capable of supporting aircraft. The area is however, a major conduate for huge powerlines which pass within 100 meters of the sighting location. The region has had other strange sightings in the past especially in and surrounding the saratoga lake area which is also home to a government facility which developed &quot;Space and Energy&quot; Technologies during the cold war. A personal inspection of this area reveals a 6-7 story tall, rusted out rocket gantry (complete with a blast pit) no different from the gemeni launch pads a cape canaveral Florida, and other building/hangar-like structures with paddock areas which appeared to be abandoned. On a personal note, I am finishing up degress in both Geology and History and plan on attending graduate school for geology next year. I am very scientific minded and am not prone to making up stories, I have seen some strange things in the sky before, but this event was truley the strangest.", "There was not a sound when i was looking at the object or when it left the area as it dissaperedIt was on the night at which the hail bop comet was circling the earth and could be seen through a telescope me and a friend were outside looking at it then i looked at the trees near where me and him were watching the comet and at the tree tops I saw two saucer shaped disks they had lights going around the outer side of the saucer and it hovered there for about 8 min or so.  There was no sound at all.  So i told my friend to come check it out and he got real sacred cause he did not know what it was.  then from out of nowhere a light came from one of the ufo&apos;s and my friend watching this with me just was in shock and did not move at all.  then from the woods came a grey creature that had a shape of pear for a head and two of the biggest black eyes that i have ever seen and had no mouth and no reproductive organs.  I had then felt a sharp pain in my head and i could hear the creatures thoughts and feel what it was feeling.  then he turned back after the pain in my head had gone away and the object had vanished before my eyes.  and ever since that day in june through the early days in july I have thoes sharp pains like migraines in my head.  And to this day i have gotten strange calls from people claiming to be from the government.", "my friend and I drove out to the country, near his father&apos;s property, which is located in or just outside of Manor, Texas.   we just went out there to talk.  I was leaning against the car and I think he was standing when all of a sudden in the not too far distance we saw an astonishing bright white light that kept getting bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger.   we never saw the craft.   the wild dogs in the area were howling at it.   I was really just so amazed and my friend was feeling more protective and cautious and excited about it, so he said he thought we ought to get in the car.   We got in the car and he took out his rifle.   I said what are you going to do, shoot at a spacecraft???   he answered:   &quot;yes if I have to!&quot; ........ It was very odd ...... we didnt see the spacecraft but we HEARD it CLEARLY ..... the mechanical noise whirring past us ....... it was really a different kind of experience. We were amazed and then curiosity got the best of us and we decided to follow it or go look for it.   We drove a little way down a country road and then decided we were IDIOTS .... for what would we do if we FOUND it?   We got scared and returned to his office where he worked. It was rather a peculiar thing.   It was definitely a mechanical sound but unlike a plane sound, unlike a helicopter sound, unlike anything I&apos;d ever heard before.   I wonder what it was.((NUFOR Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

It was floating in the air. We thought it was hellicopter. We approached until the object was above us and we parked our car aside on the highway. We got out and started to look at it. We didnt see it clearly because it was dark after sunset, but we could see that it was darker against the sky and was triangle shape (around 9pm) had larger yellow light in center and smal light on point and red and blue light on the end corners of the triangle. We didnt hear hellicopter sound and didnt know what was that. We assumed it was not a hellicopter. It floated there for about 15 or 20 seconds and moved away towards where we were coming from. And in its behind we could see bright light in center (on tail side) and red and blue slowly glowing on each corner of its tail side. We watched it until it was gone too far that we could see it anymore with our naked eye. We dont know what was that. Itdidnt look like a plane or hellicopter. It didnt have a jet or some kind of sound. What do you think it is?((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous.  PD))", "One evening when I was returning from classes at the local college, I was driving west on M Street that at that time led back into town from where the college was located on the outskirts.  Merced is located about six miles, I believe south, from Castle Air Force Base, which at that time was a SAC base.  It was very dark, as there were no street lights yet erected, and very little housing along the road.  As I approached town I looked to my right, and out in the field there appeared to be a cone of light shining down from somewhere high in the sky.  My heart started pounding, so I pulled over to the side of the road, and rolled my window down to see if it was possibly a helicopter of some sort.  The cone of light was devoid of light in its center, which is a little hard to explain just how it appeared to me.  It was as if only the edges of the cone were lighted, and the interior was hollow.  It was static, never moved as far as I can remember, but every exact in its appearance.  I sat and watched it for several minutes, never hearing any sound at all.  I assumed any helicopter would have made a sound, but all was silence.  Merced at the time was a very small town, and there were no cars on the road, or foot traffic on the road that night.  I sat there entranced until all of a sudden the cone of light sucked up into itself ... just disappeared as if it had never happened.  With my heart still pounding, and shaking like a leaf, I started the car, drove to my parnets house, and woke my dad up from a sound sleep. I insisted he call the air base to see if they&apos;d spotted anything unusual on their radar, or if they&apos;d received any more reports of a strange sighting.  I spoke with them myself then, and they assured me nothing unusual had been reported, or sighted ... I still, to this day, don&apos;t believe them, because I know what I saw, and didn&apos;t hear.  I can remember how eerily calm the night was, and how totally enchanting the sight was to see a hollow cone of light shining down from high in the sky onto nothing, only a few hundred feet from my car.  As a photographer I&apos;m usually very observant, critical, and attuned to trusting my eye.  There was definetly something strange in the sky that night for me to remember it so vividly today. Since ...  I have seen an irregular triangle of lights hovering above the 405  freeway on the way back from Mexico, and a strange brilliant flash of green light that covered most of the sky, as far as the eye could see, in the area around the San Onofre nuclear plant, and another time coming over what is commonly know as &quot;The Grapevine&quot;, a section of what is now Interstate Five between Los Angeles, and Bakersfield.

PD))", "A very bright , horizontal elliptical disk aprox. the length of a yardstick held at arms length, hovered one hundred feet  away.Before I describe the sighting, I would like to say this is my first public acknowledgement of what I have seen and I do so out of frustration with the smarmy attitude our governments have about the subject of UFOs and to encourage others who have experienced the same to speak out loudly. After reading the &apos;CANADIAN,TEXAS,JANUARY 15, 1993 STATE TROOPERS&apos; report, I was struck by his sense of awe and resignation to the fact that his reality had just been assaulted with the blunt force of indisputable, emperical evidence that we are not alone. This is a feeling that is shared by millions of human beings around the world, including myself, who do not place a &apos;belief&apos; in UFOs on a wish and a prayer or some peculiar fuzzy lights in the sky; but on heart stopping, nerve stunning, in-your-face, up-close and personal &apos;I am HERE, I am BIG and you are very, very small&apos; close encounters with these things. And I&apos;m madder&apos;n hell that this situation goes on every day without any advisement from our so called &apos;by the people for the people&apos; governments whose biggest fear next to real democracy is that we find out in fact they do not nor ever had a clue about what these things are or where they come from. WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS when these things appear, do we greet them with a smile and a handshake or should we run like hell away from them! I think our governments know at least as much to describe the various objects, tell us what the present state of affairs is concerning UFOs, and what is the nature of the contact environment for human interaction with each type; so we can at least act neighborly without putting ourselves into harms way. If these things are dangerous and out to get us, can we pop off a few rounds when they get into our crosshairs?  I think it&apos;s time humanity had a million-man-march on capitols around the world to force the truth out from between those lying teeth of politicians responsible for holding back the truth. This is a new millenium and it&apos;s time for a new world order alright but not the stilted, contrived, patrician &apos;we know better than you&apos; models we now have. Their silly secret society, michiavellian intrigue ways of doing things went out with the buggy whips that remained in the last century; and are as bizarre and artificial as the pathetic face-hip-boob lifts obsessed by celebrities today. There are many, many things that cry out for answers and change in our society, that require a different attitude from human behaviour away from competition and greed. The UFO issue may hold a very significant dimension to the problems our world faces today. For starters, who the hell are they and where do they come from? Are they here to eat us or eat with us? I have had three unforgetable events involving UFOs and I will describe them in three separate reports dated; Oct.07, 1971 - Nov.15, 1987 - March 12, 1997. On approximately October 7, 1971 at 1 AM my wife and I were travelling south east on county road #17 just past Conestoga and approaching Kitchener, Ontario(Canada) city limits. It was a clear moonless night but when we saw a peculiar object hovering above the treetops to our left about 1000 feet away, we considered it to be an interesting effect the moon was causing, reflecting off the top of a silo to look like a flying saucer. As we proceeded along the road I continued to glance over my shoulder expecting it to change shape and get smaller as we moved away from it. However I discovered that not only was it holding its horizontal, elliptical shape, it was getting bigger and brighter.I craned my neck this way and that looking for the moon that I thought might be causing this but didn&apos;t find it. I asked my wife to look out her side of the car to search for the moon and she discovered also, no moon! When I asked her to look over her left shoulder and describe what she saw across the field she confirmed, it was a disk shape and bright as moonlight. I pulled over and stopped the car. By now my wife was frightened and refused to get out of the car, clinging to the doorknob out of fear. I wanted to settle this and conclude it was our movement caused by driving that was responsible for what I expected was an illusion. Up to then my only knowledge of flying saucers was in the realm of science fiction and peculiar stories from history books. I never put much credence in the few current reports I had read and didn&apos;t really know what to think about them, the jury was still out. So I got out of my car and stood very still, bracing myself against it to to be sure of my bearing. Well the disk kept moving very slowly from a WNW direction skirting the top of the forest across the field from us, but not yet coming directly towards us. By now  its scale had gone from a dime size at arms length when we first saw it to a nickle size. Its steady movement and even moonglow illumination convinced me it needed closer inspection. Looking back at my wife I said I was going for a closer look to which she groaned her displeasure. I blythely and quite naively raced across the road towards a point in the field about five hundred feet away where I expected to come as close as I could, considering its trajectory and speed, and the distance I would have to cover in the time I had before it would pass us. This involved a possible encounter with a barnyard dog, in the dark, because we happened to be next to a farm house to our north east. I made it across the yard without incident, over a fence then into the field which was fallow with weeds and short scrub. I ran towards the predetermined point in the field ahead, keeping my eyes on the prize and soon realised it had changed course and was coming towards me. Our paths met quicker  than I expectd and was caught by surprise. Now looking due north, my head canted way back so sharply as to cause me to realise this thing was REALLY close and REALLY big and I should stop NOW. It was as long as a yardstick held horizontaly in your hand at arms length. My best guess was one hundred feet off the ground  and one hundred feet away from me. &quot;Come on down here and talk to me!&quot; I shouted up to it. It just hovered there and glowed. I saw no one, no details, no sound. Just a horizontal, elliptical disk shining like the moon. Out of the corner of my eye I caught the glint of headlights moving up the highway about a mile away so I ran back to the road, flagged the car down, pointed to the UFO and said &quot;Look!&quot; At that moment it went from five inches across at arms length, moved up and away to a pin point and vanished in one second. My wife and I reported it to the night officer at the old OPP station on King street near Rockway Gardens in Kitchener that night. He made a written record of our report, also checking with the local airport for possible flyins or radar evidence. Nothing was reported that night. Since then I have encountered a born again christian and a business man both men of character beyond reproach, confiding to me of encounters they had that were very similar to ours. My wife and I are not sure if there was any time loss but I do recall her remaining in the car terrified. She on the other hand recalls getting out of the car, this being our only point of disagreement with the whole incident.((NUFOR Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))", "Chevron/triangular orbs of light over Long Beach, CA.About mid June 1995 I was outside in the backyard(Long Beach, CA) trying to cool down from the summer heat. My house is only about 2 miles from the Long Beach airport and during this summer evening I just so happen to look up at the sky when I got a sight of a faintly glowing lights moving silently from the ocean toward Los Angeles.  I believe there were 6 lights, arrange closely to each other that it formed a chevron or triangular shape, with the pointed end at the front.  All I saw was the faint light in this formation.  I would move my field of vision away from it slightly but had to search again to find it back because the glowing light formation was so faint.  It was completely silent and move slowly away.  After the lights had passed I could hear other small aircraft in the air, with it&apos;s typical propeller driven engine buzzing in the night sky.  I have only told a few trusted friends about this incident.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.

I remember I was in primary school, but I can&apos;t remember the exact date of the event, I&apos;m pretty sure it happened in 1980, but I&apos;m not sure of the day/month.  It was in the evening, my family was having dinner, I was late &amp; they were calling me for dinner.  I was looking out my bedroom window, I liked to look at the stars at night, the blocks next door were vacant bushland and I had a good view of the stars.  We lived on the beachfront, there were some dunes covered in scrub between our house and the beach.  I remember this event so clearly, it haunts me, at the time I was mesmerised by it.  I called out to my family - &quot;mum, dad, come look, there&apos;s a UFO!&quot;  They didn&apos;t come, they were eating, and laughed at me from the other room.  To this day my family still sometimes recall my &quot;story&quot; and still make fun of me.  If only they had seen what I saw that night.  The UFO did not look like any picture of a UFO that I&apos;ve seen - it was a different shape altogether.  It rose from over the low bushland near the sea, I first saw it when it was about 10 or 20 metres above the ground, I watched it come in from the East/sea, and it moved along a straight path westward, slowly rising.  It seemed to fly so amazingly low, near my house it seemed to fly above the block next door (that I was looking toward from my bedroom window), my bedroom was on ground floor, and the UFO seemed only about twice the height of the black wattle tree next door - probably only 20 to 40 metres up in the air - I couldn&apos;t beleive how close it was.  Somehow it then continued it&apos;s path westward, gliding more towards the south west gently, getting higher and higher, it rose over the tall trees of the swamp at the southern end of the cul-de-sac, and I could no longer see it over the horizon of trees/swamp.  It glided along a smooth straight path the whole time, and it moved so slowly.  I don&apos;t know exactly how fast it moved, it seemed like the pace of someone pedalling along on a bike, maybe 2 minutes?  It seemed forever, but I think that was because of the mind bending experience.  As for the UFO&apos;s appearance - it was NOT a saucer.  There were no little green men.  I did not seen any aliens at all.  But it had a soft glow around it.  The outer seemed greyish, but my eyes were focused in it&apos;s front face - you could see into the front of it, but all I could see was a light pale soft yellow colour, there was no detail.  It was cylindrical in shape - the same sort of shape as a rectangle, but with rounded edges, and not very deep.  It was smooth all over, rounded at the corners, and I could only see into the front, I don&apos;t remember seeing into the back (it was a long time ago).  The shape was sort of like this (it was rectangular, like a long/thin/wide cylinder, kind of a cigar shape from the side, but rectangular if looked at from the top or bottom): Side view: --------- |         | ---------  Front view: ----- (     ) -----  Underside or top view: --------- |         | |         | ---------  That&apos;s the best sort of scale I can get using typed characters!  Remember it was smooth in shape and edges were round, not sharp.  But the front view did have notably rounded sides, like the &apos;()&apos; characters.  To this day I know I saw it, but I doubt myself all the time and it has messed with my self confidence as a result, I was double check things that I do now as a result.  But I know what I saw was a UFO.  It also made NO sound, which was spooky as it was so close to the ground and my house, it made no noise at all.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.  PD))", "NOTE: THIS WAS NOT A UFO! It was a Stealth aircraft, but I wanted to alert the center in case of sightings related to this craft under mistaken identity. I was taking my trash to the curb in my subdivision which is in a residential/agricultural community. Coming from NE to SW is a regular flight path for commercial aircraft coming into and leaving Hartsfield in Atlanta so the distant lights and noise are normal to me at all hours. We also have a local airfield in Lawrenceville, GA which accommodates helos and twin-engine craft for the private as well as business sector. However when I first took the bin to the curb I noticed in a more northerly direction a rather intense bright white light twice the size of the North Star usually seen. I stared at it for a moment then returned to get the recycling bin which took perhaps 30 seconds at most. When I looked up again the &apos;light&apos; had become a huge light within a vast black &apos;triangle&apos; to include a slowly flashing red light and green light in the respective lower corner angles. In the middle and slightly into the craft was a very swiftly flashing red light. I&apos;m really bad as far as judging distance so here goes my method: Holding my hand up at arms length, and &quot;pinching&quot; the object = the commercial jets way up are about 1/4&quot; but this craft was about 3&quot;! So it was very close to earth in flight. And it was totally silent! I watched it go over the roof of my house in the normal flight route and ran to the back to watch it disappear over the treeline to the SW about 30 degrees more than the commercial flight paths. My husband is in the Navy so I called him before getting excited about a UFO. He told me it was a Stealth Aircraft probably heading out toward Texas. He couldn&apos;t elaborate on anything further and I understood. I have had only one other encounter with a triangular object such as this and when I explained that one to him, he said it was most definitely NOT a Stealth aircraft! I shall report that incident next although it took place in MA back in the early 90&apos;s. I just wanted to let you know that if anyone reported this object from the past week. I would also appreciate the confidentiality of the Stealth flight pattern as it is a matter of national security...just wanted to alert you to mistaken reporting. Thank you!", "mt rainier  the craft appeared and disappeared while photo was taken, ufo is in pictureme and my friend went to mt rainier to take pictures it was late evening and i had my back to the mountian as i had the picture taken. my friend noticed a brown sphere appear as the picture was being shot.i turned around to look and noticed it then it disappeard.i was like thats a ufo i had seen previously in moxee,wa but it did not move this time it was stationary while at mt rainier and did not light up this time could i be stalked by a ufo?????? who knows?!?!?!", "it was the a-typical triangle craft....white lights on tips of triangle, low gliding movement, however sounded like conventional engines.   The interesting thing here is that it was being led south by a heavy duty military helicopter.

I noticed a red light that remained stationary for a long time.  It wasn&apos;t a normal light, it was more of a globe and it didn&apos;t blink. I didn&apos;t notice anything drop out of it like others have reported but I did see it depart straight up and away.  The rate of acceleration was greater than anything I have seen before.  I talked about this event for weeks.

There was one large cloud in the distance.  I had just returned from the store was was enjoying a cigarette while I contemplated my lunch options.  I live on top of a hill and have a clear view out over the Forbes Creek area looking out towards the Totem Lake area.  All of a sudden into my field of vision from right behind me a teardrop shaped object shot across the sky.  I had a sight of this for approx. 3-4 seconds at the most steaking to the north east.  It had a silver almost metallic center with a blue outline that seemed almost like a halo or aura.  I have never known anything on this planet to move with such speed and I have witnessed some very fast planes in person.  I could not really tell if the object was falling to earth as I did not see where it came from, so judging the height that it was traveling at was difficult.  It disappeared in to the clouds and I lost sight of it.  My feeling was that it was moving so fast and straight that it had come from behind me and was not falling to earth.  The colors were amazing.  Again nothing in my memory reveals any recognition of a color like the blue that I saw.  It was unnatural for this world is all I can say.  I called King 5&apos;s news desk and they gave me your information.  I find myself to be a pretty practical person and I do question many things.

We looked straight above us and seen a large craft hovering above us. As we watched, the craft started coming down, as it did so it was turning slowiing at the same time. It was the shape of a cylinder and silver in color, and it was all lit up with a light that came from all over the craft. I couldn&apos;t see where the light was coming from, the whole craft was light. We were so frieghtened that we jumped up from the step we were setting on and turned to run in the front door. We were frozen in place and couldn&apos;t move for a short time it seemed.  I could move my eyes, but that was all.  I seen my niece beside me frozen too.

Then, it slowed abruptly and stoped brieflyand reversed backwards and upwards at about a 45 degree angle. The light then slowly moved vertically downwards and then continued on its original trajectory before literally fading away....I am extremely freaked out I had never seen anything quite like this...so i logged online and found this site to report it...((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

As I observed the aircraft, I notice directly behind it at approximately 15k feet was a slow moving shining sphere. I immediately ran inside and retrieved my binoculars and digital camera.My first priority was to photograph the object but I had a very difficult time locating it in the viewer because of the distance. Using the top of cameras housing as a gun site I aimed and took three photos. Upon review using the LCD viewer I could not determine if I had succeeded in photographing the object. I traded the camera for my binoculars to get a better look. At first the object look like a scientific weather balloon with what appeared to be rigging hanging down from bottom to where a payload would be attached. It was at this point I justified my conclusion when I remembered strange news report earlier in the week of reports of weather balloons over the WTC site in Manhattan. As I continued observation of object with my binoculars, I could see that the rigging and payload at the bottom of object was swinging back and forth at a very violent rate. This seemed odd to me because the sphere did not oscillate nor did the rigging whip, while this was happening. Then just as my site of the object was to be blocked from trees, the bottom of the object turned bright orange that engulf three quarters of the sphere. At this point my view was blocked. I tried to circling around trees and climbing up on my deck to get a better view. After a few minutes and to my disappointment the object seemed to have disappeared and I could not relocate it. I did manage to get two blurry pictures of what looks like a white pinhead in the blue sky.", "3 unidentified aircraft spotted on highwayI had just gotten done playing at a wedding gig and me along with my quartet was talking with each other while I was just looking out of the window of the car.  I was in the back seat of the car on the right side. I love looking a star formations and consolations but I noticed an extremely bright star.  then i thought maybe it was a planet.  I told my friends to look at how bright this str was.  it was stationary I believe. we all kept looking to debate on whether it was a star or a planet.  I bet that it was a planet, anmd the driver of the vehicle thought it was an airplane tower, we all were looking to see a pole and as we drove closer( by the way it was on a highway 285 in Marietta, south I believe) we noticed it had 3 lights i think 2 white ones on either side and on e red in the middle. I was amazed becuase I knew no US aircraft could remain stationary like that. it moved sowly and later as we were passing it we noticed a second next to it. the two were flying slowing near each other. The Aircraft weren&apos;t close enough to really see a shape but I believe it must&apos;ve been a saucer considering the position of the lights.  we kept driving and then I saw another one a few up the highway.  that was too akward for 3 planes to be that close to each other. I kept staring at the objects and later disregarded them, but still thinking about why I would even mistake an aircraft for a star. I&apos;ve never done that and seems highly unlikely. I didn&apos;t believe it to be a military aircraft, because that would be too blunt for the military to fly 3 aircraft in the same location for everyone to see. but I really am not sure, I just hope someone else saw this besides my quartet and I to verify it.", "Brilliant object fades then arches across sky and disappers.Witnessed extremely bright object moving from south to north approximately 12o&apos;clock high in sky.

Then we saw what he saw. It was a round silver matalic color at first and then it turned bright yellow. Not sure if it was lit up like a fireball or if it was just reflecting the sunlight. It traveled very slowly from Northwest to Southeast. It went behind a cloud but you could still see the yellow shining through. It then came out of the clouds and continued in the same direction that it had been moving..still very slowly. The Bar B Q was done at about 7:18 pm so we brought it in the house.

I had tried to go to sleep but for some reason, I was suddenly full of energy even though  half an hour ago I was wiped. I went down to the kiychen to get a glass of water. As I drank it I glanced through the window at the lake. It was breath-taking as the moon light was reflected on the surface. Then I notied something moving. It looked like a number of bright objects were racing all over the water surface. Then it hit me, the images I was watching were reflections! I glanced upat the night sky and what I saw I will never forget, six to nine blurry lights were dancing through the night sky. At first I thought they were just spot lights or northern lights. But I soon realized that neitherof them could be going as fast or as bright as the objects I was watching. I dashed inside to wake my family. We watched the lights, fascinated for 5 minutes while my uncle went to grab a telescope.This was a very nice telescope and on clear nights could see mars as a reddish light. So he came running back with this telescope and peered through it. We all in turn looked at the dancing lights and I can only describe them as roundish balls emiting a bright pale green colour. We did not seem them in huge detail but enough that I could be sure that they were nothing man-made.The lights pranced across the sky for a while longer until they receded up into the black oblivion of space. The very next morning, crop circles had appeared right under the lights. I do not know to believe weither it was a very elaborate prank or, it was actually real ufo&apos;s. But I find it difucult to believethat humans could have made crop circles that intricate as the ones we saw the lights dancing above on that memorable night.", "Cylindrical objects hover soundlessly over Dallas suburb May 22, 2005.Cylindrical-shaped, wingless object caught my attention during sunset.  It was approximately 100 degrees above the horizon south south-west of Waxahachie, a suburb of Dallas, TX.  Object appeared when it caught the light of the sun, then disappeared, reappeared, several times.  It appeared to be very high, and hovered above the area soundlessly.  It remained motionless for several minutes. A companion, in the south at about the same altitude, appeared to be identical in shape and was also motionless until it disappeared. As the daughter of a pilot and aeronautical engineer, I am familiar with many types of aircraft -- none of which are shaped like these two objects or hover soundlessly for minutes.", "BLUE GREEN Cylinder/Bullet object with RED aura seen over Yerington, NevadaOn 5 June 2005, at approx. 2135 hrs. my vehicle along with another vehicle were travelling north on Alt 95 Hwy a few miles north of Yerington, Nevada. There were 4 adults in the two vehicles. We were travelling together and were in communication by portable radios. My business partner called me on the radio, and asked; &quot;DID YOU SEE THAT?&quot; I answered him and said &quot;YES! and explained to him I thought it was just a reflection in the window from passing cars. The object was seen at the above time and date. As we were travelling north, and I always carry a GPS handheld, I instantly looked at the time, and turned on the GPS for the exact location. The object came from out of NNE at about 30 degrees off north. I estimated the object at 35 degrees off the horizen, it was travelling at an angle of 25 to 30 degrees heading towards the mountains in front of our direction of travel in which the object disappeared behind after 2-3 seconds of the sighting. The object came in from the east heading in a west direction. The object was &quot;cylinder&quot; shaped, even a &quot;bullet&quot; shape as my business partner descibed it. The object made no sound, no other a/c were noted in the area, no other lights were seen after or prior to the sighting. The object did not emit any other objects or lights. What all that saw the object was a &quot;RED&quot; aura on the bottem, and a &quot;BLUE/GREEN&quot; light half way up the object, this aura light was bright in intensity. Holding out my hand at arms length, the size of the object was 1/4 inch thick and 1/2 inch long. Taking a best educated guess, this was a very large object! Because of the darkness of the mountains and trees in the area, I could not reference a distance and or a true altitude. As we were at about 3-4000 feet in altitude, my best guess the altitude was at least 10,000 to 15,000 feet  (See drawing enclosed, lines are only drawn to show direction and movement)  As my spouse was driving,(she did not see the object) I was in the passenger seat of our VW Jetta. I noticed the object coming out of the right corner of the window coming in from the east towards the mountains in front of us...  The mountains were about 30-40 miles north of our position, as Hwy. 50 crosses Hwy Alt 95 which goes into Silver Springs, Nevada. My business partner and I compared notes at to what we both saw. The other witness was a 20 year old woman, who was driving my business partners car also at the time of the sighting. (Their statements will be posted or mailed at a later date.) My business partner is 22 years old, works at a casino and owns his own internet business, the woman is 20 and works at a resturant. My background is 12 years in the USAF, several years in financial services and many years self employed. From my military experince, this was no known military or commercial aircraft that I know of. I have witnessed meteors, fireballs, and resently while in Colorado Springs, Colorado the falling of space junk which lit up the sky in a shower of sparkler lights... In all my years I have never seen anything that would remotely compare to what this object was. I would say it was a solid object, with a &quot;RED&quot; aura on the bottem and a &quot;BLUE/GREEN&quot; upper half and shaped like a cylinder/bullet in design. The estimated speed that the object was moving? Taking a college guess I would estimate the object travelled over 20-30 miles in 2-3 seconds. Estimated location of object; Lat; 39.06826 N    Long; 119.14044W  NOTE: The following day, while in Reno, Nevada, my business partner did experience a severe nosebleed for about 5 min. Again, he is 22 years old, and expressed to me, that he had never had a nosebleed before. His mother even lived in Reno, and he was sorta used to the altitude. I did tell him it could be the altitude and the dryness that may of caused the nosebleed episode. At the time of our sighting of this &quot;unknown&quot; I would estimate there were a half dozen other vehicles going north in front and behind us because the main Hwy 95 was flooded out due to a dam breaking and flooding the highway at Fallon, Nevada. So several vehicles had to be detoured. Hopefully, others will call or send in their reports from that area. As mentioned, the two other witnesses will submit their reports to me shortly, and I will forward these to NUFORC.", "Chevron shaped Grey Object seen hoveringI was out last night catching some fresh air on my back porch, when I saw an chevron shaped object seem to hover in the sky.

The sky was clear, with stars throughout the sky easily visible. At approximately the eleven o&apos;clock position in the south, south-east sky, I saw what I thought was a triangle of stars, presumably part of a constellation, when I realized they were moving in unison towards the south, south-east. The three lights were shining steadily and unblinking. Their estimated brightness was between 3rd and 4th magnitude stars(probably closer to 4th magnitude.)  The object or objects made no noise that I could hear. The lights were rather slow moving as compared to aircraft I have seen in the night sky. The triangle shape was that of an isosceles triangle. One light in front, the other two at the rear. I would estimate the distance between the two rear lights as approximately the width of the full moon disc. The distance from the rear lights to the front light was approximately twice the distance as that between the rear lights. After about 60 to 90 seconds, the lights faded from view(Due to haze in the sky perhaps, as the front light disappeared first; the following two almost immediately thereafter.)  My spouse also witnessed the lights.", "Four white lights moving fast dispersing blue laser lights from the object off of Interstate 30 west near Rockwall, Texas.I am submitting a report for my daughter and her friends on what they saw on June the 1st, 2005 on their way home from Texarkana, Texas.  They were about 30 minutes outside of Texarkana on Interstate 30 West and they witnessed in a field a bright light, like a lightning bolt coming up from the ground. The light came up from the ground and then made a circular motion.  They thought that was weird because they had never seen anything like that before!  And then as they got closer to their destination they noticed on the north side of the highway brights lights in the sky, the lights were white.  It was moving real fast, not like an aircraft.  And then it disappeared.  About 20 minutes later they noticed the lights again in the sky.  This time it was much closer to them and they witnessed blue laser lights coming out of the craft.  They were dispersed one at a time four times.  It was over an open field at that time.  This is when the mom driving slammed on her brakes and everyone starting crying.  They were so scared.  And then the craft flew over them at that time the mom opened her sunroof on her car and they noticed it was triangular shaped and the wings appeared to be transparent. The craft went behind them and blinked the four lights three times and disappeared. When they arrived home they were all shaken up and couldn&apos;t believe what they just witnessed.  The witnesses were a 35 year mom and her 12 year daughter, my 12 year old daughter and another little 12 year old girl.  I believe they really experienced something unusual and they would be considered very reliable witnesses.  In that area there is hardly ever any aircrat flying in that rural area.  We were hoping that someone else witnessed the sighting.  We did not report it to any of the authorities so we decided to contact this website to see if anyone could help us figure out what was the sighting that they encountered.", "Silent triangle formation of three lights at extreme altitudeA girl friend of mine and myself drove out to this &quot;place&quot; called Devil&apos;s Backbone about 20 miles west of San Marcos Texas to watch the sunrise. The &quot;place&quot; is really just a highway scenic overlook on a high ridgeline.  It is very dark, and overlooks the city lights of Wimberly about 15 miles distant. My friend and myself were completely sober, and were looking for a &quot;romantic&quot; experience subsequent to a night of talking. I am a huge aviation enthusiast, and ex military. I was hoping to see the usual things one might see at 4 AM such as satelites, the space station, meteors, venus, etc. We noticed moving from West to East at an altitude appearing equal to satalites a formation of what appeared to be 3 &quot;satalites&quot; in a loose, but not equilateral triangle formation. Stars were visible between the formation, so it was not one craft, but three. The objects were visible as unblinking, dim lights and moved in a constant direction at a constant speed. The speed was consistent with other satalites I&apos;ve seen. The formation was spaced about 1.5 inches apart at arms length. (Assuming low earth orbit) the triangle formation would have covered an area of at least one square mile. The ojects passed directly overhead, and dissapeared off to the East, as they grew too dim to see against the stars. The girl had an extreme reaction to this sighting and ran back to the car, crying. I told her it was probably just three satalites in formation, to calm here down. There was no sound with this sighting. I am color blinde, so the there was no color to report. Everything was consistent with three satalites flying in a loose triangle formation, however satalites do not fly in formation. The entire sighting lasted about 3 minutes, but has stuck with me to this day. I was prompted to post it when reading another identical sighting in Texas on your sight which I have included for a reference. Just a side note... I recently met a Sr. Officer with the Air Force Space Warfare Command and he assured me that there were &quot;OTHER THINGS&quot; in our inventory in addition to spy satalites. Perhaps these were Air Force Craft of some sort.   Occurred : 6/17/2005 04:40 (Entered as : 06/17/2005 4:40) Reported: 6/17/2005 11:53:34 AM 11:53 Posted: 6/20/2005 Location: Goodrich, TX Shape: Light Duration:2 minutes 3 star like objects moving in unison with precision to the north, no change in direction, like small constellation moving fast  I awoke on June 17 at 4:30 in the morning to get the best view of the stars. I am an amateur astronomer, but I usually view the sky in the early evening to about midnight. The milky way is just to the west of my house at this time of the morning. As soon as I stepped onto my upper deck I began to gaze at the sky. A flash of light is what originally got my attention. When I focused on the spot just to the west of me, I noticed three star like lights with the magnitude of about 5 1/2. They were moving in perfect formation like a large 100 degree triangle pointing in the north to about 5 degrees maybe to the east. They seemed to be following the milky ways direction or they were atleast in that portion of the sky. They did not twinkle or vary from their formation. They continued in their direction, northwardly, until they were lost in the distance. It took about 1 to 2 minutes for them to pass from almost directly above me to the horizon. I am not usually up at this time, but I know this is a popular time to view satellites and I have never seen one to know the difference between ufos and normal celestial objects that would be moving that way. Another thing. I could see stars inside the triangle so it was not one solid object. It was like watching a small constellation move across the sky. There was no sound of jets, but I live along side a noisy highway so there was some highway noise. What made this seem so special was the way they moved with such precision together across the sky. I think there is a logical explination for this, but would like to know if what I saw was a ufo. I don&apos;t know why I saw a flash of light first, or if that has anything to do with the formation. It could have been a shooting star, but what a coincidence. I live about 60 miles north of Houston so there is alot of air traffic and they go in that direction the most. I think I have included everything to the best of my knowledge. I hope it is relevent. I am a christian who believes that if God included everything about our universe, the Bible would never end. He lets us figure some things out for ourselves. I believe we are the only humans with the ability to have the holy spirit in our hearts, but nature is an awesome thing. God bless all the scientist and curious people reading this and happy researching. P.S. On the 15th, two days ago we had a major black out over 10 counties lasting from 7pm to 1am.

It went beyond the tree line where I think it made a circle and I saw it reappear heading north. It was blinking, but the light was blinking more on than off.

The sighting occured when a fairly wide peak came into sight.  At this point, two people saw a gold or yellow colored saucer shaped craft, slowly decending towards their vehicle.  The UFO then stood idle for about ten second, and eventually ascended into the clouds, and never returned.  The witnesses then reported the sighting to a California State Patrol Officer, who told the witnesses that the craft was an airplane from the nearby airport.  The witness acknoledge this thought, but realize that the UFO was of a distinct saucer shape, unlike one of any known aircraft.", "((NUFORC Note:  Possible satellites.  We spoke with the witness via telephone, and she stated that she had never seen a satellite in the evening sky, before this incident.  PD))Objects  with lights flashing all around - with one being very clearly a triangular shaped object, as well as moving &quot;stars.&quot;We were sitting outside on our patio approx 10:30 when I noticed a flickering object moving in the sky coming in the direction of the house.  It was just above tree-top level so if it had been an airplane one would have heard the sound.  I asked my dgtr what it was and she dismissed it as a plane.  However, a few mins later another object exactly like the first came through in exactly the same direction as though following an imaginary road in the sky.  And then a few mins later yet another object came through, although when this last one came through it got to a certain point over the house so to speak and it made &quot;contact&quot; with a moving &quot;star.&quot;  The object flickered on finally in the same direction as the first two and then the &quot;star&quot; moved on in another direction.  These same objects came back from the direction that they went and then &quot;disappeared&quot; after a certain point. The moving &quot;star&quot; appeared again and then we seen another &quot;star&quot; and it went in the same direction as the first &quot;star.&quot; We could not tell the shape of the flickering objects until we seen it for the last time.  After awhile there was a &quot;break&quot; in activity.  And then an object just appeared in the sky just above tree-top level and it was really visible.  It was triangular in shape with the point of the triangle being the front of the craft with flashing red, green, and white lights all around it.  Since we have seen these objects - the first sightings Sat - over Independence weekend - we have seen these same objects every night since.  Although, the one that was really visible and shaped like a triangle - we have not seen one quite as clear as that one since the first sighting - yet.  We keep seeing flashing lights moving in and coming from the same direction as the first night (or approx vicinity.)  And we keep seeing moving &quot;stars&quot; that appear to maintain the same directions/movements as well.  These objects make no sound whatsoever.((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))We attempted to enter the date in the form required but it would not allow us.  However, the date of the first sighting was Saturday, July 2, 2005 at approx 10:30p.m.; and we have been seeing the same objects, i.e., objects with flashing lights and moving &quot;stars&quot; since that time.((END))", "While looking toward rocking Chair mountian from the North side close to cottonwood desert area at 22:00 hrs A huge Sphere came from the sky, Green Floresent size larger than 1/4 mile in circumference Made 3 huge blasts of Floresent green slowing at each blast,outer area lighter same color.

The drive was uneventful to Rachel other than dodging Jack Rabbits.  On the way back on Hwy. 375, approx. 30 miles SE of Rachel where the road is straight for 7 - 8 miles before the intersection with Hwy. 93, I noticed a single bright light in front of us about 15 degrees about the horizon.  It reminded me of a train headlight because it seemed to be a single light and very bright.  I asked my wife if she saw it and she said &quot;yes&quot;. I watched it as I drove on and another light appeared to the south of the first light at the same height.  As the second light appeared, I noticed the first light either turn or dim.  It looked like it turned but I could still see it only dimmer.  The second light then disappeared or went out and a few seconds later the first light was back to its&apos; original brightness.  The second light then came back on for about 20 seconds and then went out. We kept driving and the lights disappeared behind the hills before we got back to Hwy. 93. I have seen video of sightings that were dismissed as military night training flairs and such and would like to know if this could have been something like that.  I have never seen anything like this before and the flairs explanation doesn&apos;t make sense if the light goes out or dims and then returns in the same location.  I regret not stopping along the road to watch these lights instead of continuing to drive.  My wife says it was probably something explanable but she did see them also. I see why Hwy. 375 is called the Extraterrestrial Highway.", "It was very simular to the one on your sight which was seen in Kirkland.  It was a clear night with plenty of stars about, and i was looking up admiring them when I caught sight of this dark object which flew overhead, it was triangular and had lights down the two leading edges the strange thing about it was the lack of any noise, it just seem to glide across the sky, as it passed overhead it blotted out the stars, which discounted my wifes notion that it was a flock of geese with the street lights reflecting off their wings, unfortunately it was gone before we could really see what it was really like.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD))", "Picture was taken with digital camera. The UFOs appeared in the picture only.  Possibly light affects. The UFOs are in multiple colors and various sizes.((NUFORC Note:  The &quot;objects&quot; in the photo look like lens flares, resulting from pointing the camera in the direction of the Sun.  PD))", "Disk shaped object hovered briefly then travelled eastward, captured video footage of it as it left.Went out to the backyard to check on the pool. (Sometimes, the Polaris sweeper gets stuck or tangled, which requires regular babysitting when it is in operation.)  While doing so, I heard a plane flying nearby.  I like airplanes so I try to catch a glimpse of them when I hear them. I could tell it was close by the sound but couldn&apos;t see it anywhere. A few seconds later, I saw it pop up from behind some trees that were blocking my view to the northwest. It was a small single-propeller airplane, probably a Cessna. As I watched it for a second or so, I noticed a dark object roughly in the same line of sight as the plane but approximately twice as far and about twice the altitude. At first, the object seemed to be changing shapes and I thought it was a bird or perhaps a garbage bag that the wind had gotten hold of. As I kept watching, I noticed that the object was stationary. By then I was fixated and I realized that the object was not changing shapes but rather was changing its orientation, which made it appear to change shapes. The way the object&apos;s profile was changing was consistent with a disk shape that seemed to be wobbling, much like the way a spinning coin wobbles just before it rests on the table... only much slower. While I watched, I saw it start to move slowly and steadily towards the east. When I first saw it, it was directly north of me in my backyard. There was a layer of scattered clouds at the time and they made for a good background to provide contrast for the object. Once, the sun peaked out for a few seconds and I caught a glimpse of a shine that made the object appear metallic. As the object moved away, I mustered up the will to peel my eyes from it and ran into the house to get the new camcorder I bought a little over a month ago. My wife was napping at the time so I didn&apos;t have to explain my odd behavior. By the time I returned to the backyard, the object had gotten very far. To further exacerbate the situation, I&apos;m not very proficient with the video camera and had to use &quot;Easycam&quot; mode and hope for the best while I tried to control my excitement. I captured approximately two minutes of footage showing the object moving away from me in an eastward direction. I zoomed in on the object a couple of times to highlight it but most of the footage is unzoomed to keep surrounding trees and structures within the frame for reference. The camera that was used is a Sony DCR-DVD403. I have sent a copy of the DVD that it produced to your address in Seattle. The third clip on the disk has the most useful footage. As for me, I have a degree in Mechanical Engineering (B.A.Sc.) from the University of Ottawa. For the past twelve years, I have been cultivating a successful career in the field of IT. I am currently employed by a major IT outsourcing company as an Infrastructure Specialist.

I looked around and saw it, it was black or dark gray, and, from what i could tell, disk shaped. It was stationary for about 5 minutes, and it made all of us feel very strange when we spotted it. After the  five minutes it moved a little and sort of tilted on it&apos;s side and flew away very quickly. We hadn&apos;t realized that it could have been a UFO until later, when we actually started discussing what it could have been.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous.

For the longest time I didn&apos;t tell anyone but my husband, partly because I didn&apos;t know who to tell and partly because I was afraid of how it would sound.  I am 53 yrs old now and have no psychological disorders, nor have I ever suffered from such a disorder. I have also never seen anything like this again. Around 5:30 p.m. one evening I turned onto route 78 traveling south towords our home in a little town, Laura, Illinois.  There were no other cars on the road when I saw it, and I was in a farming area which was open fields only.  I am sure that many other people saw the object also that night, because it must have been seen by the cars passing on the nearby expressway.  I was 10 miles from home at the point I first noticed it, and near the intersection of Illinois route 78, and U.S. route 150.  The sky was dark, and just as I turned south onto route 78 I saw a large, redish-organge cigar shaped light traveling what I estimated to be upwards of 500 miles per hour.  The light was traveling due west and it took only moments for the craft to travel completely accross the sky and out of my sight.  The object was at least 10 times the size of a commercial airplane but made no sound whatsoever, and was flying at about the height of a 20 story building. As soon as I saw it, I drove as fast as my car would travel twords home, believing that my world was coming to an end because the only thing that I had seen that looked something like this was a picture of a guided missle.  When I arrived home I thought my husband would be meeting me at the door since something like this would surely have been on the news.  After it became clear that this was not the case, we waited for the evening news to hear what I saw, but apparantly no one else had reported it either.  I have never heard anything about what I saw in the sky that night. I&apos;m glad that I&apos;ve finally gotten this out in the open, and thank you for listening.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.

It slowly moved down towards the city.  I alerted my neighbor and we both took pictures.  We noticed that it was glowing, but could also make out slight blue and red colors.  Then it started going back up, very slowly.  The at one point, another smaller dot moved away from it like it was projected to the left.  After 15 or so seconds, it disappeared.  I took more pictures and watch as it slowly made it way toward the East.  It was still up there moving after an hour.  My neighbor later told me that a couple hours later he saw the dot while driving in Atwater Village.  The strangest thing is the pictures.  Upon development, the pictures show now only the dot, but other streaks of light, maybe something moving fast or something being projected (?).   And most striking, a handful of darker dots all around the pictures and the object.  The look like dark spots, but a couple of the pictures show a red spot in the middle of the dot.  I have no idea what those were, since they were not visible by my naked eye, but show up on every single photo.", "The objects were dark and circular. They would disappear and then reappear in a different location.One object seemed to be in the shape of a dome on top. I saw one, then two and three. There were most usually two. The odd thing is that as I was taking pictures of these dark objects, I began to notice the clouds changing aways toward the right of them. I took three pictures of the changing formation. I was using a digital camera and when I took the picture of the large configuration, my camera went totally black except for the normal information readout. I have never had this happen before. I tried repetedly to take a picture and it just wouldn&apos;t work. Even the viewfinder was black. I had to turn it off and then turn it on again.

It had 4 amber lights (2 horizantal &amp; 2 diaginal) at the bottom and the shape above the lights was a cone shaped, with a grayish color. I called a friend of mine due to fear, and was talking to her when out of no where there appeared 4 more lights in a vertical row.  I told her what was happening and my 9yr old daughter woke up to my panic and saw all of this as well, and eventually my 7yr old son woke up and saw this also. The lights continued to stay for awhile, went out then reappeared. We went through the first range of mountains and you could not see them from behind them. Then out of no where again the lights appeared on the other side of the mountain in a &quot;V&quot; formation, the left far end light went out and then reappeared about 3 seconds later hundreds of feet/yards from where it went out.

It looked as if a giant headlight were hanging in the night sky.

I&apos;m sure you&apos;re familiar with the term &quot;no inertia&quot;...it hung in the sky for several seconds and then took off without any build-up to a speed of what a small airplane might run at if it were at full speed.  But like I said, when it took off it was instantly at that speed. There was absolutely no sound coming from the object as it paced itself to a point in the distance about 1-2 miles away from us and then...WOOOSH!  it shot straight up through the clouds exactly like in the movies...the speed mirrored a bolt of lightning.

I cannot recall the exact date only that i know it happened a week after reported seeing a  strange &quot;crash&quot; of an unknown object on Mt Kearsarge in Warner NH. I am trying to find articles in the newspapers to get the date it was definately covered in the papers {i can find nothing online). The Civil Air Patrol searched the mountain and found nothing. I distincly remember this being late October or early to mid November. there were two witnesses to this event. myself (at the time i was in my earl 20&apos;s and going to school I am now 33 years old and work for a high tech company in the GIS field). My Mother ( a retired school teacher)  saw the last half of the objects sighting, their manuevers and their sudden speeding off. I had also been on the phone with my brother who was away at college and i was describing to him what i was seeing. We both agreed that no planes could ever pull off the manuevers these did in such a tight formation and then suddenly shoot off like they did.. This sighting happened for well over 10 minutes. I reported this to MUFON some years ago in NH but never got a response back. I am suprized nobody else had seen this or if they did they never reported it?  All these years  I have wondered this. I have no reason to make this up and what i saw is what i saw and i just want to find out what the hell this was and why it happened a week after the report of a crash on MT Kearsarge. Hopefully someone else will read this and will say &quot;I saw it too&quot;. I wish i had been able to photgraph these lights. But i can also draw what i saw quite clearly. Its something you don&apos;t forget.on to what we saw:  It was around 7:15pm on a clear calm fall evening. I had gone outside to look around at the sky since it was so clear and it was not too cold. After about 10 minutes outside  I started to notice something through the leafless trees as I faced South. There was a bank of red lights that suddenly shifted to green and then they went out. I thought that was rather strange. It seemed to me to possibly be the edge of a huge black featureless object but i cannot be certain because i did not get a full clear view.The main objects appeared directly south of me across a field . I would say they must have been about a mile away. Size based on distance they were about the size of a dime. [by this time it was around 7:30pm where i opened the backdoor and called my mother to come see this careful to keep observing] There were two formations of yellowish lights (almost like incandecent lightbulbs). each formation was in a rough upside down scewed L shape they moved at the same speed slowly together holding their formation. There were 12  total objects with 6  in each formation. At first i thought they were two solid objects until they pulled their manuevers.  I heard no sound whatsoever. Then several of them did some incredible manuevers shifting their position in the formation. That part really freaked me out.  they then shot off  at an incredible speed.[this sequence lasted roughly 1 minute] My Mother only saw the few moments when they did some anomalistic motion and then shot off at high rate of speed (near blink of an eye speed).  I was a little shaken with what i saw and it still sorta gives me the creeps today. I travel I-89 frequently at night  and see lots of strange stuff.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.

It was difficult to discern a shape for the lights, but each was visible for about 3 seconds, then disappeared, afterwhich another one appeared, travelled along the falling star trajectory, then disappeared.   I went to search for my camera and when I finally found it, these shapes we&apos;re no longer appearing.  I focused the camera in the general vicinity where we saw the observation and noticed a bright light that was far up in the sky...possibly near the stars.  It was moving erratically and rapidly...travelling across the field of view of several stars in only seconds and changing direction rapidly. I captured this observation on videotape.", "A friend and I spotted a flying object that was Triangular with a white &quot;V&quot; on the front of it in Rockville Centre, NY.Me and my friend were really bored on a dark summer night in RVC, NY.  We were waiting for some other people to show up, and we started pulling stuff to do out of his garage.  We found a hoolahoop, and being the teenagers that were were (and still are) we really didn&apos;t use it for it&apos;s purpose.  We stood in the middle of the dead-end in front of his house and threw the hoolahoop as high as we could.  We were alternating turns, and eventually it was his turn. He threw the hoolahoop up into the dark sky, and it came dropping back to the ground.  The thing was, my friend didn&apos;t watch the hoolahoop drop...in fact, he was still looking in the sky as the hoolahoop came a couple yards away from landing on him.  He asked, &quot;What is that?&quot;  I didn&apos;t know what he was talking about, so I looked DIRECTLY above where we were standing.  At first, I thought I saw what appeared to be white toilet paper flying high in the sky.  I&apos;m not too sure if I saw this correctly or not, but I THINK it may have changed shape/form.  Maybe my eyes were still adjusting, but when I looked harder it became apparent that I was seeing a big white &quot;V&quot;.  As I looked harder, I saw the rest of the craft...and it was a large black triangle with a white &quot;V&quot;-shaped stripe on the front of it.  It looked almost like a GIANT hang-glider.  The only problem with that solution is that Long Island is flat.  There is no hang-gliding here and there is no possible way to jump off any mountain or cliffs simply because there are none of that size.  It appeared to be roughly the length of a professional hockey rink, and it made absolutely no noise.  It was traveling from somewhere above my friend&apos;s house towards the other side of the street in a slow straight line. My friend was like &quot;It&apos;s a UFO, It&apos;s a UFO!&quot;  He ran inside to get his mother to come out and see it and he told me to make sure to watch where it goes.  It continued to cross for about two minutes before I eventually lost sight of it in the street light.  The object had no lights, and made no sound what-so-ever.

I just had my binoculars focused when i noticed the object started to move. My heart started beating real fast as i watched it pass directly over my house.The object was a brilliant white point in the sky larger and brighter than any sattalite or planet I have ever watched in the sky. The object moved on a straight path from West/N.W. to East/S.E. It made no sound and, from my best quess was at an elevation   equal to or slightly higher than airliners at their maximun cruzing altitude. The object had no other lights blinking or otherwise that i could see, it was traveling at a very high speed.As soon as it passed over me i ran to the back door of my house and started to pound on it, my body tingling from my adrenaline rush, i had to get a second opinion or maybe just have someone else see it too.

One was a small, steady (not pulsing) pinpoint of light about the size and brightness of a mid- sized star and reddish- orange in color. The other was an extremely bright white light that was about five or six times larger than the orange light and it was very slowly pulsing on and off, but, not in the manner that a strobe light does and it was much more brilliant than any aircraft strobe I have ever seen. The white light object was not directly behind the orange light, but, was off to the side and rear and obviously on track and/or seeming to be in pursuit of it. They were not close enough together to be mistaken as being a single object (unless it was an immense thing, thousands of feet long) and neither had conventional aircraft style multi- colored lights as are typically seen. They were both only single points of light as described. After a few seconds, I got my senses and ran to the bedroom window and yelled for my wife to hurry and come see this and I continued to watch and did not lose sight of them. When she made it outside and I showed her, she said, &quot;What is that?&quot; and I told her that I didn&apos;t know, but, they were definitely not any kind of airplanes or jets. By that time the objects were in the west/southwest sky at about 40 degrees. Then, just as quickly as it appeared, the white light completely vanished and the orange light continued trekking west until it went out of our sight. Neither seemed to make any manuevers to turn or change altitude. There were no audible sounds and I did not notice any other aircraft in the sky during that time, at least, not in the same viewing area. Total time I would estimate at 18- 20 seconds. A side note: About eight or ten minutes later, two large planes at moderate altitude, one in front of the other and with identical lighting flew directly overhead from the east on a due west heading. The lighting on them was not like commercial aircraft, but, they were assuredly conventional aircraft. I thought the event was definitely spectacular and out of the ordinary.

At the first couple of minutes  I Thought it was sort of military aircraft activity. Then the 3 distance lights splitted while two of them maintained about 500m ahead about 500m- 1000m high above the road, and the 3rd went down. I would guess to about 100m or less above my car. No extra-ordinary lights were seen beside the exact triangular shape of the object. No effect was seen on the car, everything kept working as it was prior to the encounter.

We were watching the skys and out from the southeast moving northwest, we observed an aircraft with 3 colored lights, moving in a silent slow pace within what I was assuming normal jetliner height.  With the breeze coming from the same direction we saw the aircraft but, we never heard it.  Within 10 seconds after seeing the object the triangular patterened non-blinking lights on the craft turned off.  We both thought this was quite unusual and I began to track the craft with my right hand index finger extended under my right eye to judge the speed.  Approximately 7 seconds had elapesed and we heard the afterburner of a jet aircraft, with its light flashing, persuing directly behind the first craft.  I would say within 5 seconds of sighting the jet aircraft, the lights of the first craft turned back on and, to both myself and my friend&apos;s amazement, 2 more identically lighted aircraft zipped in on both sides of the lead aircraft making an arrowhead formation.  The three aircraft started to speed up and then make an extraordinary sharp 90 degree turn to the north/northeast. After the turn there level of speed was unbeleivable.  We raced to the right side of the house down the driveway and we saw all three aircraft dissapear within seconds.  We raced to the back yard where we saw the persuing jet just making it to the point where the three craft had meet.  The speed was just incrediable, in a blink they were gone.

For some reason, I thought it was coming from a B-52 bomber  ( we had them flying overhead constantly back then, being on the flight path from Westover Air Force Base, in nearby Chicopee , Ma. They had nuclear weapons on the base back then ...)  Anyway , there was no way it could be coming from a plane, as it was coming from the woods ,directly behind the house .

It wasn&apos;t above the trees or right below the clouds, it was about halfway.  It had been a full moon about a week before, and a quarter moon the day after I saw the craft, so it was pretty bright out.  It was also clear, no clouds in the sky at all.  After I heard the noise I ran outside as fast as I could to see what it was.  I about ran over my dad, so he wondered what was going on and came after me.  He was in the Navy for about 20 years, and said it sounded just like a helicopter, but it sure didn&apos;t look like one.  The craft seemed really big, bigger than a helicopter would be on the ground..maybe about the size of a rectangle-shaped airplane.  There was a big white light in the front middle of the craft, and a big red light on the back left corner, and a big green light on the back right corner.  None of these lights were flashing or doing anything, but they were really big and seemed too far apart and too big, even if it was a helicopter.  Like stated in my last UFO post, I&apos;m an avid believer of UFOs, but I&apos;m 100% open to explanation.  My town has a population of around 25-30k, and the only airport we have is municipal so airplanes aren&apos;t widely seen around here.  The craft was flying south, and was out of my sight fairly quickly.  Like I stated before, it was quite large, and it was like a silhouette..the corners and shape were very distinct.  I drew up a recreation of what I saw using MS Paint: http://ballz.ababa.net/exetergirl/ufo2.txt", "In the summer of 1992, two friends and I witnessed a UFO in Willsboro NY. My father owns a house on Lake Champlain in Willsboro bay. We were up at night sitting on the back deck of my father&rsquo;s boat house. It was a very quite and still night, there was a heavy overcast, but at a high altitude. I noticed what I thought was a plane at that time, flying across the sky from west to east, and at first I thought nothing of it. But it turned around and went back from east to west and behind the mountains there. The light came out again and flew the same pattern, going from east to west and then turning around. The third time it came out I took notice because I thought it odd that this, what I thought was a plane at that time, was flying in circles. I was aware that there was an air force fuel depot directly under where this object was flying. This is directly north of Skagarack Mountain on the shore of Lake Champlain. So I mentioned all this to the guys I was with and I think we thought it was a government plane and one of us came up with the idea to flash our flashlight at it. Immediately, a beam of light shown out of the object and illuminated the porch we were standing on to the point that when we turned around there our shadows were cast on the wall. The distance between the object and us at this point is approximately 1 to 1.5 miles and none of us were aware that a light could shine precisely on 3 people from that distance. This is the point that we all knew that something very abnormal was going on. We all became very alarmed at this and I remember that we began to tremble. The object then went west, behind Skagarack Mountain again, on the north side of the mountain. We thought that it may have left because it did not come out again moving east as it had before. So we were slightly relieved, that perhaps the air force was not after us. However, it came out from behind the Skagarack Mountain on the south side, north of Rattlesnake Mountain, this time a little closer to us. At this point it was going strait up and down, repeatedly coming from behind Skagarack Mountain, and each time it raised above the mountain, the beam of white light was painting us. It was almost as if it was playing a game with us. Then it flew over the mountain and started flying around the bay, and this is when we got a really good look at it. It was basically a ball of pulsating light, there was no wings, no rotors, and discernable body or fuselage. Just a pulsating light that would change colors constantly, as the colors changed, one color seemed to just meld in the next color, I remember it being mainly reddish orange. Perhaps the oddest thing was that it was absolutely silent, it made absolutely no noise at all. It moved well within the normal envelope of normal aircraft, there was nothing remarkable about how the thing moved. At this point a train was coming down the tracks on the opposite side of the bay from where we were, and the object immediately lost interest in us and painted its light on the train and followed it for a short time. Then it left the train, floated across the bay maybe .25 miles north of where we were and headed to the same side of shore that we were on. It disappeared behind the horizon there and at this point my friends and I ran around the front side of the house to find it but it was gone, and that was the last we saw of it.", "hovering ball of light above mountainThis was the fourth or fifth time since december that I have seen a ball of light moving up and down behind a mountain, I think diamond mountain is the name. I cam see it move up the back behind this mountain just up and down for several minutes. On the fourth of july i saw it just hovering up above the mountain and a bit forward this time. It wasn&apos;t exactly moving just hovering.", "Bright green streak across the sky.On August 1st at approximately 8pm, my daughter and I were watching a lightning storm to the south.

I remember the exact date of this because it happened the day after the tragedy of September 11th, when all the planes were still grounded--well, I should say they were supposed to be grounded.  My wife had went two houses down to visit some of my relatives and I can see the house from my house.  We had been having a problem with some drug addicts that were living down the street breaking into peoples cars at night and since this was around 10pm, I didnt want her to walk up on them by herself so I was sitting outside waiting for her in case she ran into any trouble.  I am an amateur astronomer and as any of us can tell you, a &quot;no fly&quot; zone is a dream come true.  So I am outside with all my lights turned out and I am sitting at the end of my deck facing that house my wife went to thats maybe 300 yards away and I just happen to look up and sitting there over my head, maybe 3000 or 4000 feet up (hard to tell because it was night) was this light, just sitting there.  It was a good size, maybe 1/15 the visual size of the full moon.  No sound, no movement, just stillness, and like a small breeze blowing through the trees suddenly.  I could tell it wasnt a planet or star, it was definantly something in our atomosphere.  As I looked at it, the light drew up--like the way the cornea of you eye draws up when you walk from a dark room to the outside on a sunny day.  It was still barely there, you almost had to not look at it to see it, it was so dim.  Then the dim light took off towards the southeast at an AMAZING speed--it had to be going faster than the speed of sound, but there was no sonic boom.  I have never saw anything move like this. I dont know of any military craft that could go from a hovering position to the speed of sound OR MORE within a second.  I am wondering if anyone else saw this craft around that date.  Thanks for reading this.", "I and my BF were sky watching last night and at around 12 midnight i saw a bright red blinking light to the right of me.  I went to my stairs on the right side of my deck to get a better look.It was right above the tree line in a north west position, im guessing it was about 20,000 feet up. At first i thought it may be a planet and stood there watching it for about 10 minutes and it kept blinking red and also other bright colors like white, orange, green. It also was moving, kinda like a swaying, it kept going down and back up again.My bf was standing there looking at it with me,He also couldnt figure out what it might be.I then decided to go inside and get my dad to come out and look at this object and see if he could figure it out. He came out and looked at it and also thought at first it was a planet, but then he noticed it was really bright and flashing all those colors and told me to go to his truck and get his feild binoculers. I gave them to him and he took a look and almost automatically after veiwng his words where &quot;wow&quot; its got lights on it. I took a look and  it had three white lights in the middle and red blinking ones on the outside and the rest looked green,orangish whitish, it looked sparklie.I made a drawing of what it looked like through the binoculers. We made my mom and two brothers come out side and look at it too. It then went behind the tree&apos;s so we decided to go down the street a bit and get a better look at it. When we got there it must have traveld at some sped because it was way much further away to the north west than it was when we were observing it at the house. But still you could see through the binoculers the red flashing going from bottom to top of the object and the sparklieness. Couldnt make the shape out anymore though. Then my dad said your not gonna belive this and said there was another one, it was in the north east sitting there. Looked just the same as the first one through the binoculers and it was closer. We stood there watching them both and the first one slowly moved to the north west tll it was a litle dot and the same happend with the second.", "Bright light from nowhereMy husband and I were sitting on our friends&apos; patio.  In the NE (we think) area a bright light caught my eye.  I thought it was an airplane at first, but then it wasn&apos;t moving.  So I asked my husband what it was and as we were looking at it together, it seemed to fade.  I have seen meteor showers, falling stars, and things of that nature, but this was weird.  It was almost as if a bright light appeared out of nowhere and then slowly disappeared.  When it disappeared, it did not move up or down or left or right, it seemed to travel further away...as if traveling further into space because it did not just get dimmer, it got smaller.

Saw lights above the trees moving and flashing beams on the groundI was awaken by a loud but low humming noise.  I thought there were people mowing their lawn so early in the morning.  The window in our room was open because it was particularly hot.  That was why I heard the sound outside.  I am a light sleeper and I can be awakened by any sound that is unfamiliar to my ears.  I tried to sleep through the sound, again still thinking that someone was mowing the lawn.  But the sound went from soft to loud, like it was moving far and near.  I still could not get back to sleep and was already intrigued by the unfamiliarity of the sound.  I decided to check it out.  I looked out the window and I saw in the sky just above the trees bright ligts, white, blue and yellow, moving very slowly horizontally.  That was the one that was making the humming or whirling sound.I woke my husband up because I thought I just saw a UFO.  He also saw the lights but he dismissed it as just a helicopter hovering.  And went right back to sleep.  I observed it for some more minutes because I could not believe that it was only a helicopter.  I know how a helicopter sounds like.  But this one was really different.  It hovered close to our building and I thought I saw a light beaming from it down the ground, like a huge flashlight looking for something.  If it was a police helicopter then where are the police cars?  Nothing was happening in the area, no movement of people or cars.

Suddenly and silently, an electric green filled my room, coming in through windows that looked out over the road.  The green was an aqua shade.  As I recall, the light seemed to pan across the room.  Both of us became immediately frightened and confused.  There was no sound and we could see (while still lying on the bed) no source for the light.  The green light filled the room for approx. 5-10 seconds, and then suddenly and completely shut off.  We listened but heard nothing (like a plane or helicopter flying away, and a quick glance at the moonlit road revealed a smooth and unbroken bed of snow; no vehicle big or small had disturbed it in quite some time.  As soon as the light went off, we noticed that the house had experienced a brief electrical problem as we could hear the answering machine resetting, and the electric clocks were flashing 12:00.  There are power/communication lines that run from nearby towers to the house, but never before or since have I witnessed any phenomenon similar to the green light.  My friend and I were frightened and excited, but decided to try to go to sleep.  Less than 10 minutes later, my friend alerted me saying, &quot;It&apos;s happeneing again&quot;.  I opened my eyes to find a much softer glow, this time appearing to be focused somehwere outside my room.  I said, &quot;What the hell is that?&quot; and jumped out of bed and went to the window and looked out to see the house across the street completely aglow; the entire back of this two-story white home was extremely bright.  The light, this time, was much whiter and seemed to me to be pulsing at a frequency of about 1-2 nodes per second. (My friend would later describe the second light to be changing from white to brief spots of green and red.) For the entire duration of this second light (20-30 seconds), my friend (now joining me at the window) and I searched for a source for  the light, and found none.  The house was glowing as if some very bright light was pointed at it from above the house about 20ft from the rear wall and 20ft above the roof, but nothing was visible.  Again, complete silence throughout, and again, suddenly the light was gone, as if it had never been.   Though my friend and I were very freaked out and certainly studied the possibility that we had just witnessed a close encounter, I later became convinced that the lights were nothing more than electrical surges or what-have-you caused by heavy snow/ice on the wires in the area.  Now, however, I am unsatisfied by that explaination, as I have never heard of or seen anything similar before or since.  I never saw an object.  I don&apos;t know what it was.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))", "We were staying in the school yard wiht my one of my friends and it mas above midnight.

Smaller than  a 747 plane.I woke up at about 7.00am on saturday morning and as was laying in my bed I looked out my window I saw small glowing white ball slowly moving from a northerly to southerly direction in the sky. Its strange because I live close to the airport and the object i saw wasn&apos;t following the same flight path as the other planes and no planes followed that path after I saw it because I waited 30 mins after too see if any other planes followed that flight path an none did, they were coming in the opposite direction south to north. And I usually hear the planes as they take off and land,and they are easy to identify because they are noisy and low to the ground....but this thing made no noise,and was much too high in the air to have just taken off from Sydney Airport. And it was a really intense white light,which made me take notice of it. Also the sun was already up and all the planes that were landing weren&apos;t using their navigation lights as it was daytime. As I saw it pass behind our tree at the front of our house it just disappeared. And it couldn&apos;t have been a plane coming directly at me as it moved horizontally across the sky continuosly glowing (no blinking of lights like an airplane - just an intense glowing white light), and I would have seen the tail and the shape of the plane as well.", "5:00 am, Pillager, Mn.

The freakiest feeling I&apos;ve ever encountered. Ever! Then, as I saw a small plane approaching directly from the northwest, the Triangle began to depart. As if it knew it was visible.

For some reason, it was impossible to tell how large, or how far it was away. after it hovered for a minute or two just above the tree line, it started doing amazing manuevers, speeding incredibly in one direction, only to come to a sudden stop, then reversing. A human couldn&apos;t possibly take that kind of &quot;g&quot; force. We were scared enough that we wouldn&apos;t even turn on the flashlight, not wanting to draw attention to ourselves.After as few minutes of these manuevers, it sped off behind the trees, out of our sight.It left no trail in the sky. we waited at least an hour before we turned our lights on,abandoning our fishing trip.I finally decided to file a report, simply because I quit worrying about the opinions of other people.

As I walked out the front door he was standing next to his car staring up into the night sky with his mouth wide open.

By stealth, I mean that it was silent and as it passed between us and the light cast by the moon over a thin layer of clouds (like fog) it&apos;s sillouette became visible. It was perfectly round and blacked-out. The disk appeared to hover for approximately 5-10 seconds then shifted from left to right in a zig-zag pattern. Suddenly it began moving to the south at a slow rate of speed. Then in a flash, it sped off at an unbelievable rate of velocity. My friend and I agreed that what we witnessed was exceptional. So much so, that we still talk about it to this day. I firmly believe that because the atmospheric conditions were just right that evening is the only reason we could see the disk. Without the clouds illuminated by the moon I don&apos;t think we would have noticed it.

I was driving towards it in my car and noticed it was too close to be mars because it was growing in size with regards to my approach.  I pulled towards it and noticed some blinking lights... but it was not moving or not moving much.  I pulled into the CompUSA parking lot on Hopkins Crossroad and 394 and observed it some more... it seemed to be about 200 feet away.  At first I thought it was a plane, but it wasn&apos;t moving quickly enough.  It was very close.  I considered a helicopter, but it didn&apos;t seem to be the right shape or light configuration.  I parked my car, grabbed my camera, and stepped out into the parking lot.  As I grabbed my camera, it started to move.  Outside of the car I could hear a slight whirring sound like the sound of a jet, but it was way too quiet to be that close to me.  In addition, the sound was not shifting like a Doppler effect would cause.  It was constant.  I had been taking photos of the moon (or trying to), so my camera was set to accommodate the brightness of the moon against the night sky.  I was not thinking straight enough to realize this until after around five photos taken... probably over the course of 10 seconds.  Still too shocked to think straight, it traveled past me and I stopped taking pictures to get a better look at it with my eyes.  It definitely had lights and looked like a very triangular plane of some sort.  It looked closest to the F117 shape if it was a plane.  It had two white lights and a flashing red light in the middle... again, like a plane  might have.  But it was much closer than a plane could have been, was traveling too slowly, and wasn&apos;t loud enough.  I changed the settings on my camera and, by that time, the object had passed by me (this is around 15-20 seconds since I stepped out of my car).  I started taking some pictures that actually turned out.  The lights kept the same spacing, more or less, despite the angle from which I was viewing it.  It was black and when the red light flashed, I could see a slight outline of the thing.  The two photos that came out best show it against a building.  It moved across only 15% of the viewing area between the two photos and my digital camera stamped the times five seconds apart.  That seems far too slow to be a plane.  The object seemed to be pulling over the highway when I noticed another set of lights to my left.  I watched those for a moment... but I realized that those were just a normal plane.  I turned back to watch the original object but it was nowhere to be seen.  I got in my car and tried to follow approximately where it seemed to be headed but I didn&apos;t see it again.   I have those photos and they mostly show the two white lights. I drove to a hill where I saw a UFO zipping around in the distance around six years ago and I saw what might have been it quite a bit further out.  It was moving slowly, again, and it was moving in the opposite direction.  Over the course of two minutes it made its way across the whole horizon.  It might have been a standard plane... the camera was having a hard time snapping photos that showed any detail.  The only thing odd about it was the trajectory... it was moving in an arc instead of a straight line.  But it never came much closer.", "green fire in the sky  around  500yd up moveing north to south  arond 50 ft top to boutom no soundI was driving north on the indian nation tpk . there were three or four other drivers runing behind me. i saw a green fire in the sky in front of us and as we went futher we couldn&apos;t tell if it was moving or not so we stoped and watcht it for arond 15 mn. it went out of sight going north to south over the state line into tx. i do not know of any thing that could run north to south all the falling stars i&apos;ve seen run east to west im an O.T.R. driver and spend a lot of time driving at night i&apos;ve seen a lot of commets and shooting stars i evae watchet the shutel burn up a couple years agoe and they all run east to west we talket about it for the rest of the night and could not come up with any ancers for what it was and i&apos;ve not seen anything since like it((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

The object was light brown with some black shading. The object was approximately 7 to 8 feet wide at the bottom and five feet wide at the top. The object was approximately 12 to 13 feet tall. The object made no sound. There were no lights on the object. There were no markings. There were two tubes coming out of the bottom of the object. These tubes were approximately four feet long. One tube was straight. The other tube was straight and then kinked at about 45 degrees three feet from the bottom of the object. The tubes were about 1 to 1.5 inches in diameter. The object seemed to be covered with scales or tiles and you could see through the object near the top, about 12 inches from the top. By this time I called very loudly for my wife. She came outside. I was across the street between the two houses and told her to go and get my binoculars (7x50). She returned a minute later and said she could not find my binoculars. Very determined I said to her, &quot;Go find my binoculars.&quot;  Finally my wife came running across the street with my binoculars. I ran back to the street and watched the object continue to fly above the tree tops. It seemed to go up and down to stay right above the tree tops as it flew away. I watched the object through my binoculars for about 10 minutes until it became a speck in the binoculars. Then 4 golden disks appeared around the speck and in a moment the disks and object disappeared. The sighting lasted about 15 minutes,(4 to 5 minutes without binoculars and about 10 minutes with binoculars.)  I sketched or drew a diagram of the object on Monday, 18 June 1990. This was the day after I sighted the flying object. Now 15 years later (27 June 2005), I have Xeroxed my sketch at a magnification of 4x and then scanned this very same hand-drawn figure electronically into a computer &quot;JPEG&quot; file. I have submitted my sketch on a diskette by U.S. Mail and also by Email. I am very familiar with USAF aircraft. Kettering is located about 9 miles from Wright-Patterson AFB. So I have seen all kinds of military aircraft and civilian aircraft fly over Kettering Ohio over the past 32 years. The object I saw was not an AF aircraft. The object was not an unmanned AF reconnaissance aircraft. The object had no wings or air foils. The object was not a civilian aircraft. Over the years several ultra-lights have flown over our home and neighborhood. The flying object I saw was not an ultra-light aircraft.", "red flashing light crossing clear night sky west to east  horizon to horizon at a speed 5 to 10 times faster than any jet i ever saw.I saw a red round flashing light similar to a taillight on an old car.  the object traveled completely across the clear sky from horizon to horizon, i believe east to west in about 30 to 45 seconds.  there was no sound, but i knew a jet could not cover that amount of space in less than a few minutes.  i told a friend in denver colorado and she told me some people called a radio station to report same incident.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

He replied do you mean the fast yellow one that was going that way as he pointed to the southeast. He told me that he had seen it a few minutes ago too and asked his mother what it was.

Have had many sightings since that date. Have recorded all kinds of overflights by MANY different shaped ships including photos. This observation occured just past 10:00pm last Thursday night. As a sensitive I have always been able to &apos;feel&apos; the approach of these anti-grav ships quite some distance from my house. This has always allowed me plenty of time to get my camera. But this time I did not have my cam available because its  a 35mm Cannon which is in the shop for calibration and cleaning. So no picks of this one. But here&apos;s the sighting info. I felt the approach of the &quot;anti-grav&quot; engines OR the presence of a non earthly occupant coming my way. I readied myself on my front second floor deck and sure enough.....the ship appeared from out of a clear dark sky entering our dimension or space above the mountain north of my house. My first observation was of the ship, which was approaching my direction slowly just above the hilltop, but far far below the regular airliners altitude. I would guess at approx. 9,000 ft. I said aloud:&quot;Greetings!&quot; and at that moment the sphere turned a deep orange glow and proceeded towards my direction then as it was almost over my house it turned to a south-east heading still remaining orange. It passed over the June Mountain Ski Lift chalet...then on behind the mountain. Gone from sight. Approx. 12 mins later 5 F-18&apos;s most likely from Fallon Air Base came in over my area fast and furious. They had afterburners running which made a deeper than usual jet engine roar, the sound of which fills our small canyon with a very loud sound.

They were 12 mins behind this sphere which tells me the AirForce is getting their look-down sat radar working pretty tight nowadays.

I didn&apos;t feel like sleeping so I knelt in my bed and leaned on my windowsill looking out at the city. Almost at once there was a small dark gray or possibly metallic ball moving steadily past my window. It was about 8-10 inches in diameter and had no distinguishing features at all. There was no sound or light associated with the ball. It was probably about 6-12 inches away from the side of the building and moved from left to right, which would have corresponded roughly to moving north. Our apartment was on the 15th floor and the window faced west-ish. (It faced in the direction of central park from the east side which is roughly due west.) The ball was not moving very quickly and I remember thinking that if I ran I would have time to get my babysitter to show her the ball before it had moved past the window. Which I did but of course when we got back to my room it was gone.

Then it came out looped around and shot straight up in the air and dissapeared. After that we couldnt see it and we were looking for it.

The estimated speed was 3000 mph, then slowed down to 500 mph then sped up and slowed down again and went behind an apartment building and a very slow rate of speed compared to the beginning of the sighting. Later on I saw a lot of military aircraft flying in the area of the sighting and was wondering why the grand finally jets weren&apos;t performing. The next day I found out the Thunderbird air show was canceled because something fell off some jet. I found that to be very coincidental and perhaps was just a cover-up excuse and it really was because the air show&apos;s airspace was violated by unknown boggies or perhaps one of the unconventional flying objects bummed into one of the jets (midair collision) and caused damage.", "Balls of light in the shape of a triangleEvery night I go out in my backyard and sit in the dark and watch the skies. Every night I witness multiple UFOs at extremely high altitudes. I&apos;m talking about in the stars. These objects I see are balls of white/yellowish/blueish white light. I live a couple miles away from Nellis AFB and I know the difference between the objects and UFOS. Anyway, last night I was sitting in my backyard and saw with the naked eye three bluish white light objects in the formation of a triangle moving from North to South. I grabbed my binoculars and got a closer look. I can see the three objects quite clearly and I can see the stars in between so I know it wasn&apos;t a solid object. They were moving at exactly the same speed. As I was watching them the one in the front dimmed out and then the two behind did also. Shortly after that about 3 mins another two of these showed up traveling the same direction. I grabbed my binoculars and as soon as I locked on them, they dimmed out.

For the past week, the weather has been sunny with big white pre-storm clouds, up until around 2 or 3pm, then the monsoon (storm) clouds roll in.  We were floating on our backs in the pool, my husband had on his sunglasses and he said, &quot;What&apos;s that shiny spot?&quot;.  I looked up and to the south and saw, in the blue sky, between the clouds, a shiny object, not moving, and if you closed one eye, it was about the size of the head of a pin.  Right then, a jet airliner flew out at an upper left angle, from behind the cloud, which was below the object.  The jet had contrails and at this point there was no doubt about it, that the object was stationary.  Before, my husband first saw the object, he commented on the beautiful cloud formations around the sun and that I should go get my camera.  I said, nah, I already have similar pictures.  Then right after he said that, is when he and I noticed the object. I jumped out of the pool to get my camera and right as I got into the house, he said the object started moving to the right (west), still viewable against the blue sky but at times crossing in front of the clouds.  When it was stationary, it was almost like a &quot;little sun&quot;, I&apos;m sure the sun was reflecting off of it, but once it started to move it was white, then when it was in front of the clouds it was dark or gray.  It was almost like we were being watched and once it knew we were aware of it&apos;s presence, and that I was going for my camera, it took off.  I have a Sony DSC-W7 7.2 pixel camera, I zoomed in and was able to get 5 shots. (Too bad I haven&apos;t figured out how to work the video feature yet!) I was disappointed that I didn&apos;t listen to my husband and get my camera sooner; as I would have gotten quite a crisp shot of the object while it wasn&apos;t moving.  I uploaded the pictures on my computer and zoomed in, the shape then appeared horizontal/rectangular/cylindrical and considering enlarged pixels, each time I zoomed in, it also may have been saucer shaped.  Observing the object crossing the sky, I actually got a &quot;feeling&quot; that this was definitely not a aircraft.  To me, the best way I can describe it, is the feeling you get when you see a helium filled latex balloon released and then caught in an air current.  Which you are only able to view from the ground for about 1000 feet, then it gets to tiny to see.  I have to say, this object was no balloon, it was higher in the sky than the jet aircraft that crossed the sky below it and we watched it cross the sky in a westerly direction for a good 30 seconds before it went behind a cloud and out of our line of vision.  The jet aircraft was not coming in for a landing at McCarran Airport, it was enroute elsewhere.  So if the jet was at cruising altitude, this object had to be at least twice as high in the sky.  Maybe I should listen to my husband more often!", "Cigar shaped object in the sky, hovering, not moving at all.We were waiting for the school bus to pick us up early one morning.

We all looked up and off to the North, we all saw a cigar shaped object just sitting in the sky.  It didn&apos;t move at all.

I can&apos;t remember the exact name of the road at the time.  There was a right hand turn that we had to make or the road would take us all the way to Douglas, and since we lived in Elfrida we didn&apos;t want to go that way.

We found the turn with no problem.  Just after we hit the pavement I noticed a large cirular object in the sky, it was like it was the moon, it cast a glow, it was bright enought to cast a dull shadow.  I was watching it as I drove and realized that it was way to close to earth to be the moon, it was like it was hovering.  I am not sure of the distance, the object didn&apos;t move it just sat there, stationary, and even as I drove at it, it seemed to stay at the same distance.

I observed a source of light in the evening sky, I was unable to see any details as the light was moving in a circular motion at a tremendous speed. After the first circular motion I brought the object to the attention of my brother. He looked at the object and stated &quot;it was obviously NOT an air plane, as a plane can not make such a tight circular manuver at such a tremendous speed. After the third tight circle the light excellerated out of its flight pattern &amp; moved towards the direction of Long Island. The light sourse moved so quickly it disappeared within seconds. My Brother &amp; I couldnt believe what we had just seen, we never saw anything move as fast as this light source object.My Brother called the local Airports and asked if their people had seen anything unusual in the sky. They said NO. The Military saw nothing. Nobody would admit there was anything unusual in the night sky. I have NOT seen anything unusual in the sky since 06/15/56. I dont usually look into the evening sky, I just dont believe man is alone in this vast universe.", "On August 11th 2005 my son and I seen a large triangle UFO with 3 lights, with the broad part of the tiangle moving forward.My son, and I were coming home from work. It was right after dusk, around 8:40 P.M. We were about 3 miles from Edmonton on Highway 68 &amp; 80 going east. At the top of a hill I seen two lights in the sky. There was a red light an a green light. I said to my son look at those lights. They looked like they were about 300 to 500 yards in the sky. The lights were not flashing. I drove a few hundred yards, then pulled my truck off the road onto the gravel. We both got out of the truck. As we got out of our truck, My son said &quot;look it&apos;s a triangle&quot; I said &quot;yes it is.&quot; When I first looked up, it was right over our heads around 300 to 500 yards off the ground. I could see the triangle shape by seeing the outline of the UFO, and not by just connecting the lights to see the UFO, the bottom of the object was a dark color, maybe black, and There were 3 lights on each end of the triangle. The wild thing about this UFO was the broad side of the triangle was going in front. There was a yellow light in the back. The UFO moved west away from us, with the broad side of the triangle moving forward. I tried to listen for noise from the object, but the cars that went by us interfered. My son said for a few seconds when the cars past he couldn&apos;t hear anything from the UFO. I didn&apos;t hear any noise from the UFO during this whole event. When I got home. I drew a picture of what I seen. I didn&apos;t show my son, who is ten years old. The next day after school. I had my son to draw what he saw. Both pictures were the same, except for the color of one light. I had the green, and red light in front on the broad side, with the yellow in the back.

At this time we noticed a very bright light above the hill about two miles away, appx. altitude was 2000 ft.. My first thought was &quot;Venus&quot;, but the object seemed to be moving away from us and to the North. My comment was &quot;It must be the atmosphere making it seem to move&quot;. As we watched, another light appeared about 1000 ft. above the first. The second light started moving to the North as the first continued Northwest. The one moving North was slowly pulsating from very bright to the point that it was not visible. We watched both qbjects for about ten minutes until the one headed North finally dimmed and was gone. Suddenly another bright light appeared approximately where the second one had been sighted. By this time, the first object had continued Northwest until it was no longer visible.

Luckily it came back Saturday night September 11th, 2004 and there was about 40 of people standing on rooftops of their homes to see it over the downtown LA skyline. Everyone was pretty freaked out and we have very detailed footage of the entire incident. We even saw what appeared to be U.S. Military jets surrounding the craft. When they got there, the UFO turned off its bright orange glow and it seemed to have turned into some type of triangle or it just appeared that way because of the various blinking lights. As it was traveling east we could tell the smaller crafts were possibly jets because of the enormous speed they used to catch up to the craft.The jets seemed to be traveling so quick but not the UFO, it kind of took its time going east. Everything we could possibly catch and see with the camera is recorded from the top of a neighbor&rsquo;s roof. This all happened over the downtown Los Angeles skyline where the object didn&rsquo;t leave for 30 minutes to an hour before those smaller crafts got there.

We went walking towards it. Two of my friends said it was just a blimp but the others believed it was a UFO. I have a camera phone so i took a picture of it.

This incident happened to my father and his friend when they were about 11 years old, and the exact year isn&apos;t remembered. I submit this information because I&apos;ve studied UFO reports my entire life and have yet to hear about an object quite like this one.My father and his friend were busy on a summer afternoon building a club house when they began to hear a strange sound. My father describes it as sounding remarkably like a metal object striking a 1/4 full aluminum can, only much louder(he tried several times to recreate the sound, at last using a fork against a 1/4 full can, which he said was very close to it. It would &quot;strike&quot; 4 times, then pause for a moment before doing it again. Naturally they looked around to see what it was.They saw, only a few feet above the trees, a 20 to 25&apos; cylinder, slightly rounded on both ends, of a dull silver color. It had what looked like helicopter skids on the bottom, and between them, on the &quot;belly&quot;, a strange series of symbols or writing (at his angle, he could only see part of it...it reminded him of chinese lettering). At the rear was a blue light or flame, very bright. Protruding from the bottom of the object was a silverish, bent tube.As they watched, the object floated, very slowly, from tree top to tree top. At each tree, it would stop and the tube on the bottom would touch the leaves (he said it looked as if it were sniffing them in a way). After a moment of this, it would move on to the next tree, all the while making the metallic clanking sounds.They watched it do this for a few minutes. It eventually turned and left only a slightly faster speed than before. It was soon hidden from sight by trees. They both ran home, frightened.This incident fascinated my father and soon UFOs became a life long hobby, which he passed on to me. I Have never known him to lie, invent tales, or even exaggerate. In fact he laments that he hasn&apos;t seen anything like it since. But the object remains clearly in his mind. I will include a drawing I did under his supervision. It is, he says, almost exactly what they saw.I have been trying to track down the other witness, but since this happened 50 years ago it hasn&apos;t been easy.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

At the time of the launch there was a 40 mile &quot;no fly zone&quot; around the shuttle. In fact, two f-16&apos;s were sent out to intercept a small plane that came within that zone... here&apos;s the link to that story: http://www.cnn.com/2005/TECH/space/07/28/shuttle.plane/index.html  Anyway, here are the details:  First appearance is at the 20-21 second mark... watch the top left corner of the screen... it flys by through the clouds.... The second appearance is at the 31-32 second mark... watch the middle left of the screen... it flys BACK towards the shuttle and then DISAPPEARS!!!!!  Here is the link to the CNN video homepage: http://www.cnn.com/video/  Once there, I had to click to view the &quot;Space Shuttle Update&quot; then on the right side navigation is an option for &quot;More technology video&quot;...once there, click to view the &quot;Shuttle Discovery Launches&quot; video. I am interested to know your thoughts regarding this strane object being so close to the shuttle at the time of launch... Please look at this and tell me what you think.

I noticed what looked like a glowing star coming from out of the west heading east at a high rate of speed, but not so fast that it couldn&apos;t be tracked with the naked eye, I  said to the others &quot;what is that?&quot; The object was almost overhead and I ran into the apartment building to grab my binoculars to get a better look. After I looked I passed the binoculars to my neighbor to have a look while I was standing there in awe at what I saw. All four adults got to see it with the binoculars. I saw a glowing white object triangular shaped with a metal surface with what looked like black waves in the metal. it was only a matter of minutes and it vanished out over the Atlantic Ocean, Then we saw another object out over the ocean in the distance heading from the north to the south at a high rate of speed, there was a plane in the air to the north that looked as if it was heading in the same direction, but it was much slower then what appeared to be the second object, I also saw the second object with the binoculars. Around these objects there was what looked like a white glow, like a florescent light, the light didn&apos;t look attached to the object, but looked more like it emanated around the object.The object that few over head did not make any noise at all, we all agreed it wasn&apos;t a plane or helicopter as the airport is not far from here and we see planes all the time with there flashing lights, we don&apos;t know what the closest object we all seen was, but whatever it was, it was quite a sight to behold through binoculars going overhead.", "Triangular craft w/ flashing lights in 1976On said date, my friend and I were walking home from the movies.  He looked up and became transfixed, not moving or saying anything.  I asked what was he looking at and he just pointed straight up and said, &quot;Will you look at that.&quot;  Directly above us, fixed among the stars, was an extremely large, silent triangular craft that seemed to just float along.  Intermittantly flashing lights travelled in irregular patterns, to and fro, blue and red with a smidge of yellow in the mix.  We both stood in the roadway and watched it hover and move in a straight line until it passed from sight over the horizon of pine trees.  We spoke only of this to ourselves for the longest time, fearing ridicule.  No one tends to believe two 16 year olds with overactive imaginations.  As an epilogue to this strange event, one night my wife and I were watching Unsolved Mysteries in the mid-&apos;90&apos;s and Robert Stack did a report of strange triangular craft seen in the SE Virginia corridor and, upon seeing their re-creation of events, I bolted from my chair and hollered out, &quot;That&apos;s it!  That&apos;s what we saw back in high school!&quot;  My father-in-law, an ex-US Airforce officer, was sitting on the couch and had been in an animated state up to that point.  Upon my recognition of this craft, he stopped all he was doing and then just stared at me for about a half minute.  He then arose from his seat and walked--zombie-like--from the room.  He refused to speak of it to me and, from that moment on, I knew what we had seen was not open for discussion.  This told me the Air Force already knew all about it.", "Large Tubular shaped CraftI was out one day. Saw this large unkown shaped craft. It seemed to metallic silver and had some windows. It was not an aircraft. it was noon and knowing that it around 5000 feet high in the sky, it was huge about the size of a US Aircraft Carrier. It flew slowly then picked up speed and flew away.", "I saw two objects with multiple orange lights (in two seperate patterns) moving  across the sky.At around 2:00 am this morning (August 11th) I was laying on the ground outside watching the annual meteor shower that goes on this time of year.  Then I noticed a moving orange mass that looked like a cloud at first. When I looked closer I noticed it was it was five or six orange circles that were in the shape of a dividing rod (one straight end with two ends diagonally coming out of it.  It was being led by the two diagonal ends.  Here is an illustration. The blue arrow indicates which direction it was heading in.   I was facing East and the object was heading West, right in my direction.http://s88311880.onlinehome.us/pics/UFO1.jpg  It got out of my line of vision, so I got up and ran until I could see it again.  I saw it for another couple of seconds until it disappeard over the horizon of my house.   I scanned the sky everywhere trying to look for it again. Then, from a completely different direction (North),  I saw another moving mass of about six circular orange lights. This time they were in the shape of an arc, as illustrated here: http://s88311880.onlinehome.us/pics/UFO2.jpg Once again, it was moving in the direction of the blue arrow from the angle I saw it (Me facing North, the object heading West - Northwest.)  As it moved more to the left,  the lights got closer together like this: http://s88311880.onlinehome.us/pics/UFO3.jpg  This mass of lights stayed in my line of vision for a good twenty seconds before disappearing over the horizon. Both objects didn&apos;t make any noise from what I could tell. Before the sighting I was quite relaxed just laying back watching for the occasional shooting star to send a white streak across the sky.  (By the way, I am 100% sure this was not a shooting star or anything like it.)  When I saw the first one shaped like the dividing rod,  I was confused.  I knew it wasn&apos;t a star or any type of airplane that I&apos;ve ever seen. It also didn&apos;t appear to be a &quot;light show&quot; produced by a machine or anything.   After I realized that it wasn&apos;t a normal object in the sky, I was shocked.  That&apos;s why I ran around looking to see if I could find it again.  When I saw the second arc-shaped one I was even more shocked because it was completely different than the first one, so I figured it was a completely different entity than the first one.  The lights were the same reddish-orange color as the first one. In both instances, the orbs were moving faster than an airplane or jet.  They weren&apos;t moving extraordinarily fast,  but definetly faster than any airplane I have ever seen. Now, I don&apos;t really believe in aliens or extraterrestrials.  Normally when I see someone talking about a UFO sighting,  I figure they were either intoxicated or saw an ordinary object (like a plane or light show) and misconstrued it as being foreign.  So for me to actually see something that *I* couldn&apos;t identify as something you&apos;d normally see in the sky,  I&apos;m just in shock and disbelief.   I keep thinking &quot;I&apos;m not one of those crackpots.&quot;  But I know I saw *something* up there.  Something strange. I&apos;m sure there is some logical, &quot;Earthly&quot; explanation for it.  But I can&apos;t for the life of me figure out what it is. My best bet is that maybe they were some military planes that aren&apos;t really known to the public.  But if they were, they sure had a strange flight pattern. I hope I was thorough enough in my explanation.", "A formation of a dozen independent green lights moves across the night sky over Las Vegas.We were outside of our hotel walking back to our room from the pool area.  My wife says, &quot;hey, what&apos;s that?&quot;  I look up in the sky and we all saw about a dozen or so bright neon green-colored lights moving high across the sky.  They appeared to flutter somewhat and moved in what appeared to be a distinct tight formation, although they did move in and out around each other like birds -- the first thought I had was that birds is what they were because of their proximity to one another and the way they moved, but that didn&apos;t make sense.  We did not think that they could have been planes, either, because we actually saw a plane flying across another part of the sky at the same time and there wasn&apos;t any similarity whatsoever. We watched them until they were out of sight, about 2 minutes.  None of us had been drinking and we all saw the lights.  I kicked myself afterward because I had been holding my camera in my hand the whole time but I was so astonished when I could not figure out what the lights were that I had forgotten about the camera, and so, took no pictures.  I have always been a skeptic and was rather disturbed when I couldn&apos;t figure out what we were seeing.", "Number of Craft: on or more dont know we saw many lights and the seemed to randomly turn on as if the lites were going around the disc and one light in the middle was very bright it lite up the dessert as if it was a sunset((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

We thought it was a reflection off a building or a huge ship but realized that no structure could be seen below above or on the side of this spherical object.  We checked the GPS heading and the direction was South West which is only hundreds of miles of ocean, thus that ruled out any reflection on any buildings. Also, it could not have been a ship because it was 100 feet off the ground with no structure below.  It seemed to be 4 to 5 miles away in the distance but that was our guess. It had no sound of blades on a helicoper as it stood there for 10 minutes hoovering. Then we noticed it started to get closer and bigger and some friends were getting a little freaked out but I felt only positive from it. Its strange for me to explain but that it what I felt. I knew we had nothing to be worried about. Then it stopped and hoovered for another 9 or 10 mintues at that moment I got 1 picture of it(not digital) :(.

The camera on the space shuttle was focused over the eastern Pacific Ocean west of California. It was still dark over the eastern Pacific Ocean but the sun had already rose over much of California. I noticed what appeared to be two Satellites flying past the space shuttle in the distance about 1 minute apart heading in the same direction. Then a very bright object heading in a different direction and moving twice as fast as the Satellites came into camera view. The bright object abruptly stopped and did a 180 and heading back in the direction it came from. This took place within minutes of the space shuttle entering daylight over the California coast on August 6, 2005.Another note: I believe the space shuttle was in sleep mode at the time of this event so the light was not caused by the space shuttle thrusters or waste.", "Black object floating across Spring morning sky over MebaneMy wife alerted me early one morning to a strage object &quot;floating&quot; across the sky.  I am uncertain of the exact date--some time during this past spring early in the week before school.  I noted the shape as a &quot;teardrop,&quot; but we have come to describe it as a floating black peanut. The object was black and looked like a peanut with the top slightly bigger than the bottom.  We could not make out any distinguishing features.  No lights or moving parts were observe. The object floated from South-East to North-West and seemed to stay at about the same altitude. It moved at about the same speed as a satelite does (when observed at night of course).

There were some clouds or a partial overcast. I could see some stars between the clouds. I saw a formation of five triangles that were dark and had no lights. They were moving paralel to Fairview Boulevard, toward the coast( I think that is south/west). They flew under the overcast, so I know that they were pretty low.

She said &ldquo;what is that light?&rdquo; I looked and followed the light up into the sky until I was looking almost straight up.  At that moment the light in the front yard that had been 150&rsquo; away, suddenly flashed all around us, when it did I saw the outline of a craft of some sort.  The light had been projected to the ground from this object.  It was no more than 200&rsquo; from the ground and made no noise what so ever.

My first thought was that maybe it was Columbia.  It was moving in a due east direction about the speed of a passenger jet.  It moved east for about 1 minute then faded out.  About 20 seconds later it returned, heading due west in the same manner.  After another minute, it very quicky turned north (I have seen planes bank that fast) and after another minute it faded again.

It was approximately 2 seconds after the first.  2 Seconds later, another flash in the same position, only smaller and not as bright.  At this point I could assume that the source of the flash was climbing straight up based on it&apos;s position in relation to the 3 star triangle.

But they all make plenty of standard aircraft engine noise, and at night, always have the required symmetrical lighting and flashing strobe light. Though I did witness this in the dark of night, the rectangular craft did not remotely appear to be any kind of conventional aircraft whatsoever. Most importantly, it was totally silent with strange non-regulation lights.I am a 48-year old artist, musician, graphic designer, and arts educator from New York City, so I feel like I am visually literate.

Laying on the deck doing situps...skys were clear, sunny. FedEx planes and other aircraft were out. Very busty morning. However, out of the blue...an object that looked like a cylinder or a tube...very metallic flew by...no sound. It was low...maybe 1000ft? First thing I thought was...wow where is the wings? I dismissed it until another tube went by....exact flight path as the other. Same description. It didn&apos;t hit me until after I seen them that I started wondering. Where were the wings? Where was the sound? Was it a missile? Seemed odd it was flying in such busy skys...but then again...it made perfect sense because the skys were so busy anyway with planes and such. Besides that who would report it? Its taken me 3 months just to report it because I had to come to termsn with what I seen. A metallic tube or cylinder object flying about 1000 ft maybe a bit more up in the air. How long or big? Dont know...didn&apos;t see it long enough. Very strange.

But the object of light sped up quick in a straight path, then made a 90 degree turn and shot off!

While looking up at my dunking pole, I saw a giggantic flash towards west side of island that seeme to be over Kaena point area.  It was like the sky opened up and a bright flash much brighter and intense than halogen came out, but the flash moved from right to left in the pattern of the shape of a weak or lazy letter n. kind of like an eyelid shape, like a small hill icon shape. The thing that made it unusual besides the brightness and movement, was that it wasn&apos;t tiny like the hundreds of shooting stars we have seen siince childhood, a shooting star looks comparitively like looking at a small grain of rice in the distance, this flash that I saw was like looing at a D-battery or like if I was looking up from the inside of an old stlye overhead projector(flat glass drawing area) as a teacher dragged a piece of thick chalk maybe 2 inches long sideways across the whiteboard drawing area of the projector in the shape of a upper eyelid  or letter n.  I just happened to be looking up at the time this occurred and I immediately looked over about 60 feet to the other guy who was fishing by hisself to see if he saw it, but he was looking at his poles in the water.  This other guy was to my right alongside the boat-ramp section of the shoreline there.  Anyway, I went over to him and asked if he had saw that flash and he said he didn&apos;t but that he had saw a similar flash about 2 times before but a little more inland towards the sky over the Waianae Mountain side. Needless to say, we talked from that point on about what the hell is out there, and I kept saying I would call the morning talk show to see if anyone else had saw that flash in the sky (eerie), but instead I just telephoned my best friend here and told him what I had saw.

I had been assigned to &quot;T&quot; class. One night we were having a bit of a friendly fight between ourselves, all of a sudden one of our dormitory got all excited and started shouting UFO! UFO! and started pointing out of one of our dormitory windows.  We all (approx.11-12) rushed to look to see what he was pointing at, there approximately 200-250feet above our football (soccer) field were three big white lights. The single light was nearest to us with the other two beside each other just behind it, the object seemed to be triangular in shape, also there seemed to be no noise, the object was also not moving it was just hovering. We looked at the object for several seconds (I am unsure how many, )when it suddenly began to move forward at what appeared to be a slow speed and passed over our our building.  Our roof was a flat roof and had no windows so we had to cross to the other side of our dormitory this would have been about twenty feet.  When we looked out of the window opposite to the first one we could see the object still moving in the same direction, it seemed to be at the same height and speed. I am not sure how far it traveled but it would  at a guess be a quarter to half a mile, suddenly it climbed at a huge speed.  When it climbed the object seemed to attain its speed instantly, it stayed on a horizontal plane not climbing as with a coventional aircraft, also it left no trail that we could see. The object took about 3-4 seconds to be out of sight, it never altered course it just shot up at a great speed at about 45 degrees from a horizontal slow level flight path. May i point out that this is the first time that this is the first time i have reported this in writing anywhere, although i have told people at times since it happened.  I also have flown light aircraft, sailed in the Mechant Navy for 18 years so am able to judge distances to some degree.

First off, i know the gov&apos;t is reading this and hiding all the evidence, well u know what? Screw u top secret agents, this is a free country, i guess not then. Anyways, it was about 12 at night and my family and i were in the car (6 including me), and it was in the middle of nowhere except for a gas station and some restaurants. There were roughly 50 cars around or so, and nobody noticed or something, i noticed first that a light was just sitting there above a street light, not moving at all. we were about a football field away from it, and we were driving slower now to see it better. I am learning to get my pilot&apos;s license, so i know this isn&apos;t something ordinary. As we were driving closer to it, i opened the window and stuck my head out, and i guess they noticed me or something. because it started to move to it&apos;s side, left and right very slowly, and knowing planes... they can&apos;t do that. there were a lot of lights around it, that&apos;s all i could see, and due to how the lights were arraigned... it seemed like a street&apos;s stop sign cut in half. As we drove underneath it, i tried to see it, but when we looked back, it was gone. that lasted for about 8 mins or so. Then about 20 mins later, we came to our relative&apos;s house and just as we parked the car and got out, we saw the same thing again, but further away. I believe it was following us, it&apos;s lights were even brighter this time and it seemed to hypnotize us or something, because i would&apos;ve thought about getting the video camera, but i don&apos;t remember thinking about anything....strange, and all i saw as i was looking underneath it was a bright red light... kind of like a beacon, and it seemed like glass or something under it. because i was able to see through it, there were lights from screens on the walls and shadows that just stood there, probably looking at us, don&apos;t remember looking at them directly, weird feeling at that time. As it came up to us, it was about 100 ft in the air or so, and was very slow above us and about 100+ ft in diameter. It made NO engine sounds except for a quiet hum and just the wind blowing, most likely from the engine or exhaust that is very efficient. Then as it was getting about 50 ft from us, it was going higher in the air and again... not much sound still and just then was i able to think of the camera and took a little video... but i can&apos;t find it, it&apos;s somewhere in the house and afraid the gov&apos;t might do something to me. then it started gaining some altitude and just turned off the lights or something and it seemed to stretch, because it was so fast, and that&apos;s when i finally heard a louder sound from it, could&apos;ve been an antimatter engine, who knows? the gov&apos;t does. Also, i heard that there&apos;s an underground military base there at Moses Lake. I know, long story, but i wanted to get the details out, and i didn&apos;t revise this, so there&apos;s things that are prob. confusing.

The vehicle was very sharp in detail with a smooth aerodynamic and symetrical shape as it decended straight for me and leveled off passing overhead, then climbing back out at about a 20 degree climb. It very much resembled a drone vehicle of about 100 feet in dimeter programed to maintain a mean ground or terrain following low  altitude of about 500 to 1000 feet above ground level.  It was observed for only about 4 seconds and moving in a straight line north to south coarse at about 650 to 700 MPH.

An outer faired ring section with a smooth symetrical straight line tapor running from the thickened center section to almost a knife edge at the outer periphery comprizing about 75 percent of the vehicle. Discription of bottom view. The ovel center section was clearly stationary (not revolving) while the outer ring section was clearly revolving at a high speed around it with no gap visible but a definite line of seperation. The colors were mostly bright white like a glowing light bulb comprising all of the center section running into about 10 percent of the revolving ring and transisting from white to orange and then reds at the outer periphery. There was a bright thick and continuous blue electrical arc surrounding but not touching the outer peripherial edge that was giving off a stream of orange / white sparks.

I was working then as an engine build-up mechanic for the Flying Tiger Line at their main base in Burbank Airport.

I have seen High speed aircraft flying just off the groung and overhead at just under mach 1. I have seen things happen in slow motion and reacted at a suprisingly high speed when jolted with an emergency adrenaline rush resulting in much detail being acquired within a second or two.

I was in the kithen, my sister in the livingroom.  We lived on Van Houten Ave. on a corner.  Across from us was a factory/warehouse.  It had a generator that made a rumbling noise. I was washing dishes facing the side street.  My sister yelled for me to look out the window...she was excited.  She was looking out the front window facing Van Houten Ave. She kepet screaming for me to look towards the factory.  I stuck my head out the window and saw this object kind of hoovering over the factory.  It was HUGE.  It was kind of cigar shaped and I don&apos;t know if it made any sound really, because of the generator, but it seems to me that the sound was a bit different than usual.  Anyhow, it wasn&apos;t a blimp or anything I&apos;d ever seen, or have since seen.  I remember there was a light revolving around the (what I assume to be) &quot;nose&quot; of the vessel.  But the light didn&apos;t seem to be attached to anything, or be radiating from anywhere actually, it was just a light revolving around the nose.  This vessel hoovered there for about ten minutes give or take.  Me and my sister were hollering back and forth at each other trying to figure out what we were looking at, and what to do about it.  It just kind of sat there in mid air for a while, and then it turned it&apos;s nose straight up in a semi-slow motion, and it shot straight up in an instant it was gone.  No fire, no flames, no loud roar...nothing like that...It went straight into space and was gone instantly.

Anyways, we run out &quot;to help&quot; and find my brother and his friend staring at the sky.  We were like, &quot;What?!?&quot; and they both point straight up, and yell &quot;Look! Look! they&apos;re moving&quot;  we didn&apos;t know what they were talking about.  We looked up and saw a sky with stars...no big deal...at least that was our first reaction.  And that&apos;s what we told them...&quot;yeah okay, big deal..Stars!!!&quot;  But they kept hollering....&quot;No...No...Really....Watch &apos;em!!!  They&apos;re moving!!!&quot;  So we decide to humor them...so okay, we&apos;ll watch for a few minutes.  Just a clear night with a sky of stars.  Well, they did start to move!!!  Every one of them started moving.  they started out slowly, kind of making circles and designs...but it was each and every one of them...they started slow, and gradually got faster and faster, and faster, and then they all kind of shot towards each other and instantly stopped in a clump...for maybe five seconds...then they shot out in different directions, every one of them, and they were gone.  Not a star in the sky.  None of us knew what to do, or say, we just all stared at each other.  I do think my brother said something to the fact that he was glad that we seen it too &apos;cause it kind of scared them.  I do remember trying to tell my mother about it...and she just looked at us like we were nuts or something, and dismissed it all as our imagination, or it had to be &quot;something else&quot;...but we all know what we saw...and actually, I don&apos;t care one way or another if someone wants to beleive me/us or not.  It happened, and I think about it and know that there&apos;s life out there some where.  I know too that we STILL don&apos;t have anything made on this planet capable of the speed and manuverability that these things had then, and this all happened some 31 years ago.

When I look thru the binoculars, I could she the define white flat oval shape object moving back and fourth, moving and stopping on the drop of a dime.  It also had blue/white, white/purple and white/red lights at the top and middle of the object.  My partner grabs the binoculars and saw the same thing.

She said, &quot;there is a ((deleted)) UFO at my house get on the roof and see if you can see it.  There are also helicopters and planes flying around it as well.  Look in the direction of NYC and you should see it.&quot;  In about 3 mins. She called again, &quot;Did you see it,  No, and then come to my house. You have to see this.  Come now.&quot;  She then called our friend and she said she was shopping at the food store but she would be there shortly.  It had been floating, hovering, changing shapes and just moving around for 20 mins now.  We kept asking the object to stay just long enough for our friends to see it.  Every time we asked it to come back form behind the trees, it did. At this point, I went upstairs to our daughter&apos;s room to get a different view.  I could see it better from here.  I could tell this was not blimp or plane.  Then I started to chant a Buddhist mantra and the object got closer and began to change shape.  It seemed to turn inside it&apos;s self and back out then it emitted a red beam.  It was unbelievable.  My partner was still at the bedroom window down stairs, she was also doing the Buddhist mantra and saw the beam as well.  We both yelled to each other did you see that.  It was incredible.

These units were a silver metallic color. There shape was like a giant satelite dish as big as a house with both sides of the dish rectangle (both sides of unit were squared off) the round parts were the top and bottom of the units and slightly bent back. The two outside units were the same height, and the one in the middle was downward about one third in elevation from the other two as it sat in between the other two. It was 6:22 PM and we were looking into the sun as the units were appearing in and out of the clouds. It had the appearence to me as if they were using the clouds as cover to hide? David and I (John) seen these three units as seperate units hovering in the clouds, however, Dusty, my 11-year old Grandaughter seen them as beening connected.

My wife an daughter soon noticed the same and recognized that the pattern of the strobes appeared to move apart, then close together, then elongate and then to a more square or rectangular pattern.

I was sound alseep and suddenly awoke to a red light coming in through the blinds.  The light was very bright, like fire.  At first I thought the apartment building next door was on fire, then I felt a static electric feeling and the red light covered my body moving from my feet upwards toward my head.  I was paralyzed and could hardly breathe.  It seemed to last forever, but it was really only a few seconds.  After the light got to my scalp it left and the window was dark again. I was terrified, so I called a friend. I was crying and shaking.  My friend told me it was just a street lamp shining in or the brakes on a car. I was on the second floor of a building that was facing another building.  I was at the end of the building farthest from the road. I insisted that it wasn&apos;t a light from the street, the red light was angled from above my window.  She said that it was just a dream and I was stressed because mid-terms was coming up.

This object moved the same way.. slowly, but changing speed at times, and almost in a straight line. the second object was viewed through binoculars and appeared to glow bright blue, and had a slight cigar shape... Just when we were starting to think things were getting strange, 10 minutes later we saw another craft flying in the same direction as the first craft, again it was a blue rounded cigar shape. I got up into the middle of the clearing to get a good view of the sky at this point, just as the 3rd craft floated out of view I saw another craft flying VERY CLOSE. It appeared blue and sometimes had an orange gleam, it was moving across the sky like a helicopter but made no noise at all. I yelled for all my friends to take a look and they got up and all saw the object, several of them said it appeared to be spinning, as we all watched it move across the western sky an airplane was flying from the opposite direction and it looked like they could possibly run into each other. The pilot must have saw the object and climbed quickly as the object. After that things seemed to die down and we all agreed we saw something that was out of the ordinary. Even my girlfriend who has always been skeptical of UFOs was convinced the 4th object we saw was something strange. The next night we all looked in the sky at the same time as the night before, and sure enough we saw an object flying high in the sky, this time from northwest to southeast. We saw it stop at the horizon, and seem to stop, but the object was actually getting closer. it stopped short of actually comming right back at us, and floated southward across the east side of the lake, once again all of us saw the object up close.

In fact, that is what I thought I was seeing, except for  two noteable differences. The bottom third seemed to be transparent and at the very bottom a white light as bright as the sun. The object could have been anywhere from a hundred yards to a mile or more away from me, I had no frame of reference to judge its distance. It moved slowly north to south seeming to slow a bit as a ballon drifting in the wind might. Its altitude seemed constant. It appeared at least five hundred feet above the floor of a valley I was facing. After watching it in surprise, I ran to get a camera and was back in about twenty seconds by which time the object was gone. At the speed it was moving while I was watching, this should not have been possible. This was a clear day, the sun overhead and no noticable wind at my location. I have a picture of where I saw it, but not of the object itself. The size was about the end of my thumb at arm&apos;s length. There was no sound and it was so quiet that I could hear rocks scrunching under the wheels of a Jeep about a quarter mile away. So I didn&apos;t seen it arrive, I think it was there when I starting looking that way, and I didn&apos;t see it leave, it was gone when I got back with my camera. I would say it was a baloon except for the transparent part at the bottom and the very bright white light at the very bottom. Also, if it were a balloon, how did it disappear so quickly? Even if it burst, it should have been visible falling and I did look for that. It&apos;s really too bad I couldn&apos;t have gotten a pic of it.

I said &ldquo;no lights&rdquo; first because there were no red or white blinking lights that you would see normally see on a plane. I knew there were no wings in other words. I don&apos;t understand how he could not have seen the object, it was large enough, close enough and there were no other objects visible in the cloudless, starry sky. He was absolutely convinced I was seeing and watching and following this object with my eyes, and the meteor happening at the same time I said to him &quot;it&apos;s vanished&quot; was quite a coincidence. No alcohol or other substances involved. The object was about the size of a large airplane and was caterpillar or ameba-like with three &quot;dome&quot; type lights beneath it that did not radiate any sort of light downward. The lights took up at least 80% of the underside of the object. There were no other lights on the side or top or around it at all. It made no sound at all, yet was flying low enough (maybe 10,000 ft) that if it were a regular airplane, you would have heard sound. It was too late for a normal airplane to fly over my house. It moved very &quot;smoothly&quot; across the night skyline. It appeared completely in synch with the sky, as if it was traveling on water. When I say caterpillar-like it was because of the fluidity of its movement &ndash; like it wasn&rsquo;t a completely solid structure, it seemed to move and bend in a way a plane never would. My sense was that it was scanning.", "2 lights that split into 2 sets of 4 bright lights flashing and moving across the sky, then disappearing.Last night at 9:08 CST just a couple miles east of Salina Kansas on highway I70, I saw some unexplained lights.  There were 2 lights in the sky that looked like 2 very bright stars, then all the sudden they split into 4 lights each and flashed or pulsated about 4 times, each time moving across the sky a little more, then disappeared, sky was black, then the 2 sets of 4 lights appeared and started again flashing and moving across the sky.  At first it almost looked like when you see a fireworks show, how a large ball of light goes across the sky and then when it reaches so high, it bursts....but these didn&apos;t burst, the lights just flashed and moved accross the sky, and then disappeared.   Also, about a month ago my son and his girlfriend were on old hwy 40 by Brookville Kansas (about 20 miles from my sighting) and spotted what appeared to be the tale of a very, very large aircraft with a set of verticle lights.  It appeared to be turning and they just saw the tail end of it, and then it suddenly flew away at unexplainable speeds (he described it like what is shown on scifi tv programs as going into hyperspeed, where it just flashes and shoots away) and he feels certain there is nothing he&apos;s ever heard of existing that could move that fast. On the show Unexplained Mysteries this morning, one of the sets of lights it showed looked very much like what I saw last night.", "Here&apos;s what I DID see: Weather was clear, no clouds, temp maybe 78. While driving south (about 75 mph) on I-505 at about 9 a.m, a few miles northwest of Woodland CA, near Cache Creek and near large power lines I saw, through my front windshield, a partial disk quickly appear about 1 mile ahead and maybe 500 feet off to the right of the road. Altitude (guessing) about 200-500. It was as if a round dinner plate had tilted slightly, and then returned to its original position. I did not see anything before it tilted nor after it &quot;untilted&quot;. When it tilted it appeared to be off-white and I could only see the &quot;leading edge&quot; which was off-white. I never saw the entire object, just the part that tilted and &quot;became visible&quot;. The object then apparently tilted back to its &quot;original&quot; position and became not-visible. It did not seem to be moving when I saw it. I heard no sound, nor did I expect to at that distance. The object, or rather the leading part of the object (off-white), arc shaped, was visible for only about 1-2 seconds. I took it to be a small plane making a turn (lots of cropdusters in this agricultural area - however they are always painted yellow) or maybe a white heron bird which are fairly common to the area. I kept my eye on the space in the sky where it had appeared and expected to find the answer to what I saw. I saw no planes or birds at all. There very few trees in that area and none that would have blocked my vision. I have no explanation for what I saw - which is why I am reporting this here. Male, age 65, well-rested. I drive that stretch of road at least 8 times a month, every month. Here&apos;s what I THINK I saw:  a part(the leading edge) of an airborne, dinner plate shaped object, camoflaged - at least on the bottom to appear as if it was just part of the sky (invisible). It tilted slightly for some reason and ONLY that tilted part became visible for a very short period of time - 1-2 seconds only. Then the object resumed it invisible position.", "Glowing pink object moving through sky at sunsetI  just came across your website and wanted to submit this event as best I can remember. About a month ago my friend and I went for a evening walk on the Coyote Dam at Lake Mendocino CA. It was around 8:30pm daylight savings time and the sun was just setting behind the mountains on the opposite side of the valley. As we were walking I looked over at the sunset area where the sky was still glowing a soft pink and saw a brilliant illuminated pink object. At first I thought it was a lone stray cloud that was glowing from the sunset. Upon watching the object I realized that the brilliant color of the glow seemed to come from a super reflective surface that was much brighter than any cloud glow Ive ever seen before. Not to mention there were not any clouds in the sky at the time. I pointed the object out to my friend and we began to watch it. She was as amazed as I was. We talked about it for some time while watching it and debating what on earth it could have been. It was moving very slightly; so slow that you couldnt really notice it at all. At one point it began to move faster, but still very slow... and MUCH slower than any of the planes that fly over the valley. As the sunset got darker the object stayed bright glowing pink. It was sort of a diamond/cylinder shape. It was quite a distance away from us. As we continued to watch the object we noticed it had a red and white light that would randomly blink on the surface of it - not at the same time... each light would go off differently at different times with no obvious pattern. The object moved closer to us in a south/east direction and then began to move away in the direction it had come. It got smaller and smaller and then immediately vanished as if it hadent been there at all. It was not a dramatic display but it was unlike any airplanes or craft we have seen before. Not to mention the fact that it was flying in such a strange and slow flight pattern. No one else walking on the dam seemed to notice it or watch it the way we were.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))", "the lights flipped on like someone turning on a light switch and then off againMy daughters and I were driving back from dropping one of there friends off in Sandborn Indiana. My oldest daughter and I were arguing back and forth. When she gets madd she likes to turn away and stare out the window. It was at this time we saw these lights flip on in the sky they were bright but they really didn&apos;t shine down on the ground, they were a very bright orangish yellow color. I asked her and my youngest daughter that was sitting in the back if they see what I see, they both screamed yes and asked if it was an UFO. I told them that I was not sure but it had 3 light in a row then 3 more in row underneath it just hovered up over Skutter Hill, Then just like flipping off a light switch the lights went off. I really could not tell if it was still there since I was trying to look and keep the car on the road. We continued on south down highway 67. I told the girls to keep looking out there window and I would watch out mine. We did not see anything until we got through the town of Edwardsport on the south side of town about a little over a mile from where we saw the first lights the lights appeared again on the right hand side of the road this time they were a little different. There seemed to be one in one row and the 3 in a row underneath. It again just hovered there for about 10 sec then like turning off the light switch it was gone. We kept our eyes to the sky for the rest of the trip home but we never seen anything again. My husband is on the fire department so when I got home I asked him if he had heard of anyone reporting that they had seen lights in the sky. He said that he had not heard anything over the radio. He thinks the girls and I are nuts but we know that we seen something, something that can not be easily explained.", "Disk moved across sky, and slowed floating down toward ground.I (age 44 M) was riding as a passenger in vehicle heading South on U.S. 94 about 5 miles North of Monticello, Minnesota on Saturday, July 30, 2005 about 12:15 A.M.  My Brother (age 42) was driving.  He noticed what at first appeared to be a large meteror passing by up and in front of the vehicle moving from the South to the North.  He said that it had a tail - I did not notice a tail.  The object appeared to slow down and turn into a bright white disk.  It was &quot;floating&quot; down - heading toward the ground, going much too slowly to be a meteror.  It was heading down in a straight line, and then disappeared over a hill at least 2 miles away.  We both commented that we had never seen anything like that before.

When I arrived at my work, I got out of my car to look at it more closely.  It wasn&apos;t too high in the sky just about where planes would be at and it moved very strangely.  It would make quick little jerks just about in any direction and zig-zag like movements also. It changed into different colors very rapidly.  It was almost like it was a color strobe light in the sky. It lasted for about an hour.  I went back out side around 1 am and it was gone.", "Grey oval object with white lights rotating underneath. Object made no sound as it hoovered. Moved quicklyI was 17 years old in Cleveland Job Corps on Carnegie Ave. I don&apos;t remember which month it was - I was there from April to November. It was probably around June to August. It was about 10pm one summer night when 6 or 7 girls came busting into my room running to the window.  They were very upset, talking about a space ship but I was laying in bed, reluctant to believe them.  When I got to the window.  I saw a grey looking oval shaped object.  From my view, we were looking underneath the ship. There were square like boxes underneath that white lights were passing over.  We were on the 9th floor and I could see many girls in their windows looking at the ship and screaming and hollering.  The object just hoovered there for what seemed like eternity and then just moved quickly out of view. There was no sound from the ship. We were so hysterical the director of Job Corps called a meeting in the middle of the night to calm us down.  There were 400 women in that building that night and at least 250 witnessed this ship.  This was not a blimp or airplane. Picture in your archive August, 1973; 9:00 PM.Princeton,Indiana (USA)looks like the bottom except there was boxes of lights rotating underneath and I couldn&apos;t see what the top looked like.  Except for family, I have never discussed this because it is so scary to remember.  When I saw the picture in your archive I couldn&apos;t stop shaking and decided to share my long held secret. I would be interested in talking to other Job Corpsmen that were there that night to see how they cope with this memory. It still scares me today, 32 years later.", "BRIGHT STAR LIKE OBJECT ON HORIZION. MOVED VERY RAPIDLY AND STOP IN POSITION INSTANTLYA STAR LIKE OBJECT, VERY BRIGHT.

I didnt know where to report it and didnt want to go to the local news so i found your site. I went outside for a bit to cool off because of the hot night and looked up and saw 3 dimly lit circular things in the sky. I at first thought it might have been spot lights but looking longer at it I ruled out the possibility that they were the spotlights. They were dimly lit, kind of a light gray and not a bright light it was like a haze over them, and were what looked to be 20 inches wide.They also moving in and out of the clouds and they looked like they would follow eachother and then sometimes they would hover apart from eachother for a bit. It wasn&apos;t a pattern to their movements either which made me also realize they couldn&apos;t have been spotlights. I finished my smoke and went inside to wake up my boyfriend and tell him to come out and look at this. Then our neighbour was coming home and we called over to him and him and his wife also watched these things. They seemed to give off a very low humm sound. It wasn&apos;t like anything really electrical we ever heard. It was something very very low but yet it was almost loud at the same time. It&apos;s very hard to put into words. After watching these things for about 20 mins. we went in to get something to drink, the neighbours were already inside their home, but when we retured the things were gone and so was the sound. unfortunetly we didn&apos;t have any film so no photo was taken.", "round object wiggles and then takes off into atmosphere followed by an extremely brigh flash of light.at approximately 12:30 AM, two friends and i are standing outside, see an extremely bright flash of light, i was standing facing east, and saw the extremely bright flash in the sky, it literally lit up the entire sky, both of my friends were facing west, and saw the flash and described it as a dot of light wiggling in the sky, then shooting up into the atmosphere. i then call another friend of mine who had left minutes before, and she and her passenger in their car say they had seen the same thing. another friend of mine was at 24 hour fittness in laguna, about 5 miles west of my location, with a friend, and had seen the exact same anomoly... the flash was bright enough to be seen by myself who was looking west and by others who were facing east. occurred somewhere over south sacramento, betweek elk grove and laguna.", "Triangle shaped UFO observing thunderstormsAir temp 85 degrees, wind out of east about 10 mph. I was laying on the ground looking directly upward, and saw a triangle shaped object enter my field of view from the southeast headed toward the northwest. This object consisted of a black triangle shape, six white lights (3 along each arm of the triangle) with the &quot;point&quot; angle about 50 degrees. The object was much larger than a normal aircraft, and totally silent. It appeared to be at about 10,000 feet (I live near a major airport therefore know approximate heights). The lights were exactly the same size and intensity as the stars that were out that night. The object moved about halfway across my field of view in about three seconds. In one second, the object appeared to make a 90 degree vertical turn, that is, move from horizontal flight to direct vertical flight. The change from horizontal to vertical happened in about one second, and in a space of about the length of the object, i.e. much faster and more smoothly than a normal aircraft, and without sound. I remarked to my friend, who was nearby: &quot;Hey, it&apos;s a triangle shaped UFO&quot; and by the time he looked up, the object had vanished. However, while he was looking at the same spot a moment later, he reported a &quot;shooting star&quot;. Notes: At the time of the sighting, a line of hellacious thunderstorms were forming directly to the northwest, the approximate direction of travel. These storms contained heavy lighning, and 70-80 mph winds. Also: We were part of a bicycle riding event, and there were several thousand campers in the area, so there may have been more sightings.", "I was stopped at a stop sign.

Coming out of a trail that opened onto the dirt road that leads back to paved roads, we saw the object.  It was about 3 feet across, and had a light on each hemisphere.  Each light moved independently of the other.  When we first spotted the object it was using it&apos;s lights to investigate a nearby field.  It was hovering about 1 - 2 feet above the tree line.  It was also making the strangest humming/whizzing sound.  It then swept it&apos;s lights over us (still in the truck), and then started to move towards us.  At that point we bolted for the main road.  I personally (as the passanger) watched it either dissappear or move too fast to be seen.

Nearly 10:30 pm the background sky was nearly pitch black.I picked a spot out of the Northern Milky way and watched.  And thats, when the First of Seven jetted across my view.  Extremly high in altitude. I would guess nearly 60,000 feet. Traveling due South.  If I would have blinked my eyes I would have seen nothing. The first object was pitch black ellipse in shape and jagged edges all around.  It was the size of three football fields combined sq. ft. Second and third objects identical in size were directly behind split apart same shape and color. If the those two were combined they would be half the size as the first. Fourth and Fifth identical size, directly behind two and three.  Split apart same color and shapes if combined they would be half the size of object 2 or 3. Sixth object half the size of 4 or 5 directly behind and centered. Seventh object same color and shape half the size as 5.

The color was dark brown or black. After about a minute or so it became apparent that they were something different. The way they moved was unusual. I told my friend to look at them. I thought that maybe these were birds flying in formations. When the objects got closer to us it became obvious that they were not birds. They were moving very gracefully, almost like two giant pterodactyls. They were not moving their &ldquo;wings&rdquo;, but hovering and did not make any sound.

it basically looked sort of chrome in color and round. it seemed to be about maybe 500 to 1000 ft away maybe ( i knew distance because we had recently had a plance pass under us and the pilot said he was about 1000 ft below us ). anyway, i saw this ROUND CHROME COLORED BALL below us ( between us and the ground ). it seemed to me to be approx maybe 1000 ft below us ( or so ). it began to move upward sort of toward us. i thought maybe it was a balloon. however, i remembered we were &quot;moving&quot; in a plane so we should have passed by it if it was a slow rising balloon.it didnt act like a balloon anyway. i am looing aout the window watching this ball rise towards us. it seemed like maybe it was rising slow at first ( or stopped ), then within maybe 3-6 seconds or so, it rose up to the same altitide as our plane, then moved sideways ( as if it were parallell with us and moved in the opposite direction as what we were flying ). i had to tiurn my head backward to watch it move by thru the back seat area glass ( i was in the front passenger seat ). then, as it moved by us it seemed to shoot up really fast and vanish. basically withing about 10 seconds or so from the moment i saw it, it rose up to our level, was about maybe 100 feet away ( when at our level ), moved sideways ( like going opposited direction as us ), then swooped upwards ( allot faster than it was moving before ) and vanished. i was a little scared and did not know what i saw. i did not say anything to the pilot about it as i just did not know what to say. ...........i did however, ask him right away &apos;WHERE ARE WE RIGHT NOW?&quot; and &quot;HOW HIGH UP ARE WE?&quot; .......I thought this may come in handy somehow later if i wanted to try and investigate this. I had no idea where we were ( above what state or city etc ) as I am not familiar with plane routes..............so i had no idea where we were. ......anyway, he told me we were above HUNTSVILLE ALABAMA and we were at 6000 FEET. ....I then looked at my watch at noted it was ABOUT 6:10 PM ( my watch set at timezone of my home in WEST TN )...I am not sure if that would be the same time in HUNTSVILLE ALABAMA or not. ...... I did not see this out of the corner of my eye. It was pretty clear skys and i watched it clearly. It appeared to be something like a ROUND BALL and looked sort of chrome in color. I have no idea of the size as the distance would be sort of hard to gauge in the air for me but if i had to guess id say maybe 5ft to 20ft in diameter???  CAN YOU HELP ME FIGURE THIS OUT?  WAS ANYTHING GOING ON IN  HUNTSVILLE AL AT ANOUT 6:10PM ( WEST TN TIME )?  ARE THERE ANY HISTORY OF THIS?  IS THERE SOMEBODY ELSE I CAN CONTACT?  IS THERE ANY GOOD INFO ONLINE THAT WOULD HELP ME?  IF SO WHERE ONLINE IS IT?  I am not jerking you around and i am 36 years old.

Q: I WE WERE MOVING FORWARD IN AN AIRPLANE, THEN IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WHAT APPEARED TO BE MOVING UP FROM BELOW TOWARD US FROM THE BEGINING MUST HAVE ALSO NEEDED TO BE MOVING ALONG AT THE SAME PACE AS US.

The object appeared to be white or silver and was roughly the size of a commercial airliner, or perhaps larger.  It was somewhere between 1 and 3 miles distant, at an altitude of perhaps 3,000 to 8,000 feet.  It appeared to be moving to the South-West, travelling much slower than would be expected for an object of that size.  At first glance, I assumed the object was a large airplaine, such as a commercial airliner, reflecting light from the setting sun.  However, as I watched the object, it became clear to me that there were no wings and no tail, as would be seen on a large jet, and it was moving too slowly to be a jet.  Then, I thought it might be a large helicoptor, so I continued to watch.  After a few seconds, the object changed it&apos;s heading slightly and it became obvious that it was not a helicopter either.  It was simply a giant cylinder shaped object.  As I said before, it was moving very slowly, and as my car was right there, I thought I might be able to drive closer to get a better look.  (This is not something I would even think of doing with any aircraft I know of.  Even small aircraft move much too fast to follow in a car.)  I kept my eye on the object as I walked quickly to my car, noticing that it was now directly reflecting the sunlight in a bright glare.  It was still in the same general area of the the sky as where I first saw it, about one minute earlier.  In other words, although it was clearly moving to the SW, it had not moved very far in this time.  After getting in the car and starting the engine, I looked to the sky again, and could not see the object.  I backed the car out and headed around another building to get a better view.  The object was still nowhere to be seen.  There were a few clouds to the West, but nothing but clear sky in the area where I had seen the object.  It had simply disappeared or moved away very very quickly (during the few seconds while I started the car).  The sky was still bright, and other objects in the sky could be clearly seen as silhouettes--birds, bugs, planes in the distance--but the large bright object I had seen just seconds before was simply gone.  Is it possible for a UFO to be visible only as a function of reflected light?  Maybe I could only see it for a brief time while it was reflecting sunlight in my direction.", "Jan 8th 2004, there was a cirlce of bright red, green, and yellowish orange lights just sitting still in the dark skies.On my way to work in the early morning hours, I looked up at the sky and I saw bright red, green, and a yellowish orange circle of lights. I swirved off the road as I was trying to get a good look at it. I then pulled over on the 60 freeway going westbound, and just stared at these lights. It was so bright I could not make out what it was, but it was a circle of lights, and it was just sitting still in the sky. I sat there for about 10 minutes, and decided to head on out to work. As I got to work, I started feeling sick, and began to vomit. I decided to go back home, but I did not see the lights when I was heading home. I felt sick for the remainder of the day.

It was leaving a pretty long trail, of hazy smoke that I thought had a greenish tint to it as well.  The oblect itself was quite bright as it was dusk and it was very easy to see from the road.  It was also very unmistakebly a very emerald green color.  At first I thought it might be a satalite burning up on re-entry.  But it plain old seemed to big for that.  I watched it for about a minute and then looked back at the road, when I looked back up it was gone ( I assumed it burned up ) It was headed roughly 340 degrees ( Compass ) from my perspective it was around 80 degrees above the horizon, I would guess the alt at roughtly 15 thousand feet.  It was definatly moveing fast.  What I find interesting is that the other reports involve it being visible from dramticly different areas, and running in different directions.

I looked across a field that lay in front of us and saw what I thought at the time was a helicopter about a mile away moving back and forth.  I mentioned this to my girlfriend and we watched it for a couple of minutes.  It descended on the other side of the field and we forgot it as we were preoccupied.  Later I noticed that the object had reappeared and was moving erractically across the horizon.  I noticed that it was getting progressively closer and finally realized that it was heading directly toward my car across the field.  What I remember was two lights blinking alternately.  One was red and the other green as I remember.  About half way across the field it stopped.  I knew it was close to the ground for I could see the reflexion of the light on the ground.  By now we were both interested and did not know what to make of it.  It continued across the field directly towards us.  When it had gotten to a point very close to us, I think I panicked.  I was parked in a position just across a narrow bridge with no backup light that would make it difficult for me to back up.  I made the decision to crank up and drive toward the object instead.  When I turned on my headlights it stopped and the green light became a bright white.  I continued (without applying too much accelerator) down the road that would lead me directly under the object.  I was as scared as I have ever been in my life as we came closer to it.  I asked my girlfriend to move to the other side of the car and see if she could see anything.  She did and came back across the seat screaming that all she heard was a whirring sound.  I continued slowly down the road expecting the worst.  When I had gotten far enough along that I could see it in my rearview mirror, I stopped and got out to look.  At this time it took off with more speed than anything we have today.  It was a streak of light.  It was seen going over the town of Oak Grove that night by friends of mine. There were many sightings of it during that time. I saw my ex-girlfriend many years later and brought up this event to her.  At first she had no recollection of it at all.  She finally said that she thought she remembered something about it.

At first I thought that they were interestingly playful because they would fly together and then the leader or point light would leave the other two and head closer in towards my way.  It was obviously not an airplane because they would stop and then proceed in alternating speeds.  I had a great view of them especially because it was so dark where i was parked there were no signs of obstructive clouds in their range.  I remember it being very cold and sort of windy.

It was very interesting to watch them move, stop and then forward heading in a direction towards the Hoover dam area or Boulder City.  Over a couple of hours these lights were playing in the midnight sky but never seemed to make any noise or any sudden moves other than great speeds as they were darting in the sky.  After a few hours there were lower flying helicopters circling the area with what had appeared to be flood lights grooming the area.  But, the helicopters were distinctly recognizable compared to the playful lights in the sky as you could hear their blades cutting through the wind.  At one time you could see a wide panoramic view of airlines on route, helicopters and these UNKNOWN solid white lights moving high and stopping in an orderly fashion as to be watching me watch them hover and dart to the west.  It also appeared as if a light would stop and then another light would break off from its original making two independent solid white lights. They were actually fun to watch.

I remember it freightened me so I moved behind a shed thinking I was out of the vision of the beams if it made it to my direction.

It came in at an incredible speed and slowed almost to a halt approximatly 100 feet over our heads then performed a semi-circular maneuever.  It continued at a slow speed and then we saw the reason for the maneuver.  It had gotten in front of a rectangular craft that was matte black, approx 75 ft long, 40 ft high and approx 40 ft wide.  In the front of the craft there was a small square window with light inside and another one on the side of the craft about the same size.  The under-side of the craft had everything molded inside except for what appeared to be four thrusters on each corner of the craft.  The first craft that performed the maneuver was a round sphere and was lit inside enough to make out a lattice-work frame, but could not make out anything else.  We watched the two craft for about 2 minutes and we noticed 2 more of the spheres coming from the north as the others had.  These two were identical the first sphere and like the first were coming in at an incredible speed but when they came in behind the rectangular craft, instantly matched its speed which was probably less than 20 MPH.  All of this was done without creating one single sound.  We could hear cattle bawling of in the distance and even birds rustling in the brush, but nothing from the four craft.

We were moving slowly down a dirt road that I had never gone down before. I looked to read my date&apos;s face to ensure she was not opposed to stopping for a while. What I saw on her face may best be described as pure fear. Her eyes were fixed on something in the air coming right at us. As it went overhead, it could not have been more than 500 feet in the air and no more than 1000 to 1500 feet away.  The car did not have air conditioning so the windows were all down.  I sat and watched and listened as this craft went by.  There was not any sound that could be heard other than the purr of the car.  It was about the size of a large passenger jet.  You could see a row of windows that were near the bottom of the bowl just before the shape flatten out to make a saucer shape.  The window lights would go out one at a time in a series so that all of the lights were on but one.  It gave the appearence that the upper part of the craft was moving counter clockwise. The bottom of the craft had a red light on the leading edge and every quarter that blinked but moved in the opposite direction.  My date did not want to look at this and I think I was telling her that she had to to make sure that she can confirm what I am looking at.  How much she did look, I do not know. After it had passed and I was certain that it was making no sounds, I turned the car around and took off in the direction the craft was going.  We hadn&apos;t gone any distance before it was out of sight.  I continued on down the road until I came to a few houses where some men were standing outside their homes. I stopped and asked if they had seen anything strange.

Tonight, I went out side about 9PM to see if the meteor shower was visible yet. I looked straight up and noticed something moving. I live out in the country, under a fly path, and almost alway&apos;s see something moving in the sky&apos;s above me. Most flights are at maximum altitude above me (30 K feet, I believe it is). Anyway&apos;s, looking at this movement in the sky, which seemed to be much higher than normal flights...... much higher, and not the normal path I usually see,heading more south than southeast, when all the sudden I saw it zig-zag. I thought my eyes were playing tricks with me. I kept looking and it happened again. It zig zagged to both sides, several times. So, I ran inside to get my binoculars. When I got back outside I pointed my binoculars towards the area in the sky, where I believed the object should have been by this time and somehow, almost instantly had this object in view. At the same time I saw another object, coming from the opposite direction , in the same view. The paths of both did not look very straight, but definately on the same paths. Their paths looked so close that I thought they were going to hit. As soon as they passed each other, the northbound object immediately turned around and followed the other object, like it was nothing.......kind of like playing a game of chase. The turn radius had to take less than two seconds...... kind of like a kid turning his bike around in the street and heading back in the opposite direction, in one smooth motion. I was awstruck! I have never seen a plane make movements like that, includine jet fighters I have watched on tv. The turn radius was way more severe than anything I have ever seen on tv. I don&apos;t see how someone could withstand G-forces like that, the way the one turned. The objects looked like solid white lights (not blinking like planes usually do), kind of how planets look through a telescope, and they may have even been a little oblong.... not a perfect circle. I watched these until they went beyond the tree lines to the south. I have probably seen thousands of planes in the sky&apos;s, above my house , but have never seen anything like this.

I alway&apos;s conclude that what I see is a plane, helecopter, weather balloon, or a satelite. I ruled out everything on this list. This definately was odd. These things looked like they were moving faster than the jet&apos;s I watch. I have no idea what I just witnessed. I have to call them unidentified!

I don&apos;t remember the exact date.  The wharf (causeway) goes from north and south, if my memory serves me correctly. Ewakuni Japan has a Marine Corps airbase there.  I was used to seeing the Navy jets and Marine jets and helicopters flying around the base. I never have seen a craft which could go staight up into the night sky like this one did, without any noise whatsoever.I was in the Marine Corps at the time, and was serving on guard duty for several days at this location.  There were several wooden boxes along the wharf, and I was basically walking around them.  To the east was the ocean.  To the west was the base.The sun had set about an hour when I rounded the corner on some of the boxes.  I was facing east.  I saw what appeared to be a bright light, (not enough to hurt your eyes, just a bright light.) come down from my left (North) and fly just above the water in front of me ( to the South).  I could hear the sound of the water hitting the object as it flew.  However the object made no sound, no engine noise, no jet noise, nothing.  The area was completely silent except for the splashing of the water. I estimate the the thing flew approximately 2 feet above the water.The object flew past me, but I could not tell you how far away it was. It appeared to me to be about 100 yards away, but I could be wrong.It went across the water, for about 300 feet, and then shot up at a 45 degree angle, and simply kept going up into the night sky.  I remember just standing there with my mouth open as I watched the thing continue straight up until it appeared to blend in with the stars in the night sky.

I finally turned to my left and ran over to a building (if I remember right it was a two story building, with the front door facing south.) I ran inside, picked up the phone and called the Officer on duty to report what I had seen.  When I told the operator that I had just seen what I thought was a ufo. I was told quite abruptly that I did not see anything, and had better not report it, if I didn&apos;t want to be labled a kook.  I was further told that I would be in very big trouble if I did. I hung up the phone and went back to my post.I have never seen anything like that since.I never told anyone but my present wife about the incident, but last night I was watching television and saw the program &quot;seeing is believing&quot; about UFO&apos;s.

As I watched it approach, I realized it was flying perfectly level, extremely slow and about 100 - 200 feet off the ground.  When it came close enough to identify, I was surprised to see it was a very low profile black triangle shaped ship of some sort.  The ship paused and seemed to hover perfectly still over the campus above me.  I looked at it very closely for several minutes it just hung there without any sound or engine noise.  I notice on the bottom a cylinder type object - if you took the lid off a skippy peanut butter jar, and place it on the bottom of  a black triangle you would have the image I saw plus 3 white lights at the corner of the black triangle.

On my way home from work as I crossed over the mountain at Thorton Gap I could see two large ball shaped objects appr. 2500 feet above the mountains. As I descended into the valley I could see them dancing in the sky above Skyline drive, moving in a North to South direction. At first the two objects appeared to be playing leap frog. After about 30 min the objects started changing colors from blue to green to yellow and then were joined by to other larger orange spheres. When the large two of the objects approached the smaller ones they all became the same color and hovered over the Big Meadows area. At about 5:30 am when the sun started to crest the mountain peaks the objects turned a pale blue and darted at a very high speed first down into the valley before charging straight up into the morning sky, they never slowed to change direction and they were faster then any vehicle I have ever seen. This is the second time I have seen this occur in 30 days, the first time I just thought I was crazy and tired. I will keep a further look out for these objects and report any more sightings.", "This was a night sighting of a slow-moving, kite-shaped craft with lights on it, 20-25 miles north of San Diego, CA.Object: &quot;Kite-shaped&quot;, but shorter and wider than a typical kite-- approximately a 5 to 4 length to width ratio-- travelling toward what would be the &quot;top&quot; of the kite.  The following diagram approximates the axes of the kite shape. | -|----  (Direction of travel: &lt;---) |  At the &quot;nose&quot; there was one bright light flashing at about one-second intervals, along with two smaller, softer white lights, close together and slightly off-center to the left.  There was one soft white light at each of the other three corners, not as bright as the strobe.  No red and green port and starboard lights.  As indicated in the diagram, the cross-axis defined by the &quot;side&quot; lights was no more than 20% of the total length back from the nose-- too far forward to be at the wingtips of large modern airplane designs.  The lights made it difficult to see the shape clearly, but stars disappeared and reappeared behind it at the edges of the kite shape-- i.e. not as would occur with wings and a fuselage. Size: Visually equivalent to a Boeing 757 at 2,000 to 2,500 feet altitude.  That is also our best night-time naked-eye estimate of its maximum altitude. Sound: A loud, fairly high warbling whine, from a single sound source. No jet exhaust roar, definitely not a piston engine. Also, there was no interference &quot;beat&quot; or other indication of multiple engines/sound sources. (I&apos;m a musician, and am used to using wave interference to tune instruments, and used to distinguishing between single or multiple voicings of a given sound.)  Speed:  The object took about 20 seconds to go from directly overhead to disappearing beyond trees and a ridgeline two or three hundred feet high and a quarter mile away. Estimated distance traveled while in sight no more than one mile.  The other witness is an ex-pilot, multiple-engine rated.  Her first comment was that it must be &quot;in trouble&quot;, because the sound was all wrong and it was at or below what would be stall speed for an airplane that size. Direction of travel: Northeast, with Polaris in sight for visual reference, observed from a house and walkway oriented within one or two degrees of true north-south. The sky was clear except for some high &quot;mackerel&quot; (cirrus?) clouds off to the south, with a three-quarter moon. Location:  Del Dios community on Lake Hodges, approximately 4.5 miles southwest of the town center of Escondido, California.

We thought it was a star in the sky but after further observation noticed it was moving slightly so we got our binoculars.  On the 5th it was more clear.  With our binoculars we could see the the red and green lights flashing around the cylinder.  It remained very stationery for about an hour moving slightly in all directions.  Finally it just shot up and disappeared.  We attempted to take pictures with our digital and video camera but it was at too far a distance to be done.", "Extremely huge, very slow moving object seen in the sky by 7 witnesses.I was babtsitting for neighbors and as they were coming in the house, the mother called out, from outside, for us to come outside to look. We all went outside. In the sky was a completly black bicycle horn shaped UFO.  It had a large round shape in the back with a cylinder in the middle and cone shape in front of that.  Out of the cone shaped front was shining a huge light.  The UFO appeared to be about the size of a football field, or maybe a little bigger even.  It was moving extremely slowly and was hanging very low in the sky, much lower then normal aircraft.  We all stood there with our mouths open for easily 15 minutes watching in silence as it moved in slow increments across a very short distance. Suddenly the &quot;front&quot; light went out and maybe two or three seconds later the now completely dark shape disintegrated like ashes.  Particules just seemed to hang in the air for a few more seconds and then there was nothing.  After maybe a few seconds we all erupted with sound, confirming that we had all seen it.  What we had seen, etc.  The father went in and called the police who, after several phone calls told him that they had some report that some air force base was conducting test flights of some craft they had.  The only air force base at the time was many many miles away and to this day I do not believe that we have the capacity to hold an object that huge in the air nor have it move that slowly with out it crashing, much less the fact that it completely disintegrated into nothing.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

The object was approximately 1000 ft up or less.  When I first saw it at a distance(2 miles), my first thought, was that it was a helicopter and there was an accident up ahead.  Because the craft was not moving across the sky like a plane but staying in place like a helicopter.  As I got closer I definitely new it was not a helicopter and it was moving extremely slow heading northwest.  It was triangular shaped with two large circular lights centered across the craft.  The outside edge was clearly visible due to these lights.  The craft was moving with the front of the craft being one point with the other two points trailing.  So, it was not leading with a side but the point.  I rolled the window down as I was driving to see if I could hear anything, and did not hear anything.  Just the noise of the air rushing in.   But as I approached the craft from 2 miles away it definitely was moving slowly huvering it seemed.  I also made it a point to look for commercial air craft since this is near the airport and Boeing (formerly McDonnell Douglas).  I saw no other aircraft in the area.", "Large very bright oval object that appeared to the right, left then right.I was driving my car north on the Stonington &amp; Owaneco blacktop about 11:30am on a saturday morning. The weather was nice and the sky was clear. There were very few clouds. I was looking down the road when a very bright light drew my attention upward and to the right. A very big bright light, like a reflection of the sun from a mirror, appeared in the sky. I tried looking at it but it was like looking at the sun. I slowed the car down and stopped the car at a stop sign. I looked up again and it was still there but was smaller (less than half the size) and had moved to the left. It looked like it was farther away. You could look at it now without hurting your eyes. It was oval in size but almost as wide as long. The light was still bright but it vibrated. After about 8 seconds it appeared to the right and was alot smaller (again less than half the size). I did not see it move to the right, it just appeared. It seemed far away. After about 10 seconds it was gone. It could had been an airplane but it went from closeup to far away in just seconds. There was no noise. I had the windows down. It seemed to appear to the right, then appear to the left and then appear to the right without moving. I saw an airplane about 10 minutes later and it reflected the sun but wasn&apos;t that bright and was a long oval shape.

This is the first time that I write about it, although I have discussed what I saw at the time to family and friends.  I was 24 years old at the time of the sighting and of sound mind and body.  I now discuss what I saw as what I remember and with clear mind, if anyone trys to discredit my story, let it be known that I do not care about anyone else&apos;s opinion, I know what I saw. I was working the second shift at a large automotive assembly plant on a Friday night.  I left work to go skiing for the weekend @ 12:30 am, heading for the North Conway ski area of New Hampshire.   At the time of my departure at work there was a bad rain/ice storm pelting the highway all thru my drive up Rt 495 in Massachusetts, then onwards up following Route 3 north.  Because of the bad weather, I was for the most part the only vehicle on the road.  Proceeding northward all the while the weather continued to be stormy and difficult to proceed. Once past the state capital of Concord, now traveling on interstate Rt 93 the weather stopped raining/freezing raining.  The cloud cover was billowy but close to the ground.  All of a sudden I saw what looked like an unusual light coming towards me in the sky, below the very low cloud cover directly over the highway.  As this strange light got closer, I began to stop my car, Due to the storm and late time, I was alone on the road.  The light came closer.  Suddenly, over my car what first appeared as a light turned into a multiple sighting.  I counted perhaps 8, maybe 10 objects that were a green neon in color, shaped like what my high school science books used to describe what a while blood corpuscle looks like, only in a glowing neon green. One after another these objects flew over my car in total silence, following the highway, but only up maybe 100 feet in the sky. As they passed over these objects were moving at a resounding speed. As these objects passed, they all were following one after the other, except for 3 at the end. These three were to one side of the rest.  Looking in my mirror they continued onward and disappeared into the low cloud cover. I distinctly remember seeing the green glow in the clouds behind me as these objects disappeared into the night. Although it has been a long time that I saw this the image and experience is still fresh in my mind. This is the first time that I document my experience.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

It was a full moon and there was a large cloud formation just blocking the moon, but the upper side of the cloud formation was illuminated by the moon.  It was a great image and we got out and my son started photographing the cloud formation with his camera phone.  The cloud formation resembled a developing thunderhead. I&apos;m a fairly avid sky watcher and I noticed an object moving from left to right across our line of sight as my son was photographing the cloud formation.  The object was illuminated an unusual amber across it&apos;s length and there were no blinking lights as a plane or helicopter would have, and the longer I watched it the more obvious it became that it was, in fact, unidentifiable.  There were no wings on the object.  It was travelling a path not normally taken by local air traffic at the altitude it was at.  I wish I could give an altitude, but I&apos;m not well versed in that.  It was at an altitude I normally see the business class of Lear jets travelling at as they leave the airport on the east side of Columbus.  However, this object was flying a straight horizontal path with no deviation in altitude during the time I observed it.  There was commercial aircraft visible in the region higher up, but nothing close to this object. I commented, &quot;That&apos;s not a plane.&quot;  My son replied, &quot;What is that?&quot; He then took a picture of it and commented how weird it was. Some of what appears as a faint outline of a series of trees in the background at left is, in fact, the clouds we were looking at.  The object was in the foreground of the cloud formation we were initially looking at.  The object is just about to move out of our view to the right.  The light in the foreground is over my garage.  There is a Magnolia tree visible and the living space is to the right of the garage. My son&apos;s laptop had to go in for service, and it took awhile to get this photo back from him.  I document our hours so I&apos;m positive of the date.  The time is accurate to +/- 15 minutes. Strange, the object appears sightly different than what I visually observed, and looks closer than I recall.  It was better lit visually I also recall.  It&apos;s entire side circumference was a dull amber glow, with a distinct dark border on top and bottom when I first observed it. The trajectory was roughly east to west.  There was no sound evident. I&apos;ll foward the image exactly as I have received it from my son.  Nothing has been done to alter the image.  The camera takes very good images, but a little blurring is evident in the foreground, which may have also affected the clarity of the object. itself.", "Bluish ball of light observed at New Smyrna Beach Florida. Possible bolide.At approximately 23:45 my friend and I were on the boardwalk at New Smyrna Beach watching lightening over the ocean. A storm had just passed through an hour before and was off shore. We noticed a large turqouise-colored ball of light, surrounded by a haze, streaking silently from north to south over the ocean, in the direction of the Kennedy Space Center about 14 miles to the south. The object was the size of a quarter held at arm&apos;s length and had a long, hazy, bluish tail. What was curious was the object&apos;s bluish color, unlike any colors of comets or meteors I have seen, and that it seemed to move slower than a comet. Our observation time was about 3 or 4 seconds before the object vanished.

The &quot;color&quot; of the object was reminiscent of very highly polished stainless steel.I could not judge either altitude or speed, but it &quot;felt&quot; like it was very high and quite large based on the appearance of the object...which would also indicate that it was moving very quickly.  It &quot;felt&quot; like it was moving rapidly.  I realize &quot;felt&quot; is extremely subjective, but we see conventional aircraft fairly regularly, both large commercial and smaller, due to being approximately five miles from the local municipal field and also approximately 90 miles from MSP airport in Minnesota.  This object did not resemble either type of aircraft and it is normally very easy to identify the approximate altitude (very high, high, low) of those aircraft.  The object simply did not &quot;fit&quot; with what we normally see here.I watched this object for the full 40 seconds or so and it initially reminded me of an early 20th century airship or Zepplin.  I have seen the Goodyear (and other) blimps on a few occasions, and this was more elongated like the airships.  It was not &quot;stubby&quot; like a blimp.The object was blunt and rounded at both ends and was noticeably wider in the center...almost football shaped, but less pronounced.When smaller aircraft pass overhead, we can clearly hear their engines.  Although we cannot hear larger commercial aircraft, the shape is quite distinct, including seeing the wings quite clearly.  This object did not have clearly visible wings.Finally, it seemed to move &quot;smoothly&quot; across the sky.  Again, this is a very subjective evaluation, but the &quot;smooth&quot; poped into my head as I was watching the flight.

Anyways, we were on our way back home coming down Main ST which turns into Hwy 107. We were on our way down the hill in town in the 25MPH zone. We were approaching the bridge which turned into a 35mph zone. My Dad was driving and I just happened to look up through the moon roof(slightly tinted) and saw a silver, round shaped craft above the vehicle. It wasn&apos;t hude or anything but it was hard to tell how big it was since I couldn&apos;t tell how high it was away. But by the looks of it and amount of detail, it was very very close...I thought a few hundred feet tops.I had to make absolutely sure it wasn&apos;t a relfection or something off a pop can in the car or something so I opened the moon roof completely and there it was....in plain sight. I quickly looked at my Dad and told him to look above the truck. He had a big smile on his face when he saw it, but he focused more on keeping the vehicle on the road. I watched this craft float side to side and doin small curved motions from the right side of the vehicle to the left...then back a ways...then zip forward. From underneith the craft I saw what looked like segmented plates, piled on top of each other. It zipped around above our car from Main ST to Hwy U which I think is like 4-5 miles...maybe more. But anyways, this craft followed us right outta town into the 35mph zone....around a big curve where this road basically turns back into a highway and then around another curve into a 45mph zone, and around another curve into a 55mph zone. I couldn&apos;t see any markings or anything..but I could see the segments very clearly...and the very bottom segment looked more like a thimble than a smaller plate. As we turned on Hwy U towards home, I whipped around in my seat and looked out the back window only to see this craft flying about 80-90 feet above the ground, altering its course about 45 degrees to the left(West). This is when I could say that, if this craft didn&apos;t change altitude, then it was about 20-22ft in diameter max, and about 12-15ft in height in the center max. The craft made absolutely no noise.

We noted that the three lights formed a triangle and comprised a single object because as it slowly and steadily traversed the sky it blocked out the view of the stars.  We became entranced by it, especially because periodically it would literally make 90 degree left and right turns without slowing down or banking, something which to me seems impossible.  It&apos;s path originated from the southeast initially heading northwest, as we were laying in my hammock facing north.  Periodically it would stop and hover motionless, and ultimately darted off at a high rate of spead in a southerly direction.  This occurred in August 2003 and since then, every August when the Perseids come, my kids recall the event and tell their friends.

They were smaller but still looked human-ish.  They looked the same as a white person but they were only about 3 feet tall and their eyes were creepy and huge.  They all stood in a ring of light that the fourth UFO hovering overhead had created with a beam.  Then they started dancing and doing the jig or something.

Two of them are a couple and the third is an old friend of mine who comes to visit me regularly. The couple decided on their second or third night visiting that they would like to go camping somewhere nearby. The boyfriend had never been to Sedona, and was taken away by its beauty. He talked the whole visit about what he wanted to see in the area while he was there and his desire to explore the metaphysical aspects to Sedona. After the couple came back from their hike that day, they were ready to go on the camping expedition. My other friend from California and I took them out to a spot we knew on a big, tall hill just outside the Village of Oak Creek near Sedona, just off of Beaverhead Flat or &quot;Seven Mile&quot; Road. My friend was tired, so she decided to stay asleep in the passenger seat of her truck, which we had used to lead the couple in their truck. It was about 2100 hours when we arrived at the campsite, I believe; I can&apos;t be sure. However, the three of us cracked a Beck&apos;s Beer each and started shooting the breeze. About an hour or hour and a half later was when the sighting occured. The couple and I were standing an equal disctance from each other around the campfire, talking. Somehow, the subject of UFOs came up in the course of conversation, and the boyfriend casually mentioned his desire to see one while in Sedona. The girlfriend confirmed, saying that he basically wouldn&apos;t shut up about it on their hike earlier in the day. No more than two minutes passed when, in the middle of a sentence while speaking to me, the girlfriend broke off and said, &quot;Is that a UFO?&quot; She didn&apos;t point, but her eyes looked so wide they were about to burst out, and she was looking directly over my shoulder. I turned around, and without skipping a beat, I said: &quot;Yes, it is.&quot; The boyfriend&apos;s eyes were transfixed in the same direction, his mouth hanging open like a Looney Tunes cartoon. What I saw was just above the horizon to the West: Three lights, in a perfect triangle (I don&apos;t rightly remember the orientation), maintaining their position. The lights were brighter than any other object in the sky, even with this being a clear, starry night, but they were so far away they looked to be in space, not in the atmosphere. Immediately after confirming the girlfriend&apos;s sighting, I yelled to the boyfriend to grab the camera. &quot;John*, grab the camera!&quot; He just sat there staring. I looked back at the lights. They started to ever so slowly move over to the right; almost imperceptably. &quot;John*, get the f*cking camera! Now! Go!&quot; I yelled. He started to run around frantically, looking for the camera that he hadn&apos;t even unpacked yet, while not taking his eyes off the lights. He tripped over several objects. I knew where my friend&apos;s camera was, so I ran back to her truck, the girlfriend in tow (scared out of her wits, screaming), and threw open the driver door. The girlfriend cowered behind me. I yelled at my friend while grabbing around frantically in the dark truck for the camera. &quot;Sarah*! Wake up wake up! Look!&quot; I pointed out her window, in the direction the lights had been. She turned and looked. &quot;What?&quot; She said. &quot;It&apos;s gone?!&quot; I yelled. I looked over at the boyfriend, who was now holding his camera in his limp right arm, looking more disappointed than I&apos;ve ever seen a soul. He told me what happened: &quot;Dude, it moved over to the right all fast, and then it was just gone.&quot; I asked him if he got a picture, and he said he didn&apos;t find the camera in time. My friend never got to see it, but the other three of us have never seen more proof-positive evidence as to the existence of UFOs. We are all true believers now. The boyfriend kept muttering that he had had a life-changing experience, and how he would think differently about everything now. I tried to use humor to make myself feel more comfortable out in the wilderness. The girlfriend was very scared, but expressed a willingness to remain in the wilderness with her boyfriend, who was now stating his want to be abducted. And my friend was scared silly by the looks on the rest of our faces, and wanted to get out of there. We left, wishing the couple good luck on their possible abduction, and high-tailed it out of there as fast as we possibly could. We asked the couple in the morning if anything else had occured, and they said nothing after we left.

As it did so, it appeared to &apos;jettison&apos; a stream of falling lights as it rose. This caught our attention, and we stopped to watch this strange object. The main light continued to move, and over the next minute of watching it became clear it was coming our way. I&apos;m not sure how we realised this, time having dimmed my recollection. But, we were aware of a shape that blocked out the stars as it moved (it was a very clear night), and in the event the craft moved directly over us. Its shape was like a triangle added to a square - so a &apos;squat arrow&apos; shape. The triangle point was the &apos;nose&apos;. It was completely silent. As it passed over us it was larger than a hand-span at arm&apos;s length. Once we were viewing the flat rear of the craft as it moved away from us, three large round white &apos;engine ports&apos; were clearly visible. As it slowly flew out over the Solent, we saw a commercial aircraft (probably a passenger jet) flying across the sky also.

I had been pacing the object at about 10-15 mph.  When I got to the bridge the object was no longer over the river.  It was moving rapidly to the south west to the town of Hillsdale.  As it approached Hillsdale, which sits low in a little valley, the object made precise turns to manuver through the valley and was soon out of site.  After trying to chase the object, I returned to town where I spoke with the town marshall and a county deputy sherriff.  Both had seen the object.  The deputy stated that he had initially seen the object a few miles east of Montezuma and thought the moon looked large and close that night.  He paid no more attention until the radio report came in a  couple minutes later.  At that point he looked out the window and did not see the moon.  He realized then, that it was not the moon he saw, but something else.  We all agreed that what we saw had navigational abilities.

In the winter of 1976, at the age of 10, while living in Flint, Michigan, my friend and I were excited about the big snowfall we had the night before.  We had a good portion of the morning climbing up the T.V. antenna and jumping off the house into large snow drifts.  The snow had stopped and it was just a cloudy day.  We were just about ready to go in for some lunch, but before we did, we climbed climbed up the antenna together for just one more jump.  I was above my friend near the roof top, when a white spinning object, the size of a 2 x 4, approximately 3 foot long came spinning around the corner of the house and then hovered right before us - still spinning - No Lights, just a faint whooshing sound as it spun.  We both staired at it in amazement as it sat there and spun.  I exclaimed out loud, &quot;Wow!  What in the heck is that thing?&quot; My friend replied &quot;I don&apos;t know!  I&apos;ve never seen anything like it!&quot;  We both were very nervous and did not know if we should move.  We both just stood there in the antenna physically and emotionally froze, staring at it.  After about 20 seconds, it spun back around the corner of the house and disappeared.  I remember looking at my friend and just saying &quot;Wow! Let&apos;s go see where it went!&quot;  We both jumped down from where we were on the antenna and ran around the corner of the house to see where it went.  We never did see it again.  We then both ran in and excitedly told my mother about the situation.  She just listened intently and then fed us both a hot bowl of chilli.  That&apos;s it!

Looking at the northern sky at about a 30 degree angle up from the horizon we saw a object moving towards us. I studied the object trying to figure out what type of jet it was. (I was raised near a Marine Corps Air field in Yuma AZ.) As a young man I would watch the jets go on there training missions and could identify any jet there was, during the Military appreciation days I would go to the shows and the fighters would fly over at Mach 1 and Mach 2. The object approached at least at Mach 1. As it got closer I told the other man &quot;That ain&apos;t any jet.&quot; It was Oval flying just below cloud level, as it flew over head there wasn&apos;t any sound. I tried to get my 7 year old granddaughter to see it but she couldn&apos;t it was an dark oval with a slight aura around it, against a cloudy sky, you could not follow the sound forward to the object like you can a jet.

Apparent magnitude about 3-4. As it reached the zenith I checked my watch to note the time so that I could check its identity on the Heavens-Above.com web site, which catalogs satellite and ISS tracks over my location on a nightly basis.  As the object moved into the eastern half of the sky, a second object, moving at what appeared to be at least twice the first object&apos;s speed suddenly appeared to its south and intercepted the first object and then disappeared.  The first object continued on at its original speed and eventually became to faint to follow.  I looked in vain for the track of the second object, which I thought might be a second satellite, but its speed and trajectory suggests to me that it wasn&apos;t an ordinary earth satellite with which I am familiar.  It may have been a meteorite, but again, the odds of a meteorite appearing to intercept the original object would seem to be way too long to be probable. As soon as the first &quot;satellite&quot; disappeared from view, I went into the house and looked up possible candidates crossing my area at 22:42 on a similar orbital flight path.  There was only one object, a Cosmos rocket, in the sky at that time, but its trajectory was wrong. While the transit of the original object lasted several minutes -- which is the normal passage time for an earth satellite -- the &quot;interception&quot; episode last perhaps a second or less. In fact the event took place so quickly, that I have the distinct impression that there were actually several objects that intercepted the first, coming from different vectors, but I am only sure about the one &quot;intercept&quot; which is the one that caught my attention. I was very excited about seeing this unusual phenomenon, made more so when I learned that there were no publically-cataloged satellites operating on this trajectory (orbit)at this time of the evening over my location in East Central Nebraska.

My first thought was an airliner heading west and reflecting massive sun. The sun was up quite high still and well above this craft.  It was still full daylight at this time.  I grabbed my binocs out of curiousity and what I saw was not an airliner in my opinion.  This craft moved very slowly, had no blinking lights that I could see, and no discernable shape. Just a bright shining light.  At one point a Cessna flew through the field of vision (flying North) which made it very clear that the light I was watching was NOT an airplane!  It did dim a few times after this and then seemed to veer to the left (South) and when doing this, became even more intense of a white light.  Just after that intensifying, it disappeared.  I continued to look with the binocs for several more minutes before giving up. I noted the time, 8:01.So, this is where it gets more curious.  I went inside at this time, took care of some things and went back out to the deck at 8:55.  I watched the same area for a few minutes and ...damn if I didn&apos;t see it again!!  This time it was orange and illuminated from the bottom (apparently) due to the sun being much lower and the sky becoming more orange with sunset.  It again moved very slowly in a different direction, more northwest I would say. I watched this time for under a minute before it disappeared, it got funky and hard to focus on with the binocs, like it was shimmering or something.  Then it was gone.

At this point the aircraft stoped and hovered for about 30 seconds, before turing to the north and flying off.", "8/27/05 at 11:00 pm friend and i was talking, sky was clear, saw falling star, then it just stoped short in the sky,then zig zaged.well last nite my friend and i were sitting on our stoop just talking, the sky was clear not a cloud around, and im always looking up at the sky i love stars so we were talking, then i noticed a falling star so i said to my friend look so we where looking and it was moving so fast like falling stars rocks etc do,but it just stop short and we looked at each other like what the hell,then it started to zig zag slow across the north sky,and we are saying thats no falling star what is it,then it started to change colors,and it was moveing very slow going north,then it was gone behind trees then thats last we saw it,but then maybe like 10 mintues after there was a few planes or jets in that area,then they where gone.well thats my story,i wonder if any body else saw it??", "I was 11 years old and my family and I were at a kite flying contest in a park .

Exactly the same. Same dark object, same number of salmon/orange yellow colored lights, same no lights in back, same turn and disappearing act. One night early last spring I stepped outside about 7:00 or 7:30 in the evening to look at the sky. Some storm clouds were passing through and the tail end of a fast-moving weather system was just overhead. From my front yard I looked east and could see the dull reflection of my small town on the low moving clouds to the east.  Just then, as if travelling in this weather system, the triangular object appeared to descend from the fast-moving clouds and travelling in the same direction, as if escorting the weather system. The craft descended rapidly in north-to-south direction, then turned east, in the direction of the weather movement, at which time it disappeared from my sight. Curious to know if others had seen the object, I called the Jefferson County Sheriff&apos;s Office and reported it. I&apos;m not certain of the date, but if the Sheriff Dept. keeps a log, I could trace back the exact date and time. My point is, the object I saw was exactly like the one on your webpage.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

I noticed a bright, rather large light that seemed to be of a golden color on the horizon to the West. I initially thought it was a plane landing at the Asheville Airport but noticed that it was not moving that quickly. Then, thought aha! planet. But, no. That was when I called my husband outside who quickly got his little binoculars that are not too strong (4X) but sufficed. We both watched this object which looked like an upside down rimless cereal bowl. It was surrounded by lights which gave us the shape. The lights seemed to emit a reddish color and a few of them were larger around the bottom. Rather like searchlights. We watched for about 15 minutes and it just seemed to disappear. The craft was hovering and moving slowly and it was almost difficult to get a point of reference regarding the speed that it traveled. Needless to say, we were puzzled and did not know who to call. It needed to be reported and as we do not think that it was an helicopter or a plane I dedcided to go to the &quot;net&quot;. Appreciate any input. As to ourselves we are born skeptics and need proof of existence before we believe. My husband is a chemical engineer with that type of logic and I share the same characteristics.", "looking to the west the object would elongate and then condense back to a round shape with red, green,white and yellow lights", "3 red lights, rectangulare-like structure, non-moving, AZThis took place while I was out walking my dog. I do this every night and watch the sky all the time just hoping something out of the ordinary will happen. This night, it did.As I was looking up at the sky I noticed a light in the corner of my glasses so I glanced over my shoulder to the east. What I saw, from POV can only be desribed as what looked to be a single red light, that split two more lights from itself. These light moved from the middle light to the sides; one to the left the other to the right. They went out a certain distance and held that possition for a brief moment then vanished. The shape of the object is unknown to me, but from my POV it looked like just a straight line, which could mean I was looking head-on to an number of flying crafts, which makes it hard to tell, but it seemed way to think to be a normal jet-plane. It actually looked thick enough from the lights to maybe have been a large rectangulare structure, but I only wander how something like that could fly.I wasn&apos;t sure what I had seen, but I knew it wasn&apos;t any form of plane I had seen before, seeing as how I live close to Davis Monthan AFB and Tucson International, I am always seeing planes and helicopters flying by at night. I walked my dog for another few steps and stopped again to clear my head of what I had seen, but then as I was looking where I had seen these lights I saw the same form take shape again. The only difference was that they were in a different spot, but in the same general direction. At this point I knew that this was not just a radio tower or something of that nature that I may had over looked the previous 100 or more times that I had walked my at night. The only reason I decided to post this is because I was looking to find more info on the same type of thing I saw just to see what it was so i could dismiss these thoughts like I usually do, but only one problem: I didn&apos;t find any documentation that fit my desription right. This wasn&apos;t a triangle, nor were they/it moving in any direction. Nothing was flashing, just a solid red light the split two more off of it in a smooth demeanor. Maybe someone will be able to answer what this may have been.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

As far as I could tell because of the lights, it had a triangular shape, but I can&apos;t be positive.  There were 3 lights on the craft: white, alternately strobing lights in the front and back and one green light that completed the triangle.  The strangest thing about this craft is that it covered the WHOLE SPAN OF THE HORIZON in less than 2 minutes.  To my knowledge, no plane can move that fast.  About 20 minutes later, I was still outside and another of the same crafts appeared.  As this was happening, my little sister was walking outside to get something out of the car.  I pointed to the sky and she screamed to her friend on the phone, &quot;Holy sh*t, there&apos;s a UFO in the sky!&quot;   Again, this craft traversed the whole span of the horizon, again traveling from east to west as the other craft had.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

The sky was relatively clear, some clouds in the distance, but not where we saw it.  I looked up at the sky, and all of a sudden in the center of it, I could see a yellow round light, about the size if you put your index finger together with your thumb, sort of like a &quot;okay&quot; sign, that was the size of it.  It wasn&apos;t going down it was going west to east.  It was followed by a fire trail.  This did not appear to be a shooting star because it was much bigger.  It was even bigger than planes that you&apos;d see at night.  While this was happening, I exclaimed to my friends (&quot;aw, look at that&quot;), my one friend saw it but by the time my other friend got up, it was gone.  About ten minutes later, my friend that saw it with me, saw it again, this time going south to north.  I would say that if you were to take a yard stick and put it up to the sky, that is about the distance that it traveled.", "UFO Contact, Amazing close sightingIt was about 9:30PM my friend and I were going to go out deer shining with my step dads truck and my friends spotlight. We left his house and proceeded to drive around the local fields shining deer. We saw 3 6 point bucks and a few does throughout the night. As we saw less and less deer we took it easy...listening to the radio and talking about what would be going on the following weekend. We lost track of time and headed back towards home slowly at around 11pm sometime, driving slowly to shine deer in the fields on the way back to his house. We turned on the road he lives on(dead end) and proceeded down to his house(going South). As we came closer to his house I noticed an orange glowing craft which looked like it was over his neighbors house.As we got closer we noticed that it wasn&apos;t. It was infact sitting completely still about 150 yards into the field just beyond their house from the road and about 170 or so yards inward from the North. The craft was like a glowing orange about the size of a full moon at night..so it seemed some-what big...but since we had no background reference we couldn&apos;t tell how far away it was therefore unable to determine its size. How we came to find out where this craft was was when it began to move. Anyways, I pointed at it from the passenger side and told him to look(he was driving). And we slowed down to a stop where it was almost perfectly parralel to us out the driver side window. This was not a normal orange glow, but rather look like fancy flares of light being emitted from this craft. At the very &quot;center&quot; of this craft it was a very bright orange/white color, and as light emitted from it, the light very quickly became a very dark orange. We sat there for about 6 or 7 seconds watching this still craft in the air which was &quot;over&quot; the tree line to us...so we also couldn&apos;t tell exactly how high it was. But to find out later, it was only about 40-50 ft off the ground. After those few seconds where it was completely still and making no sound, the craft began moving towards the north at an undeterminable speed because as stated before, we couldnt tell how far away it was. The action in which it took off was very unique, it went from a dead stop and began moving north which we found out later to be at a VERY slow speed because it was so close. It&apos;s stop to go motion was exactly like seeing an aircraft flying in the air on video, pausing it, and then playing it again. In other words, it seemed to just &quot;be&quot; at that speed...no acceleration. Anyway, after those few moments of watching it travel to the north it, I promptly had to the idea to shine our spot light at it in which my friend grabbed the spot light and quickly aimed the light at it and I bluntly told him to Hit IT! He shined the light once at it for about a duration of 1/5-3/4 second. Almost immediately after that, the craft blinked a large blue light back at us from the &quot;upper right&quot; area of the craft. It was pretty big and could see that the light was being emitted from some sort of &quot;stick&quot; which was simply a rod that had to brightest glow and the actual emitting light was a bit darker. Right after that I said HIT IT AGAIN and he did and it flashed a big blue light at us a second time! I dont remember what I said next, but he flashed the light a third time and the craft emitted two flashes of light very quickly, and when we signaled back a fourth time it then emitted two slow flashes of light, acknowledging our signals to it. It was just a moment of awe...a few moments later to object finally got the the point where we couldnt watch it very good from the truck...so we both got out and began walking down the road in the direction it was flying(N).  When it finally got to the end of the field(north side, still a ways in) we finally saw its light shining off the tree tops it was heading toward. It was 10-15ft above the trees and as it approached one tree, it &quot;jumped&quot; up in the air a ways as if it were going to hit it. Then it came back down to the exact height it was previously at and was again close to another tree still heading north at the same speed. It then &quot;jumped&quot; over the second bigger tree, came down a bit, and &quot;leaped&quot; over the third tree. All three of which are in his neighbors horse pasture behind their house, right next to the field. Still at the same speed, it went behind some other trees(pine) where we couldn&apos;t see it very good...after awhile it finally got past the trees and began heading north-west and slowly flew over his other neighbors house and stopped above a tree in their front lawn(about 120 yards or so from where we were standing)...after hovering there a bit it slowly came down til it got to about 3-4 feet above the ground. Since we started getting so many references it was very clear this &quot;craft&quot; was only 3-3 1/2 feet in diameter. When it came down that low to the ground, its color changed a bit to be a little more white than orange and was softer and less intense. It hovered there behind the branches for must have been an entire 3 or 4 minutes...but it seemed like it was forever. It was like it was just as curious about us as we were of it. Then, the craft began to rise up and change back a bit more towards orange and got about 10 feet above the same tree and it seemed like it began changing shape. At the angle we were at at this point, looking up at it, its background was the sky. So it seemed like this object began changing shape of some sort but really it began flying directly away from us at a very small angle towards more trees. We began to slowly follow it down the road and after 20-25 seconds or so it finally got behind some trees where we could no longer see it. In this area it wasn&apos;t bare maple or oak trees anymore, it was pine trees so it was almost impossible to see it through them. We stopped a little ways before the driveway of the last house and waited for it to pop back out. After maybe 2 minutes it finally crept up above the trees at the end of the road over the trees and someones house heading west-north west. As it disappeared down at the end of the road we looked at each other with our eyes big and mouths open and we took off running towards his house...completely forgetting that the truck was parked in the middle of the road. When we got to the house, just my friends mom was home but she was asleep. We ran in amazed at what we saw, grabbed a bunch of smokes, a pop and ran back to the truck. We wanted to tell the people who were there previously what we saw but at that time everyone had left. We started it up, whipped it around, and took off down the road going North. We got to the end of the road, and began heading west down the road. I was the passenger again and I was watching the sky and fields out my window to see if I could find it. We got about 1/2 mile down the road and took the first gravel road that went north. Both sides of the road were fields for about 1/4 mile, then a thick woods again. As we drove down the road I thought I spotted a light in the woods on the left side, up the road and a little ways in. So we stopped and got out to see if we could see it from a better angle. The light was pretty big, a white center and a red glow much bigger than the previous flying object. We decided we needed to look closer since it just may have been a yard light, very doubtful since it would have to shine brightly through about 100 acres of woods :-) But we had to look closer and see what it was, after all, there was an old cabin back there, maybe someone was occupying it. As we got closer we couldnt see it, and as we got to the woods, we watched out the driver window to see if we could see it. We couldn&apos;t. So we got a ways down the road and turned around, and looked again on the way back. We got back to the fields and turned around and still the light was there in the woods. We drove towards it again to see if we could see it, we couldnt. So we turned around again and came back, doing it 2 more times. But on the last time we were on our way back driving up the hill with woods on both sides of us and the fields 1/8 mile ahead of us. We drove up the hill going kinda slow and there it was. A silverish metallic ball about 3ft in diameter shining off our headlights with three lights on it, all flashing in one by one sync with each other. There was two on top next to each other spaced out and one in the center below those two. Flashing very quick blue-white lights. First the top left would flash on and off, then the top right, then bottom and back to the top left. This pattern was done very very quickly. Probably 4-5 rounds a second. It was on the right side of the road about 4 feet off the ground and you could see perfectly it was self luminous, glowing white a bit. It was maybe 40 yards from us. It was stationary for only about 5-6 seconds, enough time for me to scream to turn the truck around...but he didnt, he seemed eager to drive by it.It then floated over to the left side of the road, by that time we were pretty close, at this time I was so frightened I began letting my head to look downward so I couldn&apos;t see it, and as I did...poof, gone. Even though it was gone I still remember lights being infront of us for some reason...but anyways, we slowly continued to drive down the road going south. We didn&apos;t say a word until we back on the highway going back towards his house. Even then we said very little, a few &quot;no way&quot;&apos;s and a few more simple phrases. When we finally got to his house....we could barely talk about it. It was like there were no words because it didn&apos;t even begin to process yet. The entire experience was just so powerful for us to understand right away. He then decided to goto bed and I took the truck home back to my step dads. That&apos;s where it started to sink in, because I had to haul in somethings to sleep on from a camper we had without a flash light. One by one I hauled in a small matress, a big pile of blankets and pillows in 3 trips. I didn&apos;t want to sleep because I thought I was going to be abducted or something or that I&apos;d look up in the sky and I&apos;d see another craft. I had a negative attitude towards this expierence for awhile, but then I realized it what was obvious. That it was only frightening to us, and they had no intension of scaring us at all. It was just our first expierence with something that isn&apos;t supposed to be real. Once I finally came to terms with it and realized how great and amazing it was, it started to sink in a little that we both had a form of contact with this craft that almost without an any doubt was from another world in my mind. It&apos;s technology seemed so unbelievable. When it would fly and and &quot;jump&quot; over the trees, it seemed to be completely unaffected by force as it were independent from traditional forces like G forces. It&apos;s moves were slow, controlled and flawless. It moved as if forces did not exist at all. It&apos;s pretty obvious that this craft was surrounded by an electromagnetic field. Although I cannot account for the magnetic part, I assume it. The luminosity is a by-product of oxygen/nitrogen? emitting photons caused by the electric field. I do not know if the second craft we saw was the same as the first one. Ever since the sighting I have been into UFO&apos;s. Reading about them quite a bit, researching them and watching for them. Since then I have had another expierence of a craft in which I will be reporting which took place about a month later, during the light of day, above our car as we left the city. Both of these sightings happened during the time when Wisconsin was having all the sightings last year. The way I understand these craft to work...it seemes to be connected to electrogravity theory. Where the craft is made out of key material(zinc/iron alloy as I understand) This craft is then surrounded by a strong electromagnetic field allowing the craft to infact have &quot;poles.&quot; The field is strong and precise enough to where the motion of the charged particles allows the craft to &quot;free&quot; itself from gravity once it reaches a certain point. Many people say &quot;they&quot; cannot come here because the distances are so vast. When at the same time science has a way of explaining it, and I believe this is the way it works. Once the craft is in the previously stated condition, I believe, is no longer affected by force carrying particles outside of the craft. The craft then uses some technique(possibly Element 115, if it&apos;s true that the strong nuclear force can be used for space/time compression) to allow itself to propel towards a wave of gravity that the craft creates itself and allowing it to accelerate to unbelievable speeds instantly. A lot of new research has shown gravity may be faster than light, maybe even constant. The craft may also use a secondary measure when traveling through space. Once it is understood by us, a long time from now, space and time can be bent. And when we understand it enough, we will be able to control and or manipulate it to our advantage for faster-than-light travel in space.

I also study quantum mechanics and plan on attending college in the field of Nuclear Physics soon.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I think the downed pilot was named Mentel if I can remember correctly.  This UFO shootdown supposedly occured over, or near, Simpson County Kentucky.  Back in 1992 I had never even heard of this story before, so I at first dismissed it all as a silly hoax.  So here is the story.  As I was working one day an older man and woman came in to my workplace and asked me for any information that I could provide to them related to the possible location of the crash site of a P-51 Mustang aircraft etc. which had crashed back in 1948? near Simpson County, Kentucky.  These two people did act very strangely, and were very secretive at first.  They seemed to be looking around the room in my workplace a lot for some odd reason.  I asked them what the crash was related to, and the man frankly told me that the crashed plane that he wanted to locate was shot down by a very large flying disk, or UFO.  I at first considered this man and woman to be some sort of pranksters.  So I proceded to ask the man how that he knew that this story was true.  Also, I told him that the US Military had probably already retrieved the downed aircraft a long time ago anyway.  Yet, he persisted and then told me an astonishing story-true or untrue.  The man informed me that he was a good friend of the pilot that was shot from the sky that day back in 1948?.  He told me that he was flying in formation with Mentel that day and witnessed the whole incident.  He said that he saw the object very clearly himself, and it was no balloon or anything like that.  The man indicated that it was indeed a very large and bright flying disk that he saw.  Strangely, he also said that he even saw the beam of light come out from the UFO that destroyed the military aircraft.  I told him that I would have to look in some older newspaper journals etc. and see if I could find him any material related to this subject.  He gave me his e-mail address and they both left.  I still thought this might be an elaborate hoax or prank.  Later on though I read in a UFO book that some sort of incident like this DID supposedly happen back in 1948? or so.  Needless to say I was a little bit shocked.  Could this man have been telling me the TRUTH about a very strange incident like this?  I tried to e-mail this man and woman in Indiana with this new information I found for them.  Yet, I never received a reply back from them.  Later on I found out that nobody with their names given to me even lived in Indiana.  Who were these people?  This story seems really creepy to me now after the encounter.  I don&apos;t know if their story is true or untrue, but it makes one wonder though.  Hoax, or no hoax, this story is somewhat interesting and odd.  We can only speculate as to it&apos;s accuracy.  I thought you might like to read this.  Thank you.----JG((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The lights appeared to be vertical, but as we moved south on the highway they became horizontal and the space between them was about 12 of those lights wide, but that area was just dark. However from between the two lights there flew about 8 or more white sparks in a squiggle-type form, extending out what appeared to be 50 to 100 feet.  I asked my aunt who was in the front passenger seat, to look out her window over her right shoulder and tell me what she saw in the sky.  She spotted it and said &quot;What the heck is that?&quot; We both watched this display for a couple minutes, commenting to each other on what we saw, and wondering what it could be. My uncle was all curious but could not stop the car as there was considerable traffic and no shoulder on which to park.   We discounted any commercial display or advertising -- although its altitude appeared to be less than 2000 feet, and it surely was not some small plane or helicopter.  After a few minutes we had gotten so far from it we could no longer see it.   A few years ago I came upon a paper-back book being sold on a super-market revolving display and showing pictures and drawings of various sightings, in which was a diagram of exactly what we saw and the date it appeared -- but the darn book was $23 bucks and I didn&apos;t feel it was worth buying.

It was during the summer because the sun was just setting and my parents myself and my grandfather were standing out by his pick-up. My mother looked down our street and at the top of a hill she pointed out a white ball shaped object just hanging in mid air not moving. We all stood and watched it for several minutes with the object not moving at all. I went with my grandfather to his house and as we started driving the ball started moving with us. We got to my grandfathers house and stood in the front yard and watched it change colors. It went from white to yellow to a light green and then back to white again. It then started moving off getting higher and higher. My mother called us an hour later and told us that after we had left she had gotten into her car with my dad&apos;s very powerful banoculars. She went up on a hill that over looks Casper and could see the object very well. Behind it she could make out the contrails of 2 military jets closing with it. She said that they got to with in a certain distance of the object before it accelerated up and out of sight so fast that it left the 2 jets far behind in a matter of minutes. The next day it was reported as a &quot;weather balloon&quot; in the newspaper. That is the fastest balloon I have ever seen.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

His description was similar to mine accept the fact that he watched them for a longer duration. There were two lights in the sky.  The sun had set only a half hour before they were noticed.  The setting was river beach with tall trees and many foothills cresting about the horizon. As mentioned before there existed two lights, one nearer to us than the other I&apos;ll refer to that as 1.  The second craft seemed to be tailing by what would have been about a hundred miles if these had been planes and I&apos;ll call it 2.  At first these two lights were seemingly airplanes as far as the pace and motion go, but at second glance the behavior became more peculiar.  When I first looked up there seemed to be a gaping distance between the two blinking lights-  it should be noted that the lights were red in color.  Without a moments comprehension, the tailing light blinked off and reappeared right next to 1.  Then 2 blinked off again only to reappear where it was before.  Then 1 zipped back and forth for only a moment, blinking off and reappearing in a different spot.  2 zipped across the sky to meet up with 1 once more.  2 disappeared and 1 did also a second later.", "The object was two planes length away from our plane and moved very slowly in front of the plane.  It was very flat.I was on US Airways flight 207 flying from Nashville Metropilitan Airport, TN flying to Charlotte Douglas Airport, NC.  The flight departed Nashville at 6:00pm and was scheduled to land in Charlotte at 8:11pm. I had a window seat on the left side of the plane.  Around 6:30pm I looked out the window and saw a UFO flying from the front of the plane and slowly passing by.  I could not distinguish the shape, but it appeared to be either triangle or rectangular.  What was really striking was how flat it was and no sign of anything that looked like a cockpit.  The object flew very close, probably two plane length away from the plane. The passenger seated in front of me and I continued to watch the object go by until we could not see it anymore. When I departed the plane, I asked the pilot what type of plane that passed our plane.  He said what plane?  I said, around 6:30 pm, it passed right in front of our plane.  He said he did not see it and anyway he was sure the tower was had their eye on it.  The conversation was very strange and the pilot was trying to play it down.

I still thought it might be an airplane, but I myself sat on the back deck of our house, for about 35 min. the object did not move, however, the patterns of flashing did change.

Objects seem 5 times in various locations over 45 minutes.Hi, we live in the Olympic Hills neighborhood in north Seattle.  At 6:45PM, while soaking in our backyard hottub, I saw an object in the bright, cloudless east sky that was a light/white &quot;dot&quot; in the sky, almost like a bright star, but it was pretty small.  I was sure it wasn&apos;t an airplane.  I thought it was more likely could be a mylar balloon that someone had let go.  It was pretty small and far away and my wife actually couldn&apos;t see it.  After watching it for a minute, my curiosity got to me and I jumped out of the tub and ran upstairs to get the binoculars.  On the upstairs back deck (also on the east side of the house), I observed the object through the binoculars but there still wasn&apos;t much detail to be seen...it looked like a bright white dot, only larger.  It was sort of like when you look at stars at night with binoculars... you can certainly see them better that with the naked eye, but they still are basically white dots.   The sun which was getting ready to start setting in the west was casting it&apos;s light eastward and was illuminating this object. The object which I had initially seen straight east, had been moving to the north and eventually I couldn&apos;t see it anymore. I dismissed this object as a balloon. I went back down to get back in the hot tub, leaving the binoculars upstairs.  Then 10 minutes later, I was surprised to see what looked like the same object, but it was a bit brighter and appeared due east of us, just between 2 tree tops. I got out again, and went back upstairs to grab the video camera and binoculars.  I very quickly headed out to deck, but even though only 30 seconds had passed, the object which had been quite visible was gone again.  I turned the camera on and filmed in the same area where I had seen the object, but it wasn&apos;t visible.  I looked through the binoculars but couldn&apos;t see anything. So this time I took the video camera and binoculars back down and set them on the table next to the hot tub.  About 10 minutes later, the object appeared again and this time both my wife and I saw the object through the binoculars and I took a video of the object which lasted about 30-40 seconds before the battery on the camera died.  With the camera running, I zoomed in on the object, and you can see the trees underneath it in the forground.  The video captures what we saw reasonably well. With the battery in the camera dead, we passed the binoculars back and forth a few times for a few minutes, occasionally losing sight of the object.  My wife had the binoculars and said &quot;Oh, there&apos;s 2 objects now&quot; which was something I could also observe with the naked eye.  I took the binculars and what I saw was a bit odd.  There were definitely 2 distinct objects/lights in the sky that were close enough to each other that both appeared in the view of the binoculars.  But then I noticed that the one to the left actually consisted of 2 lights that seemed tethered together.There was a top light and immediately below it was another light that seemed to be swinging under the top light left to right and back again like a pendulum.  The two objects didn&apos;t stay visible for long and we lost sight of them again. About 8-9 minutes later, a single light appeared again and I watched it for about 4 minutes through the binoculars.  It was far enough away so that I really had trouble finding it with the naked eye, but could find it eventually if I scanned around using the binoculars.  At this point it was just a single light and I didn&apos;t see the pendulum behavior anymore.  Again I lost sight of the object. About 8 minutes later, again I saw another light that was directly east and about in the same position of the initial object that I had seen. So over a period of about 40-45 minutes I guess we same this object about 5 different times in various locations in the sky.  They were not conventional aircraft, and certainly were not a single balloon.  I supposed it&apos;s possible it could be explained by multiple balloons/weather balloons. It wasn&apos;t a mind-blowing event, but was still pretty unusual and getting it on video is kind of nice.  You may phone me if you wish to.", "Saw a very bright light on an unusual course moving at relatively low altitude without making a sound.While walking my dog before going to bed, I noticed a bright light that was rapidly approaching from the east heading in a north-westerly direction. The elevation at that point was about 30 degree. The light was a bright yellowish-white that was brighter and larger than the ISS when it is directly overhead. There was a small strobe light to the lower right of the larger light slightly detached, that was flashing in about 1 second intervals. The motion of the light was smooth like the ISS but it was going more than twice as fast as the typical speed of the ISS. The light moved along a left-handed long sweeping turn. When it passed to the north of my position, it was at an elevation of about 70 degrees. It continued to a point at about 50 degree elevation in the north-west. At that point, the craft must have made a course correction by making a smooth but easily noticeable turn to the south-west. As it came out of this turn, the light increased in brightness by a factor of three or four for about 2 to 3 seconds. It was by far the brightest light in the sky at that moment. It then went briefly very dim for about 2 seconds as if something structural was obscuring the light source but I could still see the glow of the light behind it. It then brightened again for about 2 seconds to the intensity it had been when it passed to the north of me. The light and even the glow then totally disappeared and all I could see the was the strobe plus a fainter strobe nearby that was about 1/2 second out of synch with the first strobe. When they receded, the strobes has a reddish hue. I was able to follow them until the object disappeared over the roof of a house heading due south. The elevation was then about 30 degrees. The entire affair from first seeing it and then losing sight of it lasted no more than one minute. There was absolutely no sound, even when it made the turn south and it seemed fairly close at that point. There may have been other, fainter lights but I could not clearly see them because I was in an area where there were several bright street lights. When I got home, I checked &quot;Heavens Above&quot; and found that the ISS will not be visible in my area until August 7th. Envisat was scheduled to be visible about 15 minutes after my observation at a trajectory SE50-ENE72-N10 at a maximum magnitude of 2.9 which is about as bright as Envisat gets. I have seen it many times and there was no comparision to the light I saw. The light I saw was at least a minus 4 or brighter.No other satellites were listed as being visible to me at that time. I have no idea what I saw. If it was a conventional jet, I should have heard a sound, since it didn&apos;t seem to be very high in altitude. This fact was confirmed by the ease with which I could follow the strobes to such a low elevation.", "Ufo seen over local elementary school webcam at 7/29/05 at 14:00 hours.

I looked up and saw what looked to be a star, the sky was still bright and no other stars were out. A plain at 34 thousand feet just passed overhead heading North leaving a trail behind it. The object was in back of the trail. I have Video. The UFO stayed in one spot. What was odd is that when the plain passed by leaving it&apos;s ice jet trail, the trail broke where the UFO was however the rest of the trail was still there. Like I said I have Video to prove this. The neighbors where out next door and also saw this. We used binoculars and a telescope to get a better look. It was a Bright different type of white light coming from this object. Then my neighbor spotted another one to the left of the first one we saw. I don&apos;t have video of that one because I was to busy looking through a telescope. They were moving extremely slow heading West. Both UFO&rsquo;s  stayed in formation until It ended up on the horizon and lost sight.  The UFO was right above us when we first saw it at 7:40PM, it took only 30 minutes for both UFO&rsquo;s  to get to the horizon. In 1977 I saw UFO&rsquo;s and reported that also.  The only difference was the speed the UFO went. In 1977 the UFO&apos;s started off going as slow as this one seen tonight. however they took off at great speed then stopped and took off again at great speed. The two we all saw tonight kept going slow west. If you were out and just looked up you could have easily thought they were stars. I new it wasn&apos;t a star because of the different brightness of light coming from it, the light was bright but not the same temperature as a star. A star is more of a yellow light, this was a pure white light. Just keep looking up and you will also see one.((name deleted))((NUFORC Note:  One of three seemingly high quality reports from same witness.  PD))", "((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Walter &quot;Tom&quot; Sheets for sharing the report with NUFORC.  PD))GUFOG Report of Minor Observation During MUFON of Georgia SkywatchOn 13Aug05 GUFOG&apos;s friend and associate, Georgia MUFON Director Mark Ausmus, was holding a Skywatch atop Brasstown Bald (BTB), the highest point in Georgia at 4,784 feet. BTB is located within the Chattahoochee WMA directly on the boundary separating Union and Towns Counties. BTB is located appx. 82 miles NNW of Atlanta.This writer arrived on BTB at about 10:00PM and met with Mark and four of his MUFON staff. This local surveillance began from the large parking and picnic area atop the mountain.  Earlier in the afternoon and evening there had occurred an EXTREMELY HEAVY period of rain which began to clear off by 7:30-8:00PM. Mist and light clouds remained down below, but the top of BTB was far above this and offered almost crystal clear dark skies overhead, with the Milky Way in plain view. Some light mist would occasionally show on the distant horizon, but it would clear off or shift, not much interfering in any way with the excellent visibility and ceiling. The moon had set by about midnight or so. Conditions for a Skywatch seemed to be mostly perfect. The wind was calm and temperatures dropped into the 60&apos;s at that elevation.  The post-peak Perseid meteor activity was consistent and rather &quot;busy&quot; at times.  At 3:57PM, the group was facing more or less to the west, with frequent 360 degree scans and a check of the rear (east) horizon. This writer had turned toward the east for just such a scan.This writer, looking toward the east, observed what appeared to be a light approaching from the NNE appearing to be traveling generally south. It appeared LARGER and BRIGHTER than the starry background. Observed with the naked eye, this light made an obvious swerving motion which seemed to make it EVEN bigger and brighter AS IF coming closer, i.e. seeming to quickly and briefly veer SW TOWARD our location. It is estimated that this light was about 20 degrees above the horizon.  The writer quickly trained 7X50 binoculars on the light and alerted the other members of the party. Upon viewing with magnification, the light appeared to be a TINY PEARL-LIKE GLOWING ORB that was proceeding quickly on a generally N to S course, it&apos;s movements being several rapid &quot;swerves&quot; upward and then levelling off, then repeating this......swerving upward and levelling off, as it traveled N to S. This N to S course was parallel to the large parking/picnic area on top of BTB. This swerving motion was OBVIOUS and seemed almost looping or &quot;snake-like&quot;, especially in the first few seconds. As the ORB continued past, it seemed to get smaller and dimmer and this writer had the impression that it was veering off to the SE, AWAY from the Skywatch&apos;s BTB location. This continued until the ORB vanished among the LOW background of stars. Event duration is estimated at about 10 seconds. Even with the difficulties of determining range or distance at night, this writer had the impression that the ORB was definitely MORE than a mile away and DID in fact come a bit closer to the BTB location for a very brief period during it&apos;s N to S transit i.e. the first few seconds of observation.Afterwards, the group discussed a satellite, but the DEFINITE swerving observed by this witness was SURE and DISTINCT. This ORB was also low down toward the horizon and seemed to be traveling MUCH faster than any satellite (or even commercial aircraft) previously observed by this writer.  The horizon was noted to be crystal clear at the time of this observation.  Though this observation seems A RATHER MINOR EPISODE, recent reports of unusual and unknown aerial activity from this same mountainous region makes it advisable to describe the event for documentation.  An effort to identify this event as PROSAIC was initiated by this investigator.  The database of the &quot;Heavens-Above&quot;  (HA) site was consulted.  It revealed that the closest &quot;known&quot; and readily visible satellite to the time period in question (3:57AM 14Aug05) was the ISS.  The HA database indicated that the ISS would appear at about 3.0 magnitude at 4:10:24AM at 10 degrees in the NE........maximum altitude for the ISS at that time would REMAIN at 10 degrees in the NE......the ISS appearance then ENDING at the same 10 degrees in the NE at 4:10:28.......being visible for ONLY four seconds. This is 13 minutes AFTER the observation described above by this writer.  This writer, as former MUFON of Georgia SD, ISUR Board member and founder of GUFOG, has utilized the &quot;Heavens-Above&quot; (HA) database for numerous years. It has always proven accurate during many case investigations.One glaring example of HA&apos;s accuracy would be a central Georgia investigation from a few years ago.  While interviewing a witness, she was pointing out the sky movements of an unknown craft observed the night before.  A BRILLIANT flash, almost like some high, fiery pyrotechnic device, surprised both the witness and this writer as we looked up. Upon returning to the office, the writer checked with HA and found a predicted Iridium flare AT THE EXACT LOCATION AND EXACT TIME as the aforementioned flare.  Precise information indeed.  As described above, this writer&apos;s observation from BTB at 3:57AM was 13 minutes EARLIER than the predicted appearance of the ISS.  It was also higher than the predicted ISS and TRAVELED at least 40 degrees on the compass before vanishing appx. in the SE.  Said travel seeming FASTER than previously observed satellites or even commercial aircraft.  Lastly, the movement itself was unique....seeming to &quot;swerve&quot; closer to BTB during the first few seconds, then with &quot;snake-like&quot; motion and swerves, moved NOTICEABLY UPWARDS, then leveling off, upwards then leveling off, repeating several times.  This writer is continuing with the effort to identify this MINOR unknown observation, but at this time ALSO considers the &quot;Heavens-Above&quot; information to be true and correct. Probably indicating that the unknown observation and the predicted appearance of the ISS to be separate issues.  W.T.

I was out walking my dogs. There was no moon out so it was very dark. Something caught the corner of my eye and made me look up. I saw four very bright, large, round, white lights strobe-ing very rapidly forward. Then they would reverse and go backward. The strobe effect was very rapid.  To my amazement, a huge black &ldquo;triangle&rdquo; floated just over the tops of my trees. Then it stopped and began to hover near me. To me it seemed like once it had my attention that it turned off the strobe lights and  just hovered there. I suddenly realized that the object was not making any sound, not a peep. Aircraft fly over all the time, I can always hear the engine clearly, the private planes above the clouds let alone the jets. And this was absolutely silent. Then small white lights on the top, bottom, front, back and sides started to do a little &quot;dance.&quot; All of the smaller lights began to play a pattern. First the two top lights would blink twice, and then the two lights at the front of the craft would blink twice,  then the two top ones again, and then the two back ones, etc.  It went through the pattern until it had blinked every sequence it could with the number of lights that I could see. The object appeared to be dark except the lights, black in color.  It was darker black than the night sky.  The object was very large and solid, I couldn&rsquo;t see stars through the object.I estimate the length to be between 60ft to 100ft long judging by the trees and houses and other landmarks in the area.  I couldn&rsquo;t tell how wide the object was because I was looking at it from the side and slightly below. Suddenly, four much larger diamond shaped red lights appeared at the rear of the object, themselves arranged in a diamond pattern. I could see them because the object slowly started to pivot towards me.  The diamonds had a &ldquo;grid&rdquo; inside them that reminded me of a honeycomb. I knew then that I was seeing something totally unknown. They just stayed on for a moment, and then went out. They were so bright that you could see that the object had a kind of triangular or diamond shaped tail end. Or maybe like two inverted pyramids with a notch on the top and the bottom. And this &ldquo;tail section&rdquo; was large enough to house these large red diamonds. Finally the object flashed the lights in a kind of &ldquo;grand finale&rdquo; with the small white and big red diamond lights flashing a pattern together using all the lights.  I just stared motionless, even my dogs were standing perfectly still in the snow. Then the object started to move away, flying very slowly. Just gliding along, in no hurry at all.  It didn&rsquo;t look like it was worried about radar, fighter interceptors or anything else. Although it was probably flying too low to register on radar.  It started to turn in a slow bank at about 45 degrees towards a nearby cellular phone tower. Right then as it flew near the neighbor&rsquo;s house across the street, his truck&apos;s alarm went off. It continued to honk until he finally had to come outside to stop it.   I wanted to shout to him to come look at this thing, but it was already getting further away.  My neighbors don&rsquo;t live close by and he couldn&rsquo;t see it from his point of view. I also thought about running inside and trying to get my camera, but I just couldn&apos;t take my eyes off of it.  As it moved further from me, the patterns got simpler and the red diamond lights came on less often.   I was very relieved that it was moving off, away from where I was standing. While it was right above me the lights were flashing nonstop. It moved close to the cellular tower which also has lights on it, to let aircraft know it is there. But it only has two beacons, slowly blinking white lights like you see on any tower.  The object blinked its white lights at the tower and the lights on the tower began to blink rapidly as well.  It seemed to linger in the area of the tower for a short time and then starting moving steadily away. I stared at it as it moved slowly further away. Finally, after about 5 minutes and it getting cold I wanted to go inside. When I turned my back around again the object was gone. I thought that was strange too, because I thought I should have been able to at least see a little dot but nothing. I have no idea what it was. But I do know that I know a lot about airplanes and have seen them fly over at night many times.   Their collision beacons blink very slowly and they have a small red light on the tail that stays on at night. This was *nothing* like that. It was as if these lights had a program written, to get them to create a little light show. I don&apos;t know why any aircraft would have something like that.

Two faded bluish gray craft that looked more like long speed boats suddenly appeared in a clear blue sky and moved slowly around the still burning flares then disappeared again.

No blinking lights, no red beacon lights..just these three lights one in the front two in the back.

It is near a park area and rest area so people can hike, see the herd or just camp for the day. On the way towards Genese housing development. We stoped to have a picnick and watch the sunset. There was other people there as well. There was a hispanic man standing on one of the many boulders watching the sky. I looked west towards the setting sun and thought at first I was watching an airplane. But then I realized it was round and metalic and very bright. Still I thought it was just the sunlight reflecting on it. I pointed it out to my frined and her kids. At that moment it skipped across the sky at such a fast speed. It was in one spot than the next, to the point your head had to turn real quick to catch it. It was definately faster than any fighter jets and made no sound at all. We just stood there watching it skip back and forth across the sky. I started to get creeped out and said to my friend we need to go. I looked over to the Hispanic man he was rushing his family out. It was like everyone just instictually knew to leave. For some reason my friend, who was driving decided to take the scenic route or back roads back down to Denver. It was a wierd decision because the freeway was right there. As we were going down the mountain side it was still pretty light outside. The sun had not set yet. There were these light like a negative print from a picture but they were florecent green. Not bright, but almost like an olive florecent? they came at the car in waves.

I couldn&apos;t get a good look at his eyes but, He was so very still. We got to the bottom of the road and it was night outside. We couldn&apos;t figure it because the cars time clock didn&apos;t seem to be messed with and we all seemed to be of sound mind. The car was acting up.  We got to her place just in time to discover the brakes were completely gone. Which was extremely wierd because she just had new ones installed a few days before our trip out there.

At first I thought it was an unusually large aerodome of the type seen on AWACS aircraft, but the &apos;glint&apos; was fully half the length of the plane, and appeared just above and behind the vertical stablizer.  I saw no actual structure.  The plane immediately passed into or behind a small cloud whose apparent horizontal size was roughly 5 times the length of the plane.  I expected the see the plane emerge from the other side of the cloud in 2 - 4 seconds, but it never did!  This was VERY strange, as the cloud seemed too small to obscure even a quickly turning airliner.  I stared at the cloud for minutes, not knowing what to expect, but saw nothing emerge.

I could identify almost every plane by the sound.I was awoken by my, then, wife with her saying &quot;their here!&quot; She was out of bed and heading toward the window on her side of the bed by the time I was awake. The room was filled with blue light coming from the small window in our up stairs bed room. By the time I was on my feet and walking around the bed toward the window she was trying to open the window.The window was an inexpensive aluninium frame type that had moisture intrusion between the glass panes causing a white calsium deposit to obscure the view. So opening the window was in order to see what was going on out side. When she finally got the window open it made a bang on the aluminium frame. I scolded her for making too much noise. I could only see out of the bottom half of the window so I had to bend down.I saw four half sphere white lights that were so bright it was difficult to see anything else. The airport beacon was obscured completely. However, I could see what I think was the side of the craft. I say craft because there is no other explanation for the lights or anthing else being there. It was completely silent and stationary above a hanger 25 yards from where we were.Now, the most extrordenary thing happened. I have had an interest in UFO&apos;s and the possability of life on other planets and inter dimentional travel all my life.

Right before I closed my eyes I thought &quot;what are you doing?&quot; A day or so later I remembered a dream that I had and was telling her about it I discribed everything that I could remember down to her banging the window open. Her face changed and she said that she had the same dream. She remembered the sound of the window banging open. That was her trigger.

This is an additional report that was not reported this year. The exact day was the second Friday in March of this year(no calendar handy). These craft may have been military technology. The witness in this incident is the same person with me in the 08-31-05 Kentfield report.Me and my friend were sitting above Pantoll in Muir Woods on Mt. Tam. We had noticed high airline traffic during dusk with jets flying at 10,000 and 30,000ft range traveling north to south which is typical. Two crafts were observed exactly fifteen minutes apart before complete darkness. The first craft was definitely a military jet flying at approximately 60,000 to 70,000 ft leaveing contrails the jet was very quiet but an engine still could be heard and it was painted black. Fifteen minutes later a glowing orange disc was seen on the same exact path as the military jet and was moving at around the same speed which could only be estimated at 2,500 to 3,500 mph. I thought it could have been a test run of the SR-71 and our captured redesigned alien technology at work. This orange craft was slighty higher in altitude and was noiseless and stayed the same color at all different angles and was observed for about 45 seconds. Note: The craft from the 08-31-05 report was traveling upwards from the ocean and was white/yellow/red verses this craft that was on the same military route and glowing more orange. Note: The craft from 03-97 was in the upper atmosphere and was traveling north to south along the coast but it was stopping and starting over and over. This craft changed from black(cool to orange to red to white(high speed) and then back to black when it would stop.

The sky was perfectly clear, some white clouds and it was perfect daylight. There were 5-8 round balls that were trailing behind the main object. The number of balls varied at times and changed positions. The crown object appeared to be changing shape very subtely, but kept its main shape for the most part. I could see it very clearly. It seemed to be radiating heat or it seemed to bpossibly be spinning slowly. It had a &quot;pawn&quot; type structure rising out of the middle, like a pawn in a chess game.

It stayed in the same spot for about a minute then turned again to a tube shape and kept going slowly.

I saw a strange (at least to me) perfectly horizontal shooting star, pretty big.  Then, about 5 minutes later, my girlfriend tells me to look up and asks me if I can see what she&apos;s seeing. I don&apos;t at first, but she uses a flashlight and points right at it.  It looked EXACTLY like two stars, very far apart, moving in tandem slowly and methodically across the sky.  We watched this thing for close to 2 minutes before it literally vanished - not over the horizon or out of our field of vision. It just disappeared. This thing had to have been huge.  It would not be exagerrating to estimate at least 400 feet in length. One light at the front, one at the back. No pulsing, no flashing. Totally and completely silent and very high up, or at least it was disguised to look as if it was. If we hadn&apos;t been scanning the sky, we never would have seen it.  It looked EXACTLY like two big and bright stars, very far apart only moving together through the sky, obvious to anyone who saw it that they were part of one enormous craft of some kind. It really looked as if it was using some sort of cloaking device or disguise - I knwo that sounds crazy, but you had to see it - it was obviously trying NOT to be seen. As a soldier in the bush wears camouflage and greasepaint to blend in with the jungle... that&apos;s what it made me think of. I&apos;ve seen quite a few UFO&apos;s and such in my life, but this was without a doubt one of the most indisputable sightings I&apos;ve ever had. No question that it was up there. No question that it was NOT an airplane, a weather balloon, a meteor, shooting star, bird or swamp gas. And no question that it was gigantic, silent and on a controlled course.

After the phone call my Wife, 8yr old son, mother-in-law,Father-in-law,and his grand daughter, all went out on the patio to look. My Wife Immediately called me after deciding that it was not a plane or a star. I was at Our residence waiting for her to come home when I recieved the call. We live aprox. 2 miles east of my mother-in-laws.When I looked up into the sky looking for what my wife was franticly describing to me, I found it immediately to the east of my location. My Nephew, His wife their two little kids, and My 12yr. old daughter all seen this Bright red glowing object that from my location looked to be a little bit larger than a star but much much more brighter, and it was very very red, about the same intensity that a red becon on a radio tower is but it stayed glowing bright red for about 10 min. and did not move. from my wifes vantage point she said it was &quot;f&apos;n huge&quot; she said it was as big as my Chevy Blazer. and also said it was directly over the house. My Father in law also said it was very large, when I asked him if he held it out at arms length how big would it have been? he said about the size of a softball! They wathed it for about 10-15 min. when it started moving off to the west picking up speed as it got farther away. mean while I wathed it from my vantage point and watched it for 10-15 min. and then it slowly moved south, then it blinked a few times, got real dim, then it got real bright again and headed in a westerly direction at a very fast rate of speed till I lost it behind some trees obstructing my view. Mean while the cousin who first spotted the object had arrived home and was out watching it also. His observation was pretty much the same as mine except when it started to head off in the Westerly direction he observed it split into two peices. Which kind of makes sence to me because his street runs east to west and he would not have any trees obstructing his view. Incidently, Brookpark,Ohio borders Cleveland Hopkins International Airport. and My mother-in-law lives less than a mile and a half from the airport. The flight path of this thing would have been within a half mile of the airport. The next day one of the news statons reported the UFO along with a pixelated still photograph. and a report from some local astronomer that what everybody saw was actually the suns reflection off of the international space station.

It came approximately my direction in a straight course heading due east. I moved thirty feet into the back yard and kept it in my view, it passed over my residence to the north at 85 degrees above the horizon, still heading due east and not altering course or speed. It was a completely round craft and was glowing faint orange on the bottom. At it&apos;s closest position to me it appeared the size of my little finger nail held at arms length. Completely round and flat, not like a ball, but like a disk, it had a gray rim. It had no lights just the faint orange glow under the whole craft. It went out of sight at about thirty degrees on the easterly horizon again at that point it was about the size of a seagull at two hundred yards. It made no noise and distinctly looked like a round flat craft, it was faster than any object I have seen in the sky except a shooting star, it took 15 - 20 seconds to cross my field of view, from west 30 degrees to east 30 degrees, and did not look like a satellite, space station, or plane.

The object was white but seemed to glimmer a silver color. The sun was low in the sky in the east and the object seemed to be reflecting the sun, much like a mirror does. The object really struck me becuase it was not moving at all, there were no markings, lights, or other things that made the object look like a plane.

It made a soft hissing sound  which is what made me look up.  I could see some purple lights on the underside (only 2 or 3 but my view was obstructed by trees on the sides of the road).  It was a very dark night so I had a hard time discerning size and height but I estimated it was about 50-60 feet up and 80 feet across or more.  It was moving at only 5-10 mph.  The purple lights were a dark color and not terribly bright.  I saw no other color lights on the object (ie, no normal white/red/green aircraft lighting).

The first one was in Hamilton located flying above Wilson Jr. High school on the first day of school in 1997. As far as i can remember is was a silver rounded object hovering above the school for about a few minutes not moving at all, it was about the height that average planes fly but made no sound and many students saw it but never said anything of it. I&apos;m still unsure of what it was. It light as day out and too bright to see any kindof satellite flying that low. The second and third sightings were exactly the same and located about two miles south of downtown Hamlton at around 10PM the first and 2AM the second time. They were two glowing lights, just lights slowly moving in differant directions as I saw riding in my car by the great miami river on the west side of town. I&apos;ve seen these two lights in the same location twice and I strongly don&apos;t believe they are planes because they just hovered around the same area for about 30 minutes each time without any blinking lights. There is an airport there that just has small planes, none of them are capable of doing, or look like these two objects, They where white lights . I am a very openminded person and I would not give you a fake report or anything, as I, like so many want to know the truth about what is happening.

It was a descending white light. What caught our attention, however, was that the shape of the light changed as it descended, flattening out into a horizontal line of light.  As we drove down a depression in the freeway, we lost sight of it, but I caught one more glimpse of it after coming up the other side.  Although I only saw it momentarily, it appeared as if there were two white lines of light, one on top of the other (like an equal sign).  I then lost sight of the lights.

I pointed it out to my sister and her boyfriend, and we all watched the thing. It was slightly lighter than the sky around it, and had a small orange light at the very tip of each point. Whiteish smoke was coming out the tail end (the shortest side) and trailing away, kind of like a cloud. It was moving... I&apos;d guess about the speed of any airplane(?). After about 35 seconds of us watching it, the whole thing just faded. The outline faded, the white smoke stopped (but the smoke that was already in the sky died away slowly), and the orange lights dimmed. The two rear ones died out completely, but the one on the front tip just dimmed until it was around the brightness of a red dwarf star. (I don&apos;t know whether it was a stealth action.) The whole ship slowed down, and moved very slowly from that point on, and we just watched it for like another minute, and then my sister said, &quot;Just drive.&quot; So we went, I kept trying to watch for the triangle&apos;s light, but I lost it, and by the time we got back, I guess it must have flown away or just dimmed completely. I&apos;d guess it was between 22 and 45 degrees up in the eastern sky (from our POV).Our background? My sister and I are born-and-raised Americans, and the boyfriend is a Russian.

The night was unusually beautiful, moonless and crystally clear.  My head was craned back as I looked overhead and marvelled at how velvety black the night was and how sparkling the stars.  As usual,  the milky way was much in evidence.

I used to climb to the top of North Mountain every night for excersize. Coming down one night, I saw what I first thought was an airplane, but it came closer and it looked like it had slowed down quite a bit, ruling out an airplane, at which point I thought it was a helicopter and became alarmed (sometimes police helicopters fly over North Mountain park, which closes at 11:00 PM, I did not want to be &quot;spot lighted&quot;). I was eyeing the aircraft very closely to see if it was in fact a helicopter and because it was approaching North Mountain.  It was flying very slowly at some point, and I was looking directly at it, trying to make it out against a black sky. I caught the first glimpse of its shape, it had lights on it, like a helicopter would, but the rear of the aircraft was square. I became very confused, trying to figure out what kind of aircraft was &apos;square&apos;. Also, it was very quiet, helicopters make a lot of noise, even from a distance, this one wasnt making any noise at all. I continued to stare at the aircraft, caught a second glipse of it, and the shape looked definitely square from the back end (couldnt make out the front end because of the lights on the aircraft). At this point, I became nervous, I was starting to panic, I moved into a dark area off the paved road under a small &quot;ridge&quot; to keep myself from being seen. The aircraft flew nearly overhead from where I was standing, and it literally dipped down towards the gorge area, flew back up a little and circled around the peak across the gorge (this was the peak where the radio antennas are located). The aircraft must have not been more than 50 feet from me at one instant. It was black and sqare shaped aircraft, made a quiet turbine machine like noise, I had no idea of what this was, but it was &quot;right in my face&quot;, so to speak, and I was mortally terrified. What went through my mind in that instant was not good, I was really scared, I wanted to run away at full speed down the mountain towards the apartments where I lived. I just wanted to get out of there, quick, but I also realized that any movements might cause me to be detected by whatever that aircraft was. After the aircraft circled around the North Mountain peak, I did not see it again. I was worried that it might circle back around, but it didnt. I somehow consoled myself by thinking that whatever that was, it was not looking for me. After a few minutes, I started back down the road briskly in an effort to get to the other side of the ridge, so if it did circle back around then I would be obscured from its path. On the way down, I considered calling the police when I got back to my apartment, but then I realized that I wouldnt have been taken seriously. I continued to climb North Mountain after that, but only in daylight hours. I didnt think running into something like that would ever happen again, however, the incident had shaken me up pretty badly and I did avoid climbing up at night after that. Previous to this incident, I did not believe in UFOs and when somebody mentioned it I would go so far as to get upset and try to prove to them that they do not exist and it is impossible by the laws of physics to cover great distances in anyones lifetime. After witnessing this, it is obvious to me that they do exist because I saw one, although I dont understand it or how it could be possible. But I still saw it. i can speculate that maybe the reason why it was flying over that area was because of the radio antennas? At any rate, I had a close up visual of the aircraft, it was not a helicopter, and it could not be anything else because of its extremely low altitude at the final moment of the sighting. Aside from the fact that helicopters are obvious and make a great deal of noise, not even a helicopter would fly that low in that area because of electric lines that go across the mountains (danger of hitting an electic line).", "seaton devon over the seaThe aircraft was hovering over the sea it was quite close but there was no sound coming from it. there were lights at the front it hovered around as though it was just having a look around still it was so silent.

But it was not dark enough yet for any other stars to be seen.  After 5 min or so they quickly changed formation and kept changing.  Then they disappeared.", "I saw three strange lights moving erratically over the foothills behind my house, departing in different directions at different times.I was outside in the early morning watching the end of the meteor shower when I noticed two very unusually bright lights near the mountain behind my house that I at first dismissed as stars.  One was located to the West, the other toward the Northeast.  As the sky grew lighter,  I noticed that the lights had not moved from their positions, but the rest of the stars had.  Upon closer observation, I saw that the light in the Northeast was rising into the sky very very slowly, and was also darting slightly from side to side.  I then noticed a dimmer light a little below it also start to rise in the same manner, but almost immediately moved in an Easterly direction, disappearing shortly afterward.  Then the brighter light seemed to stop rising and just hovered, still making small darts from side to side.  I then started watching the other light to the West and noticed it was moving side to side as well.  This one, however stayed closer to the ground, only rising a bit, then sinking down again and again.  The movements were subtle, but it was undoubtedly moving. I have never heard of or seen any kind of vehilcle that moves like these lights did.  Both the lights I saw made no noise, and flickered at an irregular rate.  Each time they flickered, the color seemed to change slightly, from white to blue, to yellow, and I think red, too, but each color was so bright and blended together it was hard to tell.  I&apos;m also pretty sure they changed shape slightly as they flickered.  The lights stayed like this for a while and all I could do was stare and try to process what I was seeing.  Eventually, the Northeast light seemed to move away East across the valley and I lost sight of it, so I kept watching the one to the West.  Almost as soon as the other light left, this light&apos;s movements became more pronounced, rising higher, then sinking, and moving back and forth along the hill.  Each time it sank lower and lower until I lost it behind the hill.  I immediately ran into my house, put on some shoes, and raced out into the desert to find it.  I ran around the hill I saw it disappear behind and saw the light again, still moving in the same manner, but it was moving away over the mountain at a steady pace.  All I could do was watch it zig zag farther and farther away.  It appeared to stop a few times as it did so, but it eventually rounded the side of the mountain and I could no longer see it. I have always believed in UFOs but never actually thought I would see one.  I was raised in a good family, I get along well with my parents and sisters, and have never been known to lie about something like this.  I am not on drugs and do not have any mental disorders that would cause me to see this.  I still cannot believe what I&apos;ve seen.  I have no rational explanation.  I feel like I must sound completely crazy since I&apos;m the only person who saw this, especially on the night of a meteor shower.  I am absolutely positive, though, that these lights were not stars or meteors or airplanes or anything I&apos;ve seen before.  I am absolutely dumbfounded.", "I always thought this sighting should be on an official list, now, 60 yrs. later, it is.If you are keeping records of post-war sightings, here&apos;s one.It was a brief encounter, that left a lasting impression.The craft was silent, hovering, greyish metal and disk shaped.As for the disk shape, picture a hat with a low rounded crown, where a hat band would normally be there was a row of windows.There was a sense that someone was inside  but it was not distinct.My mother is the person who saw it. She was waiting for the bus in the early morning, happened to look up, was stunned to see this thing hovering over the top of a flat roofed building (Sears Roebuck) across the street. She didn&apos;t want to take her eyes off it, but wanting someone else to see it, she turned to get their attention, in that instant of turning away, it was gone.The location where this happened was very near the main part of town.There was, if memory serves, a Union Carbine/Western Electric plant about a mile away.Their business may have been defense work &lt;--not sure about that, but certainly not aircraft.That was appx. 1945. It remained a vivid memory until she died in 1983.She drew sketches of it, and I grew up hearing the story many times.She was not a hokus-pokus sort by any means.

Lauderdale, FL in the late 1990&apos;sOne evening in the late 1990&apos;s or maybe 2000, my wife Kathy and I were sitting out by our screened pool facing west. We felt a sort of rumbling and heard a low hum. We looked up and saw a very large black object in sky heading east. It flew over us and over the house at a slow rate of speed.  It was a triangle like shape and appeared to be black but it was hard to tell because it was night but with alot of light pollution. As it got directly above us we saw &quot;lights&quot; that were inverted V in shape and a greeish yellow color.  Both of us thought at the time and still do that we saw a stealth bomber flying at night in a heavily populated area at a low altitude and slow speed. We had both seen stealth bombers at air shows and were convinced that this is what the craft was.  We listened to the News to see if there was such a craft in the area but there was no mention.  We looked at the newspaper but no mention.  I asked people at work the next day if they had seen or heard anything but no one had.  I even mentioned the incident to my boss who lives in Phoenix.  We do not remember the date that this happened because we were completely convinced this was a stealth fly over.  We did think it odd that such a craft would be flying at night at such a low altitude and slow speed over a heavily populated area near a busy airport (FLL.) But for us it was not a life changing event because we thought we knew what had happened.  We were reminded of the incident last year when we were at a Jacksonville Jaguars football game during the day and there was a stealth bomber fly over.

I noticed a car pulled over to the side of the shoulder, and then a few hundred feet further another car pulled over to the side of shoulder.  The passengers of this second car, two people, a male &amp; female were standing in front of their car with a flash light pointing it straight up towards the sky and turning it off &amp; on, like they were signaling to something.  I thought what the heck are these people doing???  I slowed down and had to lean over the wheel and look up to my right to see what they were signaling to.  Once I saw, I immediately pulled over to the side of road also.  I pulled over about maybe 15 or so car lenghts in front of this car and immediatley turned off the engine and lights and then began to watch the object.  The object was to the right of my car, approx five or six car lenghts off the shoulder and then approx about a telephone poll and half up into the sky.  I can&apos;t measure real well in approx feet which is why I&apos;m using objects to describe this.  The object that I saw was so close to me and so close to the ground but yet it just hung there, no sound or vibration at all, absolute silent, and very, very, big.I am very hesitant to give all the details over the internet however, I will say that in looking over your site I found one VERY close and similar incident which follows -         Occurred : 7/17/1996 01:35 (Entered as : 07/17/1996 01:35) Reported: 1/17/2004 4:37:11 PM 16:37 Posted: 1/22/2004 Location: I-5 (Firebaugh Exit), CA Shape: Diamond Duration:15 min What I saw, and I know the other two people saw as well , was a triangle of lights. Becasue this incident was so close to me there was absolutly no mistaking what I saw.  I know that this was a craft of some sort, however, not something of our world.  I&apos;m no expert but I feel very confident that planet earth does not possess the capabilities to do what this craft did.  Additionally, the entire time I watched this object I had the very distinct and real feeling that someone, or some thing,  was watching me back.  I&apos;m posting this today becsue of the sighting that I referenced above.  This happened to me at approx the same area.  I was just about 2 or 3 miles from the Firebaugh exit on I-5.  After viewing this object, which eventually traveled straight up into the cloud covering and disappeared, I immediately drove to the first gas station there at the Firebaugh exit and phoned my mother to tell her what had just happened.This experience happened to me in 1987 almost ten years ago, however, I remember every detail as though it happened ten minutes ago.

I saw a small sphere that was baseball size moving along about 10 metres above ground height. It came from behind me and passed. There was a wall ahead and i&apos;m not sure if the sphere dipped after it got past the wall or if it had been dipping its trajectory slightly all the time. When I saw it Ihad just been coming to a bend in the road where the wall was ahead. I was going to cross the road to look over the wall, but a car came round the corner and had the driver not horned at me i would not have noticed the car.

I then spotted a white disk crossing the path of the jet contrail after the jet had passed the object. The white disc was in the southern sky moving to the north. It was moving slowly so I went just inside the house and got two binoculars so we could observe this object. The sky was mostly clear with only a few white clouds. The object could be seen very easily since it was reflecting sunlight. It was very high in the sky but looked like a white disk through the binoculars. We could see the shape of the wings on the jet but not on the disk. It moved slowly north to almost directly over us and then stopped and remained stationary for about five minutes as we observed it.

I and some friends were at a Drive-In movie located in the town of 29 Palms outside the base. It was pretty late at night. The movie screen was located about 5 feet away on the other side of 5&apos; high wooden fence that surrounded the parking area. I just happened to look off to the upper right hand side of the screen and noticed that something was hovering, with multi-colored blinking lights, above a darkened building, about a mile away on the outskirts of town. (29 Palms, CA) I thought to myself, &apos;What the heck is a helicopter doing hovering over a building out in town&apos;? I was used to seeing all kinds of helicopters on the base. I then noticed that it continued to hover, there was no sound or sand being kicked up. It appeared to be a ball of multi-colored blinking lights. I couldn&apos;t discern a shape. I absent mindedly started walking towards the fence to get a better look. I then noticed that many other people in the Drive-In saw it too and got out of their cars. The UFO then started to rise straight up, silently. It did not flair out at an angle like a helicopter would. It kept going up until it appeared to be the size and color of a star. It then started zig-zagging across the sky while still going up, until it finally disappeared. I found out later that at the same time, people located on the other side (to the left of the screen) of the drive-in area, saw two UFO&apos;s hovering over a mountain, located to the left of the screen. They reported that the 2 UFO&apos;s they saw, also rose straight up, silently, and zig-zagged while going up until they were out of site.

The campsite was around 30-35 miles east of Prineville, Oregon past a small village called Post.  One night during the trip I was awakened by a streaking lime green fireball moving very quickly across the sky.  It was emitting sparks (also lime green in color) and I could hear a crackling sound from above.  This whole memory is only remembered in a dream-like state.  In the brush across from the campsite about 30 yards away I saw a creature in a spacesuit-like outfit.  It was short and rotund, like the Michelin Tire Man.  It was in a form-fitting light brown color jumpsuit/spacesuit outfit.

Owning and frequently using a telescope as an amateur astronomer, and recognizing that nothing should be in this portion of the sky, I stopped and looked trying to figure out what it was.  As I watched, the light began to oscilate or twinkle, then quickly grew smaller, until it could not be seen. I was somewhat stunned, but it appeared that whatever it was moved directly away from me at amazing speed. The object was white as a planet or star, and as large as venus when it is low in the sky. I am a male, 47, professional, and enjoy watching the nightime sky.  I have seen many things in the sky, with most easily being explained as meteortites, satalights, planes, or other conventional aircraft. This event was unique, and quite puzzling due to the objects speed of travel.  Seeing that it was dusk, the suns rays could have still been refracting into the sky, but the light source was not consistent with a reflection.

Thinking it odd that the northern lights would be in the east-- during the summer-- I pulled off the road, turned off my headlights and rolled down my car window. I observed a shimmering light that was behind some low cloud cover. The shimmering was similar to the way sunlight filters through clouds in distinct rays-- or sun rays at sunset when they are distinct and moving. The light shimmered from right to left and another layer from left to right simultaneously. Then, what looked like a search-light moved across the clouds from right to left,hesitated, jerked back, went above the clouds, moved from left to right above, and then repeated the movement under the clouds. I could not discern whether the light was touching the ground or just the clouds. I listened for aircraft but only heard insects. I then continued driving south on 287-- stopping occasionally to attempt to understand what I was seeing. Although I was moving fast, the lights were still on my left as if they had also moved at 80 mph. I stopped, looked, and they came closer. I thought maybe there was a search for a missing person and they might think  my turned off headlights were suspicious. Then there were two searchlights in front of the shimmering background. Then there were three and one came close enough to me that I could see the source of the light better. It was round. (sorry). I became really frightened and confused by it all and sped into town.

My friend and I watched a flying object for several hours and witnessed its presence as long as five hours after initial sighting.  The object made no sound that we could hear.  We were at the top of a small mountain with a continuous, nonchanging rise to the area on the other mountain where the object was.  In other words, we were in a bowl shape that would have channeled sound very well.  The object was in the sky and about half way from the bottom of the mountains to the top.  The bottom of the mountain where the object was is also the bottom of the mountain that we were on.  It repeatedly flew in a &quot;T&quot; shape.  It would fly straight back and forth for at least 10-15 minutes and then drop at a perfect right angle down into the bottom of the &quot;T&quot; shape.  It would then resume the back and forth movement after coming back up to the plane it was moving in horizontally.  The object had a light that could best be described as an amber light resembling a street light in color.  The intensity of the light decreased significantly as you look away from the center.  The light appeared like a round ball of evenly dissipating light.  The light stayed one intensity, but would increase approximately 10 seconds before the object descended into the bottom of its &quot;T&quot; movement.  There would occasionally be a red light that seemed to be attached to a lever that was  connected to the object in the middle.  The lever would look stowed into the vehicle and normally not be visible, as there was no red light visible.  As the object came up out of the &quot;T&quot; pattern, the lever with a red light at the end would sweep 180 degrees, from horizontal at the rear of the vehicle to horizontal at the front, and disappear.  The red light appeared to swing down from out of the craft, swing in a half circle and disappear up into the front.  The angle at which the object descended in its &quot;T&quot; movement pattern was a right angle, not an arcing angle like a helicopter or balloon would follow.  Also, the amber light was bright enough to see over the forest on the mountain.  We could barely see shadows in the trees(I have 20-20 vision) moving as the object moved above the woods.  It resembled what one would see from 2 miles if a military flare to expose enemies was released, but a dark amber in color, just bright enough to see the tree shadows moving if you look slighty to one side of area being lighted up.  The light was not bright enough to easily see in the woods by looking straight at them even though our eyes were adjusted to a very dark sky.  The object never left the one spot where it was first seen.  The &quot;T&quot; shape that it moved in appeared to be approximately 100 yards or less in length across the top, and about the same distance down the vertical leg of the &quot;T&quot; shape.  It appeared to be maybe 200 yards above the forest on one end of the horizontal, and about 150 yards above towards the front.  I fell asleep and did not see the object depart unfortunately.  The &quot;T&quot; shape would be perpendicular to the mountain, meaning, as you look straight to the top of the mountain, that the object approached and then moved away, as opposed to moving back and forth relative to the top of the mountain.  I am an electrical engineer and am quite certain by the angles at which this object moved that it could not be hovering by manipulating air.  Also, I know of no aircraft that can silently move at impossibly right angles for over five hours without refueling.  Plus, this mountain is all a National Wilderness Area with no military activity that I have ever heard about.  The nearest military base is the Navajo arms depot about 20 miles away, west of Flagstaff.  I believe that everything approaches infinite mass when approaching the speed of light and that living beings cannot live long enough to travel the distances necessary at the available speeds to reach other planets.  Therefore, I am truly perplexed by this event.  I really hope this information helps us learn more.", "I was out looking a the Moon with a small telascope for about 20 min.

I knew it was not an airplane, I see airplanes in our area all the time, and this was forsure not an airplane or helicopter. I could only see the light when in was in the clouds, when the light moved to the blue sky it vanished. Then I thought, well maybe it was someone down below shining a light in the sky, but saw no beam. The light travelled very fast, up, down around, left and right, sharp movements. It would disappear into the sky, then resurface in the clouds. It was an orb shape, not circle, nor not like a tear shape.  Very strange, I have never seen a ghost or a space craft in my life, I was amazed.  Could this be a alien?  Or a gosht?  Or was it something else?  I have no clue, this was the second encounter. The first one did last as long, but the light split into two and vansihed into the night sky. The area we live in a a new development, not much around but land. Not sure what I saw, but it would be intresting to see if others had seen the same thing.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

They were not visible until they illuminated the sky.  They might have been using high power microwave and lasers to generate magnetic fields and magnetohydrodynamic or electrohydrodynamic propulsion.  They would have been invisible to radar as plasma disrupts radio signals.  They were definitely hypersonic aircraft or spacecraft as I am aware of some from an aerospace company I used to work for.  It had rocket flames which would be magnetohydrodynamic diffuser generators to provide power.  I know the Air Force Research Laboratory is building UAV&apos;s and SDI weapons using these same technologies.  Also they might have had flickering skins to confuse IR heak seeking missiles from tracking it as it had a enormously long rocket plume(They had intense lights from them that were flickering and plasma doesn&apos;t flash at such a high frequency).  The two spacecraft darted across the sky at high velocity going in opposite directions on the hypersonic test range.  The plasma was blue and there was no noise or shockwave as the plasma attenuates the shock wave at hypersonic speed.  You can find more information from Venik&apos;s Aerospace Website.  They also test hypersonic missiles and missiles can&apos;t keep darting back and forth for 60 minutes at least.  It was near the border of Nevada.  I haven&apos;t seen them test since that time.

It was just hanging there, about 30 deg up on the horizon. The brim was jet black in color and the crown was a cream color. I watched it for about 30 sec and I looked away for and instant and it was gone. There was not a single cloud in the sky on this day. I searched the sky but it was no where to be seen. There was just blue sky.In August the same year I was practicing golf again at around the same time, 3.00 pm when I was attracted by a flash in the cloudless blue sky. At first I couldn&rsquo;t see anything, but then I saw a group of objects that I at first mistook for birds. They looked about the size of a dinner plate but as they descended and grew larger I could see that they were in fact discs.  They were dull white in color and rising and falling as if they were riding a wave and going very slowly. They looked to be approximately 5 to 6 feet across. Estimating their true size was difficult as I had no idea how high they were. I counted 9 of them, and as they leveled out in a very ragged two abreast formation, one then turned and went away to the south west, but when it reached a certain point it just pure and simply dissolved into nothing. I was absolutely amazed at what I was seeing. I then turned my attention back to the others and focused on the next leading disc and it dissolved in the same manner.  At first it began to go black at the front then turned into deep olive green and as it was turning at the same time I could just make out a bulge at the top before it dissolved into a cloud of black dots.   Like pixels on a computer. There was no flashing lights or any kind of noise. And all the while their speed never varied, each one of them disappeared at the same point in the cloudless blue sky as silent as they came.The whole episode lasted for about two minutes.I found this site by accident and decided to tell someone about what I saw.I was very skeptical about the whole UFO scene, but not now.", "Oval lighted object made no noise as it rapidly flew overhead in sky.On Friday, August 12 2005 around 4:25 AM I stepped outside for a smoke, and I looked overhead to see if I could catch any of the meteor shower.

It seemed almost to be shiny or have a haze or glow to the sides, but I can&apos;t be sure.  It could have been a trick of the lights on the object.  It did not look like any aircraft I had seen before, and I heard no noise at all.  The object seemed to maintain its speed while overhead, though as I was losing sight of it the object seemed to slow some.  This however could have been due to my perspective and line of sight.", "I saw a silver ball in the clear blue skies above the Blue Angles flying routine in Seattle on 8/5/2005 at Seafair.I was with a large group of people standing on a dock watching the Blue Angels over Lake Washington while they were performing their stunts during Seafare.  I was watching one of the jets flying straight up at a high altitude when I noticed a silver ball north of the Blue Angel jet.  It appeared to be very high in the sky well above normal flight of commercial jets flying on long trips.  I pointed it out to my 16 year son and another man who was standing next to me.  After I watched it a few seconds and pointed it out, it began moving in a NW direction and it only took about 10 seconds to travel out of sight.  The man I was talking to suggested that it was the space shuttle.  No way can we see that from land.  But, this carft was in our our atmosphere for sure.  I know that airplanes are directed to stay away from the Blue Angels while they are practicing their stunts.  I must believe that they are dissallowed in the area even if they were at 20 or 30,000&apos;.  I had my new digital camera in my hand &amp; I took a photo in hopes of capturing it.  However, my lack of experience with the camera and the slow spped failed to catch it.  This happened about 1/2 way through their routine.  It&apos;s my hope that others saw this and have reported on it.  I have heard nothing.  I have been a believer for years.  However, I had never had an encounter in the past.

So here it is.Around May 1997 it was pretty bright out even though it was about 9:30 pm. I believe there was a full or close to a full moon that night. My best friend, another buddy of ours and I all had a few beers and decided to go for a walk along the lakeside which was really low due to the major drought we had. We parked our truck on the lakeside and started off. We walked about a mile away when I noticed a very bright blue star. I pointed it out to the other guys and we continued on our way. We walked about another half mile and I kept looking at this star when one of the other guys said to me that he needed to sit for a minute. My buddy was 6&amp;#8217;2&amp;#8221; at about 260 lbs at that time. As we sat and chatted I noticed the star had started to move. I then thought to myself that it might be an airplane that was coming right toward us and I didn&amp;#8217;t notice it moving. My friend asked me why I got so quiet and I told him that I was watching this light. He joked and said it was a UFO and we all chuckled a little. We all sat there for a about 1 minute and as eerie as it may sound we all stood up at once and looked at each other. The object was now very close and seemed to be headed in our direction at a great rate of speed. We all stumbled around and started to head back to the truck. Walking fast and checking behind ourselves, I noticed it was now about a foot ball length away.  The object was teardrop shape and almost looked metalic that glowed bright blue at first but looked white as it came closer.  I high tailed it and began to run. This is when things get a little fuzzy in my memory. I remember running, feeling my heart beating really hard. I stepped on a stick and made it crack. I remember hearing a sound about the same high pitch sound it makes when you turn on your television. I don&amp;#8217;t remember hearing my friends anymore or even thinking to turn around. I remember opening my eyes slightly and seeing hardly anything. It was so black and dark wherever I was. I was lying on something flat that was at an angle. I looked down what seemed to be a hallway with an opening about 1 &frac12;&amp;#8217; wide. It was a very tall opening and couldn&amp;#8217;t see the top of it. I noticed an oval shaped hole in what I thought was the floor and could see about 5 sections of finned propellers spinning in reverse direction of each other.  I couldn&amp;#8217;t hear anything except a low hum sound that was steady. I saw a transparent plate of what seemed to be glass with markings on it.The next thing I know I hear my friends yelling and running towards me. I was lying up against my friend&amp;#8217;s truck. They began to ask me where I was. I told them I remembered running toward the truck after seeing the light and then hearing them just know. They didn&amp;#8217;t remember the light and said it was already 12:30 am and that when they got to the truck I wasn&amp;#8217;t there. They thought I ran home and went there to pick me up. After about 2 hours of waiting for me with no return they went back out to the lake to find me. After another hour of looking for me they decided to go back home and that is when they saw me there by the truck. At first I didn&amp;#8217;t remember what I saw until about 2 years later.  I couldn&amp;#8217;t explain why there was a long lapse in time. I tried to talk to my buddy but he said he doesn&amp;#8217;t remember any light. He only remembers me running off and missing until he came back with the truck and them finding me there. I tried to talk to my best friend and he never wanted to talk about it. He always said for me to shut up about it. After 9 years of trying to talk about it with him he finally said he remembers the reason why we ALL started to run. He remembers the light flying by at a great speed and then disappearing but never hearing anything. He said for me being gone for 2 &frac12; hours boggled him for years and wanted to know where I went. I told him the things I remembered and he said he doesn&amp;#8217;t want to talk about it and will never talk about it again. I tried several times but he gets angry and walks away.I never told my father or anyone what happened.  One day he told me about an encounter he had and I decided to let him know what happened to me.  Since then he told me about this site and keeps asking me if I am going to post my experience.There you go Dad.  It is now posted.

Avon is located South of Rochester NY and East of Buffalo NY.  We had just entered Route 20 where it separates from Route 5. We were heading west.  This is a 2 lane road through a large open field, and a route I regularly travel.    My friend wanted to show me how his new high powered green laser pen worked when pointing it at the moon.  The moon was at about 11:00 and fairly low in the sky.  My friend put the laser up to the windshield so we wouldn&apos;t get back splash from the laser into our eyes.  He pointed it at the moon.  A second or two after pointing it in that direction suddenly the laser hit an object flying by the moon but relatively close to us, maybe a couple of miles away at most. When it hit the object the light from the laser began sparkling and spashing in all directions as if it had hit a prism or similar object of glass.  I thought he had hit the side of a plane and told him to shut it off as we would get into trouble.  After he turned it off, there was nothing in the sky except the moon.  We looked for a plane but nothing was there. There was enough background light from Rochester and Buffalo to allow us to see an object as large as the one we had seen.  Note I was still driving, perhaps 30-40 mph.  We thought this was an abbarition and he again lit the laser.  This time nothing happened when he shown it at the moon.  By chance he moved it around and at the same elevation, but now about 1 oclock he again hit the object.  He followed it for a moment, then shut it off.  We realized that there was something there that did not reflect light as any airplane we knew of might.  Also it was not visible to the eye except with the aid of the laser.   We became a little shaken and I hit the gas and got out of there quickly.  It was cold that evening and so we did not open our windows to listen for sounds. Because the object was only visable with the laser, we could not determine its size, and because the field is mostly open we had no reference point to be sure of the size or the distance from us.

PD))", "July 2005 Meridian &quot;field lights&quot; -- night flights of cropdusters?I live south of Nampa, Idaho -- a community near the recent July 2005 sightings of bright lights over fields in Meridian. I have an educated guess (?) as to what those folks saw, because I saw a similar thing in the fields around my house at about 10 p.m. on July 15. At about 10 p.m., I went to the sliding glass door of the master bedroom to let my dog out onto the patio. The back of my house, patio, and long backyard face west. I heard a plane flying low overhead, which is not unusual because I am between the Nampa Municipal airport and the Owyhee Mtns to the south/southwest; lots of folks like to take small planes from that airport and sightsee. I thought maybe it was someone returning late from a trip into the Owyhees; at this point, it&apos;s mostly dark, with just a hint of pinkish sunset left to the northwest of us, toward Nampa and Caldwell. (Idaho daylight and sunsets are long in the summer.)  I was surprised to see a plane just RIGHT THERE, heading south along Track Road, arced in a sharp curve and obviously making a U-turn back toward the north (back toward Deer Flat Rd). When the plane was facing me head-on (the plane was now facing east, toward Meridian/Boise), I saw that across the front of the plane there were 3 round, bright white lights, along with a very small colored light on each wing tip. (I believe one was green and one was red, although on subsequent passes/turns, I also saw blue wing-tip lights -- guess FAA regulations dictate which lights have to shine depending on what motion you are performing?)  As the daughter of a retired pilot/cropduster, I realized it was a cropdusting plane. (Although I admit I did not realize you could operate them after dark -- thought it was a safety hazard.) I watched as the pilot crossed Deer Flat Rd -- the pilot then popped on a bank of REALLY bright white (almost pale yellowish) lights on the underside of the plane. When I say really bright, I mean bright enough that I could see not only the tops of the onion plants he was spraying in that dark field, but the mist of the chemical coming out of the spray jets. I watched for several minutes as he swooped low to the ground and arced and turned and popped his various sets of lights on and off while he dusted the field -- quite a skilled pilot in a nimble plane. I was amused to think that it reminded me of some scenes in Close Encounters with the craft zooming down the road and thought, &quot;Well, if you weren&apos;t close enough to hear the engine, you&apos;d think it was a UFO!&quot;  Then I got to thinking about the Meridian reports I&apos;d read earlier that week... At that point, I grabbed a notebook and tried to sketch out the lights in order to compare it to the report I&apos;d read on the NUFORC site. After a couple minutes, I thought about getting the camera, but by the time I&apos;d located it, realized I needed the flash, went back in and located the flash, then went back out to the patio, the plane had changed fields and was spraying fields west of Track Road toward Powerline (where it dead-ends at Star Pass Ridge). That was a somewhat eerie sight, seeing those lights pop on and off from behind one of the rare stands of trees in the area. When I came back to the NUFORC site today, I see that the Meridian reports are front-and-center and that the folks are going to be on the Coast-to-Coast AM show soon. Now, I obviously can&apos;t swear for certain that this is what those folks saw in Meridian around the first of the month, but there are lots of fields and agricultural operations in the western edge of Meridian/eastern edge of Nampa (the garage farms haven&apos;t taken over all of it, yet!), and it IS cropdusting season (apparently even at night). And if they had burning eyes, it could be from the poison the plane was spraying on the crops. Plus, one witness&apos; drawing DID describe the object as having a &quot;plane&quot; shape. So that&apos;s just my information to offer as a possible explanation of what might be an IFO instead of a UFO. Please note, if relevant, that I am a MUFON member.", "Five white lights seen in Southern Ontario skyI first observed 1 bright light in the South East sky above our neighbourhood while looking out my bedroom window. Shortly after I called my brother in to see it 3 more lights had appeared which formed a square with the first light. The top right light became extremely bright and a smaller light of the same brightness then appeared directly to the right of that light. The lights did not move and appeared to hover for aprox. 5 minutes. They did not blink or flash, but the light in the right of the square and the small one beside it gave off an extremely bright white light. The lights were all circular. Then after about 10 minutes since the first light appeared they all vanished at the exact same time.", "Bright lights that are stationary and that move and then seem to disappear.Looking out my bedroom window I saw a very bright light above the tree line.  It remained stationary for about 2 minutes.  I got up and went outside to the backyard and saw another bright light behind the trees and moving from north to south very slowly.  When it was behind a tree it seemed to have disappeared because I could no longer see it.  There was no sound or aircraft in the vicinity.  This is not the first time I have witnessed these bright lights in the sky around my home.", "In response to sighting of 08/15/78 in St. AlbertI believe I saw the same object in the about the same time, give or take a year.  But, being an estimate of time, and the grade and age I think I was, I think it&apos;s the same PLACE.  My experience took place in an area of St.Albert where the field is huge and borders with schools. Coming home in the evening from outside skating at one of the schools, my sister and I crossed the street and entered the field through &quot;the hole in the fence&quot;.  As we walked about 15 ft, just by the ball diamonds, we noticed an extremly huge &quot;spot&quot; light crossing back and forth through the field, as if searching for something.  There was no sound, and nothing to see but the light.  We froze in one spot, and watched this light as it virtually &quot;searched&quot; the field from one side to the other.  As it approached us, being frightened, I believe now we were in shock, my sister pushed me down, and told me to lay still and quite as she covered me in snow.  She then covered herself next to me.  She was so quick to act. I think she had covered both of us in less than 30 seconds.  Just as she finised herself, the light passed our heads by inches.  As the brightness of the light passed, we peeked to see that it was once again on the other side of the field.  We jumped up and watched as the light disappeared straight up.  For a second the sky was dark, then a bright streak of white and red shot south through the sky.  I have NEVER seen anything move and dissapear so fast in my life!We ran back to the &quot;hole in the fence&quot;, crossed the street, to where the street lights were, and took the &quot;long way home&quot; along the houses and street lights.  We were frost bit, and I don&apos;t have any memory of entering our home.  I have tried to speak to my sister about this incident many times through the years, but only lately, has she spoken about what happened in the field.  I don&apos;t even remember entering our crescent.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

It was a chilly night so I was closing a window before retiring for the night when I noticed an unusually bright star (so I thought) in the sky.  As I looked at it, it seemed to grow even brighter still, and then just as quickly it grew dimmer.  Soon it dimmed completely out.  I thought this was very odd as it was a perfectly clear night.  I decided to investigate it further so I went and found some 10x binoculars.  Upon examining the spot in the sky where the object had been I found nothing but stars, but looking a bit futher north I found something in my sights that took my breath away.  The object was comprised of 3 lights a larger blueish/green light in the center with two smaller reddish/brown lights on either side.  The larger light in the center was slightly elevated above the two smaller red lights, otherwise the 3 lights would have formed a horizontal line.  Immediately, my mind connected the 3 symetrical lights into some kind of or attached to some type of aircraft.  But, this craft was motionless.  I soon discovered a second object beside the first, then a third above that one, and fourth, all of identical size, color, and shape and all motionless and not blinking or pulsing.  As soon as I had counted the fourth object the lowest object began to move, slowly at first, but then accelerating rapidly straight up to the outside of the other 3 objects which remained still.  At this point I wanted someone else to see what I was seeing, so I went to get my parents.  Upon returning just seconds later all of the objects had vanished, we ran outside to search the rest of the sky and found nothing.", "a bright white circular shape, with an odd design on the outer layer, and transparrent objects around it with the same design.these objects were seen in a picture and not actually seen with the naked eye. at first it looked as if it were a moon but there was no moon out that night. this object had a strange design on its surface. there is one big white bolsd circular object and the rest are the same only smaller and transparent. i took the picture over a lake looking at the mountains at in the evening whil taking pictures the first one i took shows mountains with the same transparent objects and in the second picture i took the location of the objects changed and the was a much brighter and solid object in the sky. i have a picture with and with out the main object i am concerned about although both pictures have the transparent objects.", "Friend was laying in the back of his truck.

I know what we saw. The other guys were just as astonished as I, but less reconciliable about WHAT exactly these lights were. At approximately 02:15 I began my nightly exterior perimeter patrol of the building, insuring all doors are locked, the cyclone wire fence hasn&apos;t been obviously breached anywhere and that the site is basically safe. Somewhere near the southeast corner of the building a light in the sky caught my eye. Though an airfield is nearby, it doesn&apos;t operate at night; still though, at first the light was nondescript and creepy--like the way a jetliner looks head on from a distance. Anyone who knows what I mean knows the lights of these are bright, there is no or little sound and the illusion of hovering or slow moving.I thought nothing of it really, just another jet. . .I made my way around to the building&apos;s northeast corner as usual, and had forgotten about the jet. As I approached guard post at the facility&apos;s main traffic gate, I saw my guard outside, looking at what I thought was the jet still. I looked again and knew why he was so stupefied; the light was a lot closer now, and was definitely bigger than a jet&apos;s headlights. We both mumbled something to the effect of &quot;What the heck is that?&quot; and watched the triangular?--shape as it drifted toward the building. The intensity of the lighting made it&apos;s exact hull outline impossible to see. I am guessing that it was no farther than five or six hundred feet away, over an area of woods and highway (I think. I know beyond the cyclone fence is just woods).As we watched, the triangularish craft jerked to the left, then back some, and then to the right. It&apos;s light was no longer so bright, or not pointing in our direction anymore, and we both made out what appeared to be a bank of &lt; shaped lights that pulsed a dark red from dim to moderately bright and back to dim again. Shafts of white light seemed to poke out from the underside of the craft occasionally. At several points during the &apos;flight&apos;, it had maneuvered so that we could see that indeed the shape was triangular and a brighter or more intense light lit each of the triangle points&apos; underside. An inbuond vehicle stopped at the main gate and the driver got out, watching just as we were. Though I only counted once, the others said they saw twice, maybe three times, small red spheres falling to the ground, spiralling in a slow descent like oak seeds would.This went on for some minutes until finally something seemed to explode on the ground below the craft. But not like an explosion you&apos;d expect. It was a loud crackling zap accompanied by a brief white light. After that the craft slowly hovered around in the area some more, as it had been before the small red spheres came down. After only a few more minutes the thing took off and disappeared out of sight. My guard began processing the driver and I decided to go back around to the corner where I first saw the light.I have one fear in life and it isn&apos;t UFOs or aliens, but I must admit as I approached the building&apos;s dark backside I became very nonsensically afraid. The fence was not breached anywhere that I could see, but it didn&apos;t make me feel much safer. The last detail I have to report is a strange staticky noise that overcame my radio as I approached the corner closest to the incident, and after only a few moments drained the nearly full battery (8 hours of charge left). It also broke my watch which I found later had stopped at 02:52, which is approximately the time I&apos;m guessing I was in the area. People inside and at other guards posts had complained about an abundance of static for a few minutes, though it hadn&apos;t lasted very long. Two hours later, as the sun was beginning to lighten the sky, I went back around the building with a newly charged battery and experienced what I believed to be a small bit of excess static, but nothing like before.The three of us have decided not to tell anyone at work, and I only tell you know because the truth should be known.", "It was early evening, while looking West, towards Hudson County Park, a ball of fire was seen moving east...My husband was looking West, towards Hudson County Park, when he claimed to have seen a ball of fire moving East towards New York...when I got to the window, it was gone.

I went out for a long walk down the east side of the Charles river starting from Mass Ave and made my way north always keeping close to the river. When I got to the first bridge after passing the Longfellow Bridge I decided to head back from the other side of the river. I crossed this bridge (passing by the Museum Of Science) and started walking back down south again sticking close to the riverside on a small pathway for runners and bikers. It was when I was around the proximity of Memorial Drive when I saw an black flying object that was shaped like a disc, floating in the distance over the Charles River. At first I thought it was a kite that someone was flying but the way it was flew wasnt convincing enough. It flipped on all three axis and it was flying only in one direction. The altitude never changed (it was flying pretty low already but could fly over 10 story buildings) and it flew way to far to be a in a kites flying range. It flew pretty slow. I stopped to watch it fly by until it flew over the buildings out of my sight over memorial drive and up north. There were people around me at that time of the event but most were runners who were out for an exercise and didnt see the flying object. I looked around to see if anyone else is pointing or looking skywards at the object but I couldnt see none. I was pretty depressed that day (hence the long walk) so I didnt bother talking to anyone around me about it. Also, at that time, I have already walked for over an hour, and it was around dinner time and I was a bit hungry. I was also listening to my i-pod all the time druing my walk. But I am pretty sure I did see a tangable object fly over Charles River that day in the fashion as I have described above. Im just not sure if I was the only one to see it or not.", "It was like watching the changing of the guards, but they looked like moving stars?Three of us were sitting on our porch enjoying the coolness of the evening when my son looking at the stars asked &quot;What&apos;s that?&quot; Looking up I said jokingly &quot;The Milky Way&quot;.

It looked like a star but not fast like a shooting star, then my husband seen it. It would almost stop, then shoot off again. We watched it move to a point near a stationary star then stop. Then we watched another leave just south of that one and head north, it moved slow then faster, then two more from the north to the south. They looked like stars at first then moved to specific points. I joked at one because it moved in a jerky pattern not smooth like the others. &quot;I said it must be Santa Clause testing new equipment&quot; They all traveled down the milky way.

We we&apos;re driving down the street, a moderatley busy one in fact, and we stopped at the red light. When we stopped, my mom had seen a set of bright lights WAY further (A LOT FURTHER) near the other end of the street, but she didnt say anything about it. THEN, like 5 seconds later, she noticed that the same lights were RIGHT ACROSS the street from us and my mom had se said &quot;Hey whats that up there?&quot; and i said &quot;Where?&quot;. She pointed over above these houses across the street, and there was a triangular shaped U.F.O hovering over a house! It had multi-colored lights around the bottom edges, and it was HUGE.

PD))", "Solo driver witnesses oblong, rectangular object w/ lights moving to the north above freewayIn the beginning of January 2005 (I forget the date) at 5:24 pm while driving southbound on Interstate 25 south of Denver, Colorado I saw an oblong object in the sky, flying (what seemed to be very slowly) above me, northbound directly up the highway.Its size and speed was hard to determine, not knowing exactly how far away it was, and because there was nothing I could compare it to, I could not make a determination.  It seemed to be anywhere from about 20 feet to an undetermined length, and it seemed to be doing anywhere from 10 miles per hour to an undetermined speed, and it seemed to be anywhere from 100 feet high to an undetermined altitude.  If I had to guess I&rsquo;d say it was about 50 to 100 feet long and about 200-500 feet above me, and was traveling at about 40 miles per hour or maybe a little faster. But this is just a guess...it could have been bigger but it was impossible to determine. My first impression was that it was a bunch of Canadian geese flying in &lsquo;line-abreast&rsquo; formation, because I had just seen (a minute or two earlier) a &lsquo;V&rsquo; formation of them flying north.  However upon closer examination, what I saw was not a group of individual birds flying in a line, abreast, but it was a solid object.  I then thought it must be a piece of black polythene or polyethylene caught in the wind like a kite.  However upon closer examination I was able to determine that it was solid and &lsquo;plank-like&rsquo;.  It kept its rigid form and in no way fluttered or flexed or was jostled or buffeted or affected by the wind or breeze.  It held its course and form.I say it looked black because at that time of evening, it was silhouetted against the sky.  It could have been some color for all I know, but it appeared to be black.  I noticed two small &lsquo;bumps&rsquo; on the leading-edge of one end of what I&rsquo;ll call this &lsquo;wing.&rsquo;  These small protuberances for lack of a better definition (other than &lsquo;bumps&rsquo;) were not exactly the same size but were almost the same, and were immediately adjacent to one-another.  My thought was that if this was some random piece of junk caught-up in the breeze, then it would not be completely symmetrical, so I immediately checked the opposite end of the leading edge to see if there were bumps there also.  I saw that there were an identical set of bumps in exactly the same place on the other end.This object looked like a board, flying sideways up the highway above me. Not exactly streamlined for sure.  In fact it was the most un-aerodynamic thing you could imagine. Certainly not something that would work in a wind-tunnel. I could see clearly that it had 90 degree corners and features.  It had no perceptible camber nor rounded edges.  It was not &lsquo;airfoil-shaped.&rsquo; It had no anhedral nor dihedral nor sweepback. Its form and the speed it was flying defied Bernoulli&rsquo;s principle.  It had no separate fuselage nor engines nor tail/empennage nor visible flight-control surfaces, no external anti-torque devices, neither did it display any lights or markings.  No perceptible intake or exhaust, no props, jets or rotors, windows, vents nor antennas. There was nothing attached to it nor hanging out of it. What I saw was unlike anything I&rsquo;ve seen, heard or read about.  Just picture a giant, black, symmetrical board moving in the sky, steadily in one direction.I could not relate to it in any way except to feel (mere speculation here) that for the lift and thrust and weight factors of aerodynamics, it must utilize some undisclosed type of technology such as magnetics for propulsion/stabilization and to overcome gravity, and ionization of the atmosphere to overcome drag through the air.  I was unable to hear any sound from the object, because I was inside my car amongst traffic in the fast lane.  There were a couple of vehicles pulled-over on the side of the road at this point, but I didn&rsquo;t really take my eyes off the object long enough to see if the occupants were watching the unknown flying object also.  What surprised me the most was that I didn&rsquo;t hit my brakes and create a major traffic jam or accident, but rather just calmly thought: &quot;Now that&rsquo;s curious.&quot;  Some have talked about dimensional shift, dematerialization technology or thought projection, but I can&rsquo;t go there at this point because it&rsquo;s a little beyond my paradigm.I&rsquo;m guessing the duration of this sighting was about 20-30 seconds from the time I first saw it off in the distance to the time we both &lsquo;closed&rsquo; on each-other and it went overhead while I craned my neck, and pressed my face to the windscreen to watch it as long as I could before it disappeared in my blind spot overhead because of the roof of the car.  Even though the thought seemed &lsquo;silly&rsquo; to even contemplate from the scene I was witnessing, I consciously looked to see if there were any wires or poles supporting this object as the suggestion crossed my mind that maybe all it was, was some object hung over the highway, and the movement was due to a &lsquo;relative motion&rsquo; illusion.  There was nothing I could see to support this idea at all. Besides the object was moving relative to the highway also. I was as conscious and lucidly awake when I witnessed this event, as now when I&rsquo;m writing this description of the event.  I have no idea what it was, nor do I have the slightest clue if it was our technology, or where it came from.  I&rsquo;m totally at a loss to explain what I saw. Kinda cool though.((name deleted))Sketch of what I saw.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date in January 2005 is approximate.

The sun was beginning to set though the sky was still blue. With a few minutes to wait I looked up and something caught my eye. At first, due to the shape of this object (a black inverted teardrop) I believed it was a black balloon that had been let go, but once I saw that it was moving in a perfectly straight line I began to wonder (if it was a balloon, I figured, it would have had at least a slight variation in attitude or bearing). I was facing north when I first saw it, with the sun setting to the west, and it was travelling approx. East-Southeast. As I turned towards the east to follow it, I saw the sunlight reflecting off it&apos;s west side and realized it was a highly reflective surface in the shape of a perfectly inverted teardrop. Although I couldn&apos;t tell for sure, I received the impression it was spinning at a very high velocity.

We hear and see aircraft several times as day; this was like nothing we&apos;ve seen before.  We never would have looked twice if it hadn&rsquo;t been for the very obvious &quot;wavering&quot; from side to side that this object was doing.

What struck me as odd was that it was going very slowly and the lights didn&apos;t resemble those of a jet or plane.  I saw 4 brilliant lights alligned perfectly in a square formation, moving slowly in the sky, southwest of where we were.  I asked my friend to stop and ran out of his truck to a nearby yard to see it more clearly (he did not come out of his truck because he was bewildered at why I suddenly yelled at him to stop and got out of the vehicle).  Staring up at the sky, I was intrigued to see that the &quot;object&quot; was in fact moving slowly, but not consistently.  It would move (in my field of view) about 3-4 inches across the sky, then would stop suddenly, then move again.  It then moved the OPPOSITE way back and flew very quickly out of site into the dark sky- trees and the houses then blocked my view.  At that point, I struggled to see it again, but I could not.  My friend had gotten out of my truck to ask me what had happened, and I told him the above, much to his disbelief.  I SWEAR that happened.

Olhei para todos os lados para observar se era um reflexo de outras luzes no vidro do carro. Mas, n&atilde;o.  A janela do carro estava aberta. Observei melhor em volta, para comparar com as luzes de torres de TV que existem naquela redondeza. Tamb&eacute;m n&atilde;o eram. Talvez fosse uma corda de luzes presa a algum avi&atilde;o.

PD))", "constantly changing nebulous-shaped object flying disturbingly fast at the moment of a full lunar eclipseI have been looking for cases similar to this and didn&apos;t have any luck until I found your reporting site due to reading an AP article.  Your site has several listings that are very close to this and it is interesting that no one seems to have a clue what it is.  The following description was originally posted on my own website (www.danafrostick.com) about 4 years after the event occurance and was updated as noted on 3/22/2002:  ufo in breckenridge, texas?  On the night of a full lunar eclipse in the autumn of 1996, my future husband and I were stopped at a small roadside motel for a rest in our Southwestern journey. We enjoyed dinner and went to our room. We had been able to watch the progress of the lunar eclipse as we ate our food and we were anxious to get the binoculars out to watch its culmination from the parking lot. The parking lot was adequately lit for security, but it didn&apos;t diminish the light from the full moon as it gradually went a bloody brownish color. The motel itself was the only establishment on the road for at least a mile or so. There was nothing on either side of the hotel or the other side of the highway except desert. We were leaning against our rental convertible, passing the binoculars back and forth as the moment of full eclipse approached. Only the thinnist sliver of reflected light was left showing as we both appreciated this natural phenomenom above the roof of the adjoining motel rooms. Suddenly, motion just below the moon caught my eye. I turned my head to the right to follow it and briefly saw the object as it flew off at a disturbing speed. What I saw doesn&apos;t sound like anything I&apos;ve ever heard described before. Likewise, my husbands&apos;s description is unique, but only shares a few similarities with what I saw. We both saw something, because, I turned and looked at him and he said, &quot;Did you see that?&quot;  My description:  The first view I had was only a glimpse of motion. When I turned my head I saw for just an instant what can only be described as a net of dim stars. It was a loosely structured object with a network of greyish &quot;lines&quot; which were actually various series of points. This grid structure was moving in all directions at once in an undulating fashion. It reminded me of watching a fisherman&apos;s net being tossed around in the waves, or an amoeba floating around on a speciman slide. Even though it didn&apos;t seem to have a method of propulsion, it was flying too fast for my eyes to follow it as it crossed the highway and headed out into the desert night. My husband&apos;s description:  He only got one glimpse of it as it passed underneath the moon. He saw what he called a gigantic skeletal bird, flapping its wings. At first, this doesn&apos;t sound like it could be the same object I saw. But, it is similar in that large sections of the object were moving, and that there was not much mass to the object, but a lot of empty space in it. Skeptics answer:  This was obviously a flock of birds flying low over the hotel. Even though I&apos;ve never seen birds fly so fast that I couldn&apos;t keep up with them visually for at least 3 or 4 seconds. And, there was absolutely no sound. Then it must have been some piece of debris flying in the wind. Even though it was a still and completely cloudless night. Written: 9/25/00   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Updated: 3/2/2002 I was watching a show on TV last month, called &quot;You&apos;ve Got To See It To Believe It,&quot; and I saw this really weird piece about something people are calling rods. It really freaked me out because it reminded me of the description that Richard gave of this incident. I went online and sluthed out a website about the rods called www.roswellrods.com and showed it to him when he came home. He told me that the rods looked like the object he saw that night in Breckenridge. They really do look real, but I can&apos;t convince myself that they actually exist. I&apos;m thinking about setting up a video camera and maybe even a digital camera and doing some skyfishing on my own.((NUFORC Note:  The date of the reported incident is correct.  A total eclipse of the Moon occurred on the evening of September 26, 1996.  PD))", "Four moving UFO&apos;s appear on NASA TV&apos;s Shuttle Discovery STS-114 camera. While viewer records it all.On the morning of August 6th between 7:00-7:30AM My wife and I were watching NASA TV from our Direct TV Satellite dish.  I was also recording on my tabletop VCR and while we were watching NASA&apos;s broadcast of the STS-114 Discovery mission.  The Shuttle had undocked from the International Space Station and passed between Australia and New Zealand on it&apos;s orbit and was now half way across the Pacific Ocean south of Hawaii and west of Chile. The TV camera located at the back of Space Shuttle Discovery&apos;s cargo bay was trained on the Earth&apos;s darkened ocean and horizon showing stationary bright and dim stationary lights with some blinking on or above the surface and what appear to be stars in the sky at the bottom of the frame.  With the curve of the Earth visible.  The view is upside down because of the orientation of the Shuttle (flying upside down). Suddenly one dimly lighted object appeared around 9-o&apos;clock in the frame and quickly traveled down to the lower right around 5-o&apos;clock in the frame and slowing to a stop at the curve of the Earth.  A few seconds later a large bright object appears around 4-o&apos;clock in the frame and swiftly travels left across the frame at an upward angle and slows to a stop around 9-o&apos;clock then reverses direction and retraces its path across the frame.  Around the same time you will notice a dimly lighted object from around the 1-o&apos;clock position in the frame travel straight down and exits at the bottom of the screen.  Also at the same time there is another dimly lighted object around the 8-o&apos;clock position in the frame traveling from left to right at an upward angle across the frame to around the 2-o&apos;clock position in the frame and exits the frame. When the large bright object approaches the 4-o&apos;clock position the camera is panned to the left away from where the object is traveling and clouds appear from the top of the frame and dims half the screen.  Then the down link is cut off by NASA TV. The programming comes back on showing the computer grafic of the orientation of the Shuttle and then changes to the Shuttle bay camera again showing the Earth as it&apos;s orbit brings it into the lighted part of the Earth.  I counted a total of four moving objects.  Three dim and one bright.  The VHS tape I was recording the broadcast with was recording in the SLP setting (not the best quality) but I converted the footage to DVD format and the video is very clear on a computer monitor.  I have sent a copy of this DVD to The National UFO Reporting Center for evaluation. I have also e-mailed stills from the video to the Director.((NUFORC Note:  We have reviewed the DVD sent to our Center, and we agree with the assessment provided above by the witness.  The footage is so interesting that we have decided to post it to our website, for visitors there to be able to review.  We have no ready explanation for how an object, seen moving across the sky, would suddenly slow, and then reverse its motion.  Its direction and velocity can be determined, given that the object of interest can be seen moving, relative to the star field.  We invite comment from anyone who can determine what the object is, or may be.  We express our gratitude to the gentleman who shared the footage with NUFORC.

My daughter is a teenager.", "a rectangular object, with an orange glow, was moving slowly over a wheat field.A friend and I were sitting in a car, approximately 5 miles outside of town, when we saw a light coming across the field toward our car.  At the time, several teen boys in town owned small motor scooters and it looked like the headlight of one. We had been watching the light for about 30 seconds when it turned to its right and headed west across the field.  Still thinking it was a scooter, we didn&apos;t become scared at the time.  A few seconds later an orange glow appeared and ,for lack of a better word, dominoed into a rectangular object about the size of a small trailer house. I remember being terrified and screaming at my friend that we should leave.  We had no trouble starting the car and quickly drove into town.  We became braver the closer we came to town and decided to drive back out to the area.  When we arrived at the area, the object was gone.  My friend died in a car accident in 1975, leaving me as the only witness to this sighting.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate; does not indicate town in which alleged sighting occurred.

I looked out the passenger window as my girlfriend was driving and noticed a shower of sparks, a sort of tail of golden sparks.  I would estimate the height of the to be approximatly 750 - 1000 feet.  I thought it may be a firework of some sort up until it made a slow turn heading in the oppisite direction. The tail of sparks stoped and I saw what may have been the light of an airplane, although it was just a single small amber light, the size of a star. It continued on for a moment then the sparks started agian.  I am telling you it was the strangest thing.  It was manuvering in the air and I could have mistaken it for a firework if it had not been manuvering and turning on and off. The strangest thing is it started to drop small sparkes which exploded and appeared to be just like a 4th of july arial firework. I don&apos;t know whether aircraft preform these types of fireworks shows or what, but whatever it was was under control and definatly manuvering in such a way there was a craft behind the whole thing.  I have never seen an airplane fly over and drop a comet like tail of sparks and fireworks. My girlfriend was witness to all this too and I got a terrible video of it on the digital camera.Thanks", "circular light followed my car..appeared within seconds beside my car (passenger side), then re-appeared in rearview mirror.This event happened years ago.

I remember seeing a bright circular light in my rearview mirror..it followed me steadily for a very short while.  When I took my eyes off the mirror to look at the highway ahead...I glanced to my right and noticed the same size/intensity white light..facing me...at about the same speed I was traveling.  I could not determine the light&apos;s distance from my car...but it traveled in a very smooth/steady manner...and the light faced me for a short time (as I repeatedly looked out the passenger window.

The reason I find the &quot;sighting&quot; odd is because of my location.  I was not near an airport that could have handled a large plane.  This object was further away from the small airport than it should have been were it coming in for a safe landing. As I drove home around 8am Wednesday morning, I glanced towards the sky as I came over a slight hill and noticed a metal glint against a cloud in the sky.  It caught my eye because it was so clear.  I pulled over to watch it.  The object was definitely several miles away and would have been visible from the interstate.  It didn&apos;t move very fast.  There was no vapor trail.  It appeared to be oblong shaped and silver in color.  I watched until it passed behind a cloud.  At this same time I had my window rolled down and heard nothing.  I didn&apos;t expect to being so far away. Again, I really can&apos;t say if it this was simply an airplane or something else.

At first i thought it was the one we just saw, as me and my boyfriend wathced the one go past his family saw another one following it and then another one. we watched it for a good 10 to 20 minutes until we thought it was kind of weird and freaky and went back into the house.

Then 10 minutes later another light, appearing in approximately the same place, did the same thing. Checked the Iridium Flares schedule and there were none happening at that time.", "Black disk shaped object  motionless observing airport  free falls and wobbles back up and vanishes.Thursday 6/30/05 at around 5:35 pm, I was walking toward my car in the parking lot at work when I saw what looked to me like a round black object standing motionless high in the sky south east above the San Jose airport. I was looking up at an angle 135-140 degrees, considering straight up to be 180 degrees. To give an estimate of the size of the object in view, it would compare to that of holding up a cherry seed between ones thumb and forefinger at arms length. Now I can not begin to calculate its true size not knowing how high and the miles away the object was from where I stood. A moderate breeze was blowing toward the east. I assumed it could be a large weather balloon. Then after what seemed like a minute had passed, this round black object suddenly rotated revealing a disk or saucer shape. Within seconds of this new transformation, I began to notice a bright white flash every couple of seconds or so but randomly and not consistant. Then it began to free fall downward but in a way resembling a leaf falling from off a tree limb.  Twice I saw the bottom part, round and circular, tilt toward my direction so that I could see a faint orange glow or gold aura , even looked like it was sparkling somewhat . The object descended straight downward about a hand length. Then it hovered about 3 seconds before shooting upward like that of watching a bumble bee in flight. By this time I pretty much ruled out the notion of it being a large balloon. I heard a roar of a jet plane taking off from the San Jose Airport but could not see the plane until it got to a certain height heading northwest in my general direction. The large jet aircraft came into view as it ascended upward. I could now compare this unidentified object to the jet plane. The object was indeed considerably farther up and toward the south east than I had previously thought. The large commercial jet plane as it went overhead just slightly to the east of my position was the length of my thumbnail at arms length. After the Jet plane was nearly out of sight toward the northwest, this black disk shaped object currently hovering high up in the sky south east of the airport took off so rapidy that it vanished in just two seconds. I continued looking and then the object or another disk object reappeared out of no where for three seconds and then it vanished in thin air and did not reappear. I don&apos;t know what I just witnessed for nearly 2 minutes, but it is certainly a mystery to me that I am anxious for it to be solved!((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

He  happened to have them that day.I wasn&apos;t allowed to use them but my uncle said that the UFO looked like a flying cigar. I saw it as a white/silverish, disk-shaped object that moved erratically.  It hovered, zoomed away, and then back again ( many times in an erratic order).  After a few minutes (seconds), it was GONE!

It was up in the clear night sky, similar in size and velocity to a satellite.  What was unusual (at least in my experience) was that it &quot;sparkled&quot; - I have been referring to it as a &quot;fast sparkler&quot;. It sparkled in a regular pattern, it seemed to me, in maybe three levels of intensity, over the space of a second or a bit less. My personal explanation is that is is a pulse-jet driven craft (Aurora?) but who knows?  Maybe it was a conventional military craft at Mach+ speeds.  I do not believe it was a meteor as it did not appear to change it&apos;s flight characteristics in any way (altitude, sparkle rhythm, brightness) and it appeared to be travelling precisely west to east. I saw it cross at least 80% of an almost horizon-to-horizon vista over a span of maybe as much as 30 seconds.

She told me that she has never mentioned it to anyone and only decided to tell me about it because she knows I&apos;m interested in these things.She told me that when she was 17 (born in 1922) she lived with her family in a house that was just yards away from the railroad tracks. They were living in Keakuck Iowa. Her father and brothers all worked for the Santa Fe railroad which was why they lived so close to the tracks. Once in the middle of the night she sat up in bed and felt compelled to look out her window. She said she could tell there was something large there although she really couldn&apos;t see anything, just a huge black oval &quot;space&quot; where there were no stars or anything else visible. She could tell it had a shape and it hovered over the tracks for about 10 minutes and made absolutely no sound. She never saw anything like it again but clearly never forgot about it. She didn&apos;t tell anyone else about it for obvious reasons. The weird part about this to me is that no one had even said anything, that I know of, in 1939 about a similar incident. In later years after she married my father, moved to Portland Oregon and had 5 children we were always interested in Science Fiction movies or TV shows and just always believed they existed. My oldest brother joined the navy when he was very young and stayed for 16 years. During his time he was in China Lake for a few years and said he saw something that he could never EVER tell us about, which only made me more curious. I found out that the best way to sober him up if he&apos;s had a few too many is to ask him about what he saw. He sobers up and almost gets angry that I made him think about it... whatever it was. I moved to the UK to be with my Scottish husband 9 years ago and am fortunate that I can hear Coast to Coast online. I love it when you&apos;re on and I thought I would take this opportunity to tell you about my mother&apos;s incident. I would like to add that my mother is a very honest person and wouldn&apos;t lie if her life depended on it. Thank you for your time.

As it continued rising, about 30 seconds into this, I noticed that there was another pinpoint of light in the sky that was also roughly 2 o-clock east, but reddish in color like that of Mars (except of course this was daytime, and it was a bright blue sky at the time)--and this one was standing perfectly still. I watched as the first orb continued on in its path and by passed by the other reddish orb, fairly close by, and which also seemed to be internally lit, like a soft glow, rather than reflective. I lost track of that second one as I continued focusing on the first orb,which gradually made its way almost directly overhead, though about 1 o&apos;clock northward.

Then, at about 7:00 or 7:05 PM, it began slowly backing up and going *backward* in an easterly direction, roughly along the same pathline from which it came, but somewhat more northeastly in arc this time. It was continuing very, very slowly, and about five or ten minutes into this movement, it stopped once again and remained motionless in the sky at about 2 o&apos;clock NE. It seemed to be getting smaller as if it were ascending higher, and it was hard to keep track of it. Then, at around 7:20 or 7:25 PM, it began going Westward once again, slowly climbing back as it had the very first time but in a somewhat more southwesterly arc this time, but more or less to where the same general area spot it had reached and reversed direction at earlier. This time, it finally reached the zenith of the sky at roughly 7:30. At this point I continued watching as it moved very, very slowly further West, but covering only a small arc of sky as it grew smaller and smaller in size, and I lost track of it around 7:40. At last sighting it was located about just a few minutes in westward arc from zenith. The entire sighting lasted almost exactly 45 minutes, as I looked at my watch both at the beginning and end of the sighting. (The other times cited are more iffy.) In short, the overall trajectory formed a kind of &quot;Z&quot; pattern (but more as begun from the bottom right of the Z and up, rather than the upper left and then down, if you know what I mean.) I have no idea as to its size, but I would guess just based on various factors (see below), this object was anywhere from 50 to 100 feet across; if so, then it&apos;s safe to say that it was roughly at 30 to 40 thousand feet high--or more--especially towards the end. (By way of reference, at one point a jetliner flew across the sky, heading in a Westerly direction, coming close to crossing the path of the orb, probably at around 25 or 30 thousand feet--and the orb seemed much higher to me, based on its luminosity and the atmospheric haze over each body. Pure guesswork, of course, but worth mentioning. )", "That I lost sight of them when they were still pretty close to where I was standing.I was watching the the shooting stars, when I saw 2 dots flying almost next to each other but one was a little behind the other,I have seen this befor and assumed they were satellities, then I saw a third dot ahead of the other two flying a little bit to the left of the outside one.

I notice a light directly in front of my vehicle and my first thought was that it was a plane or some kind of air craft.  I decided to continue to drive unil I reached an area where there was parking along Dallas road.  Here there was a much better view of this object that was continuing to fall from the sky.  I did notice 5 other men watching the same object I was.  The light seemed to be on fire and falling through the sky very quickly.  Soon it was all over and the light vanished into the horizon, sinking into the ocean.  That was it.

The birds flew off, then the operator noticed what looked like another bird but at a very high altitude.  The supervisor spotted it as well. It was a craft of some kind. It was translucent white in color surrounded by a misty teardrop shaped aura.  It looked similar to a plane with swept back wings but neither of us felt is was a plane.  It was going north to south at a very high altitude.  It was so high it was barely visible; it seemed to blend into the blue sky. A passenger jet was also traveling in the same direction at a lower altitude; the normal cruising altitude for commercial jets in our area. The white craft overtook the jet like it was standing still.  It streaked to the south and then switched direction and shot straight up and disappeared from sight in a matter of seconds. We continued to watch the sky as the jetliner disappeared from our view.  A minute or so later, we then spotted another craft flying along the same trajectory as the first UFO.  It streaked across the sky and then shot straight up and disappeared in exactly the same manner as the first one did. The sky was clear at the time, except for some contrails overhead. The craft were very hard to detect: they were very well camouflaged. If we hadn&apos;t been looking up already we never would have seen them. Both the supervisor and the operator had seen a UFO previously; one in 1989 and the other in the 70&apos;s.

I became concerned because it seemed to be a large aircraft, flying very fast at way too low an altitude. I watched as it made a turn to fly against the hillside range above my house. Suddenly I realized that not only was the aircraft NOT flying fast, but it was much smaller than I&apos;d thought. I kept watching and realized that the aircraft was sort of &quot;floating&quot; along, not following a direct path, but sort of meandering side to side, and up and down.  Sort of like a ball floating on waves. When I could make out details, I found that it had no particular shape, was sort of &quot;opalescent&quot; like a bubble, and seemed to be revolving, but in no particular direction. The strange thing is, when I realized I was not looking at a standard aircraft, I gasped and said out loud &quot;OH MY GOD!&quot;   The aircraft reacted, sort of stumbling to a half-stop, and then dashing away full speed. I dropped my child into her crib and raced out the door, 3 seconds tops, and it was already out of sight when I got outside. There were no discernable lights on the craft, yet we had no lights that would reflect on the craft, so the lighting must have been interior.  For years I would have a vague memory of that night in the back of my mind, but it was not until my daughters and I saw another strange shape over the San Joaquin Valley and started talking about it, that the memory and all the details of that evening long past came flooding back.

Mind you, the area i live has a small wooded mountain in front of me so the object passed below the mountain height level and was highly visable due to the white light contrast against a black backround. The object was approx. 6-7 stories high in flight and traveling at a 100+ mph rate of speed..it was fast but not fast enough for the naked eye to catch.

We caught sight of this object in the vicinity of an overpass approximately 15 miles east of Coalinga. Initially we saw three lights that were lower in height than the overpass and they appeared to be heading south along the freeway, making a sharp turn to the east.  As we approached the object it had turned around and was heading northwest along the freeway.  At this point we saw strobe lights on each side. It turned around again heading straight for the traffic and we thought that it might be a plane making an emergency landing.  At this point I began to brace for the worst believing that it might crash land into the cars, but it crossed right in front of us just skimming above the cars on the freeway.  I craned my neck around to get a closer look as it passed overhead and to the south east behind us.  It maneuvered incredibly quickly around almost as if it had flipped over (inverting itself),throughout performing extremely tight turns and came back at full speed to make a quick pass overhead again.  At this point I saw two blue strobe lights on its back outer edges.  We were travelling at approximately 65 miles an hour and it kept up right with us.  A number of cars had overtaken us by this time leaving us alone to observe this object.  I had become quite nervous by this time and did not feel safe being around this object.  My brother wanted to stop to take a closer look, but I felt uneasy because of its erratic behaviour and because I did not want to cause any more traffic hazards myself.  The three large round lights that were spaced evenly across the front of the object cast subdued lighting rather than bright headlights.

We now want to report 3 sightings within an hour while we &quot;dog sat&quot; for my sister in the hills of Palmdale last night. My sister lives up in the hills of West Palmdale.  We went over to the house around 9pm. We checked on the dogs, and went out by the pool to relax and watch the stars. The house is situated on the hill in such a way that provides a panoramic view of the sky and the entire Antelope Valley.  As is our usual custom, we were viewing the sky. The first &quot;star&quot; came from the southwest corridor, and even while planes were flying around, this &quot;star&quot; almost &quot;hovered&quot; as it flew in a slow, steady, northeastern direction. Like our previous sightings in Lancaster, this object dipped occasionally and then eventually &quot;dissolved&quot;.  We both confirmed what we saw: no sound, no flash pattern or lights with the exception of the objects &quot;brightness/ sphere shape&quot;.  We waited a while longer, perhaps 8 to 10 minutes, and the 2nd &quot;star&quot; appeared out of south heading in a northerly direction. This 2nd star was different, however. This time, while it made a slow, almost &quot;hover&quot; like pattern, with slight dips, etc. it made it&apos;s way into our northern view, stopped, hovered, then suddenly became extremely BRIGHT, as if someone turned on a spotlight, while it remained motionless, felt like a signal to us that we see you seeing us. Then it dimmed again, and dissolved into the same spot as the 1st &quot;star&quot;.  We waited awhile longer again, this time it was approximately 15 minutes, and eventually, another &quot;star&quot; came out of the direct west direction, made a slow, dipping, hover like pattern, and again, moved across the sky and &quot;dissolved&quot; into the same exact area of the sky (due north)  As previously stated in our post of last week, we are very close to Edwards AFB, and see many flights of different aircraft all the time and are familiar with private and military craft.  These objects are not airplanes. No sound, no flash patterns, no direct flight path, no usual flight path taken (as we are used to seeing here in the Antelope Valley)  We are reporting this again in the hope that some other people in the valley have seen the same objects in the sky.

The second object had 2 bright lights attached to unknown dark craft . Also the first object was far away , but the second was close enough to see it was not a airplane or jet .", "I Was On My Computer 3 Nights ago i was still shaken by seeing a Disk shaped Flying Object When I See a Triangular shaped obect flying pretty fast across the sky. I wake my mom up and tell her she said it was just an airplane. Then i see another and i wake my mom up and show it to her she responds the same way [she doesn&apos;t beleive]Then i see the mothership with a opening in the center.", "Disk-shaped UFO with dome under perfectly clear conditions at less than 100 feet altitude, motionless.This happened in Omaha, NE in 1968. I cannot pinpoint the day or month because it was so long ago, therefore I could not enter that info in the box above, but it was during the Democratic Presidential Primary election (Bobby Kennedy vs. Eugene McCarthy). I had come to Omaha from Indianapolis as a campaign volunteer. I became acquainted with 3 other campaign workers, 2 of whom were instructors at the University of Iowa. A day or two before the election, we went to dinner at a family restaurant--NO ALCOHOL SERVED.The dinner conversation covered many topics. It developed that the name of a former English teacher from my alma mater was mentioned under his pen name, Brad Steiger. I informed the group of his real name and from there the talk led to the paranormal, Steiger&apos;s main subject in those days. UFOs were mentioned at length, but after awhile our dinner talk went on to non-paranormal subjects.It was dark when we left the restaurant; I believe it was about 9:00 PM. As we walked out the door into the parking lot we noticed a school bus in the lot full of what appeared to be high school students. Several were leaning out the windows, screaming and pointing upwards behind us.When we turned to look we got the shock of our lives. Directly over the restaurant&apos;s parking lot, at an altitude I estimate at no more than one hundred feet, was a UFO.The object was circular, with a flat bottom and an opaque dome on the top. I estimate the diameter of the object at 35 to 50 feet. It held absolutely still and made absolutely no noise. On top of the dome was a single, steady white light. Around the rim were solid white lights in the shape of rectangles with rounded corners, separated from each other by unlit space. The lights flashed around the rim in a counter-clockwise direction like lights on a theater marquee, but I assure you, this was not a theater marquee we were looking at.Conditions were ideal to observe. There was not a cloud in the sky. There was plenty of moonlight behind us so that the bulk of this UFO was outlined against the sky.I assure you this was not a hot-air balloon. There was no flame, no hanging basket. Besides, a balloon, even if tethered, could not have been so absolutely motionless as this object was.As other people came out of the restaurant, they also saw the object. I remember parents with children taking one look at the object, then RUNNING to their cars and leaving the lot as fast as possible.Eventually, one of the men from the U. of Iowa started timing the object. It was more than 2 more minutes before the object began to move away. But I stress that we were able to look at the object for quite awhile before it occurred to anyone to start timing it. While we were timing it, we also asked each other to describe to each other what we were seeing. Our descriptions agreed.When the object began to move, it moved VERY slowly, maybe 4 or 5 MPH. Again, it made absolutely no noise. There were no ports or windows in the object, just the disk shape with the dome on top, illuminated by the lights described. We watched until the object was too small to see with the naked eye. While it moved away, it maintained its low altitude.I have often wondered if anyone took photos of this. Let me tell you, if there had been video camcorders in those days, we would have had, without any question whatsoever, THE CLEAREST, MOST DRAMATIC, LONGEST-LASTING SIGHTING ever made of a UFO.We got in our car and attempted to follow the object, but this was tough to do in a city we were not familiar with. Later that night we thought we saw it again on the outskirts of town, but we could not be sure.Now, SOME PUZZLING THOUGHTS. Was it just coincidence that our dinner conversation had been, in part, about UFOs? Did our collective thoughts produce an illusion? But then, we were not the first to see it.More puzzling: this was Omaha in 1968, still the active headquarters of the Strategic Air Command, and yet there was not one other aircraft anywhere in the sky. You would think that this thing would have been seen on radar and all kinds of aircraft scrambled to intercept it. Unless, of course, it was one of ours.But, if it were one of ours, why would it hover so low over a busy part of town where it would be sure to be seen? Why were there not at least some police cars chasing this object? At the time, I was 23 years old, and had attended a small, private, church-sponsored  college, majoring in instrumental music and minoring in English.I do not recall what departments the 2 men from the U. of Iowa were in, but much later, maybe a year or so later, I happened to see them both in a story on the national TV news related to some event taking place at the U. of Iowa.I have never forgotten this incredibly vivid encounter.But, I&apos;ll tell you this: I never want to see another UFO.--end--((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  However, the Presidential Primary Election occurred on May 14, 1968, so we have assigned an arbitrary date above of May 12, 1968.  We would very much like to receive reports from any of the other witnesses to this event.  PD))", "I simply don&apos;t know what they were.I don&apos;t know what they were.At around 8:15pm, my friend and I were parked in the Burger King parking lot, visiting and watching the cars go by. Something in the sky caught our attention. At first, I thought it was three birds flying close together, but then noticed that there was no flapping of wings. They looked like three black triangle shapes that were flying close to one another. They made no sound. The three objects came from the north, flying south, and then went toward the south-west. I estimate their speed at around 30-40 mph, judging by the speed of the cars below.About a minute after the three objects were off in the distance and no longer visible, a fourth object was observed. This fourth object took the same flight path as the first three, and traveled at the same speed, only this object was shaped differently. This was like a black dot in the sky. There were no lights nor any sound to this object. I took a snapshot of this one, and am courious to see how it shows up on film.Again, this flying black dot went into a south-westerly direction.  I drove my car in that direction hoping to catch another glimps of it, but could not catch up to it.", "Note: I don&apos;t remember the exact time, but it was sometime between 10 PM and 12 AM I believe. I used to keep my window open before it got really hot.  I live by train tracks (not too close, but close enough), and by leaving the window open, I could hear trains, any sort of cars, animals, anything.  I was on the Internet and watching tv, I also had a fan on, yet I heard this really loud noise, like an airplane was flying over.  My town has a population of about 25-30k, and the only airport we have is municipal..I&apos;ve lived here for about 13 years, and I&apos;ve never once heard/seen an airplane in this town.  Anyways, I looked outside, and I see this craft.  It&apos;s triangle shaped, has three huge bright white lights on each corner, a small red light and small green light by the back left white light (one of the points was guiding), and what I think was a small white/purple light by the back right white light (I tried to adjust my eyes to see if it was a light or just glare..I wear no contacts or glasses and have perfect vision).  The small red light flashed about every second or second and a half, and the green flashed the same, except twice as fast.  This made me wonder if it was a plane.  I&apos;m an avid believer of UFOs, but I&apos;m always open to explanations. I drew a recreation (in MS Paint) of what I saw: http://ballz.ababa.net/exetergirl/ufo3.txt  When I saw the craft, it seemed 2D in the sky, and it was pretty far away, and diagonal from where I was watching it.  I&apos;m not good with figuring out distances and how big things can be depending on how close/far they are, but this seemed pretty big and pretty high up, not just above the tree tops, but not right below the clouds, it seemed about in the middle.  I can&apos;t really discern how big it was, it could have been about the size of a plane, but it seemed like at that height, it would be bigger than a plane at the same height.  I could distinctly see the shape of the craft.  It was an equilateral triangle with rounded off corners, and it looked like a silhouette.  It was bright out (a full moon just a couple days before), and it was also a clear night.  The triangle looked like it was just a piece of shaped paper flying through the sky..like I said before it was 2D, and I couldn&apos;t see anything like engines or any other objects on it.  All I saw was the silhouette of a perfect equilateral triangle, as if it had lights on top or on the side.  This was the second time I&apos;ve seen it.  The first time I saw it was with two other people in July/August of 2003.  The &apos;03 craft looked exactly the same, but it was going E/NE, while the &apos;05 triangle was traveling N/NW.  The closest military base that I know of is in Davenport, Iowa (about three hours away, I believe), and it would seem a bit odd to me if it was an airplane or military craft.  I don&apos;t remember if any sort of magnetic or electrical effects happen, but I do remember both of my cats &quot;freaking out&quot; right before I saw it.", "Flashing Ring floats S-SW from Minneapolis view area 45 minutesFrom Maple Grove MN looking south recognized an odd flickering of light for what I would expect to be a star or planet.  Watched for 10 minutes noticing that the object moved ver slow across the sky. Used aircraft leaving MSP Airport as reference to object as they were moving many miles closer to my location.  Could discern what apeared to be red and green blinking lights. Retrieved binoculars and telescope. Binoculars confirmed the twinkling light, but unable to see much else other than the slow movement S to SW. 21:45 set up telescope and targeted object.  Clearly saw what appeared to be a planar ring shape glowing modest white/yellow light, with bright white lights flashing around the diameter in an orderly counter-clockwise direction.  Ring did not appear completely rigid, but could have been as it may have been &quot;wobbling&quot; or deforming.  Object appeared to remain planar, and did not expand or contract.  Looked much like what you would see under a microscope looking at a small bacteria or sea animal.  Green and Red lights would periodically flash from what I can best describe as directly perpendicular to the ring plane.  Looked like a donut with an imaginary center post kind of like a spinning top.  As the object moved to the SW, it fell below the house and tree lines and I gave up watching about 22:15.", "Sphere turns into jetMy husband and I were out working in the yard and I happened to see a jet coming from the west that was probably at 25,000 feet. The setting sun reflected off of the jet. Approxiamtely 5 or 10000 feet below the jet was a small silver looking sphere that also was reflecting the sun. I pointed it out to my husband and as we were watching it the sphere turned black and then turned into a black replica of the jet overhead!! I still could only hear one aircraft. Both objects flew to the east out of sight.", "triangle, 7 light, black and chrome  with a haze surrounding it type object seen 31July 2005 in Ashland City Tn. 4:30 am.I left the Petro 2 truck stop in Kingston Springs, Tn at 4:00am on July 31,2005.  I decided to take the quick way home instead of taking the interstate.  I was on hywy 249 north, it is a winding road but it takes only half the time to get home; the evening was still it was alittle foggy driving along the river.  There was a half moon and a few stars out.  I reached the end of hywy 249, I made a right turn on hywy 49E.  As I made this right hand turn I was entering on the bridge; there was this big triangle shaped 7 light object that looked hazy hovering over the treeline. I pulled the emergency brake on my car I got out of my vehichle and stood in front of this object for about 1minute and a half.  It was amazing.  I was scared and excited at the same time.  I have never experienced anything like that ever.", "Small u.f.o. hovering over Archuleta Mesa in Dulce, NM.I visited Dulce, NM on December 13, 2004 in order to hike the famous Archuleta Mesa. I hiked around and took quite a few photo&apos;s in order to study later.  I only recently discoverd what seems to be a small ufo hovering over the Archuleta Mesa. I can&apos;t quite make out details of the U.F.O.  All I know is that it&apos;s not a bird, plane, or helicopter.  The sky is Blue as can be, not a cloud.  If you would like me to e-mail you the photo then I will do so.  ((name deleted))", "I was standig in my citchen window looking at the stars when i saw 3 orange/red lights in a triangle formation, my first ufo :-)", "Triangle zigzagged.  Another shined light on us. Others jetted to horizon.I was almost home, driving thru a 1000 acre corn field after harvest on a dirt road between Indiana and Michigan 3 a.m. 1991. The sky was very clear. Out of the corner of my eye I saw an orange light descending from the sky. As I turned my head it came to a stop behind a leafless tree line on the other side of the field about 1/2 mile away. The light seemed large for aircraft maybe 2 feet in diameter. More like a small orb, yet small from the distance. It was quite peculiar, it&rsquo;s color, the way it descended, and the way it came to a stop without slowing. I pulled the van over and said to my friend &quot;hey, watch that light over there. I could swear I just saw it come down out of the sky&quot;. So we sat there talking, not really paying attention. It had not moved for 10..maybe 15 minutes when I looked and it was rising up and slightly toward us. At about 60-75 ft. the orange light turned into 3 dazzling lights in a triangle pattern...Holy crap!!! Surprised the hell out of us! We looked at each other then back at the lights which were strobing in a rainbow of color so fast they seemed bright white. Then it started to zigzag 1500 feet back and forth several times like a bug without stopping or slowing. I can only guess the speed seemed to be more than 300 mph. It seemed to stay parallel to the ground at the same altitude. Needless to say by this time we were freakin out, both of us tapping each other on the shoulder, looking back and forth at each other and the &quot;alien ship&quot;, saying &quot;are you seeing what I&rsquo;m seeing&quot; over and over. That&rsquo;s all we could do. I was astonished. That went on for a little less than a minute. Then it headed east at a steady speed, gaining altitude. Two or three times, before it became too distant, it seemed to disappear and reappear in the same line of flight 2 or three times more distant than it should have been at the same speed almost instantly. An extreme jump in speed or should I say place because when it reappeared it was traveling at the same speed. We tried to chase it to see if we could spot it again but figured it moved on. So we headed back. As we drove back down the dirt road something drew my attention to the field on the other side of the road. So we stopped again backing up into a driveway so we could see if there was really something out there. We sat there a few minutes. It was like a dim, bluish spotlight waving back and forth. The beam seemed to extend only about 20 ft. I asked my friend if he wanted to go out there to get a closer look. He said no, and I was relived. Just put that out of mind. Now I wish I had, I always wonder what I would have seen. But I was more afraid of what might happen. I should have drove through the field. Maybe I could have run my truck into it or run down some helpless alien. Anyway, it waved 2 or 3 times with interrupts between passes. I asked my friend, wondering if it would be such a good idea, if I should flash the headlights at it, which I did. About ten seconds later directly after making another pass to the sky the light shined right on us. I have never seen a light so eerie. It seemed to be more luminescent or dissipated, fractured as though shining through a fog. It stayed on us for about 2 seconds then went about what it was doing without skipping a beat. I wondered if it was signaling some other craft. So, I got out and looked up. There were others that appeared like moving stars. I didn&rsquo;t get a count but there were more than three because I remember 3 that came together in a large triangle formation then jetted away from each other almost to the extent of the horizon within 5 or six seconds. At the altitude they were at, I&rsquo;m assuming space, the speed had to be tremendous. Then they flew back to form the same formation just as fast. There were others but they seemed to be stopped then would move shorter distances. I wasn&rsquo;t taking much note of them though. They were hard to keep track of, they blended in with the stars and my neck got really tired after more than 15 minutes or so looking almost straight up. It had been a long night, the object in the field had stopped signaling and I&rsquo;m not sure what happened to the ones in the sky. Dawn was approaching so we went home talking about it all morning. Hours later we went out into the field. The dirt was very hard. There were no signs of any activity.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))", "Small Gold Flat Chip(s) Extracted From MouthHere&apos;s a play by play of exactly what has transpired. I&apos;m an American living in Brazil with my girlfriend of 5 years. About three months ago I was driving back with her from the town where she grew up in Brazil. We were conversing, passing time, and she happened to tell me this story about how she and her sister used to expell metal pieces out of their mouths when they were kids. I was nodding my head and acknowledging her, but inside my head my thoughts could frankly be described as, &apos;mmhmm, oky doky&apos;, like &apos;yeah, sure, I&apos;ll just forget my girlfriend ever mentioned this crazy story&apos;. She continued to say that her mother had the last piece extracted analyzed in a lab and the results were that the object was not &quot;from this world&quot;. I naturally probed with a few questions, but I wasn&apos;t convinced so I honestly let the story in one ear and out the other because the mother or sister wasn&apos;t there to back the story and I need proof to believe something like this. Friday August 4th, 2005 - The Proof  My girlfriend decides to come home for lunch, a rare occasion. I made her a sandwhich, she ate, then had to rush back to the hospital (she&apos;s a doctor). She went into the bathroom to brush her teeth and I remained on the couch with our dog. All of the sudden she came out holding her finger out at me with a gold piece on it and said, &quot;Remember when I told you me and my sister were getting these metal pieces out of our mouths? Well, here&apos;s one&quot; (very calmly and confidently). She came out and showed me this thing like this wasn&apos;t the first time she&apos;s shown someone else these objects and she handed it to me and told me to keep it. She also had this air about her like, &quot;You believe me now?&quot;. So I inspected it. I was really curious. I asked her if it had come off her necklace and she said, &quot;C&apos;mon (my name), no&quot;. Then I made her swear on my grandmother&apos;s soul that she wasn&apos;t lying and she did. My grandparents who are diseased mean the world to me and she knows it. Then I started thinking, was it in the bread, egg, salt, onion, tomato, cheese, ketchup, or lettuce that I made her? Was it in the grape juice she drank? How about the toothpaste? So I went into the bathroom and pointed out the toothpaste tube we&apos;d been using and asked her if this was the toothpaste she&apos;d used and she confirmed it was the one. So I squeazed the remains out on the bathroom counter and mushed it around with my finger to see if there were any more chips, no chips. Then she left, she had to get back. I got curious having this thing in my possession and wanted to check online to see if anyone else has had this same strange phenomenon happening to them. I wasn&apos;t having any luck. I started putting in on Yahoo, &quot;coughing up metal&quot;, etc. I was clicking around with no luck until I happened upon this website, reading this story. http://www.ufoinfo.com/filer/2000/ff_0003.shtml  &quot;STRANGE GOLD IMPLANT FOUND Bill Bean writes that, &quot;In July of 1997, I became mysteriously ill and couldn&apos;t swallow, because there was a pressure on my throat.&quot; I felt I was choking, just drinking water. It was the most horrible experience of my life, and I wish it on no one. I saw eight different doctors and many tests were done and nobody gave me an answers. I was rushed by ambulance to the hospital, three times in three weeks. I truly thought I was dying. I noticed a pattern of red circular marks on my back that I felt was a reaction to the medication. My wife photographed them. I could not eat and my weight went from a muscular 240 lbs. to 198 lbs. On December 16, 1997, I was in the bathroom with my wife, brushing my teeth when felt a bristle came off my toothbrush causing me to cough. I reached in my mouth to get the object with my right index finger and found a gold - square - flat - chip. Our first thoughts were that it had to come out of the toothbrush. Something told me to save it and I did. The next night, while brushing my teeth, I started coughing again and expelled two more of these things in the sink. After expelling the first piece, I felt like some pressure had come off of my throat and the next night a lot of pressure had come off. I began eating normally and felt much better. Last year, I sent one piece to Derrel Sims who had the object analyzed. Bill says, &quot;My piece matches a piece that was surgically removed from a person four years ago in Brazil. An isotopic test to determine if the piece is alien is being accomplished.&quot; Thanks to Bill Bean bllin@erols.com. Editors Note: Derrel Sims and I feel this may be the most significant implant case thus far. derrel@holman.net&quot;   When I read that line, &quot;On December 16, 1997, I was in the bathroom with my wife, brushing my teeth when felt a bristle came off my toothbrush causing me to cough. I reached in my mouth to get the object with my right index finger and found a gold - square - flat - chip.&quot;, a surge of fear shot right through me. I felt like I was in a movie suddenly or a bad dream. How could this all be some weird coincidence? It&apos;s possible sure, but I have a hard time formulating a hypothesis. Is some company having a food processing flaw allowing 20 some odd chips to fall into vats over the years and these three people in different countries happen to consume?   There are so many possibilities! Could it be the government somehow tracking people? Why the two sisters? Why the man, if he&apos;s telling the truth? Could extraterrestrials be abducting and experimenting on us? My girlfriend, seems to think they are coming from her nasal passage, not travelling up her esophagous and surfacing in the throat. Or perhaps if it is a food consumption flaw perhaps it&apos;s getting caught in the back of the throat in the tonsuls or skin. In 2002 after she extracted a chip, she moved with me shortly after to the US in 2003. Coincidently, she had a bad nasal infection and smell emminating from her nose.  Another oddity related to this: both sisters have a benign cyst in the same location in the cerebellum in their brains. My girlfriend two months ago was feeling immense migraines and motor skill loss, so we went a diagnostics center here in Brazil to have an MRI done. I saw her holding up the large X-Ray looking sheets into the light and she said, &quot;Weird, I have the same cyst as my sister and in the same spot&quot;.  Immediately after I read that similar story online, what did I rashly do in a panic? I called SETI. I got their secretary in California and she couldn&apos;t help me, all she said was that she was sorry, but she didn&apos;t know where to guide me in this appologetic voice. Then she advised me that my girlfriend should see a doctor. I told her, &quot;the person who is expelling these is a doctor&quot;. And she didn&apos;t have anything to say, but that she didn&apos;t know how to help me.  That&apos;s when I started emailing as many UFO researchers as I could. Everyone seemed to refer me to A.J. Gaevard here in Brazil. So I contacted Mr. Gaevard and he was very nice and helpful and directed me to someone here close to home. What I do know is that when the mother of the two sisters had the piece in 2002 analyzed, from what I gather, they basically took it, said it was not from this planet, and didn&apos;t give it back and the family didn&apos;t hear anything back. So the girls weren&apos;t extracting anymore chips and the issue subsided and nobody talked about it, until now. I had my girlfriend call her mother in front of me and ask what happened exactly to the last chip. So her mother called her contact and this is what her mother explained to my girlfriend, who explained to me: The first lab didn&apos;t know what it was or what it was made of, so they sent it to another lab where they said it was somehow composed of quartz. That&apos;s it. And it took three years later for the mother to find this out in 2005. Update: We have since remained in contact with A.J. Gevaerd and his close friend and colleague who is an esteemed doctor and publisher, which we met in person last Monday (8/29/05) to drop the chip off for analysis. They are conducting research on the piece now. Results will be posted in Gevaerd&apos;s magazine sometime in the near future.((NUFORC Note:  We have corresponded with this witness, and have seen photos of the tiny, gold-colored object.  At this time, we have no specific reason to suspect that the object may be of extra-terrestrial origin.  It is being analyzed, under the direction of Mr. A. J. Gevaerd, well-known UFO investigator, and publisher, from Brazil.  PD))", "Marine sees ufo come down out of sky, travel across bay, and shoot up back into sky in Ewakuni Japan, June 1965.I was on guard duty on the causeway in Ewakuni Japan.  It was just after the sun went down behind me, I was walking around some boxes on the wharf when I saw what appeared to be a bright light coming down from the sky on my left.  It leveled off over the water and slowly crossed in front of me, going from left to right over the water of the bay.  I could hear water striking the hull of the object as it went very low across the water.  There was no sound other than the water hitting the object, I could hear no engine noise at all. I could not see a shape as it was dark and I could only see what appeared to be a bright light.I estimate that it traveled perhaps 300 feet across the water. It then went up at approximately a 45 degree angle straight into the sky.  I watched it until it was so small that it appeared to be one of the stars.  I was completely astounded, and just stood there a moment looking into the sky.I finally ran into a nearby building and called the Officer on duty to report what I had seen.The operator on the phone told me that I had not seen anything, and told me to forget it, as I would be in big trouble if I said anything further. I hung up the phone and never told anyone else about it because I thought I would be called a kook.I know what I saw was not a weather balloon, or a helicopter, and I have never seen a craft that could go straight up into the sky as fast as this thing did. I was in the Marine Corps air wing at the time and was used to seeing jets take off. I have never seen a jet fly without making any noise at all, so this in my opinion was not a jet either. I simply do not know what it was.I have never forgotten that moment. The reason I am reporting it now is because I just got through watching seeing is believing on tv, I don&apos;t feel so stupid telling my story now.  I cannot prove my story, so I don&apos;t expect people to believe me.  I only know what I saw.", "Black Triangular Craft with Seven Dim Lights Sighted Over Spencerport, NYThe evening was unusually cool and very clear, so my husband and I decided to go out onto the back patio to enjoy some relief from the heat and relax while looking at the stars.  We sat in our loungers watching the sky for about a 1/2 hour or so, but only saw the usual satillite or two, and a shooting star. Then, just before we were getting ready to head in, I caught something out of the corner of my eye moving in the sky toward us from over our house, coming from the South East, headed North West. As I focused on it, I could see the outline of a black, triagular craft, with seven yellowish, very dim lights on the bottom.  Three of the lights were along the bottom left, three along the bottom right and then one light at the tip. The body was very black against the sky and the underside lights looked just like round, recessed lighting you&apos;d put in your house, but with the dimmer turned way down.  It blended so well with the sky that had I not been staring straight up, I probably would not have seen it.  As it moved, the bottom of the craft seemed to always be facing us, since you could not see any depth to it...it looked very thin and flat. At this point, I started pointing up and yelling for my husband to look ...he did and to my surprise, he saw exactly what I did...a big, black triangle, flying quite low, at what appeared to be just a few thousand feet.  It made absolutely no noise and moved very smoothly like a glider through the sky.  It came from over the front of our house, passed over our backyard and then disappeared as it moved behind the trees at the back of our property.  As for the speed, it was moving moderately fast, but slow enough that we were able to view it for 1 1/2 - 2 minutes. I had seen something very strange in the sky many years ago, but was alone at the time and had no one with me in order to do a &quot;reality&quot; check.  This time, though, I could not believe that my husband was actually seeing the same thing that I was.  Those few minutes were very surreal. The whole experience was quite exciting, yet very disquieting at the same time -- what was it that we saw?????  My husband and I are both well educated, respected technical professionals in our mid-30s, with steady jobs, a stable home life and we own our home.  We very rarely drink, if ever, and do not do drugs.", "neon multi-colored jellyfish type hovering object in Oregon late 70&apos;s -first report of this incidentVery clear, close up colorful moving object shaped like a giant jellyfish hovering in forest.  This is very old that was never reported; I don&apos;t think I ever made a formal report of this before -- I really don&apos;t know why not-- maybe I thought people would judge me in a bad way.  Anyhow, my brother and I saw the object from the back seat of our car as we were on a trip with our parents from Nevada to Oregon.... it was really late and the other kids in the car were asleep.. but not us 2.  It was between about 1977 and 1979 and I think it was on Christmas break or possibly summer break... exact date and year or time of night I am not sure of, but the sight was definitely clear.  It was possibly 30 meters or so from us on the right hand side of the road down in the forest... we were situated at a level slightly higher than the object and the road was pretty curvy.  The thing was about 10 feet across maybe... dome shaped with hanging down undulating legs.  The whole thing was like neon -  glowing in the dark  - even the legs. The top dome had different  colored (I think oval) lights going all the way around the dome.  It was so long ago I wish I had drawn an exact likeness, but I definitley remember these things.  It was such a beautiful object hovering just above the forest floor.  We only saw it for a moment but it was clear... no distant nebulous lights or anything.  Still, my brother and I really had not discussed it much over our lifetime. I think we might have tried to tell our parents later on, but they must have laughed it off and no report was made.  My brother and I are both highly educated. We are not red-neck storytellers or something.  I have no wish of any notoriety at all. I am just curious.  I even called my brother this evening to ask about it and he laughed and said yeah that octopus thing ...that was definitely strange.  (He was 2 years younger at the time we saw it and maybe had a less clear memory of it, but he definitely confirmed that he had never seen anything like it and he still thinks it very odd).  I would like to know if anyone has seen this specific type of object besides us.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

The boxed lights ran along the circumferance of the object and did not move.  They were extraordinarily bright.  The object stopped and hovered in place once it reached the busy street and then slowly hovered south along Campbell rd.  The craft appeared to be about 30 feet above the rooftops of the residences within the neighborhood.  From our perspective which was directly across the street in the Foodland parking lot, the air craft appeared to be the lenght of 4 or 5 of the houses it was hovering above.  After having viewed the strange ship for about 5 minutes, it was no longer within our field of view.  About 3 or 4 minutes later, my father exited Foodland and we attempted to pursue the craft by driving south down Campbell, the same direction it was slowly hovering in.  It was no longer visible in any direction at that point however.  It was as if it had simply vanished.  The ship made no noise that was audible beyond the general hum of the Campbell rd. traffic below it.

I looked up in time to see a fireball overhead which I thought to be an unusually close comet because the fire was red.  It was moving slowly so it couldn&apos;t have been a comet.  In fact when my brain adjusted on it, I realized it couldn&apos;t have been more than 3 - 5 hundred feet in altitude.  Looking closer I noticed two circular glowing red holes like jet engines at the back of a dark un quantifyable craft from where this huge fireball was protruding the fireball must have been 50 ft. long once compared to the size and altitude of the craft.  Than the fireball completely vanished leaving the two glowing engines and then they vanished and so did the craft. I suppose it could have been a jet fighter but let me ask a question to people living in Toronto.  How many jet fighters have you seen speeding over Toronto&apos;s downtown sector with their afterburners on?   I bet you it&apos;s never happened.

However, when I was looking straight up, a movememnt in the peripheral feild of vision in my right eye made me look towards the western sky, at a degree of 60 from the western horizon. The sky was cloudy due to a cyclone in the Arabian sea. But, luckily, a small linear break in the clouds allowed me to see a V-SHAPED/Boomerang shaped UFO which was visible in that hour only because of the lights , circular, atleast 6 of them under its structure. It was moving from west to east. Speed was about that which normal airliners take over cities. It made NO NOISE AT ALL. Inspite of that flying at cloud level (clouds during cyclones are somewhat low in altitude) , there was no engine noise/ no noise due to aerodynamic disturbance. Its size, I estimate it to be bigger than a boeing747. Shape, and illustration of the UFO , I am submitting a jpg file by email to this site. And I am almost sure that the UFO which I saw was not a secret military aircraft. Reasons: 1) the Noiseless flight. If it were to be using a jet engine, even if the engine was hidden inside the airframe, it would have emitted some sound, flying at that low altitude. 2) The big light emitting circles under it. Why would a &apos;stealth aircraft&apos; have such lights underneath it? the meaning of stealth itself if challenged if a stealth aircraft travels over a highly populated city like Bangalore, that too at low altitude, that too with light emitting circles under it.((NUFORC Note:  We have amended the date of the sighting to November 05, 2004, from 2005.

At the time the picture was taken you can see that the sky is extreamly clear with no clounds.  Due to the early evening our the sky is in a darker shade that makes the rounds white objects stand out.  I ignored it at first, but looked awfully suspicious.

My friend and I were on Cambridge st. at Somerset when we heard a loud distant boom high up. Almost as a sonic boom with no echo. At which point, I looked up to the sky and notice a light brighter than a flare but heavier with a much larger volume shining at a point (similar to magnesium oxide strips) with a huge trail of smoke billowing and gathering in huge amounts above it. It seemed like an object moving at a phenomenal rate of speed towards our general area. Probably far from us. I observed it long enough to determine it&apos;s size and speed as being quite extraordinary. I looked around neightbouring areas in the sky, noticing multiple trails of smoke starting from a center in a bike wheel pattern. The center moved away from where I had spotted the bright light. I looked back at where I saw the object and it was gone. The centerpoint pattern continued for some time until it dissipated. Here&apos;s what my friend has to say.: Ok let me start of by saying I did not see the part of the event as aforementioned by my friend, but we both heard the loud bang, I thought something very large had exploded. When I looked up to the sky I saw what looked like a hole in the atmosphere, a huge round circle in the sky, bright green and possibly blue in colour patterned like the lines of an iris as in the coloured part of the human eye. It was as if there was a puncture in the sky. All I know is It felt out of place and completely unatural.

I was up in the mountains with a few friends of mine and we were celebrating the last day of school. The mountains were and still are, one of our common hang outs but that night was a little different because a new area was recently opened after construction was finished. We decide to go on the new path, which my two others were familiar with. We parked up on area that was the base of the road. We all got out of the and my two other friends began to walk towards the ledge of the cliff directly in front of them facing the interior of the mountains. I stayed at my current location and began to gaze at the sky as i do most every night. I turned about 180 degrees, facing the west, before abruptly stoping at the sight of something i had never seen before. It was a circular object, bright and luminesant. From my view point it appeared to be as big as the moon or maybe bigger. The object had to relativly close because of it size and no plane would safely fly at the elvation through mountains terrain  nor would need to be at the elevation. It was very bright and had a great radiance about it but no light was cast by it. It was a combination of colors but at the same time one solid color, consisting of white, yellow and orange. But before i could call my friends over to look at it, the object shot off at a speed and a velocity i have never seen before. It was very still for a short period of time then dissapeared in the same amount of time or shorter. I began to cheer and laugh because it was my very first U.F.O sighting. My friends gave me ridiculous conclusions of the objects identity, but all of them were nothing like what i saw. I see planes in the sky all the time when i am up there and none of them are that large and could move at speeds that fast.

As i watched the program, something caught my eye and luckly i taped it so i could go back and check it out. The topic of the section was about project blue book and they began to show different documents from the organization. The thing that caught my eye was that claremont california was listed in one of the documents, and next to it was a case file with a claim of seeing a description of the thing i view shortly before. I also was told by another close friend that he viewed the same thing as me on the same night from his bedroom. It was around the same time as my encounter and he described a loud noise at first and then silence. The object then hovered slowly over his home about three stories above.

During a graveyard shift, I went outside to do my hourly weather observation, taking the temperature/dewpoint samples.  I noticed an object moving slowly from over the mountains to the northeast (Dragoon mountains), on a southwesterly heading towards the Bisbee/Ft Huachuca area.  I could not estimate the size or altitude of the object, but it was a light blue color and globular.  It seemed to glow and the intensity would fluctuate as it moved along.  Having been in the USAF and around aircraft for many years, I saw that this was definitely not a conventional aircraft, neither fixed wing nor rotor.  When it reached a point over the Mule mountains to the southwest, over the Bisbee/Ft Huachuca area, it stopped and just hung there. A couple of minutes later it started to move sporadically back and forth over that point.  I went back inside the station and rang Davis-Monthan AFB in Tucson on our interphone line requesting them to verify a target at that location.  Davis-Monthan confirmed a target over Ft Huachuca, and their height-finder radar indicated an altitude &quot;above 90,000 feet&quot;.  The size of the object as it appeared, and at that altitude, must have been huge.  Davis-Monthan scrambled 2 F4&apos;s.  I went back outside and in minutes could see, approaching from the northwest, two aircraft moving towards the object and the glowing trails of their afterburners going full bore told me it was the F4s.  When the aircraft were approximately 10 or 20 miles from the object, it suddenly zoomed away at high speed towards the southwest and disappeared over the mountain horizon, leaving the F4s orbiting around the area.  I could only imagine what the pilots were saying to each other.  They then headed northwest towards Tucson.  Davis-Monthan had checked with the base at White Sands Proving Grounds to verify if a weather baloon had been launched recently.  They had not.  When Davis-Monthan called back for more information, I told them jokingly...&quot;congratulations, you just confirmed a UFO&quot;.  They were not amused.  I did not have any other inquiries from either the Air Force people nor our FAA.  A couple of days later I learned of the new UFO Reporting Center in Seattle.  I called them and told them the story and never heard from them again.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  Witness heard back from NUFORC, on this occasion.

From the light I saw in St.Albert to disk shaped flying over the hood of car, light in the sky changing dirctions as if follow us, to another unexplainable object flying over car, to light that changed from straight approach to 45 degrees.

PD))That day, my wife phoned me to join her rapidly in the garden which took me 1 minute.She said : look into that cloud almost ahead of us and I immediately saw what she ment. Imaging a chemtrails &raquo; - this was the exact opposite :  Very slowly in this existing natural gray/white cloud was a kind of huge transparant tunnel in the process of being formed like if a big transparant but not visible balloon made its way from west to east and doing so making the path behind it clear from cloudyness with just enough cloud_stuff (which was ringed with many vertical rings, like there used vibrations) to create this amazing sight of a perfect tunnel in that big cloud.The diameter of the tunnel was about 6/8 airline_planes as we see those often here. This invisible ball which did this was because of what happened in some  way visible.It took about  15 minutes  ----------  END of the PHYSICAL  part because I saw what she saw  --------  but there is more to it. .   .   .COMPLETELY UNBELIEVABLE (This was only seen by her and not by me  ! )  Two hours later she asked me again to come and look in the vineyard which is all around our garden.There she saw a vertical transparant tower going vertically endlessly in the sky with no end.Diameter below 80 meter but not cylindric but square wit the edges rounded.Color was transparant blueish. I did really my best but saw nothing  So I really saw nothing and felt nothing. Now - today - she says and I know she&apos;s not lying that because of my blunt &quot;see nothing&quot; she didn&apos;t say much more about what happened,  Imaging a university at closing time when all students go home. What she saw was IN OUR GARDEN (which is big) a stream of young people ( ages from 15 up to 30) all in a very cozy way - talking to each other - in small groups dressed like in the 60_ties , somewhat old fashioned laughing - energetic - hundreds of them all going to that vertical column, My wife tried contacting them but no avail at all. They didn&apos;t see her. Now the whole thing made me think of a story I read long ago of somebody in Waterloo and saw suddenly a part of Napoleon&apos;s army (from 1815) passing by - hurling - crying - smell included etc. I can imaging the past comes strangely to live but in this case : This passing by of that balloon which created a real physical tunnel effect - and you saw that tunnel effect 15 minutes later still present !  The second part is like a kind of Fatima Vision but as it it connected to the tunnel - strange mixture of matter_frequencies -  or is this HAARP projecting holograms of things happening on the other side of the planet - but then why did I not see the second part", "A fireball shooting across the skyIt Looked like a fire ball just shooting across the sky leaving a trail behind it", "White cylinder craft dissapears and reappears right above us on Folsom lake in CA. 5 witnessesThere was a group of 5 people wakebarding on Folsom lake around 7 o&apos;clock on Wedensday the 24th.  Our boat was travelling parralell next to the Folsom dam.   Above the damn we saw a white cylindrical object in the sky.  It appeared still at first then slowly moved away from the dam.  In no way did it appear to be a plane.  It was in the sky for a good minute when our friend fell down in the water, and we took our eyes of the craft for no more than 5 seconds. Then we look back and it had dissapeared. Before we had turned away it was a fairly close distance and no plane could have dissapeared that fast from how close it was to us. This day there were absolutely no clouds in the sky. 10 min later on the way back to the dock, we were all scanning the skys when suddenly the same craft was directly above us!  It had appeared there in practically an instant. Then it moved toward the damn at a faster speed.  We eventually lost sight of the craft until it was too far. We also saw a helicopter in the area that appeared to be head in the direction of the craft.  We also saw plenty of passenger planes that were instanly identifiable as planes.  This craft shared no resemblence.  None of the plane were moving at the speed of the craft.", "Craft with multicolored lights drifted above us.We were in a bus going from Lynwood to everett, we were just entering everett when suddenly 3 Disk shaped objects hovering low below the clouds followed the bus for twenty five minutes. The bus driver gazed in astonishment and fear. Some of the passangers got out cameras and took picutres, though no one outside the bus seemed to respond. The crafts were illuminated with what seemed to be fourteen or so very bright lights on the bottom of the craft. It looked like stars floating above us. After the minutes had passed, the craft reversed direction and shot off at unbelieveable speed.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

The object appeared to give off some kind of heat like if you look down a road in the summertime the way the heat from the sun reflects off the pavement this thing appeared to have a circle around it and outside this circle it was giving off waves heat like reflecting the sun so I called my roommate (A Network manager at an architectural firm) and he told me to get the video camera which I did.  It was my first time using my roommate&rsquo;s camera and after viewing what I had there are parts where this thing has 8 or more orbs in a triangle formation.  this object then headed slowly to the south east at which point I saw a commercial airliner fly right past it the pilot had to have seen this object, around 7:30pm my roommate gets home and I point the thing out to him as it was now much farther away he agreed with me it definitely wasn&rsquo;t a plane and neither of us had any idea what this thing was.

Every once and a while I will see falling stars and airplanes traveling from the airport, Hartsfield. Anyway on this night I saw a triangle shaped object with 3 lights at each point, it was moving very slow and much closer to the ground than the other commercial aircraft, there was a smaller object moving behind the larger triangle. The smaller object was moving back and forth (left to right) with a lot of blinking lights on it, whereas the triangle was moving slow and steady south to north east, no blinking lights on the triangle. It was silent until it passed, then I heard what sounded like normal engine sounds.I am not sure what I saw, I just know that I have never seen anything like those two objects before. I saw the mention of this web site on the National Geographic episode about UFO&apos;s with Peter Jennings, so here I am.I have read other reports of triangle objects on your web site, however none had a smaller craft/object tailing the triangle.

It was silver with a black bottom (which I presume was shadow) but I saw no fins or even a gondola (or carrage)where the drivers would be.  I also noticed it was longer and not as plump as a blimp.  I&apos;ve seen the Goodyear Blimp and this was much longer.  I also heard no sound.  The motor of a blimp is not something you would miss. As I watched it, I noticed that it was tipping forward and back, like a see/saw as it moved slowly along the sky.  I thought this to be rather  odd movement for an airship.  It did this all the while I watched it.  Finally it moved out of my viewpoint.  I tried to catch it again at the top of a hill, but it was gone. The next day, I saw about 10 white panel trucks with a blue shield and the letters *cc inside the shield.  On top were the Yellow caution lights utility trucks have.  The * is represents the letter I didn&apos;t catch.  They were all moving fast and not paying attention to stop signs.  I had the idea they where searching for something because some of the trucks had what appeared to be radio equipment in their beds. I&apos;ve not heard of any reports of downed blimps in my region.  So, maybe this was a U.F.O.", "At first we thought it was a baloon, but we saw it so something i&apos;ve never thought a balloon was capable of.It was a shiny dot in the sky. at first, i just thought it was a baloon. But it did something a balloon could never do. It sat in one spot for a minute or so then zoomed across the sky like a bullet.  After another minute or so, it zoomed back to the same spot. After another few minutes it zoomed off into the horizon. i don&apos;t know what the hell it was, but when my mum called the UFO reporting center, she said that the man told her that other people had seen it do the exact same thing at the same time.

I ask that you send me an email if you can find any similar sightings in your database.I want to know if anyone has seen anything similar:  Early AM, very cold; weather clear. Cubic &apos;craft&apos;, about 18&quot; on the side, flew overhead repeatedly, emitting a whooshing sound; a buzzing sound could also be heard, similar to the sound made by an electrical transformer under load.  These flying cubes appeared to be made of &apos;brushed metal&apos;.  They flew in an undulating &apos;chain&apos; formation. They repeatedly &apos;buzzed&apos; me; in other words they dove at me. I was on foot at the time. I attempted to &apos;escape&apos; from this remote location by hiking toward a store (closed at that time of day).  I had to cross a steel bridge over a river, but saw that the cubes had landed in the center of the bridge.  I was terrified by this time.  I watched as the cubes disgorged a number of shiny silver spheres;  the spheres varied in size from 3&quot; to about 12&quot;.  After the spheres had &apos;rolled out&apos; from small square &apos;doors&apos; in the sides of the cubes, the cubes suddenly took flight and vanished. Now my path across the bridge was &apos;blocked&apos; by these silvery spheres. They did not glow, but were very reflective. There were several spheres, I do not know how many.I decided to brave an attempt to pass by the spheres.  As I did, one of them vanished with a tiny &apos;ping&apos; sound.  This was very strange. I should mention that there was on the ground, the last of the snow of winter; this was very hard snow, a crust, about 1&quot;-8&quot; deep. There were bare areas of dirt also. As I walked toward the far end of the bridge, my head began to sweat, and my vision fogged.  I became dizzy, and could barely walk.  The sensation of heat _inside_ my head increased radically with every step I took.  My vision &apos;doubled&apos; and I had to lean against the rail of the bridge to stand upright.  I was convinced that I was about to die.  I carelessly walked close to some other spheres, and they too &apos;vanished&apos; with the &apos;ping&apos; noise, similar to the sound of a musical triangle. The moon was casting considerable light. I happened to look at the sloped, snow-covered bank of the river, which bank was about 40 feet from the top to the edge of the water.  There, imprinted in the snow, was a huge &apos;footprint&apos;.  It appeared to have been melted into the hard snow.  The &apos;footprint&apos; resembled that of a bird; it had three &apos;toes&apos; and one &apos;heel&apos;.  In other words, it was a &apos;Y&apos; shape, with a middle prong between the uprights. For some reason, this sight deeply shocked me.  I finally began to panic, and indeed felt that my death was imminent.  I gave up the attempt to cross the bridge and went back to the shore which I had started from. It was there that I saw, on the hard snow at the side of the road, MANY footprints just like the one described above;  but these were of many sizes,  from small (3&quot;) to large (6&apos;).  They were scattered about, in what seemed to be a random pattern.  One thing did catch my attention; the footprints occured only in pairs. It looked as though some &apos;invisible creatures&apos;, whose feet were hot, had stood around there, in that hard snow.  I could not believe my eyes, so I bent down and ran my finger around inside the footprints. The snow had been melted into hard ice; the footprints were indeed &apos;real&apos;.  Each footprint was literally a depression in the snow, a 3-toed shape, and the snow had been compressed, or melted, to produce these impressions.  The depth of a footprint of about 4&quot; was approximately 1/2&quot;. It occured to me that these &apos;footprints&apos; were made by &apos;something&apos; which had been &apos;hatched&apos; when the silver spheres disappeared as I approached them.  This was totally mind-boggling, to say the least.  The problem was that I was apparently &apos;under attack&apos; by invisible enemies.  I had been sweating, and now I was growing cold, as the heat had diminished when I returned to the end of the bridge.  It seemed to me that the cubes had deployed the spheres, which had deployed the &apos;invisible whatevers&apos;, whose job was to prevent me from crossing the bridge. Strange, beyond words. I can describe this &apos;event&apos; in much detail, but my main concerns are the footprints in the snow.  I had managed to forget most of this, until perhaps 5 years ago, when I read a report that an Alpine mountain guide of impeccable reputation, in Switzerland, had filed a report of an event which had greatly upset him.  He had observed &apos;huge, 3-toed footprints&apos; in the snow of a remote mountain valley.  He stated that the footprints appeard to he those of a &apos;huge invisible bird&apos;.  I have forgotten most of the details, but the similarity to my own &apos;sighting&apos; was too close to miss. I want to know, if you have in your database, any reports of similar cubes, spheres, or 3-toed footprints; especially the footprints.((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident may be approximate, although witness does not indicate that fact.
