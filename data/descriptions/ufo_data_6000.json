It made no sound and it traveled very fast. My brother became scared when I questioned what it was and asked him why wasn&apos;t it making a sound. He then told me for us to get in the house because it knows what we are thinking. When he said this, it dissapeared as if to suddenly go blank. I then fell to the ground and we tried to walk-crawl into the house. We were very scared.I forgot to mention it was only about 200&apos; away from us. We  were very close to the thing.", "Very bright light observed in eastern sky. After watching for several minutes determined it was moving away from us.At approxiametely 07:55 a friend came into my house and told me our buddy was outside looking at a bright light in the sky. I saw him standing on the street in front of my house looking east. When I joined him I saw a very bright object/light which appeared stationary low down in the eastern sky. Only by standing where the roof of a house was visible beside it could we see that it was moving. I ran inside and got my camera, a nikkon 35mm and slowly took 8 pictures using different f stop settings. The last picture should have shown the light just disappearing behind the roof of a neighbors house. When I had the pictures developed later that day there was nothing visible in the sky on any of them. I was using a 200 mm telephoto lens and the light was very bright. I do not know why it did not show up although I am by no means a great photographer. I noticed all the pictures showed a sky which appears overcast when in fact it was not. To the naked eye the object appeared out of round. Through the lens of the camera it appeared tear drop shaped with two points instead of a rounded head and a pointed trailing end. When I turned away after it was out of sight I clearly saw the planet Venus visible about 45% to the right or south of this observation. The sky was clear blue and no stars were visible. My two friends had noticed this light as they left a nearby hockey arena and said they watched it on the drive over to my house.", "I was abducted as a childI was lying in bed when I realized that the bathroom light that was usually on was off.  When I went to get up I couldn&apos;t move.  I tried to scream, but nothing would come out.  I&apos;m not even sure my mouth opened.  Then I realized I was not in bed anymore.  Then, short, pale men with huge eyes(I can most certianally remember the eyes, they were so dark) surounded me.  They acted as if they were examing me.  Then one pressed his finger against my forhead right between my eyebrows.  I then woke up in my bed, as if nothing happend.  But, I then had a scar right where the one touched me.  I didn&apos;t have it before, but I most cerinally had it then, and it still shows.  I&apos;m sorry, I did not see the spaceship.  And I&apos;m not crazy!((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was moving at an increadible speed and at a high altitude.The object we observed on November 16, 1999, at 19:04, was that of a huge fireball-shaped object traveling east, northeast at an amazing rate of travel.  Only 1 (one) object was observed at the date and time noted above.  It was golden in color with bright green and orange showing up at one point during the observation. I have seen a similar object like the one described above in the late winter of 1995 while standing at a bus stop.

The light traveled in a southwest to north east direction across an arc of the sky roughly equal to the apparent distance between the tip of my thumb and the tip of my outstretched forefinger at arms length. The light seemed to follow  a slightly meandering path, though that might have been an optical illusion (I&amp;#8217;ve noticed that the eye is often fooled when trying to follow the path of blinking lights, like a distant airplane, at night. While this light was not blinking, the same effect might have been occurring here.)The light started out bright white and gradually faded to a tiny dull red point before disappearing completely. In total the object was in view for 7-10 seconds. In my opinion it was moving too slow for a typical meteor. It also lacked the characteristic streak of a meteor. This light was a distinct pinprick of light throughout the observation. It actually resembled a satellite, but the fading effect and the apparent erratic course was unlike any satellite I&amp;#8217;ve ever seen. Thinking it was an airplane, I made a conscious effort to discern strobes. There were none.

One particular night a large ball of light appeared over what is now the Arkansas State Police Headquarters.It was stationary and started to follow the automobile we were travelling in,due south on Geyer Springs Road.When the vehicle observers were in stopped for traffic light the UFO stopped too.A Little Rock Police patrol car travelling in the north bound direction stopped for the traffic light too.The officer seemed to be talking on his radio and reporting about the UFO as he was crouching under his windshield.", "They were flying above myself and then,i remembered nothing because of a white flash.i cannot desscribe it very well.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate; was directed to investigators in Australia for corroboration.

This trip took me up the coast into a very unpopulated wilderness area on the island very unexcessable unless by four wheel drive.  In the night I saw what seemed like a falling star, but intstead of burning out it stopped suddenly in mid flight, pausing it shoot in eratic angles several times before disapearing into the night sky.  I was just wondering if there where any air bases in the Corpus Christi, South Texas area that might have experimental aircraft testing. There isno wayconventional aircraft could have made the manuevers I saw.  I was so amazed by the sight, that I yelled out to all the campers with me to look at what I was seeing.  This was on exactly the night of Aug the 12th.  I am curious if anyone else has reported what I saw and if it is conected to the military, it could have been experimental aircraft or a antimissile testing.", "Strange half-moon shaped thing shoots light into room, causes paralysis and other effects.This report is from my first experience - or at least the first one I clearly remember. I had recently turned 5, so the exact date &amp; time are approximations, but I clearly remember the year, and that it was just a few days before Christmas. While asleep in my room that night, I saw a rather bright bluish-white light come in through the window. It was much brighter than the moon would make. I got up out of bed and went to see what it was.  As soon as I went into the beam and looked up, I became paralyzed and unable to move. The object was about 2x to 3x the apparent size of a full moon, and was shaped kind of like a half-moon, but it was tilted at a bizarre angle, and the flat side wasn&apos;t flat at all - it had a scalloped appearance like you&apos;d see on the tops of ancient medieval castle towers. Although it was difficult to judge height &amp; distance because I was so young, I&apos;d guess now that it was hovering about 50&apos; above the ground at a distance a distance of 150&apos; to 300&apos; away.  This would make the object around 20&apos; in length by 15&apos; in height - but these are only rough guesses.  There&apos;s no way to know for certain how long the object was there, but my best guess would put it at about 15 to 30 minutes. Immediately after the sighting, my hearing seemed to become very sensitive. Small objects like pins falling to the floor sounded like pieces of rebar being slammed into concrete; I also remember feeling what I might now call an altered sense of reality. From that point on, I&apos;d start having these strange, almost dream-like periods that would always begin the same: a series of rectangular shapes colored in bright yellows, greens, and blues would appear and rapidly superimpose themselves upon one another in my visual field. After a moment or two, a small area of intense, scintillating green would appear near the center; followed almost immediately by the paralysis, the apparent enhancements in my hearing, and an overwhelming feeling of terror. This &quot;thing&quot; would happen almost every day; usually at night but sometimes while wide awake during the day. It wasn&apos;t until many years later before I learned a way to &quot;control&quot; or &quot;stop&quot; these in their intial stages, and eventually the incidents of them slowed to the point where they only occur very rarely anymore.", "It was very either very large or extremely close to the ground.  It was not moving.  It appeared to have 3 flashing lights spaced equally.  I was driving and it kept being blocked by trees but reappeared several times until it completely disappeared.  I got out of my car to find it but it was gone.I was driving home from work and came to a curve in the road.  As I approached the curve I saw this long object in the air.  At first I thought it was the helicopter for the near-by hospital but then I realized that it wasn&apos;t any helicopter and wasn&apos;t like any kind of plane I have ever heard of.  It was long and had several lights (I think three and I know that the end lights were colored differently)  As I moved I realized that the object was not moving at all.  I on several occasions went by groups of trees that blocked my view but when I got pass them the object was still there.  I came to a corner and turned in the direction of the object to see it better and it was gone. I have to say that this did not look like some kind of alien spacecraft---like I would know (ha!) But it didn&apos;t look like a plane or helicopter either.", "Horizon to horizon cluster of slow-miving, fragmenting fireballs with colorful trailsto be honest, i didn&apos;t look at the time, but it was a few hours before midnight 9/1/99.  i was particibating in an event called burning man, in the black rock desert northeast of gerlach nevada, approx. 80 miles due north of reno. i was out on the playa, talking with a guy named scott at pyro camp (one of  the very remote, outlying camps out on the playa, southeast of the man, near  the train tracks. he was trying to recruit us to help rig the man with  explosives for saturday&apos;s burn.). i was talking to him, facing what i  thought to be westnorthwest, when i noticed what i thought was a firework  above his head. after i lost track of what he was saying and tuned in to  what i was seeing, my jaw dropped open... it was just above the mountains to  the north of black rock city. this &quot;display&quot; was moving in a northwest to  southeast direction (my best guess). what i saw was about 3 lights, eventually becoming 5 to eight chunks of  &quot;stuff&quot;. i didn&apos;t see any actual shapes, just big points of light, but there  was one &quot;main&quot; leading chunk, with the others being various smaller sizes,  trailing behind and slightly off to either side. there seemed to be fewer at  first, and it sort of slowly crumbled into more pieces as it flew across the  sky, some fizzling out, some new ones breaking off from the main chunk.  minus the mountains to the north and south, from horizon to horizon this  event lasted at least 45 seconds, maybe as much as a minute/minute and a  half. the colors i saw (i would consider this very accurate, with me being so far  away from the light of camp, and with well-adjusted night eyes, and the fact  that i used to do color correction for a pre press company) were this: the  chunks were a orangish-white, and each had an orangish glow and a &quot;vapor  trail&quot; that seemed to be a somewhat greenish color closer to the chunks and  turning to a darkish purple towards the tail ends. the trails had a kind of  billowing sheet-like quality to them, slowly expanding, cycling thru the  colors mentioned, then fading out. it seemed that by about halfway through my observation many citizens of BRC  had noticed it too. people were yelling and cheering and clapping and  hollering. i remember myself yelling &quot;take me home&quot; a few times. another feature i remember is a kind of black smoke just behind some of the  chunks. i kept asking myself &quot;is that smoke? how can i be seeing smoke in  the night sky?&quot; the moon was due to rise shortly thereafter, so it may have  been illuminated by the not-yet-seen moon. it sort of looked like the smoke  coming out of old coal trains, only not nearly as thick or opaque. very  subtle. and then it was gone. over the mountains. i never saw a deviation in  directon, or any other lights etc coming to meet it or break away, other  than what i am pretty sure to be a faint shooting star that happened to  cross right through the heart of this thing/things, about 3/4 thru my time  of observation. there did seem to be one chunk that dropped quickly away  from the others at about the same time, but i wouldn&apos;t swear on that. there was no sound whatsoever. this WAS NOT a meteorite. and in my opinion, it was going too slow and  covered too much distance to really be some sort of booster rocket, the more  i think about it. it really had about the same relative speed, if not  slower, as a satellite seen in the sky right after sunset. to me it seemed  to be powered, given the length and distance of my observation. i would  think something such as a booster casing re-entering orbit would die out  much faster, and be coming in at a much sharper angle. this seemed to have a  constant altitude to me, although how high i couldn&apos;t even guess. it seemed  low enough and slow enough to not be really burned by atmospheric friction,  in which case it must have been powered in some way to maintain its  altitude, yet on the other hand, it seemed very high up and thus moving at a  greater speed, but i would think if that were the case, there would be one  of those atmospheric pressure waves or whatever they are called leading it,  like i have seen when the shuttles re-enter orbit. i just remembered one of the theories i head around BRC the next night... a  hacker was bringing down satellites, one by one. if it was man-made, my  guess would be a satellite, not a booster rocket, unless it was one that had  been caught in a semi-stable orbit for some time and was taking it&apos;s own  damn sweet time coming back down. maybe iridium investors doing some  insurance fraud? all in all, it was absolutely amazing. and what fuels my suspicions more  than anything is the fact that i haven&apos;t heard any &quot;official&quot; explanation  anywhere about it. i would think that something so spectacular and witnessed  by so many people would have quite a few news stories or talking heads or  scientists or nasa geeks or SOMEBODY talking about it. c&apos;mon, at least give  us a good cover-up story! and that&apos;s all i have to say. bug - denver, colorado", "I saw a large green fireball like object with a red tail or streak.Driving home on a winding mountain road at night I saw a very bright large green fireball object traveling from east to west streak across the sky leaving a red tail or streak behind. It almost looked as if there were two of them but perhaps it was the same red streak from the fireball I witnessed. It was about the size of 1 1/2 full moons. It was very bright and caught my eye even though I was driving on mountainous roads from Blueridge, Ga. to Dahlonega and then home. I keep a cell phone in my van at all times and it was turned on lying on the passengers seat connected to the AC adapter which emits a light on the phone. At the same time I saw the fireball in the sky my cell phone cut off. I could tell this last fact easily because the light was off. I tried to turn the phone on but could not and it stayed off for about 30 seconds. Then I was able to turn it on. I could not tell if the fireball type object had fallen to earth because I was traveling on a narrow state highway with trees on either side.

I watch it closely while driving but could not get my binoculars on it fast enough.I was driving north across Iowa City at 10:30 AM. The sky was clear. I saw a round white object in the north. It seemed small at first but then hovered and seemed larger and a bit like a giant inflated beer can seen in beach commercials, like a cylinder standing up. I headed north on a One Way street trying to keep it in view and it was moving slowly North or a few degrees east of North as it moved away across the Interstate 80 out into the country. About this time I noticed contrails moving to the west from two jets but they seemed different form the hundreds of commercial jets seen daily. They were close together and were very clear for the distance away. I was trying to get home to get my 10 power binoculars. By the time I got to my back yard the object was to far north to be seen even low on the horizen and I chose not to chase it out into the country. It could have been drifting slowly with prevailing winds but I judge its size to be at least 20 feet high from how big it still appeared after almost 10 minutes of viewing as my car moved north. Also the two planes appeared at about the same heading as the location of the white egg shaped object and I even thought for a while they were two UFOs but then I could make out that they were a sort of jet plane, but perhaps they were UFOs, they seemed different than most jets I see and were moving close to each other although they seemed to be of different size and shape.", "I saw a huge triangular object traveling at a high rate of speed while I was on my way to my evening shift at workWhile en route to work on the evening of October 26th, at approx. seven thirty, I saw coming towards me a very large tiangular shaped object. It was dark out, save for a basically full moon. I could tell its shape by an outline of white lights emanating from its periphory. It was in a relatively remote area, between Roy Wa. and Spanaway Wa. on a stretch of road that traverses the Fort Lewis military reservation. As I was driving, it seemed to come straight towards me, at a very low altitude. My instinct was to pull to the side of the road, almost to get out of its way. Then it turned immediatly to its right (my left), and dissappeared. It was so low, it almost appeared to go into the tall trees that border the road. I have been traveling this route, which is in the immediate traffic area of Mchord air force base, for quite some time, and have seen a lot of different types of aircraft, but this thing was bigger than any jumbo jet. Its travel path was very strange during the short time I saw it. Its turning characteristic seemed very abrupt, very unlike conventional aircraft.

There was no noise made by these crafts.  They were only about 500 feet to my west and hovering about 225&apos; (Northern most one) and 300&apos;. I observed these for aproximately 60 seconds, then started the car and drove around the bend until I was directly North of them.

No engine noise and travelled slowly. Object emitted pale-white light.I am a biomedical scientist and my wife is a business owner. I noticed an egg-shaped object travelling slowly towards Southwest from Carmel Valley. The object was visible from 17:50 to about 17:59 PST (complete darkness) and had an approximate altitude of 1,000 to 1,500 ft above ground and 2 to 3 miles out. The object had two or three strobe-lights. Their apparent location was on top of the object and on the bottom of the object, and one at or near the tail region. The strobes flashed top-bottom--top-bottom--pause-tail-top-bottom ... the tail strob could have come from an object following the first at close distance. The object emitted a pale, white light and appeared to have dark, window-like areas. I was unable to hear any engine sound, which at that distance should rule out any conventional helicopter. It could have been a blimp, but the egg-shape and light emitted from the object would rule that out. I managed to alert my wife who can corroborate my observation and take several digital pictures of the object.((NUFORC Note:  Witness forwarded eight digital photos of object.  They are interesting in appearance, but unambiguous identification of the object is not possible from the photos.  Text of follow-up report included below.))Classification: UNCLASSIFIEDDear Mr. Davenport,thank you for your interest. Here are more details:1. Other witnesses: the ones I know are my wife and our 5 year old daughter.I noticed it when turning into our street while driving home. Given its sizeand the illumination, it should have been noticed by anybody in CarmelValley at that time. My first thought was, why is a coast-guard helicopterhovering over our area, but after a closer look I noticed that the shape wastoo round to be such a helicopter, plus the object was illuminated, whichwould not be the case for helicopters, and also there was no red painting onthe object. The object seemed to radiate a dim light all over the surface,ruling out a search light. My second thought was that it was a blimp, butthe shape was more egg shaped than cylindrical, and again the illuminationradiating from the object would make it unlikely. In addition, it did notappear to have any carriage attached underneath, and window like structureswere on the body, which would not be the case for a blimp. Given theproximity to Miramar, it could have been some experimental aircraft (I didnot see any wings attached). Also, sunset was much earlier, so I do notthink I saw a reflection of the setting sun at a higher altitude in theobject.2. When I first saw the object, it appeared to be stationary, but aftergetting my camera and following it carefully, it seemed to move towardsSouth/Southwest about 1 mm/ min at a meter&apos;s length from my eye. It moved ina straight line and appeared to head towards Miramar. It did not make anyengine noise, which I should have definitely heard if it was a helicopterfrom the distance I was at.3. I was facing SE and the object moved from left to right away from me. Iwill confirm this with a map and send it to you, since I never paid muchattention to the direction our house is facing.4. The apparent size when I first saw it compares to the moon in length and3/4 of the moon in height. When I took the pictures, it was about 1/3 of themoon in size and when it disappeared behind a hill it was about 1/4 of themoon. It was much bigger than any star or planet.5. The pictures were taken by hand - exposure was automatic (probably  inthe range of 2 seconds) the light appeared whitish-gray by eye, but looksmore yellow on the picture. You should have received one set of 8 images(DSCN0080 through 0087), they look pretty bad and you will have to correctfor my movements because I did not have a stand to put the camera on. I didnot have binoculars handy unfortunately.Let me know if you need exposure times for the images.Sincerely,", "I was out with my dogs and watched a red light object moving slowly from so. to so. west and stopping and moving very slow.   It remained motionless in the air for about 5 to 6 min.  Then it just kept coming down as if to meet the ground and at a slow pace then going up and then it kept coming down as if to land.   The light was a red vibrating light not the sort as an airplane would have and not going off and on.   I watched it until I couldn&apos;t see it anymore an it was well below the tree tops and it just seemed to keep on a steady course of coming down.The shape seem to appear round and a red light that was vibrating like from deeper red to pinkish and just kept doing that.   At first I thought it was an airplane but the more I watched it it wasn&apos;t moving like airplanes would move.  It would stop in a area then start up again and moving downward.   Once it started back up and then it just kept coming down as toward the ground.  When I first saw it,  it was due south then it was goin south/west.   It appeared to be slowly falling to the ground,   and there was no noise at all.   You would hear an airplane in the sky if it were,   and the light was very different.  It was almost like a strob light affect.   I watched it until I couldn&apos;t see it any longer then came into the house to contact you.   One other detail I have three Shih Tzu&apos;s and they were just standing next to me the whole time and just smelling the air as if there was something there.

Sphere was bright blue and translucent. Size could not be determined, but smaller than an automobile. I first thought the light my be a reflection in my windshield; I looked back to see if there were such a light and there was not.  I then thought it might be a small meteorite, but because of it&apos;s translucence and because I have witnessed several of these in my lifetime, I knew that it was not.  Further, it&apos;s trajectory was not consistent with all the other meteorites I had seen previously. Lastly, I can also state that the weather was such that I knew it was not ball lightning. The object travelled very slowly and as it started to descend over and into the city of Newport, the light simply blinked out--it was definitely the strangest thing I&apos;ve ever seen.  It was definitely NOT a &quot;alien aircraft&quot;, but rather I believe some sort of atmospheric event that has yet to be explained.  I would compare it to the same sort of events that appear to precipitate seismic activity on the West Coast.  Of course, I can testify that Cincinnati doesn&apos;t have quite the same seismic activity as Los Angeles.  I was alone, so nobody can verify my claim.

I was looking west about forty five degrees above the horizon, I was trying to identify some constellations for my astronomy project notebook.  I looked down at my star chart for a minute and then looked back up.  It was then that I saw the objects, I noticed them because they were moving across my field of vision right to left.  At first I thought it was a plane going really fast but there were no aircraft warning lights on them at all. What I saw was three spheres&apos; all aligned vertically.  They were not bright at all, they seemed to be a dull gray with a haze around them. The objects were not bright like a star or meteor.  Once I realized they were not planes or a meteor I felt uneasy, I have never seen anything like them.  The three objects flew perfectly in a striaght line.  I ruled out a meteor because of the dull light and they flew straight.  The objects changed course almost vertical and disappeared, that is what freaked me out, they went straight up.  There is no way that was a meteor, military plane or weather balloon, I have never seen anything do that before.", "noticed a large triangle type craft hovering over a shopping center parking lot near some apartments in the early mourning hours in little rock, arkansas.it was just past midnight, we where running out to taco bell because they are they only thing open that late.  we where heading down west markham just east of shakelford, my goelfriend glenda was driving. as we where heading west i noticed what i thought was aircraft landing lights. you know how when a plane aproches straight at you they look like headlights in the sky, anyway as we continued to drive it seemed these lights where stationary, again i figured this was a plane coming in and it must be coming straight at us giving the illusion of not moving.  what bothered me was the lights seemed so low and bright.  right after you cross shaklelford approximatly 1/4 mile there is a small shopping center, service merchandise, office depot, and the like. well as we got to the beginning of the parking lot i realize these lights are just hanging there in the sky.  a yell at glenda to slow down so i can see and she does just a little.  now its a little hard to discribe the scene but let me try, just behind this center there is a large hill with apartments built above it, these are aprox 4 or 5 story units.  as we are driving by i realize this thing does not have 2 lights but three white lights, one on each corner and a red &quot;pulsing&quot; light in the center.  it just hung there making absolutly no sound.  it was real huge,  probably 150, 200 feet in the air, it seemed to take up a big section of the parking lot.  glenda refused to stop, first of all she does not believe in ufos at all and did not even want to look at it. as we continued down west markham to bowman it just sat there.  we then turned south on bowman and it was still there.  as we went south i believe i saw it rise then lost it.  when we headed back that direction to home (1/2 hour later) there was no sign of it. i never heard any reports on the news and i was suprised know one else saw it so i just forgot about it.  i listen to jeff rense regularly and after hearing you again i decided to report it to you.  this is not the only sighting i have ever h! ad but i never knew who to tell about them. every time i have talked about these things my &quot;friends&quot; think i am nuts.  thanks for listening", "My daughter and grandson came to my house at a little after 7.

There were 8-10 faint star-like objects around 3-4 magnitude moving in a tight formation across the sky. They were in a V or boomerrang like formation 20,000 Ft. + high traveling from West to East very quickly across the sky.  There was no deviation from their course, just straight line movement.  The total time of observance was only 10 seconds max.  It almost seemed that the background of the formation was distorted in a way.  I immediately ran back in to tell my friend of the sighting, and he had told me that I was clearly shaken up by the ordeal.", "It was from a high flat window, several miles away high, really high up in the sky. I was scepticle as the object never moved, I could see all the stars but this was way brighter than any star.

The red glow disappeared from around the white blinking light.  It continued blinking and was again surrounded by the red ball of light.  I saw the red light 4 times before I lost view of it.

I always look up because jets fly out of Seattle-Tacoma Intntl Airport right over the farm. This jet was making the typical 747 rumble in the sky so I looked up. It was heading SE. suddenly I noticed the a bright object was flying high in the sky to the left of the 747. The object flew over the top of the 747. The object was much higher then the 747 which I figure at 4-5 thousand feet. This object was at least 20 thousand feet or higher. The object left on contrail but other jets in the sky at high altitude were. The object was heading toward the sun so I soon lost sight of it. One other thing, as it flew forward it looked like the object &quot;skipping&quot; left and right of a straight line. The shape of the object was elongated arrow shaped.

I am a truck driver and was returning from a run and was near Moorehead KY when I observed what appeared to be a bright star at first glance.  However, being fairly familiar with the stars I knew this wasnt one.  This object appeared in the ENE sky at about the 1:00 position on the horizon.  It started as very bright, and then dimmed until it had disappeared, and continued on this cycle for about 3 minutes.  At the dimmest, it was not visable, however at the brightest, it appeared to be a greenish color, almost neon bright.  Then the object moved across the horizon to the WNW horizon, leaving a tail such as a comet would, then stopping and proceeded to repeat the cycle of dim to bright.  After about 3 minutes at this position, it returned to its origional position, repeated the cycle, then disappeared.  I can not say for sure this was a ufo, or what it was, however I do beleive I know what it was not.  I am sure it was not a star or any visable planet, and I am reasonably sure this was no military aircraft.  Anyway, I thought you may want to check this out.

Within our atmosphere. Not a star. It did not move or change shape and was too high to be a helicopter, plus it had no flashing lights on it at all. It was just a very bright light shinning in the sky.My friend and I were on our way home from a friends house last night when I noticed this light. At first I thought it was just a star but noticed that it was much brighter and closer than a star. We watched it as we were driving in hopes of seeing it move or show indication of being a known aircraft ( flashing lights, movement etc.) but to no avail. As we continued to watch it we began to realize that it seemed to be to high up to be a helicopter but could possibly be a plane. But then again there was no movement or flashing lights. It looked like a star was sitting inside the earths atmosphere.

This noise was heard for a period of approx 2 minutes, at two times, approx 15-20 minutes apart.  I expected this noise to proceed over my house as a plane would, or die down as the plane left the area, however the noise droned on at the same level for 2+ minutes then abruptly ended.  This noise vibrated my house, upset the dog, and there were dogs&#x5C;coyotes howling in the woods during this incident.  My daugher claimed to see a flash of light accross the western sky after the first incident.I heard an engine sound, that sounded like an aircraft engine.  WE frequently have the Air National Guard flying over our house so I didn&apos;t take much notice.  Our house began to vibrate slightly and the dog began to bark and I noticed that the sound was not proceeding over the house as a plane would.  I went outside and listened to the engine sound and waited for the &quot;plane&quot; to pass over the house, or for the sound to die down as they flew away.  The sound continued to drone on for approx 2 minutes, there were coyotes howling in the woods behind my house in the direction of the sound. Due North. The sound abuptly stopped.  I went inside and my daughter came down stairs.  She to had heard the sound and after it stopped she claims to have seen a flash of light accross the Western Sky. I questioned her about the flash, thinking it could be the flash of the sunset.  She said it was very sharp and bright.  Approx 15-20 minutes later we again heard the same engine noise in the wood North of my house.  Again it lasted for approx 2 minutes and then abruptly stopped.  Due North of my home is approx 4 acres of woods and then a seclued farm field.  We did not see any craft or ship of any kind.  The only sighting was the flash. It was after dark at the time, and I can&apos;t think of what could have been in the woods at that time of night making that kind of sound.  It was louder then a chain saw, or tractor.  It made my house vibrate. The best decription of the sound would be that of a aircraft engine.", "I saw what I at first thought was a Vandenburg launch to the west. Instead a vapor trail, orange in color, rose in the sky and leveled out heading east. The trail remained the same size, when it was overhead I saw that there was a round object at the head and noticeably separated from the trail. I photogaphed it with my digital work camera (I am a newspaper photographer). It was probably a jet or something like that, but so unusual looking. I can send an image if you would like to see it. My brother thinks its a jet.  .When I left work around 10 miutes to five today, November 11, 1999. I noticed a trail in the sky to the west, in the directon that we usually see the Vandenburg launches, and that was what I thought it was. It was still light out, but getting dark. The vapor trail seemed to rise but never got any longer. It headed toward me, to the east. The color was orange. I thought well maybe I should photograph this, so I  my camera out of the truck and took some pictures as it came toward me, as it became level with me I could see from the ground with just my eyes that here was a round object ahead of the vapor trail, and separated from by a distance about the same sizes the round object. The trail and object looked at arms length to be about 4-5 inches long. The picture clearly shows the gap. Does a jet plane have a gap behind it and the trail? If so I guess it could be a jet, the color  the trail, very distinct. Could it be caused by the sun angle, sun was below the horizon I think. Anyway, color was unusual and certainly round shape unusual. Would the roundness be another bit of work by the sun angle?

It all happened quickly but my first view was three egg shaped lights moving together in the shape of a triangle.  I thought well It must be military jets in formation or somthing.  i thought that because they were at a very fast speed.  I didnt realize they were seperate until the two back end lights of the triangle seperated for about 2 seconds.  then I was tripping out.  Then it seemed to go up higher into the sky until it became small and we could not see it anymore.  My boyfriend and I looked at eachother and he pointed out two regular airplanes flying above us.  &quot; see, those are planes, those are flying much slower.

It appeared that it turned over on its side and we saw four small lights in the shape of a square with a faint circle joining all the lights.

I tried to see if I could get it to come closer by signaling with a flashlight. Maybe I was being foolish, but if it wasn&quot;t from here I really wanted make contact. Am I nuts or is this normal? Please contact meOn the night of June 6, 1987. I was about three miles outside of the Jackson Lake Lodge resort area, where I had worked. There were four of us hanging out at a foot bridge having a few beers and counting stars, when we saw what we thought was someone walking down a trail with a very bright flashlight. It was swaying back and forth and kind of bobbing up and down. Sort of like a flashlight would if someone was walking with one. I then noticed that the shadow of the tree-line was below the light. I told everyone to watch it and to confirm that I was correct about the light being above the trees. It was very quiet that night. Around there you can hear a car from over five miles away. There was no sound coming from whatever it was we were watching. The more we watched the more we realized that this object looked like a star. I flashed my flash-light at the light hoping (out loud) that I would get a response. I did not get one, I wish I had. I was becoming excited, because it was thrilling to see. The two college age women who were with us became scared, and wanted to go back to the workers dorms. When we returned to the dorms, the light was still in the sky. I pointed it out to two Park rangers and a security officer. I asked them what the saw, and they said a star. I told them to watch it for a while. The security officer and Rangers pretty much &quot;freaked&quot; than almost simultaneously announced that it was moving. It was about that time that the two young women came back with a couple of the wranglers to show them the light. Other employees from the Lodge  statred to come over to us to see what it was we were looking at. some lodgers came up to the Rangers to ask what the light was. A small crowd had gathered and we all watched the light together until a little after midnight. It was about that time that the light steadied and started moving in a north-eastern direction and began to dim. We watched until the light began to move only slightly ( or so it seemed) faster and finally blende in with the numerous ! others s tars in that wonderful night sky.", "Me and family were driving home from town...it was just before dusk and we spotted a large bright light sitting in the west sky.

When the craft would vanish I could see a faint rippling of the stars where the craft should have been. They were moving at about 45 miles per hour. They had no lights on them. Didnt see a rotating beaken. No strobes. As far As I know thats against FAA regulations. The stealth aircraft cant fly at 45 miles per hour.

It rapidly moved east as could see it for sometime. I could see it glwoing as it went through a small cloud cover and I could then see it going straight upwards.

The object had no appendages except for a slight dome on top which appeared which less reflective or more translucent than the rest of the craft. Having flown and soloed in aircraft ( but never completed enough hours for a private rating ) before, I would estimate its altitude as somewhere around 5,000 feet, its airspeed between 100-125 knots, and its distance from me possibly 3-5 miles.

It was to the north of us and heading from west to east. At first I thought it was an airplane crashing to the ground.  I was waiting for an explosion.  It never came.  It disappeared beyond the horizon.  Later that night, we heard on the radio that many people had seen it in this area.  From Missouri to Illinois.  I&apos;ve seen meteors and this was no meteor.

It was seen for approximately 30 seconds.  It moved from a east northeast position in the sky to a position nearly overhead,  at which time we lost visual contact.  We waited for the object to reappear in the southern sky, after it was blocked from view from the roof of the car, but it never reappeared.  The object was approximately 8-10 feet in diameter, object was approximately a half mile away when first seen and at about 1000 ft.

I play in a rockband who had recently been playing a few gigs in Hollywood. On the Morning of 5th October 1999 we left LAX on the Delta airlines flight to Atlanta at apprx 12.00 midday. We had been in the air about 3 hours and with their being some room by the window, myself and our Drummer went to sit at the window. It was a very good clear day and we could see the ground,( don&apos;t know where abouts we were though ) all of a sudden I saw a disk  moving very fast accross the horizon. I KNOW it was not a plane as it had no tail fin. I proded Marek, the Drummer, who looked out. His response was &quot; what the hell is that&quot;. I know that a few other people must have seen it, however no one really seemed bothered. It really spooked me that it was so close to the aircraft I was in. I didn&apos;t think much about it, until I got home to England. I really want to know what it was. All I know is that it was NOT a plane.

As I usually tend to do, I looked up toward the east to see how clear the sky was, and my attention was immediately drawn to an arc of 12-14 extremely dim orange lights coming from the north, almost directly over my head.  They glided silently toward the south, making a slight turn toward the southeast and then faded and vanished as they turned.  The whole thing lasted about 4 seconds.  I can&apos;t make an estimate of the altitude, but from one end to the other, the arc was about the width of my fist at arm&apos;s length.  It appeared to be fairly low in the sky.  It was the smoothest motion that I&apos;ve ever seen anything move with, and seemed very surreal.  What struck me as odd was that the lights were so dim that they were barely visible in the dark sky.  I tried to discern whether they were individual lights flying in a formation, or if they were all on one object, but it swept by so quickly, I couldn&apos;t tell if the stars were blocked from view as it passed over.  There was positively no sound.

After I got off the Phone with Peter I went back outside and looked for them agian and they were still thier but further west in the sky and had changed their pattern agian! This time the pattern was more of an arrow shape and around the &quot;tip&quot; Or &quot;point&quot; of the shape the faint smaller lights were still there too. I remembered I had some binoculars and I got them and went back and looked at them agian! They are still there and in a different pattern. With the binoculars I could see the shapes better but not well enough to describe in detail. But, They are white lights, round white lights.

I know what I saw and it was not a star, nor was it one of the planes as this object was totaly setting there and not moving other then a small rocking motion.

Object appeared to be a ball of light that divided with a dark line (like a hamburger) and at one point appeared to turn on edgewhere three white lights in a triangle pattern were visible.  After observing for several minutes, a digital camcorder was employed to capture the phenomena.  At about the time the camera was set up three more objects joined the first.  The newcomers were slightly smaller appearing and at times faded to deep red or blinked out completely.  At one point, the objects appeared to &quot;shoot&quot; white lights between each other that traveled at high speed from one to another.  The light show went on for at least 45 minutes and 22 minutes of it are on tape.  It is noteworthy that the camera turned off several times when pointed in the direction of the lights (CCD overload shutdown??) even though the lights did not appear to be of extreme intensity.", "Triangular shaped, green lights, seen when investigating why dog was whining.

I walked out on back porch and sat down on the top step.As I was petting the dog, I looked due south and observed three green lights that formed a triangle. The triangle was about 150 ft. away and about 10 ft. off the ground. The object appeared to be about 10 ft. wide. The center of the triangle was bright but translucent. As I stared at it the lights moved towards me and simply disappeared in a blur. The lights made no sound whatsoever. Our dog could not wait to get inside the house. At approximately 00:05 hours I sat down at the computer to play solitare and the next thing I remembered was looking at my watch and seeing it was 01:45 hours. I was extremely tired and could not remember anything from the time I sat down. After calling my boyfriend who was at work, I went to go to bed and discovered that my feet were very dirty.

It had one continuous light, none blinking,; it din&apos;t follow the usual flight path of the usual plane and it seemed to fly very close and between other planes flying by.

Last night at 6:04 to 6:05 PM, my husband was laying on our couch after dinner he was looking out our east facing window he started yelling, &quot;Look, look, the biggest meteor I&apos;ve ever seen is outside, Hurry! Hurry!&quot; Everyone ran to the front yard where we all (8 people) saw a large light almost as large as my outstretched fist, It was yellow but quickly turned the most brilliant neon green, it had a massive vapor trail behind it.  It was traveling Northeast.  Based on how long it took my husband to call us out and adding the time we watched it it probably glowed for 30 seconds.  As it left our line of sight it seemed to be breaking up small yellow colored sparks seemed to be lagging behind and then fading in brightness until I could no longer see them. Now, we live in Paddock Lake, Wisconsin.  If you check a map that is at the bottom of Wisconsin nearly in Illinois and about 15 miles straight west of Lake Michigan, outside of Kenosha.  I called a friend in Missouri to talk to them about it and the man there had seen the event also a glowing orange turning to yellow headed Northeast and he had enough time to stop his car and point it out to his kids.  He stopped his car thinking it might be something about to crash into the ground and he wanted to get a bearing on where it was headed.  He lives in Cabool, Missouri which is in the middle of nowhere. It couldn&apos;t have taken this object more than a minute to travel 650 miles.  He knows it was about 6PM when he sighted it and they may even make a report today themselves.  That&apos;s all I know.  I have seen LOTS of meteors but honestly none have looked like this.

No bridge over us and we could hear no engine sound other than the truck engine even with the truck windows open. the windows were bright but opaque. The object flew over us at 10-15 miles an hour in a straight line.

It was probably a large meteor or fireball as it is termed.  About five minutes later I heard a large booming sound which I suppose could have been the meteor hitting the ground", "While driving home with family,  heading south on 25th St.  Saw a cigar shaped craft, with lights flying low, slow and heading east towards NJ.  I couldn&apos;t believe my eyes.  My wife wanted me to follow it.  but traffic was too slow.  Somebody else should have seen it .  My children were the other witnesses.The object was cigar shaped with 4 -5 white lights  on each side of its  length. I would estimate the length at 50 -60 ft  and its width maybe  about 15 ft.  It appeared to be low in the sky maybe 400 - 500 ft. in altitude.  It was traveling  from west to east as I was driving south on 25th Street.   I could not distinguish a color as it was dark out  at  approx.  19:30 .

There wasn&apos;t a sound accompanying this objects travel, though seemed to be very close as it moved overhead. At first I thought it was a shooting star but it was moving slower and was much larger than any  falling star or meteor.  It also moved accros the night sky not plummeting downward.

I was driving roughly in the same direction as the object when I spotted it overhead and in front of me. On my returning home minutes later, we were surprised the we&apos;d seen the same weird thing. One more point of interest, on Saturday the 2nd, we had three sonic booms and the sound of more than one aircraft after each boom.", "A large fireball type object appeared to be falling from the sky. As we watched the fireball began tilting upward instead of falling and then did a circle and flew towards the southwest.My parents, and my son and I were driving down Bardstown Rd. heading from our small city of Mt. Washington into the city of Louisville which we are about 10 miles or so south of. We were headed northeast on Bardstown Rd. and my son said look a plane is falling. I looked out the window and immediately got excited because I&apos;ve never seen any type of plane that would be that distance in the sky above appear that large. We are in an airpath that routinely has airplanes fly over our house night and day. We&apos;ve lived in this same house for 23+ years so I know what the normal planes look like in this area. This looked like a big fireball falling from the sky. It was a color of light orange and had like a ripply haze around it. Whethere this haze was the effect of the setting sun or not I can&apos;t be sure. My mother said it looked to her like something out of the movie Armageddon. This fireball was going in a course straight down. My father argued it was just a plane going over the horizon but he could get a proper look at it since he was driving the vehicle. My mother, my son and I continued to watch this fireball spellbound. I can&apos;t say for certain the exact height this fireball was in the sky but I know it appeared to be above where the planes usually fly. If I strectched my arm out the fireball would have been at least the size of my fist. If it was any smaller than that it wouldn&apos;t be by much. Now as I said my father argued it was an aircraft going over the horizon. Keep in mind that it was still daylight here as we were watching this fireball in the sky. The sun was starting to settle in the horizon and the sky was still pretty light. It got dark maybe a half hour or so later. Now as my mother, son and I were watching this fireball go down, i noticed a shift as did both of them. The fireball changed from a falling pattern, went up about a 90 degree angle then it completed a loop and moved off in a southwestern position. We were floored. This fireball was clearing falling straight down and then did what was a! basic l oop and headed a new direction. There were no planes in the area at all either that we could see. Just this lone fireball trailing it&apos;s tail. It was about that time that we went up a hill on Bardstown Rd and around a curve and could no longer see the fireball in the sky. Later this night after we returned back to our home I watched our 11pm news on Channel 11 broadcast from Louisville Ky and found that the story had made the nightly news. They of course reported that it was either a meteor(which there is no way.this thing was way too large) or that it was falling space debree. Since I&apos;ve never seen space debree fall I&apos;ve no idea but space debree doesn&apos;t do loops in midair to any of my knowledge. Also on this newscast on Channel 11 they had a State Trooper from Seymour, Indian on there. He actually got this object on video tape except it was darker when he taped it as he said it was 7:00 PM or so and you can see different colored lights in the fireballs tail. He also said on the news as I told you that he&apos;d never seen anything like it. If I can help with anymore info please contact me. I&apos;m also a commercial artist so if a sketch of this thing and the loop it did would help you let me know and I&apos;ll do one and email it out to you.", "Low slow silent over houses,hand glider shaped, 1.5 x as big, 5&apos; thick, round edges,dirty yellow,lit from inside like candle thru wax paper. flying parallelFrom the north I saw a light over the tip neighbors house about a mile  out.

The lights were bright at the leading edge and decreased in intensity as they went toward the rear, with the midsection being totally dark. The sky was perfectly clear.

This area has no streets lights of any kind and there is farmland in the valley between the two ridge tops. On my left there was a break in the ridge, and a light (almost moon size) was hovering stationary to the left of the break. I rolled down the window and stopped the car on the road. There was no audible sound coming from the light. Shortly thereafter, a car was coming up behind me so I proceeded forward. The light moved at a very quick speed horizontally to the right (about 15-20 degrees). I lost sight of it after that due to trees obstructing my view. The total event time of the sight of the light was about 1 minute. The only other sighting I have had was in 1976(?).

I at first thought it was the same plane that made it doubling back along it&apos;s own contrail, but the shape of the craft was so radically different than anything I had ever seen, I was amazed. Then the strange craft made a high speed right angled turn followed almost instanly by another, and then disappeared completely in the clear blue sky right next to the contrail! 5 or 10 minutes later, a nieghbor boy [about 14 or 15] stopped by, and I excitedly started telling him about what my wife and I had just seen.  The lingering contrail was still there, as I pointed out to him where we had just seen the strange craft, and he looked and said &quot;I see them!&quot;  I replied &quot;Them? Whadda ya mean,*Them*?  He said &quot;Now there is like 3 or 4 of them.&quot;  I quickly stepped over to where he was and low and behold, I saw 4 metallic spheres, in the same area where I had seen the single angular craft just minutes earlier, even as we watched, the spheres covorted lower and closer to us, and then the young man said look, there are more over there!  Off to the right we spotted several more spheres, and within a minute or so the entire area to the east and south east of us was literally filled with the spheres. I was, with great difficulty able to count 12 but there could have been a few more, as they were each moving independantly this way and that. During this time, a small conventional aircraft came into site and we were able to compare the airplane&apos;s look and sound with the spheres which were heigher and completely silent.  A little later a sea gull flow under the strange spheres and we could compare the gull with the spheres.  I estimate the spheres came as low as about 1,000 feet, and perhaps 500 to 600 feet from being directly overhead.  Some were heigher and some where lower and when one would &quot;wink out&quot; it was as if someone flipped off a switch.  They would disappear instantly and reappear [or not] in a different location. About two years earlier I had seen in broad daylight a single metallic like sphere in this same location, and this one appeared to be about 100 feet off the ground at about 150 yards and appeared at this distance to be about the size of a volkswagen bug.

I heard all of the hullabaloo on WLW AM 700 in Cincinnati and later on the Art Bell show on AM 1100 from Cleveland and I was kind of surprised. Yes the object was large and it headed in the opposite direction of where you would expect a leonid meteor to come from, but it didn&apos;t exhibit any non-ballistic or unexplainable motion.

The main body was bright white and had a trail behind it with varied colors of blue, red, and yellow. The trail also had 2 or 3 additional white lights in it which appeared to be more objects rather than part of the trail. The trail looked more like burning particles or embers rather than a fire trail. The trail was very long about 10 times the length of the main body.

It did not stop abruptly, but slowed first. The light then just slowly faded out, getting smaller and smaller until it was no longer visible (this took about 3 to 4 seconds).

The top of this craft was white and the bottom a rust color. It had no markings and it was very big. It looked like a cylinder or a cigar. The front and back had rounded corners or edges. The sky was cloudless except for the chemtrails which were spreading into a cloudbank. I have seen many objects or craft before but this one was a surprize right in the middle of the day.

One evening, my brothers, stepbrothers and stepsister had all gone out to play in the cul-de-sac after dinner.  It was evening and the sun was beginning to get low in the sky.  While playing, I do not remember who, someone noticed a large red triangular object in the sky.  I remember that the altitude of the object did not seem to be very high because I noticed that the object had 3 inverted &quot;V&apos;s&quot; on what appeared to be a flat bottomed triangular shaped object.

The object then reappeared again, coming back from the direction it had disappeared, it again flew directly overhead, never making any sound, disappearing into the horizon from which it had originally come from.

As I observed the plane and the contrail with my binoculars I noticed a small light above the contrail which looked like a large star. It was still daylight and too light outside for it to have been a star. I continued observing this light from my car looking overhead slightly to the south. It suddenly disappeared.

It sounded like our transmission fell out of our car and landed few cm from our current location.  A blinding flash filled our soon to be bewildered company and vehicle.  Our car stopped almost immediately. As soon as our car stopped, now illuminated, these beings emerged and appeared to surround our stationary vehicle.  The description of these beings is as follows: 6 feet tall, with a triangular shaped head, and  strange tenticles, not long, on their chin.  They spoke in a somewhat bubbly English voice.  They opened up the door, even though we locked them.  We, at this time, were in a state of complete bewildered and terror, a real revolting witches brew of strange emotions.  We were numb all over except our eyes and ears.  The beings drew some blood from our arms and legs with wierd needle-like precision instruments.

As it passed at almost a due north position it began to to drop bright yellow spheres of what appeared to be debris from the mainbody.  The colors and brightness were like nothing I have ever seen. It continued on a trajectory parallel with the surface and went out of sight.  Absolutely the most outstanding light show that I have ever witnessed.  My impression was that it was space debris because of the trajectory and the speed which again was unusually slow for a meteor.

Was on the phone to my husband at the time and explained what I was seeing.Only one craft of a medium to light grey color.  As it glided to the south east I lost site of it because it then blended into the night sky.  It flew in a straight line, no noise, and no lights on it.  My husband told me to explain to him how large it was in proportion to the Moon.  The Moon at the time was half full, I invisioned it to be full, and told him the span of the wings were twice the span of the Moon.

We watched it travel from the eastern edge of the Sierra Nevada mountians over the crest and beyond to the west, then it seemed to drastically change direction, dropping below the horizon, which for us wast the sierra crest.  All this took place in about 10 seconds, Approximatly 40 miles.  The craft traveled at an altitude of about 20-25 thousand feet above sea level, estimating, and accounting for our 11 thousand foot camp.  It appearead as rectangluar from our perspective, we had a somewhat side view of it, for it traveled to our north by a few miles.  It pulsed with light originating from it&apos;s core.  It also appeared to have a glowing distrotion field around it, the atmosphere around it appeared to be bent like a teardrop around it, bending light and glowing as well, a blue/greenish hue.  It made no sound, not even a sonic boom, which I would expect from something traveling at such a high rate of speed.

Approximately 10 or 20 miles away, the object appeared to be anywhere from 1,000 to 10,000 feet in altitude. And at the same time as the appearance of the sphere was the beam of light shooting down from it at an angle. Very bright, far brighter than any light I have ever seen, for a moment I thought heaven was opening up and peeking down at us. The strong beam was pointed directly onto a glowing red, twisted, tornado-like cloud. The sphere, glowing cloud, and white beam were all stationary for five minutes. As the sphere and beam appeared out of nowhere, so did the glowing red twisty, tornado-like cloud, which appeared to touch the ground as a tornado would, but was totally stationary. However, the &quot;tornado&quot; did not have a cloud above it, as it just dissipated into the sky, about 1/4 the heighth of the sphere.

Usually between 2:00 and 6:00 a.m. in only selected areas we frequently travel. The areas are remote wooded and recently logged areas on the west side of the mountain. About 2 months ago we had my husbands mother babysit our son.We were in the woods and called her to say we would be home in 30 minutes,at about 10 p.m. on our way out of the woods we saw the same orange light but was closer than normal, we got out of the truck to watch it in the distance moving about for what we thought was about 2 minutes.The light disappeared and we got back in the truck and headed home.When we got on the highway my husband asked what time it was and it was after 12:00.At 11:00 my mother in law called my sister in law to ask if she had seen or heard from us,and she hadn&apos;t she then called our cell phone and could not get through.We arrived at my mother in laws house at 12:30 and could not account for the lost time.Last night My mother in law was watching our son for the night we went spot-lighting bucks in the cut timber ridges where my husband has been hunting.On the way in we noticed that the wildlife behavior was very odd,they paided us no attention at all.We have been doing this in this same area for years and have never seen this behavior before such as:an owl sitting in the road and not moving when we approached it in the truck we stopped beside it and it flew into the side of the truck.Very exsessive amounts of small game like skunks,rabbits,coons,opposum,and rodents all traveling in the same direction out of the cut timber.At the same time about 3:30 a.m. we observed a female deer acting very strange as we passed by she came to the truck and looking behind her into the clear cut acting confused,we assumed a buck was pushing her towards the road so we shinned the hard wood hollow looking for the buck,not seeing him we eased down the road to give him a few minutes to come into the clear cut. We drove up the road and turned around to come back to find she was the only doe we saw which is not usual for we usually see 15-30 does a night.She was in the same spot still confused, we shined behind her! for the buck to find nothing on the first pass of the spotlight,upon the second pass of the spotlight we saw a red-eyed deer.We have never observed a red-eyed deer most deer eyes reflect green.When the hit the red-eyed deer he moved swiftly over the ridge and out of site.We waited a few more minutes to see if he would return to the doe.Afer about 5 minutes we he did not return so we down an adjacent road to see if he had circled the ridge.When shinning the back side of the same ridge on the first couple of passes of the spotlight we saw nothing driving slowly while still shinning the spotlight we spotted the red-eyed deer.My husband looked through the scope of the gun to see if it was a buck.It was about 200yds. off the road it was very hard to locate the deer in the cut timber.When my husband got a good look at it,it had a enormously massive rack not usually found in this region.He got out of the truck and fired one shot at the deer and I saw another red-eyed deer to the left of the first.He shot the red-eyed buck it dropped to the ground. He looked at the one on the left through his scope and it was also a massive buck. He shot at it also and it too dropped to the ground but was trying to get up so he fired a second shot then it was also lifeless.We sat in the truck for 45 minutes because my husband felt somthing wasn&apos;t right we shinned the spotlight on the deer 3 different times to see if the deer were still laying there.My husband still could not concieve the idea of the two abnormally large deer.After the third time checking they were still there,we decided to turn the truck around we came back to retrieve the bucks.We were about to get out of the truck, when my husband turned to get his gun and out of the back window he saw the same mysterious orange light in a distance moving very rapidly in figure eights and looping in the sky.My husband said there&apos;s your light.I turned to see the light moving while he cranked the truck because of unusual movement of the light.Scarred to death he floored the truck while! I watch ed the light,half way to the road it started coming towards us very rapidly.I screamed go It&apos;s coming after us.My husband driving as fast as possible while I was still looking at it coming My husband let out an ungodly scream and bowed out of the seat he felt an electrical serge in his back and was screaming everything was black and white.A few feet from the road I turned to see that the light had stopped where he had shot the red-eyed bucks.We keept going towards the main highway as fast as we could and scarred to death.As I looked to the left once we were on the highway the light  had followed us, traveling 100ft. above tree level never leaving our side approximatly a mile away. Panicing trying to get away from it we were going about 90mph.But even through the curves it never left our side for about 5 miles.About 3/4 of a mile before approaching a steep ridge the highway went over, it started angling towards us appearing to intercept us at the base of the ridge.Pushing the truck as fast as it would go,screaming and crying more terrified than we have ever been. At the base of the ridge it was directly above us we felt enormous static electricity we heard a loud bang on the truck like someone had thrown a baseball at it.My husband screamed radio the police as I turned the police issued radio which will radio to Sequathcie, Grundy, Marion, and Bledsoe Counties as I keyed it made a popping sound and went dead.  At the same time the electrical systems in the truck began to fail.  The truck headlights, interior lights, gages, electric fuel pump, and engine began to fail which caused the truck to start missing.  I saw the windshield wipers beating on the windshield and there was a bright glowing light inside the truck.  Suddenly a calmness fell over us and I held both of my husband&apos;s hands as we starred at each other confused and terrified at the same time the truck felt as though it was being levitated less than a foot off the road at the same instance my husband grabbed the steering wheel as the truck was s! till mis sing we were coming out of the light now much slower than what we entered about a 1/4 of a mile back.  As soon as we left the light the truck began to function normally again.  Still terrifed and panicking we drove about 3/4 of a mile as fast as the truck would go to our friend&apos;s house for help.  As we turned into our friend&apos;s road I looked back and and saw that the light had dissappered.  As we skidded into our friend&apos;s driveway we jumped out of the truck and ran to the front door.  As my husband was beating on the door he noticed that all the lights were on, all the vehicles were there and that his Friend&apos;s two house dogs did not come to the door barking like they always have.  Terrified he beat on the door harder and began to scream to be let in.  Panicking he reached to where his friend always kept his spare house key and it wasn&apos;t there.  He tried the door knob and it was unlocked.  He ran into there house screaming his friend&apos;s name and yelling for help.  Although four adults and two loud house dogs live in the house there was total silence.  He ran to his truck and grabbed the cell phone and tried to call his frien&apos;s number hoping he would answer but it would not go through.  Immediatly he called his sister&apos;s home for her to pick us up because we were extremly disoriented.  His sister answered and he began to scream hurry come out here and get us out of here theyr&apos;e after us.  the phone kept cutting in and out but he finally got her to understand where he was at.  His sister and her roommate called us back from her roommate&apos;s cell phone as they were franticly coming up the mountain not knowing what was going on they had called back to let us know they were coming as fast as they could and trying to find out what was going on, but when he tried to warn them to watch out for the orange light the phone died.  He tried calling back several times but it would not go through.  About six minutes after he had called them they slid into the yard expecting the worst.  We ran screaming and jumped into the ba! ck seat of his sister&apos;s car.  She could tell how mortfied we were and immeditly back out of the yard and hauled ass back towards the highway to take us home.  We were so shook up that we were babbling and could not get them to understand what had happened.  As we pulled onto the highway my husband yelled &quot;There it is!!!!&quot; as he pointed at the bright light in the sky that was now white. His sister and her roommate(who is an EMT) both saw the light following the car a great distance up in the sky.  His sister who had heard us talking about the orange lights before knew immedialy what had happened to us.  She began to drive over 100 mph to get to the only convience store that was open at this hour approxmalty 4:45 a.m.  We pulled into the parking lot and parked in front of the doors.  We sat there for about 20 minutes trying to explain what had happened the whole time all four of us were watching the light that followed us.  It moved side to side, up and down, and it would fluctuate between bright and dim, always returning to bright.  then we decided to go to our house which is about a mile from the store the white light followed us at the same distance since we had been with them.We pulled into the driveway and sat in the car the light was still at the same distance in front of us and I turned around looked out the back window and saw an identical light as in front of us approaching us from behind but keeping the same amount of distance as of the one infront of us.We decided the best place to be was a public area so we went back to the store we sat there for about another 10 minutes and decided to go back off the mountain to his sister&apos;s and stay.But my husband was begging us not to go back towards where the incident had occured.We got about 4 miles from the store which was about a mile and a half where the light was over the truck.When his sister&apos;s roomate who was watching the light all the way from the store which up until this point had remained the same distance,started to scream &quot;turn around it&apos;s coming @#$%!! !!!&quot; we made a u turn and the light shot back up to where it had been the whole time. we went back to the store and sat for about 5 minutes and his sister and her roomate were now terrified of the situation also.We drove back to our house again and no one would get out of the car because the light was still following us.We finally decided to brave it and go to his sister&apos;s house as fast as her car would possibly go.Once we hit the road we never slowed down but the light traveled the same distance beside the car as it had been.as we drove down the mountain it stayed above the mountain but still beside us and always in view.When we got to their house which is at the base of the mountain it was still above the mountain but in plain view over the valley, we went into the house about 5 minutes later his sister went out to her car and said that the light was gone.we stayed there and colmed down and tried to figure out what had happpened. we couldn&apos;t figure any other reason of them chasing us other than the red-eyed deer. so we waited until daylight and went back to the clear cut to see if the deer were still there because we couldn&apos;t understand the relationship between the red-eyed deer and the orange light chasing us or if there was any at all. We needed to see the deer to prove to ourselves that there was no connection.When we got to where the red-eyed deers were laying we saw nothing from the road.But my husband knew exactly where they were laying so his sister,my husband, and I walked into the clear cut to where we had seen them laying.But we found nothing no hair no blood and no tracks as if they were never there.We spread out and searched for deer tracks and walked for 2 hours over a 15 acre area and found no tracks that were equivilant to the massive deer we saw.As we were walking we found a deer carcuse not visible from the road which was laying on it&apos;s back without any meat, flesh,hair,or blood anywhere around it but suspiciously ALL bones were still intact. we left the clear cut and are now wondering what ha! ppens ne xt?", "My friend, and I was riding late at night, and seen a bright light coming over the hillMy girl friend, and I was riding around up in the mountains above Estacada Oregon, and she told me about these lights that she was seeing for a few days...so I went up there to prove to her that it was a planet...I position the car so the light would have to come over the top of this mountain, and I knew it would come over slowly because It was a planet. The light came shooting over real fast, then turned, and flew at a 90&apos; angle, then stopped again, and did a loop, and flew back over the mountain out of sight then it flew back over again really fast then stopped. It then just flew around. It definately was not the planet I thought it was.We have seen it many times since, and my friend has seen it many times before.

When it went over the horizon, I waited for the sound of a crash which never came.I walked outside of my house just before 6:00 pm to walk the dog.  The sky was clear, dark and the air temp cool.  I noticed how starry the night was. About 10 seconds after walking outside I looked up straight up and saw this massive fireball with a long trail behind it.  My first instinct was it was some sort of a jet plane going down.  Although the airport is 5 - 7 miles away, planes from Milwaukee &amp; Chicago fly over my neighborhood on their approach.  This &quot;plane&quot; was coming from what seemed to be SE and headed E/NE.  I thought that if it was a plane, it had taken off from the Madison airport to the SW, encountered problems and continued an arc that brought it E/NE and over my house.  Elevation seemed to be maybe 4000 feet and then as it headed towards the horizon &amp; went over the trees, it looked like it was going to crash on the east side of town or in the village of Cottage Grove. The speed of the object was no faster than a plane making a landing approach.  It moved silently.  When I first noticed the fireball, it was directly overhead.  From that moment until it went over the tree horizon, about 45 seconds to maybe a minute went by.  It was long enough that I contemplated running to my next door neighboor&apos;s house to tell him to come out and watch this. After the object dissapered and I heard no explosion, I went on my walk with the dog (who by the way did not act strange during this event)all the while trying to figure out what I had just seen.  I knew about the upcoming meteor shower, but I thought that 1) it was so huge, I didn&apos;t know meteors looked like that 2) I thought the meteor shower was going to be in the middle of the night.  When I got home, I ran in the house &amp; turned on the local news.  The Channel 3 weatherman was on and talking about the meteor shower.  Since I turned on the TV in the middle of talk, I missed most of what he said.  He was indicating however that the meteor shower was already starting &amp; that was what people were seing.  He said (paraphrased), &quot;we&apos;ve just had several calls about sightings, and that&apos;s what you&apos;re seeing folks - the meteor shower.&quot;  So that did it - I just assumed I saw a meteor. Then last night I turned on Art Bell, because I was curious to hear if he would talk about these impressive meteors.  Boy was I in for a surprise.  When you came on and played the tape from that lady in Northern Michigan, I nearly died.  It was incredibly similar to what I saw.  Like she said, it was moving slow enough to pull over and get out of a car.  Just incredible. To give you a bit of background - although open to the idea of UFOs and such, I have never seen anything which I would describe as unidentifiable until last night.", "I was west bound on I-84 just east of LaGrande, Oregon at about 2225, 11/8 when I obseverd three what I thought at first to be very bright stars west northwest of Lagrande over the Blue Mts.

The object that we saw was a huge oval with huge windows all the way around it.  The windows were lite with amazingly beautiful colors, they were every color you could imagine.  we saw the object and wanted another look so we backed up and turned around and it was gone.  When we saw the object the radio in the GMC Jimmy went out.  But when we turned around and the object was gone the radio came back on.  We spotted the object over a valley area.  we arrived at our destination we contacted the State Police to see if anyone else saw anything in the sky, relatively the same area.", "Light formation spanning over a HUGE area and moving very slowly from South to North direction then aiming downwardMy retired neighbors (husband and wife) and their son age 40 and myself, a nurse , saw in the evening sky a string of blue and white lights move slowly from generally South to North ( possibly southwest to northeast). The lights were horizontal when we first saw them. I held my hand at arm&apos;s length and opened my hand as far as I could.  Then I held my hand up to the lights and they spanned longer than the distance between the tips of my thumb and index finger.  It passed over my subdivision as it continued in it&apos;s path. It took approximately 10 seconds for it to travel from one end of my subdivision to the other (about one mile), but the lights spanned over at least 1/4 of that mile.)  It was very long. We heard no noise, but it was traveling at a low altitude -- lower than the airplanes fly over the subdivision as they ready to come in for a landing. We could not make out a form of the object it could have been cigar shaped or disc shaped (assuming that the lights were positioned on the outside edge of the object.)  As it moved, it passed behind some clouds and then reappeared.  Then the string began to slowly aim downward at approximately a 45 degree angle to the earth.  It continued downward and I could guestimate that if it were to hit the earth, it would hit somewhere in Flint, which is 10 miles NE of Swartz Creek. At that point, we could no longer see it. (I was expecitng to see it either ascend and reappear or to see some flash or something to indicate that it crashed).  We did not see it again.    I felt that the object was at least 5 miles away when it began to tilt downward. The distance between each light remained constant throughout the sighting. Fint&apos;s Bishop airport is about 4 miles from Swartz Creek.  There were no planes near the object at the time, but I could see about 4 planes much higher in the sky and much further away.  I have lived here for 35 years and what I saw was in no way an airplane.", "In early evning light the craft appeared black.  At first I was not sure if I was looking at winged aircraft or helicopter.  What caught me attention was that it was moving rather quickly but able to execute very sharp and quick moves.  It was flying toward me briefly, then started to ascend straight up. This ascent continued for about 20 minutes until I could no longer see the craft.  I saw no wings, propellers or exhaust.  During that time a commercial jet aircraft flew by but the UFO was far above so I don&apos;t know if the aircraft pilot saw what I saw.It was early evening in Jerusalem.  Object appeared to be black at the time, but that could be due to light conditions.  Object appeared to be round saucer with a small cap on top.  It caught my attention because of the fast but maneuverable manner in which it flew.  I then realized that it was neither plane or helicopter.  I was facinated by the way it ascended straight up until it disappeared.", "Triangular Formation of 3 lights moving at the speed and appearance of satelites.The center blocked out stars as it moved from West/NW to South/SEMY wife and I have a weekend cabin 18 miles from Detroit Lakes, MN. It is isolated from all city lights as it is located in the Minnesota lakes country. On Oct. 8th, 1999 at 11:15PM My wife and I were outside in the backyard looking for satelites and shooting stars. The sky was very clear. I first thought I saw a satelite, but noticed there were 3 lights moving in a triangle. I showed it to my wife to make sure she saw the same thing. They were moving at the speed and brightness of a satelite. It was fairly large and moving at a steady speed.The center of the three lights would block out background stars,as it moved from West/Northwest to South/Southeast.It is very quiet in the woods as we have no close neighbors. There was no sound at all, we can hear commercial airliners at very high altitudes when it is that still and quiet. After about 2 to 3 minutes the lights disappered.((NUFORC NOTE:  These satellites may be U. S. Navy satellites, flying in formation.  The same type of phenomenon was reported to us during August and September 1996, and Mr. Terence Dickinson, astronomy journalist for the Toronto (Canada) Star newspaper, apparently was able to identify their origin.))", "Metallic cylindrical object with rounded ends,Daylight sightingI looked up and saw this object. It was in the west, moving southwest. I was along the east bank of the Great Miami river.  It was clear where I was but morning fog lingered to the south. There there were clouds to the south as well. It appeared to be at normal airplane altitude but moving slowly. Its appparent speed was that of a jet at high altitude but it seemed to be much lower. It appeared as long as my thumb is wide, veiwed at arm&apos;s length. The ends seemed brighter than its length, the ends seemed shiny, the length grey-white. It was moving into the low clouds. I knew that it would disappear before I could get a camera or antoher witness. I kept thinking that my mind was playing tricks on me.  I thought my perspsective would change or angle of view, or something, would change.... that it would turn out to be an airplane or even a blimp. If it was a blimp or dirigible I would have seen more detail (GOODYEAR or FUJI, cockpit etc.) It looked like nothing more or less than a slow flying tube w/ rounded, mirrored end.  Definitely an UNIDENTIFIED flying object.", "An alien had sex with meI don&apos;t know what time it was I just remember it was night.  I awoke and saw 2 ailen looking creatures at the foot of my bead, they looked just like the one on the TV alien autopsey film.  I rember not being able to move nor was I afrade but actualy I knew their intent and was shamefully looking forward to the encounter.  I was concerned that my wife would wake up but I could hear the alien telling me she would not wake up and that &quot;this&quot; would not take long.  One of them moved towards my head and then I could not see the other one although I was looking for it.((NUFORC Note:  Rest of description is reminiscent of classical interaction/abduction experience.))", "TRIANGLULAR SHAPED OBJECT OBSERVED APPROX 60 FEET ABOVE GROUND.  SEVERAL LIGHTS AROUND PERIMITER, MANY COLORS.  APPEARED TO HOVER.  SOUNDED LIKE JET THRUSTERS BUT NOT LOUD.  BOTTOM WAS FLAT LOOKED LIKE METAL (DARK GRAY TO BLACK)", "Star like object with a constant speed the size of the typical star of that particular evening.At 21:30 on Saturday September 4, or Sunday September 5, 1999 three of us noticed an object in the north sky over Tustin Wisconsin.The object looked like a typical star in the evening sky.  It moved with constant velocity from the east to the west.  The sighting took about 15 seconds.  The very unique thing about the sighting was that about half way through the trajectory the star like objet seamed to be deflected at an equal angle that veared from the originla path.  Could it be a meteorite that glanced off the high atmosphere and disapeared into outter space ?", "We saw a strange contrail and craft.I was on my way to drop the kids of at Church when I saw something out of the corner of my eye. It looked like something falling out of the sky smoking. Nothing was visible.We never saw anything come out. It looked like a contrail after it fully appeared. I dropped them of and went back home I immediately told my husband to come out on the back porch to see if he could tell me what it was that I saw. He looked and he said it is a cloud , but it was not moving like the oter clouds. I told him that at first I thought it was a meteorite. We then decided it was some sort of contrail but there was no aircraft in sight. We continued to watch and he saw a nikel colored object fly out of it. I did&apos;nt see it at first then I kept watching and I saw it fly back into it , then a few seconds later it shot back out and flew all around this contrail or what ever it was. Then it disappeared for a few minutes. We kept watching and it flew back out and disappeared . We never saw it again. I was scared by this . I don&apos;t know what it was, neither did my husband . It started out as some sort of weird contrail and then it became stationary, then this nikel colored object flew all around and in and out of it for about 15 minutes. Very weird. When this object was flying you could hear no sound or see any contrail coming out of it. I don&apos;t know what it was I have never seen anything like it. My husband is a floor covering installer and I own my own cleaning service. I can assure you we are not a couple of ufo nuts . Until now my husband has been a skeptic. I believe there is something going on with all these sightings, but I am not so sure it is from somewhere else, but what-ever it is I would feel safer knowing that our Government knew about it. But I also feel that as a tax paying citizen that I have a right to know what it is. Also about an hour after we saw this we heard jets flying, we looked out and they were headed in the same direction as to where we saw the &quot;thing&quot; for lack of a better word. I would not have thought that strange until they turned around and went back several times , like they were doing a grid search . Thats about it I hope you can explain what this was to me I am really worried about it. Thank you.", "Object silently traveled north -northwest. It was V shaped with five orange lights on the perimeter and one white ligh in the center of craft. Altitude: aprox. 2000&apos;.speed: guess- 1100mph. It traveled in straight line over the mountains out of sight.At 10:30pm on 10/10/99, my husband went outside to lock the car he looked up to a cloudless sky to see an craft traveling north northwest directly over our house.  He immediately ran into the house and yelled at me to hurry outside.  I ran out to the front yard in time to see a craft in the aparent shape of a V lined with orange steady glowing lights.(two on each angle and one in the front) as well as a bright white (search light style) light directly in the center of the V.  It is dificult the estiimate the altitude, but I would guess it to be aprox. 2000 feet traveling at a speed of 1100 mph.  It traveled in a direct line over the mountains and disappeared behind them.  We are in the direct flight path of commercial aircraft traveling to Seattle and Portland or Kennewick, WA.  We have ovserved them many times.  This craft did not follow the normal flightpath of these flights.   This is the second craft of this type that we have observed in a two year period both traveling in the same direction.", "Right around dusk, my girlfriend and I had just finished dinner in the fire lookout tower. She spotted something to the north, over a mountain range about twenty miles away, and alerted me. It looked like a huge, flaming star. I put the binoculars on it and it looked like something on fire, a metallic, electrical-looking fire. Long &quot;flames&quot; shooting out of something in the core. All of a sudden the &quot;flames&quot; collapsed in on themselves, seemingly sucked into the center. What was left was a flashing light that jumped around the sky, seemingly at random. Then the object began moving south-southeast, almost directly at us. It flew in basically a straight path but it would jump around from time to time. It was disconcerting to watch. It didn&apos;t seem to obey the laws of flight we are familiar with. It passed within a few miles of us. I kept my binoculars trained on it the entire time. It was saucer-shaped, with multi-colored lights moving around its edges, a large white light at the bottom and a smaller red light on top. My girlfriend got scared and ran inside the lookout. I stayed on the catwalk to watch it. It went through the sky at sort of a 45-degree angle; not flat like a frisbee. It flew, still jumping around some, over the San Joaquin Valley. AS far as I could tell, it stopped at about five thousand feet above Woodlake or Lindsay, somewhere in that area. There it remained, nearly motionless, for several minutes. Then, from the west (the direction of Lemoore Naval Air Station) there came several flashing white lights, five or six of them. These lights behaved like helicopters. Above these lights was a another, larger light which behaved like a large airplane. As these lights approached the object, the object suddenly shot nearly straight up, going from five thousand to about 30,000 feet in a blink of an eye. There it remained while the white lights flew around the airspace it had occupied (searching?). I kept my binos trained on it for many minutes until my eyes became watery. I wiped them off and when ! I looked up it was gone. The white lights eventually peeled off and returned to the west.", "300&apos; cigar,silver,10 windows w/soft corners, 200&apos; off ground, traveling from ocean inland at less than 50 mph.I was traveling north to work at 5 am. or so and observed an object that I first thought was a 747 coming in to land at a local airport, but, it had no wings. It was traveling at less than 50 mph. The coast is dark at that point, and the city lights made the lower to upper areas visible. There were rectangular windows with rounded corners. A very light pinkish light shown in the windows. No markings. It traveled inland, east, for about 10 seconds and then made a slow (flat) 45 degree turn north and with a 20 degree rise flew another 10 seconds and then with an abrupt rise of 70 degree, increased speed and quickly disappeared into the night sky. If this object was infact an airplane or jet, I would have seen the tail section with a flat reflection, not, a cigar to oval end reflection. I viewed this object at approximately 1/4 to 1/2 mile distance. I have been in construction all of my life and I know how to judge distance, shape, reflection, degrees, and travel speed. This object broke all the laws of physics. Did I mention, I stopped the car on the side of the road and opened the door and stepped out with one foot and listened for sound? There was no sound at all. None. No high tention line electrical type buzz, no jet like sound, no prop or motor noise, no nothing. I, of course, thought that it might be a blimp, but it was about 300&apos; long, 30&apos; high. This is not a cross section of any blimp I have ever seen of heard of. Besides, if this was an extraordinarly shaped blimp, why was there no motor or prop sound? Even a blimp makes a slight roll when it turns. The turn I observed was flat as a pancake. Also, I have never heard of a blime making a rise of 70 degrees, nor, pick up speed as rapidly as the object in question. If there is a logical explination for the occurance, I am all ears.", "Very large disk shape, many portholes, silver in color, nestled between two hillsThe sun had already gone down and the sky was still lit up slightly when our family, two daughters and my husband, were in our boat and going in to shore. My husband was steering the boat and my daughters and I were enjoying the scenery. As I was looking tomy right, I did a &quot;double take&quot; because I remember thinking quickly that the arrangement of the hills looked different than usual. I saw an extremely large, silver disk hovering (no sound) in between two hills and the port holes, many of them, were clearly visible. It was suspended and I could see the remainder of the darkening sky around the edges of it. I said to my husband &quot;What in the world is that?&quot; As I kept my eyes on it I looked then at my daughters and I think they were looking at the shoreline thinking that I was talking about a pretty home or something. I looked at my husband and I don&apos;t think he heard me because he didn&apos;t respond to my question. I think the engine of the boat was too loud. He still looked straight ahead. Then the hill to the north began to block the disk and it went out of my sight. I thought I should ask my husband to turn the boat around but at that time I couldn&apos;t believe that I even saw what I saw. I never did say a word to him afterwards. I did tell my oldest daughter eventually. It&apos;s a difficult subject to talk about. I continue to tell myself that I didn&apos;t really see it - but I know that I did. The image is as plain as ever.", "coming on to I-20 going toward dallas, i saw what looked like a black ball suspended over the shopping mall complex to my left.i was turning onto the highway, going toward dallas, when i looked to my left and noticed what looked like a black ball or sphere suspended in the sky, over the shopping mall complex.  i thought it was just a street light or something at first, but took a second look at it, and noticed that it was a little higher than the lights.  it wasn&apos;t an advertisement balloon or blimp, because i kept my eye on it to see if i could read anything or see strings.  no strings, no poles; nothing.  it was just a huge black ball suspended in the air, and it was creepy because it was just as still as all the buildings and other structures around the area. it didn&apos;t sway in the wind, have a velocity, or emit any smoke trails. as far as depth perception goes, it looked to me, to be about the size of a small automobile, like a VW beetle, or maybe bigger.  i&apos;ve gone down that same stretch, since then, to double check that i wasn&apos;t just seeing street lamps, or if i could see it again.  no weird street lamps and no spooky black balls in the sky.  i&apos;d sure as hell like to know what it was that i saw.", "It looked white and round and bright.As we were traveling on a back road home, I looked in my rear view mirror and saw this bright white object following us.  As I slowed the vehicle down the object seemed to slow also.  Then it just disappeard.  When we got to our destination it seemed that it had followed us there.  I got my daughter out of the car and the object was gone as quickly as it had appeared.", "At 5:oo P.M.  Me and my husband were eating at Burger King, we left to go home and he was mentioning the contrails in the sky, and how they were not normal contrails. So we proceeded home, and there was a jet, you could see plain as day, thats what it was, he was expaining how those were contrails, anyway as we were looking at the jet there was a steady light,the jet seemed to be going straight towards it, it seemed to be still, to me but my husband thought it may have been moving slowly, I couldnt really say for sure, the jet went above the object. This thing was almost glowing, it could not have been a reflection because the jet was in the same spot at this point only higher, and there was not glow to the jet, then as I made a right turn, it put the two behind us, I was driving so I wasnt looking back, then my husband said oh my God it just vanished the jet was still heading the same way, but it was gone.", "I witnessed an extremely bright, pulsing object at approx. 3000 ft, slowly descending and then accelerating - this object was completely silent.I am a 27 year old Austin, Tx resident.  I was travelling on northbound Interstate 35, joining 35 from 183.  I was heading north towards the Braker Lane exit.  The time was approximately 8:45 p.m. on Monday, November 8th,  and I had just left my office to join some friends watching the Dallas game that had just started at 8:00.    As I was travelling north on I35,  I became aware of an extremely bright, pulsating object in the sky.   The object appeared to be descending rather slowly,  and was extremely bright - several times brighter than any visible stars in the sky.  As I exited on Braker Lane,  heading along the frontage road,  I still managed to track the object.  The object descended appromately 1000,  then changed direction,  heading almost due south.  By that time,  I was travelling east on Braker lane,  and became aware of more details about this peculiar object.  The object appeared to be accelerating - my estimate would be approx. 400-450 miles an hour at this point.  Something else caught my eye - 2 tiny lights that were trailing this object.  By this time,  Both objects had passed me,  and I was looking behind them as they continued south.  The original bright object that I first sighted now appeared to sport several red blinking lights on the anterior of the object - these lights blinked in sequence, similar to standard navigational lights (however,  there were at least 5-6 of these lights on the anterior of the craft).  In addition,  there appeared to be some kind of strobe or circular light on the belly of the craft - this appears to be what accounted for the extremely bright, pulsating light that I had witnessed earlier.  However,  as the object was starting to become perpindicular/head away from me at this point,  this characteristic had become less apparent.  The two white lights that were trailing the craft (from about a mile) appeared to be the exhaust of a seperate,  conventional jet aircraft.  As I arrived at my friends house I immediately stopped my engine and climbed out,  stil! l tracki ng the two objects.  The first thing I noticed was that the first craft was extremely silent - no audible propulsion sounds were discernable.  In addition,  dogs in yards directly under the craft&apos;s path were barking loudly,  and this could be heard distinctly as the craft passed over the subdivision.  What appeared to be a jet aircraft followed this path shortly after the unidentified craft,  and this audible noise did not disturb the animals.  I lost sight of both objects as they passed over the horizon,  but that is not the end of my sighting. At approximately 9:10 pm the same night,  I had stepped outside into the backyard of my friend&apos;s duplex to smoke a cigarette.  I must make the disclaimer at this point that I was in no way under the influence of any psychoactive/hallucinogenic substances,  or even alcohol. Stunned by the earlier sighting,  I watched the skies as I smoked the cigarette.  To my suprise,  looking east over the roof of the duplex,  I spotted a bright light of similar intensity slowly arcing up in a straight path.  Iridium satellite, or some other orbiting satellite,  is what I first thought.  The altitude/speed seemed consistent with an orbital satellite - however, as this object passed right over my head,  I was again able to glimpse the flashing red lights on the anterior,  and then knew it was the same object as I had seed earlier.  However,  this time the object&apos;s altitude was (estimated)  at least 50-60000 feet,  and it&apos;s speed had to be several times supersonic,  at least mach 8-9,  to account for the terrific speed in which it traversed the sky from horizon to horizon.  It&apos;s long,  arcing flight from horizon to horizon occured within about 4-5 seconds,  and that was a good indication of it&apos;s altitude and speed,  as I watched it ascend from the east, pass straight over me,  and continue to the west,  until it passed from my view.   I did not see any conventional aircraft in pursuit this time (no conventional aircraft to my knowledge could demonstrate  this type of acceleration/speed). My final thoughts:  The red blinking lights indicate possible navigation lights,  lending an earthly explanation to this - could this be an Aurora sighting?  One thing&apos;s for certain, though,  this is new and completely unconventional propulsion system.  I believe that the bright, pulsating glow of the circle? underneath the craft has something to do with the propulsion - just by shear virtue of its intense luminosity.", "Someone pointed out an object in the western sky facing the Rocky mtns that appeared to be not moving.  Couldn&apos;t tell what it was.While at a housewarming party a group of us were standing out in the driveway at approx 17:30 - 18:00.  Someone pointed up and asked what this object was.  It looked like a jet and it&apos;s contrails...but the contrails were not growing and it seemed like the object was not moving.  It looked a bit like a pair of flourescent tubes just sitting idle in the sky.  I did notice during the day that there was a good amount of contrail activity that day, but this looked much brighter than contrails.  Like I mentioned earlier there seemed to be no evidence of any movement/growth or any trace of fading contrails.  Then everyone just went back to conversation.  I looked back up a few minutes later and the object was completely gone.  There was absolutely no trace of anything have been there.  Normally you would see some faded contrails or something to show that something was there.  The object appeared to be quite a distance away, so it may very well have been a jet and contrails.  I just thought it looked a little odd, because there was no evidence of movement, and it just seemed brighter than contrails.  Then upon looking again, it was just gone.  This may not be anything, but I thought I&apos;d report it to see if this may add to someone else&apos;s report.  I do NOT have any further information, since I didn&apos;t really watch it for any extended period of time.  I just looked as someone pointed it out for a couple of minutes, then looked up a couple of minutes later to see nothing was there.

I told my wife to look at the object and she did. I put the baby down and went to get my binoculars which is a 7x35 extra wide Switf sportking.I looked at the object and it was disc or round i couldn&apos;t see because i wasn&apos;t holding the binoculars steady., so i braced them against a pole  and  i could see that the object looked like it was changeing shape to a triangle type then it went behind trees.

Oct. 23, 1999, 10-11 guests at our outdoor party saw an UFO.  We were playing music and and singing by the bonfire. No one was intoxicated. Someone pointed and said, &quot;there&apos;s a UFO&quot;.  Everyone stopped playing music and stood up. I saw, without my glasses unfortunately, a column-shaped object vertically and silently glide across the sky. It appeared to have 3 muted lights lined up vertically along the column.  The sky was very clear with a bright full moon except for a few light wisps of fog.  The object was seen for around 30 seconds before it went behind the fog.  It never came back out! There were different descriptions of the object seen. One person said that she saw a column of 4-6 hazy lights that was traveling at an angle. Another person (who might file a report too) said that she saw a grey- colored vertical rectangle, that was backlit and that had a triangular shaped exhaust coming off the back. Everyone was very matter-of-fact about the whole thing.", "I saw 4 craft floating in the sky in and near the constellation Ursa Major. They remained there for quite some time and then sped off.I saw 4 craft at around 11:15 p.m. last night floating in the sky around the Big Dipper. They floated about rather slowly in circular patterns and one sped off almost immediately after I first saw them. The other three remained for nearly five hours and didn&apos;t really do much except float around. They remained in motion constantly (not much motion, but it was noticeable) all the time I watched. The craft themselves appeared to be rectangular or oval in shape and didn&apos;t appear to have three dimensions at all (i.e., flat or something?). They were primarily yellow, green and red in color, with two yellow bands (apparently glowing) on their &quot;top&quot; and &quot;bottom,&quot; running all the way across, from &quot;front&quot; to &quot;back&quot; on all four of them. In between the two yellow bands was a section of alternating red and green lights that appeared to either move or change colors in a regular pattern. I am a 19 year old student with an interest in the sciences (primarily physics and astronomy). I don&apos;t really know what other information about me you want -- I&apos;m not a &quot;wacko&quot; or mentally unstable or anything. Also: this isn&apos;t the first time I have seen these craft, either. I see them usually a few times a year, but never this many and never for this long, so I decided this was noteworthy. Thank you for your time.", "I saw a sudden flash on a nearby pond, looked up and saw a white light with a greenish tingeAs I stepped outside (it was getting pretty dark), I saw a sudden flash of light on a nearby pond to the north which was coming from above the area. The flash was diffuse but fairly bright in a cone shape -- lasted about a second or two -- the bottom covering about 50 feet or more. I quickly looked up directly above the flash and spotted a round light floating slowly toward the east at about 100-200 feet. I ran and got my binoculars and watched as it slowly continued moving to the east. This was a single steady white light with a greenish tinge which appeared to be somewhat dimmed by the thin clouds (created by multiple persistent contrails during the day). Within a few seconds it disappeared into heavy cloud bank. I have been watching aircraft in this area for over a year and am as sure as can be this was not an aircraft. On another night, I saw two flashes several seconds apart coming at an angle onto the nearby Lewisville Lake toward a yacht which was flashing its light also -- but did not see a source at that time. Are this surveillance spheres? -- Are these signals (short flashes)? -- Are they taking some kind of photos? What could be the purposes of brief pulses of light? Perhaps there is more than light involved?", "looking out of window I saw a huge long light moving slowly across sky, that looked like a passenger train with many lights alongside of it i ran outside but it had gone..At about 19:04 -19:05 hrs I was sitting in my family room(main level of house)watching television. The large window next to the television has a half moon window above it. I witnessed a large  long continuous light passing across it slowly. I often see aircraft passing in the night, but this was huge, bright and moving slowly. I jumped up from the sofa and ran to the window. Looking up  at this moving light I noticed many, many smaller whitish lights moving alongside the huger light. I was alittle scared because it was like nothing I had seen before. I have seen meteorites flashing across the sky in arches, but this moved slowly and in a straight direction. I would say from the position of the window that I saw this from, that it was moving in a north easterly direction. It looked like a large passenger train, deep and long in shape. I ran to my front door and outside believing that because it was moving so slowly that I would continue to be able to see it, but it had already moved out of vision. I called my husband at the hospital, where he works to tell him and to see if anyone else had seen this. Later in th evening on the news, other people described that they had also been witness to this strange phenomena.", "I saw a light in the sky, looking much like a bright star. When I looked closer it was moving slowly up, then it shot up into the air.I was looking out of my bedroom window, I noticed an unusually bright star in the sky. Looking closer I noticed that it was slowly moving up. I thought that it was my imagination or a trick with my eyes so I went to my window to look properly. To my astonishment it was moving up, very slowly however, after about 1 or 2 minutes it shot up into the air, probably taking no longer than a second to be totaly out of sight. The object was about 30 degrees above the horizon and was in the North-East. I couldnt predict distance at all due to the object having no particular shape or features. If it wasnt moving I would have thought it as being a bright star. Since it was I automatically thought either sattalite or aircraft, but no sattalite or aircraft or anyother craft that I know of has that accelerarion and moving ability.", "It was warm out at first it appiered to be a weatherballon (I thoughtdue the HIgh P.)My sister , mother and I pulled to eat in parking lot and at 11o&apos;clock on the horizon this object went in a circulular west to s.w.THE OBJECT WAS CIRCULLAR IN SHAPE AND MOVED RAPIDLY WEST TO S.W.AND BACK AGAIN.THE SIZE WAS LARGER THAN VENUS.AT FIRST I WATCHED IT FOR ABOUT 10 MIN.THEN SHOWED MY MOTHER AND SISTER FOR ANOTHER 20MIN.

Descended 15 degrees in approximately 3 seconds. Object was observed in the city limits, however, I do not believe there was enough light to diminish an ionization trail. It was exceptionally bright, and lacking a standard color format, it was the color of a BLUE Christmas tree light. I am an aviation historian, and amateur radio operator, and I specialize in &quot;bouncing&quot; signals off of Meteor trails. I know of no substance that burns in this color, so will discount a Leonids meteor, which was prevalant at this time. Object was quite large, and no signs of diminshment in size, such as a meteor would display.", "White light east southeast of here seems to be flashing red and blueI see one white light that is flashing red and blue, I thought it might be an airplane but it hasn&apos;t moved in over 20 minutes not up not down no movement.  There are no towers over that way that I&apos;ve ever seen before.  And I often look as I usually look at the sky while walking my dog.  I was looking at Orion this evening when I noticed this thing it was almost straight down from the first star in Orions belt.  I&apos;m still observing it does seem to be getting somewhat higher but still a white light flashing red and blue.  Maybe its a star I don&apos;t know I&apos;ve never vseen a star flash like that before((NUFORC Note:  The report is not inconsistent with a bright star that appears in the southeastern sky during the early morning hours.  We have received many reports about it.))", "I saw a light flying across the sky, from west to east, at an extraordinary speed.  It flew in a straight line, slowed a bit then speeded up again, it traveled a great distance in seconds,near the horizon it veered right and disappeared out of sight.  I could see many aircraft in the sky, because we were north of Sky Harbor airport. The speed of this light was amazingly fast in comparison to the aircraft in the area.  I&apos;ve seen hundreds of meteors in my life and am positive it was not a meteor, a plane, a bird, a bat, a reflection, a satelite, or a rocket.  I&apos;ve never seen anything like this before and am writing this because I have no idea on what other recourse to take.I work an evening shift and at 7:30pm two co-workers and myself went outside because they smoke cigarettes. I don&apos;t smoke, but just went with them to talk.  We went up to the top floor of a four story parking lot for employees of the company.  The weather was great, were in Phoenix, there were plenty of stars, were near downtown, so the city lights drown the sky, yet it was easy to see the entire sky from this roof top.  Squaw peak mountain is several miles to the northeast of us and I could see a light mist near the peak.  Off on the east I could see some light clouds on the distant horizon.  Planes could easily be seen circling for a landing or take-off from Sky Harbor airport to the southeast. I saw a huge thick bright meteor to the east headed straight down, very bright with specks of bright green. It burned up and I was impressed with the thickness, brightness, and straight down direction that it had. It seemed very close, but I know these things can actually be very far away. All three of us saw the meteor.  We continued talking and about ten minutes later I commented again on how beautiful the meteor had been and the others were agreeing, just then, my friend said whats that, I turned around and saw the light zooming across the sky.  My first thought was a plane, it looked like it had a dim red speck on it. I&apos;ve also seen birds fly by a night at close distances that appear to fast high flying vehicles, but I quickly dismissed this being a plane or a bird.  Phoenix is full of helicopters, I see them alot. This was definitely not a helicopter. Way too fast, went very far, fast.  I thought it might be some type of reflection. No clouds, it varied it speed, slightly, then veered right.  It wasn&apos;t a reflection.  It happened very quickly and the third person in the group never caught eye of it.  I&apos;ve seen satelites before and I even saw the shuttle fly by one morning as it was about to land in California. This was faster than that. Did anyone else see anything? Just when you think you seen it all....I! was ama zed!", "I was looking into the sky towards the high east watching what appeared to be a passenger jet cross the sky when my periphial vision caught sight of a luminous amber object coming from the southeast and headed in a northwest direction.  At first I thought it was a big bird of some sort the way it was gliding in the sky.  It was reltively low in the sky especially compared to the jet I had been observing.  The object passed silently overhead and it was like the shape of a boomerang.  It was&apos;nt glowing or lit but yet it was oddly illuminated like it was reflecting the light from the valley floor.  (I-5 is nearby and Ashland and Medford are well lit)  I have seen many other craft and strange lights over the past 40 years but this was very unique to my experience with UFO&apos;s.  In my judgement it was around 3,000 ft. in altitude and moving at a pace that allowed it to remain in my vision for nearly a minute as it passed over, veered right sharply and then took off rapidly due east. I can&apos;t get that eerie glow out of my mind.  If I had&apos;nt been looking it would have been nearly invisible.Besides the 10/11/99 incident, on the morning of 10/ 14/99 at 4:15 AM a gigantic fireball was seen from my home in the southeastern sky.  It was not a shooting star but a gigantic golden fireball steaking across the sky.  We have been seeing many strange things in the sky here lately.  Southern Oregon is being chemtrailed at least once aweek for months now and it is so thick sometimes the blue sky is completely hazed over within minutes.", "We saw a v-shaped formation of orangy-yellow round flying objects fly right above us and disappear on the other side of horizonAs me and my wife came back from shopping thursday night and I had just parked my car in front of the garage, I was walking towards the garage door when I looked up and saw a perfect V shape of bright orangy/yellow round objects approaching. I told my wife to look up and she also wittnessed it. They flew right above us and disappeared to the other side of horizon. My estimate of their distance is 1,000 ft. It was clear star-lit sky. There was no sound coming from these objects. I called 911, the police and the close by Westover Airforce Base but nobody took me too seriously.", "3 Blue green balls of light with streaming orange yellow tails. Tails resembling sparks.I was travelling south bound on Woodbine Ave, just on the east side of Newmarket. I noticed to my right (west) a stream of blue green lights glowing in the western sky, just above the horizen moving in an eastern direction. At first I though that an large airliner was making an approch to land,except for the fact that there were no landing stips in the area. I pulled over and got out of the vehicle as fast as I could. I continued to watch the three balls of light drift almost directly over me. The stream was stretching across the sky at about 30 degrees right above where I was standing. The tail looked like orange yellow sparkles that faded as it passed over me. It faded or burned up completely just as it passed over me. I heard on the radio at about 13:06 EST that they mentioned that the Leonids meteor shower would be active but that the sighting that they descibed (very briefly) was what I had seen was not part of the Leonids but mearly a stray! If it was a Russian rocket booster (Yeah right!),they should get a gold medal for making it this far east.", "Green Fireball with yellow-orange tail.Green Fireball with yellow-orange tail observed in the soutern sky traveling at a high rate of speed from west to east.

I notice it had one blinking white(?) light and two to three gold or yellow, more gold than yellow. Like a mercury vapor street light. I proceeded to get binoculars. And when i returned the object was perhaps 4 or 5 miles away and south of my position. And i continued to watch the object through the binoculars. Was difficult to keep the binoculars steady. Bu i saw the same thing through them. One blinking white light, and two to three gold lights! Estimated speed was maybe 50 to 70 mph. Didnt hear any noise from the craft. Will try to keep an eye out for the object again in the future. The gold colored lights were the most unusual part of the sighting! I have never seen lights like this on any flying object before!!!", "Objects seen over detroit meto airportThis was reported to me while I was working on the aircraft parking ramp at detroit metro.

I went out of my car to knock on the door and waited while he came to open the door.  After a while looked up into the sky.  I was a beautiful night.  As I looked I noticed an object in the sky.  At first I thought it was an airplane but it was flying too close and too fast.  In comparison to an airplane i would say to probably flow 10 times as fast.  I&apos;ve watched airplanes fly across the sky before but no normal airplane goes that fast.  It also eluminated a bright green light, which was constant.  My Fiance came out and was also stunned.

It looked like a fireworks flare with the outer edges glowing like the light sparklers give off. It appeared to be very low but there was no way of knowing. However, the sky is overcast so it had to be below cloud cover to be so brilliant.

We live near the landing pattern for Andrews Air Force base and I have noticed within the past year that the nav light configuration has changed for many aircraft and now take on a triangle shapes vastly different from the wingtip and tail configuration. What was different about this triangle in the sky was the red light that was equidistant and in the center of the white lights. This weekend there has been ...JUST NOW AN INEXPLICABLE DISPLAY OF RT.RED AND WHITE LFT WING LIGHTS IN LINE  WITH A SUPER BRILLIANT RED STROBE (TWICE THE DISTANCE AS BETWEEN THE WING LIGHTS) BELOW AND 30 DEGRESS LEFT OF THE APPARANT WING LIGHTS. There was an abnormally loud single engine noise which made me look off the porch by my computer. Anyway this weekend has been replete with low screaming fighter jets 3 in formation that I saw and lots of helicopter traffic. The red strobe I just witnessed as I was writing this was really bright about 10-20 million candle power in red.  And why would it be in perfect 90 mph formation below and to the left as if attached in some way.

After watching this object for only 5-6 seconds, it shot off out of the womans sight.  When asked the woman said the was not a &quot;shooting star&quot; as she has seen plenty of those before. She also stated that this object shot off very fast.  The object was seen in the Western Part off the sky.  The witness stated that the object was very low and had no sound to it.

I was looking out the slidding glass doors from my bedroom balcony from my bed.  The door was ajar enough to hear ambient noise from outside. I was still in bed, but awoke and idly watching a star around 15 degrees above the horizen to the west.  Keep in mind that I am located on a hill adjacent to downtown LA and there is a lot of ambient lighting in the area including all of downtown LA with its major lit-up skyscrapers only a mile from the site towards the south. Visibility was good, but by no means crystal clear, hence the object I was looking at was either a major star or planet nearly directly west.  I notice a smaller but clearly distinguishable object slowly circling the brighter object.  At first I thought it was an airplane or a helocopter, however at this time of night, I discounted the possibility of an airplane as it was an unusual at this hour (I know LAX traffic patterns well and they don&apos;t fly over the city at this hour).  At any rate I couldn&apos;t take my eyes off of it and wandering what it could be.  Too high to be a helecopter; no sound.  Within a few seconds the smaller object simply turned, acerlerated and litteraly shot away like a meteor- across the northern sky from west to east. No big deal, I smiled and made a wish.  After a while, I began thinking that it could not be a meteor, meteors don&apos;t turn at right angles. There was no breaking apart or trail characteristic of meteors either. There was no sound.  It was quite amazing.  What was it? All of this activity would have to have been seen over the entire LA Basin as it took place at a great distance from me.  I am mostly curious if other may have seen it...surely they did, but did they see it slowly turn and then shoot like a bat out of hell?  If it was actually approaching earth during the slow turn, then it must have been a major asteroid.  If it was so easily visible during this period of time, it must have been huge to reflect that much light for so long.

The house was getting warm so my father and I went out into the back-yard to sit in the shade. My chair was facing northwest while my father was facing notheast.  As we talked, my father mentioned that he was watching an object in the sky that was apparently not moving. Getting curious, I shifted my chair and after a little searching located the object.  I estimate the object&apos;s position to be northeast and about 45 degrees above the horizon.  The sky was clear and bright with the point of light, looking to be a few miles away. I noted the time (10:45)and after a few minutes my father again remarked that the object still hadn&apos;t moved.  I relocated the object, using the peak of a neighbor&apos;s rooftop as a reference point.  Indeed, the object was still there and I went inside to get my 7X50 binoculars.  Using the same reference point, I relocated the object.  Bringing the binoculars into focus, revealed the small object to have an oval shape and glowing a bright orange.  It was now a few minutes after 11:00 and the object had still not noticibly moved.  I watched the object through the binoculars for a few more minutes and saw that featureless orange glow was not varying in brightness.  Asking my father to keep an eye on the object, I went inside to get some stronger optics.  After a few minutes, I came outside with video camera that has a 50X digital zoom. Unfortunately, without a tripod the camera shook too much to be of any use.  The time was by then 11:30 and while continuing to watch the object through my 7X50&apos;s, I noticed that it began moving slowly away. The object&apos;s heading was due east and in only a couple of minutes, it was gone from sight.  At no time during this sighting, did either myself or my father notice any sign of a contrail. I must note that my house is located less than two miles from the U.S.Marine Corps Air Station at Miramar.  I have seen and heard all manner of aircraft over the years and this object really made an impression me.  Because the object was apparently quite far away and high in the sky, I hope that there were other witnesses to this event.", "Two parallel contrails were seen in the western sky approximately over eastern San Fernando Valley heading from south-east to north-west.

They were spotted within high cirrus cloud formation. Sorry, no pix.Not much more to report. Contrails were white in color, appeared to not have much distance between them ( 1/2 mile perhaps ), were very visible and stable for as much as 40 minutes.

It was moving in a downward slant. I watch it until I could not see it any more.The object had a big front and a firey tail. I would say it was the size of a quarter. And the tail was long I believe it was far away. It was moving fast but it was not a shooting star because it lasted way to long.", "Deep black sphere about 1 meter diameter emits paralyzing orange beamThis sighting is from 1982. At that time I lived in the Juneau Receiving Home, awaiting foster care. Around 2 in the afternoon on a mid-June day, I had stepped out back for a cigarette.  In the back of this home was the driveway, a freestanding garage, and a dipsty dumpster. A woodland area surrounded the whole back side.  About 100&apos; from the porch and well into the wooded area lies a 10&apos;x10&apos; patch of concrete with a basketball hoop on it. When I stepped out, I noticed a deep black globe, about 3 feet in diameter, hovering in place about 80&apos; away and 18&quot; or so off the ground - right near the front edge of the basketball court.  The sphere was a pure black, almost as if it were a hole in space; yet I could tell it was fully 3-D and very real. Almost immediately after I noticed it, the sphere started drifting smoothly towards my right at about half a mile an hour. A low humming noise became evident at this point. The sound could be best described as the sound effect they use on Star Trek Voyager to indicate power going to the warp core; but it seemed lower and more intense. The object then emitted an intense, fan-shaped orange beam of some kind, directed towards my right; but sweeping slowly from right to left. As the beam swept past, objects in its path (tires, pop cans, etc.) glowed a kind of phosphorescent orange color; while the general background was darker. At this point I was more than concerned; I became somewhat frightened. When I turned towards the back door and reached for the doorknob (still looking at the sphere), the beam hit me, paralyzing me where I stood. And that&apos;s the last thing I remember, until finding myself back in my room some minutes later wondering just what the hell had happened. Just before this sighting occured, I had been trying to record shortwave radio broadcasts on my new JVC RC-M70 boombox. The tape was still running after the sighting - so being the curious person I was, I played my tape back.  At first, all I heard was what I expected: static-filled shortwave broadcasts. About 20 minutes into the tape, these broadcasts were replaced by a very odd warbling noise, modulated and remodulated with all kinds of harmonics; rising and lowering in general pitch with a period of about 20 seconds.This sound lasted for about fifteen minutes; after which the usual static &amp; faint shortwave station sounds resumed. Sometime between 1982 and 1990 the tape became lost though.  I sure wish it hadn&apos;t. There were no apparent physical effects from this encounter; although those strange paralyzing &quot;dreams&quot; from a previous sighting came back for a few weeks afterwards. The object didn&apos;t appear to be suspended by string or wire; the general terrain in that area would have absolutely forbidden any means of support for the kind of smooth, natural movement it had.  Not from above, not from the sides, and not from below.  My opinion of the object was that it may have been a probe of some kind; it was too small to have been a ship and it most definately wasn&apos;t a balloon. I never found out what happened to it; for it was already gone by the time I realised what had happened. Back during this time period, I was messing with lasers and electronics; and had constructed a device which produced some unusual EM effects; however this device had not been in operation for about a year before the sphere showed up; so I found no obvious connection between the two.", "I WENT OUTSIDE TO TAKE OUT THE GARBAGE DURING THE INDIANDS PLAYOFF GAME I WENT TO THE BACK YARD LOOKED UP AT THE TOWER AND SAW A LIGHT.

My wife and I went to a state park near Jordon Mn. just south of Minneapolis. I noticed what  at first I thought was a satalite moving across the sky. However, the object was not traveling in a straight line, and the intensity was growing brighter. Next the object stopped, this really got my attention. This did not behave like any conventional aircraft. I instructed my wife to not lose sight of the object as I ran to the car to get my binoculars. I returned and quickly regained view of object which had the appearence of a bright star. You would have to be looking for this as it was not easily noticeable. To my amazement the object began to move again, this time in a different direction. The object stopped again. Very shortly later it began to move again. Only this time it appeared to be moving out to space as it began to get dimmer and dimmer. I watched it dissapear with my binoculars. It did not dissapear over the horizen, it dissapeared out in to space until it was no longer visable. I was very impressed, much more then my wife.", "Driving home on the 4th or 5th, I thought it was Easter night. There were not many cars out we saw it while driving.  It moved very fast then stood still then went the other direction.  We saw it high in the sky then as pulling into our subdivision it dropped came towards us and put a light on us.  Frightened with our children in the car I told my husband to leave immediately.  Been trying not to think about it until months later. My husband saw the same thing, but will not dicuss it.", "An eliptical-teardrop shaped object travelling approx.15-20 degrees above the horizon, from SE to NW in a horizontal position  along Seola Beach was observed for approx. 10 secs. at 21:45 Sunday, Oct. 3, 1999.My home is located on a cliff overlooking Puget Sound.  It faces south and looks across to Vashon Is.  My living room is floor to ceiling glass, so the object that moved  horizontally across the sky seemed to be following the coastline.  It was extremely large and green-yellow; the object seemed to be outlined with a glowing yellow.  Yellow, glowing particles were coming out of the tail.  It moved steadily past my windows but  not with such speed that I was not able to observe it.  The object was as large  or larger than a city bus, eliptical with a long tail.  I might add that this is my first experience seeing something  that cannot be explained, so perhaps it falls into the UFO category. I have lived at this location for many years and am well acquainted with th area.  I am a graduate of the Univ. of Wa. and a retired teacher.", "oblong, extremely large and  bright object in sky, going behind mountains.

The object was so large, we wondered if Winnemucca still existed.The object lit up the whole sky  over Winnemucca and then disappeared behind the mountains.", "On a trip to CHicago from my home in Glencoe, I witnessed a large black object that looked like a diamond floating in the sky in front of me as I drove my car in traffic on my way to Chicago. I pulled over and was able to capture 34 seconds of the event on digital video tape.I left my house on the way to a video shoot in the city, on my way to the highway (Edens Expressway) I was heading West on Dundee Road toward the overpass to enter the expressway whenI saw (because you could not have missed it unless you were sleeping) a large diamond shaped object floating in the distance in front of me. It was sunset but the was not in the sky and there was a sunset at the time the object was so strange that I pulled off the road at a gas station (at the SW corner of Skokie Blvd. and Dundee Rd.). Since I was on my way to shoot video I had 2 Digital Video cameras with me 1 (a Canon GL-1), which already had a fresh battery in it and some tape also. I parked my car and got about 34 seconds on tape. Today (Nov.8) I contacted the Palwaukee airport control tower and spoke with a man who said to send him some stills from the video which I did and e-mailed them to him. I also called the FAA and was given a few numbers to contact. Upon reching someone, who thought it to be very interesting gave me the number for the UFO Center. I am a 31 yr old digital video editor producer, I mostly work with music videos, when I looked at the tape on my computer it looked like a big black snowflake (diamond shaped), it had structures sticking up and down on it but from a distance it looked almost like a big black kite, there were no lights at all and was just sort of floating moving NW from my position. I have a Video Broadcast Processor whic I was able to lighten up the picture and it is like nothing I have ever seen. When I first saw it I had to pull over it looked like nothing I have ever seen before!", "The object was in the northern sky for approximately 1.5 hours on the evening of 10/16/99.  It was saucer-like shape with a very bright glow in the middle.  It had red and green lights circulating around it.I was sitting on my deck and was on the phone with a friend of mine.  I saw an object that seemed as though it was not moving.  It was just becoming dusk and the reason I noticed this object is because it looked like it was twinkling.  As I continued the conversation on the phone, approximately 25 minutes, dusk turned to nightfall and the object was getting to be more defined.  It seemed like it was moving very slowly towards the north.  At the same time, there was jets flying a southernly pattern.  They were very high--you could not hear their engines and they were going in the opposite direction of this object.  The interesting part of these jets is I counted the time it took these jets to pass the same area that this object moved in.  The jets took approximately 12 seconds.  This object, at this point, was up to about 40 minutes.  The object briskly moved to the south for a very short period of time, probably 30 seconds, and then went back to its northerly path.  The movements were quite sharp in direction.  It did not turn, but it just moved in the other direction for a period of time.  When comparing the distances between these passenger jets probably 30K feet, this object seemed a lot further away.  I finally told myself that I was really experiencing something that I never have before and went and brought out my telescope to see it more clearly.  I set the telescope up and saw it very clearly.  It was a saucer-like shape with a darker space in the middle, outlined in white with red and green circulating lights that seemed to be flashing/twinkling.  I called my wife who came out and looked in the telescope and she saw the same thing I did.  I asked her to call NASA at Moffet Field, but we couldn&apos;t get through.  We then called the FAA who switched us to the Oakland Tower.  They gave us your number.  We called Channel 5--KPIX News Room and asked if anyone had reported anything out of the ordinary in the sky.  The gentleman told me that yes there had been some reports and he said he thought it was t! he re-en try of a satellite.  I told him I had the object in the sights of my telescope and that unless there building satellites that look like flying saucers that hover in the sky, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s a satellite.  He told me he would check into it.  I watched the 11 o&apos;clock and there were no reports of anything, which of course, I really didn&apos;t expect anyway.  My wife and I have never seen anything like this before.  We are in our 40&apos;s and don&apos;t typically follow this type of thing.  However, this did catch my attention and I know what I saw.  I continued to follow this object till it went out of my line of sight/horizon and it&apos;s attributes remained the same.", "IT WAS JUST TURNING DARK=HUDSON RIVERS AT THE END OF MY BACK YARD=IT WAS VERY REAL AND THE ONLY UNUSAL THING I HAVE EVER WITNESSED IN MY LIFEI LIVED IN GREEN ISLAND =THERE IS A ISLAND IN BETWEEN WHERE I LIVED AND TROY NY=I WAS JUST STANDING THERE=THE HUDSON IS VERY SHALLOW ON MY SIDE OF THE ISLAND=ALL THE SUDDEN IT WAS JUST SECONDS,I LOOKED TO THE RIGHT AND SAW THIS BALL OF LIGHT MOVING VERY SLOW ABOUT 2 FOOT OVER THE WATER=BLINKING LIKE A FIRE FLY WOULD==CANT REMEMBER WHAT COLOR=IT WAS NO FIRE FLY=IT WAS BETWEEN SOFT BALL AND SOCCER BALL SIZE=IT WAS COMING IN MY DIRECTION =NOT TOWARDS ME BUT MY DIRECTION OVER THE WATER=IT WAS DARK ENOUGH THAT I COULD NEVER SEE ANY THING BUT THE BLINKING=COULD MAKE OUT THAT IT WAS A BALL FORM=I WAS ONLY APPOX.30 FEET FROM THIS OBJECT SO IM SURE OF ITS SIZE=IT NEVER PICKED UP SPEED=IT GOT TO THE POINT THAT IT WAS ABOUT STRAIGHT AHEAD OF ME THEN IT SLOWLY STARTED TAKING A TURN TOWARDS THE ISLAND AND STARTED CLIMBING AT THE SAME SPEED =IT TOOK A PERFECT CIRCLE TURN TOWARDS THE ISLAND AND WENT STRAIGHT UP OVER THE TREES ON THE ISLAND WHICH I WOULD EST.TO BE APPROX 50 FEET HIGH,THEN IT DISSAPEARED OUT OF MY SIGHT AS IT WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ISLAND==TROY NY SIDE=THATS PRETTY MUCH IT=I DONT DRINK OR DO ANY DRUGS AND VERY SOUND OF MIND AND LIKE I SAID THIS WAS THE ONLY THING THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN I WOULD CLAIM WAS NOT OF THIS WORLD AND IM 42 YEARS OLD=I WOULD APPRECIATE ONLY ONE THING ==IF SOMEONE WOULD LET ME KNOW IF ANYONE ELSE HAS EVER REPORTED SOMETHING SIMILAR IN NATURE TO WHAT I WITNESSED THAT NIGHT=I HAVE MOVED TO NORTH CAROLINA SINCE THAT TIME", "I and four other people watched a very large cylinder slowly move across the noon sky and enter a long, narrow cloud through one end, not to reappear again.About noon on the 21st of Oct.  1999, I was driving towards the west in my truck when I noticed a very bright object in front of me about 20 degrees up from the horizon. The object looked almost rectangular, it&apos;s width appeared 1/3 that of it&apos;s length. Upon closer inspection, I could see that the object was a very bright white. It&apos;s ends were rounded. Upon arriving at a middle school, the object was still visible. Three additional adults joined me, to witness the sighting. During the time we watched it, two airliners flew above and below, and were dwarfed by it&apos;s size. Slowly the craft moved South, and entered the end of a long narrow cloud. We waited several minutes, but the object never emerged. Upon speaking to a friend later about the incident, he confirmed that he too had seen such an object at approximately the same time of day, and location as I had.", "An extremely fast flash of light moving from southwest to northeast.  Than approximately 20 minutes later the flash reoccured moving northeast to southwest.This event occured before the start of a fire works show.  We were sitting outside looking at the sky and stars waiting on the show to begin when there was a flash of light from the southwest that moved to the northeast, from horizon to horizon.  It was much too fast to be any airplane.  The light appeared a little larger than the size of a star.  At first I thought it could&apos;ve been my imagination, but 2 other people with me saw it also.  About 20 minutes later, the event occured again, only this time, the flash moved in the opposite direction of the previous event (from northeast to southwest).  Again it was so fast that if you had blinked you would&apos;ve missed it.", "I heard area coyotes and dogs howling very loudly and when I went out side I saw a cylindar shaped object with lights in a repeated circular pattern along the bottom. The lights were white and there seemed to be only one light going around portholes fairly fast so it appeared to be more than one.

I looked out the window to see if the neighbour had left for work yet and saw what I thought was a plane.  I looked closer because it was different somehow.  I looked closer and it was a single light source, soft, big, and constant, kind of hazy; not like the small, sharp, blinking lights of a plane known to the public.  It was moving across the sky parallel to the neighbours house.  I just went smoothly west.  The light was bright but not blinding.  It was about ten times the size of the larger stars in the sky.  It took about 3/4 of a second to go from one colout to another.  It shifted or slid from side to the other.  It did not have a deffinate line between the colours but it was more blended.  It passed behind the tree but was still visible due to thin leaves and sparse branches.  It continued for a minute or so and stopped dead, non-moving, then began to retrace its path, exactly.  It stayed in one place for about half a second.  The light never changed its pattern from left to right, or the colour.  About 1/3 of the distance I saw it travel, it became a tapered streak of light, coloured by all of the aforesaid colours.  It was gone and the streak accross the sky dissappeared with it.  I have perfect 20/20 vision and could not have mistaken it.  The sky was as clear as it could have been, no clowns or smoke.  I believed in this contact with other people and other sightings before but became fully aware afterwards.", "While sitting in my patio, I glanced up and was amazed at an array of glowing orange spheres moving across the sky.I was sitting in my patio listening to music, and I glanced up and saw a W-shaped array of large, bright, glowing, orange lights in the sky. My first thought was that it looked like the constellation Cassiopia because of its shape. But it only took about 5 seconds after my initial shock to realize I was seeing something extrordinary. As they drifted westward, they moved in a random, criss-cross manner, very unlike balloons. As two would maneuver across each other, they would brighten. The thing that struck me was that they couldn&apos;t be balloons if they were moving that quickly back and forth, and also they were staying grouped together tightly as they moved across the sky instead of drifting apart as balloons would. Their movements looked very unnatural. One by one I lost view of them as they crossed the constellation Aquila. If anyone else in the L.A. area saw this, please contact me. I would very much like to hear a description of what someone else saw.", "just star gazing and 1 star was movingi was looking up at the stars as i do every night when i take the dog out.then i noticed one of the more distant stars moving.it was moving at a costant speed.traveling from the southeast and heading northwest in a straight line.it&apos;s brightness remained the same during my view and i did not see any tail or vapor trail.this was for sure no airplane!((NUFORC Note:  Except for the assumed direction of flight, this report seems reminiscent of a sighting of a satellite in polar orbit.

One nite while hooking up to a trailer at a large chemical factory I saw a large group of lites passing over head. THe lites were flying very close to each other. I thought it was a low flying jetliner with it&apos;s landing gear open which would be very unusal for around here. After the lites passed over head all of them changed to a flying Vee formation that is when I knew that all those lites were seperate objects. Also there wasn&apos;t any sound.

Stopped and two more appeared in other same vacinity different angles.At 7:35 am, on way to work on Everson-Goshen Rd, between VanDyk Rd. and Pole Rd. looked to east and saw what looked like a jet trail coming straight down towards the earth, but stopped well before it would have impacted. From angle I was at, it was in line with Mt. Baker, but to the north. Sky totally clear and sun not yet visible.  Continued traveling down E. Pole road westerly and continued looking in rear view mirror and second one appeared. It was slightly farther to north of first one and started about the same height but came down at an angle so that if it would have continued it would have formed the letter V, but it stopped well before that. Was shorter than the first one.  Had cell phone and called aunt who lives on E. Pole Rd. As I passed her home, she was outside looking.  As I reached the Guide-Meridian Rd. a third streak had appeared.  It was shorter than either of the first two, but farther to south.  They all seemed to be approximately the same distance away. I entered a fog bank west of the Guide Meridian on the W. Pole Rd and continued to the Aldrich Rd.  Shortly after turning south bound on the Aldrich Rd., I could again see the streaks, but only the last one to appear was still there. Again went into foggy area.  On reaching the Aldrich and Smith Rd. intersection, all the streaks were gone.  There was no wind on ground level so seemed odd to me that they would dissapear that quickly.  It only takes me about 10-15 minutes to get the Guide Meridian and Pole Rd. intersection to the Aldrich and Smith Rd intersection.  When I got to work, I called the local new radio station, KGMI.  They said they had no other calls. Asked around at my work located just west of the Smith and Aldrich intersection on the south side of the Smith Rd.

I was watching the sky when I noticed 4 bright green lights coming from the northeast moving downward at an approximately 45 degree angle.  It was such an unusual sight that I caught my breath and stopped walking to watch. The front light seemed larger, maybe about the size of Venus. The trailing 3 lights were slightly smaller.  All were very bright neon green. They seemed to be perfectly spaced apart and were all moving at the same rate of speed. The rate of speed seemed slow for a &quot;shooting star&quot;.

The most interesting feature was as the colored lights dimmed to disappear,  the trail was still intact, but there were five or six small glowing dots continuing to follow the same trajectory.

My friend there with me is former airforce and said it did not follow protocol with lights etc. no visibal signs of regulated aircraft. all we could say was &quot;Oh my God&quot; . I can&apos;t shake the image from my mind.", "I saw bright light balls with tails flying outside our 24th floor apt. window.I saw roundish, very bright balls of light with tails.  They were flying all in a row and there were about 10-15 of them.  All of a sudden outside our window about 100 feet away, going west to east was a bright light that got my attention.  When I immediately looked out I saw almost out of nowhere were these balls of light with tails flying totally in a straight line.  I&apos;ve never seen anything like it.  I proceded to call the St. Clair Shores police dept. to ask if anyone else had seen what I saw.  They said they didn&apos;t have any other reports.  I then called my mom, two girlfriends(that I didn&apos;t get ahold of) and my fiance and described what I saw.  I was then informed about the metior showers but it didn&apos;t look like that to me.  It was going west to east horizontally in a line, not vertically.  My mom then heard the program on the radio and called me to tell me other people saw exactly what I saw and they were describing it on the radio.  I live in Southeast lower Michigan and someone said at 19:04 someone reported it in Northern Michigan. I also called our local T.V. station to report what I saw after hearing the radio broadcast.", "Fast falling light in the south southeast sky turning from white to green.I live out in the country, I was burning my trash when I noticed in the south southeast sky an unusually bright star high in the sky, while I was looking at it, it got brighter and started falling towards the ground the closer to the ground that it got the faster it fell about 1/4th. of the way down it slowly turned from white to green and got brighter untill it got about 1/4th. of the way from the ground and fissled out.

My sighting is located at the top of the chesapke bay on the elk river just north of the c&amp;d canal. I observed one a/c stationary about 1 to 2 miles south of my home at 100ft. agl. with 3 lites (red, white &amp; green) which indicate nav. lites but where more intense, the white lite normally indicates aft pos. But this appeared to be forward section of a/c. I noticed the a/c was completly motionless for several mins. with on noticeble engine sound. this is almost imposible even for a &quot;helo&quot;, when another a/c appeared along side the other out of no where! I then went &amp; got my wife out of bed to show her &amp; while she was standing next to me another a/c appeared along side the other 2 a/c. We where both concerned at that point, then one the frist a/c that appear moved along the shore line just inland &amp; headed north just east of my location &amp; approached my location moving at 10 to 20 knots. As the a/c closed in on my location I could here a humming sound from the a/c, when it reached my location I could see half of the a/c through the tree line. The a/c was still at approx. 100 ft. agl. and to large to be a &quot;helo&quot; I could see the aft section of this a/c as it moved past my location and noted that the trees were not being moved from any downward thrust at this alt. any manmade a/c would hve to produce 1 to 1 thrust ratio to stay aloft, but yet no sign of this? I did however hear some lite jet fan sound as the a/c were directly over head. The a/c design was unlike anything I HAVE EVER SEEN. After the a/c moved on I noticed other identical a/c moving south to north east &amp; west of my location with the other 2 a/c moving out in the same direction. I worked at phl int&apos;l airport for several years &amp; called the tower there to see if they had any a/c at my location, she replied that there wasn&apos;t any traffic in my section. the whole event took approx 45 mins.", "Bright Comet-like object seen in Washington stateI must say I still believe this was a comet however after searching, I have found no information about a comet this morning (oct 4).  But I am sure others noticed this object as it was quite bright.  I saw it while driving, relatively close to the sun and looking just as a bright comet would (w/ a trail not especially long or unusual for a comet).  I watched the object for a long as I could traveling from the northwest to southeast (approx.), I estimate 10 minutes before I was driving into fog.  As I watched the object traversed the sky in what seemed to be a great distance.  It was obvoiusly quite far away after the 10 mins, and from my perspective very high in the atmosphere.  There seemed to be no erratic movement and changes in shape, light, etc. (except that the light got dimmer as it was farther away)  The light seemed to be white.", "Triangular Shaped Object Hovering Over Frozen Lower Gar Lake No More Than 1500ft (Aprox 1/4 Mile Away) From Bridge I Was Standing On.  Three Brown Lights On Bottom Forming A Triangle.  After I Noticed Object In Sky, I Looked At It For 15 Sec Or So And Then It Went Straigt Up Into The Starry Sky And Was Out Of My Vision In No More Than 5 Seconds.  I Became Startled As I Was A Great Distance Away From Nearest House Or Person And Ran To My Car.  Once There, I Continued Looking Into The Sky Where I Saw The Object Go Up And About 10 Min Later, I Saw 2 High Altitude, High Speed Jets Over The Same Location I Saw Object Disappear Into Sky.I was a senior in High School at the time I saw this object.  I often walked at night alone on a bike trail that cut through a forest near my old house on the lake I used to live to get an adrenaline rush, Lake Minniwasta.  There is a bridge over the lake and on the south side of the bridge is Lower Gar Lake.  I was crossing this brige which is built between two points and glanced at something strange over the frozen lake suspended in the air.  It was three lights in a triangle shape about 50 ft off the lake&apos;s surface, and about 1500ft or so away from where I was standing.  I thought at first they were rural security lights from farms on the south side of the lake, but I looked at them closer and could see the horizon on the south side of the lake and saw the lights I saw were not due to that.  I started to get a little anxious and just as I became a little scared, the object took off straigt up into the cloudless star filled sky.  I mean straight up and was completely gone in less that 5 seconds.  After I saw that, I freaked out and ran back to my parked car about 300 ft away.  I stayed there for a while (5 min or so) looking in awe at what I had just seen.  Then I noticed 2 high altitude jets in the same vicinity I saw the object disappear into the sky above.", "Eran las 7 u 8 de la noche, cuando al salir de mi casa, desde el patio de la casa, en ese entonces sin techo; voltie hacia el cielo ya que por costumbre suelo hacerlo, y vi lo que parecia ser una parrilla formada por 10 o 15 objetos redondos, como del tama&ntilde;o de una pelota de beisbol c/u, llevaban una formacion perfecta por lo que parecia un solo objeto pero en cierta parte de su avance se desformaron un breve instante por lo que pude ver que eran objetos individuales.

Los objetos viajaban de oriente a poniente y emitieron un zumbido un poco grave al pasar por mi cenit.", "As I reported in my first submission, I was standing guard, with a Pvt. Rodriguez.  And noticed a fireball similar to the one I witnessed in Pittsburgh.  And as I reported it to my drill sargent, he thought I was a lunatic.  Then, just about 10 meters outside his tent I viewed an object stealthily coming above me.  It would stop directly over my head, as if it were observing me, and I would stand there just looking back at it.  Originally, it had lights on, and I stood ther just looking and thinking.   I was armed and never once did I think of shooting at the object.  For me it was all time had stood still for this brief moment.  The object turned it&apos;s lights off and stayed hovering above the trees and me for a few more seconds and then it just suddenly took off at a speed unimaginable.  Then, i didn&apos;t understand it, but today I would consider it a blessing, to view these objects.  And I would live all these years never forgetting.  The siting in Pgh. and in Ga are just two of many I would go on to witness..  My next siting would occur in Texas, some time later, at Lake Belton, in Belton County, TX.  This siting was a cigar shaped object and looked like a lit up bus.  There was no sound as it passed over head.  Then, as with now there was no known technology, that could explain these events. I know, firsthand, because I was in the Military Intelligence community at the time and viewed all known Strategic Initiative Technologies, under the then Jimmy Carter, (Carter) Administration.  I would then and now still look to the skies, for more events i have witnessed in my youth.In Georgia the shape was a fireball at first.  And upon my closer encounter, it was rectangular in shape.  It had lights brighter than the new halogen lights of today.  And when i first haeard of the new stealth bomber, i looked forward to seeing it&apos;s shape.  i felt it wpould maybe appear to be the rectangular shape I had witnessed earlier in my life, but it wasn&apos;t.  And I would imagine that the lights that folded into the craft I had witnessed in Georgia, were not there on the stealh bomber.  Rodriguez was from America, probably from the western half of it then.  Where he might be today is unknown to me.  I&apos;m sure he never forgot this night, in GA, either.", "A long line of white lights moving from W to E, absolutely static and rigid, no blinking or sparks, no movement in relation to the other lights, no noise.I saw a line of white lights move from W-SW to E-NE, but generally from W to E.  The lights never blinked, burned out, left sparks or changed position relative to each other.  They were spaced roughly evenly apart, with some a little higher or lower than the centerline of the formation. The length was equivalent to a grapefruit held at arm&apos;s length. The sky was clear with no stars and a half moon.  The unusual thing about this was that the formation was absolutely rigid from horizon to horizon.  I&apos;ve seen meteors before, and this did not look like that.  It could have been a solid object.  The altitude could have been 5,000 ft. or 50,000 ft., it was hard to tell.  I was looking about 45-60 deg. up from the south horizon as the formation moved W to E.

Displayed brief instances(lasting anywhere from 45sec. to approx. 1 minute) of intense brightness, than would suddenly fade very dim, to the point that it would appear to be a distant star. It would stay stationary for lenghts of time, than would move very slowly from side to side and at one point even disappeared briefly just at the edge of the the hills, than suddenly appeared again. At around 2am (2nd sighting) the object displayed all the chararistics as just discribed, but after several minutes of watching it, it suddenly just disappeared. An interesting note; during the second sighting there was an aircraft in the very same vacinity as the ufo during that time, in fact the air craft flew extremely close to the object, but didn&apos;t show any unusal interest in the object. The 2nd sighting I wittnessed alone, where as the 1st sighting was observed by my boyfriend.", "Three dots forming a triangle, Bright gold and glowing white.

I looked out the passenger side of the car and saw a saucer shaped U.F.O. flying past the car heading towards the ground. My dad, who was driving, said &quot;look at that&quot;. I turned to see hom looking out the top of the windshield of the car and I looked up.  There was another U.F.O. flying over the top of the car, heading towards the ground and over the highway.  I remember him saying &quot;There&apos;s no engine noise&quot;.  The U.F.O.&apos;s were a bright, but not blinding, white light.  The one that flew over the car, I could see the underside, which was dark.  But I could see rounded shaped objects, about 3 or 4. Perhaps lights enclosers?  The U.F.O.&apos;s then both flew towards the Highway meeting near the ground. Then they BOTH WENT STRAIGHT UP INTO THE DARK SKY, SIDE BY SIDE. They seperated once they got very high into the sky.  One went over to the left and the other went towards the right..  There they sat still, real high in the sky.  The one on the left, I was able to watch a while, was blinking on and off it&apos;s light.The U.F.O.&apos;s were saucer shaped, and they were of a white light. They whistled when they were traveling at a great speed.  It sounded like the front window vent opened of a truck or like the window vents of the older cars of the sixty&apos;s.  The whistleing became louder as they went past us.  The light coming off the U.F.O.&apos;s was bright, but NOT a blinding light.  I was amazed, to say the least.  My dad to this day will NOT talk about it. The U.F.O. that went over the car was round and dark when I looked up, but as it came down in front of the car, I was able to then see the sides of it. It also was a white lighted, and saucer shaped.   The two U.F.O.&apos;s then met each other, VERY close to the Highway, in front of us, ABOUT (Approx.) 200 hundred yards, then they shot STRAIGHT UP, side by side, into the sky.  They seperated, once they got very high into the night sky.  The one on our left, went to the left and the one on our right went towards the right.  I sat there watching the one on the right out the right side of the car for as long as I could see it.  It moved around a bit, from side to side, then it sat still.  It looked like a star at that point.  It was blinking on and off it&apos;s light.  We were traveling on I-4, heading East towards Deltona, where my parents live.  We were out side city limits of Altamonte Springs, Florida.  I want to say around Lake Mary, Florida when we saw them.  I have read many books of U.F.O.&apos;s since then.  My father still will not talk about it when ever I bring it up, which is very frustrating for me.  The U.F.O.&apos;s were Approx. 40 feet in Diameter. I was absolutly amazed when they shot straight up.  Nothing happened to the car while we observed this.  There were other cars on the Highway, besides us.  The cars that were heading West, on the other side, looked like they slowed down a bit when the U.F.O.&apos;s were coming down in front of us.  I talked to a Mr. ((name deleted)) about my story once, back in about 1994.  He claimed that he was a U.F.O. researcher and he knew people that seriously researched U.F.O.&apos;s.

It was a darkish lime green color with no flashing lights.  At first we thought it was a jet, but no sound or flashing lights came from this object.  We watched it continue across the sky for approximatley 3 to 4 minutes.  It had a circular shape but could possible be oblong or V shape.  We thought it could possibly be the STEALTH, but we realized that in order for the quietness it would have needed to be going a certain speed.  This was going slower than a normal plane. When looking at the object, we were unsure exactly how large it was, because of the depth of the darkness compared to the shape.  No vibrations, no sound, no humming, nothing but complete silence.  We had children trick or treating in our yard with friends, and our first instinct was to get the children inside.  We were very unsure of what this was.

There was no engine sound, just the whosh like air was being fanned out of the way. The UFO in my dream got closer as it circled counter clockwise. Then it shot off. Later that morning after waking up I went out to the kitchen and my daughter asked me if I heard that sound. I was a bit surprised. She defined the same sound that I had in my dream with exact detail. Even the circling. It was such an unusual sound that my daughter ran outside to see if she could see anything. She heard the same sound from far off in the distance about a minute later. Keep in mind that she is 15 and still a little scared of the dark.

Relatively low altitude; discerned from change in perspective of chevron shape.I was out on my deck observing the sky prior to retiring for the night.  I was looking more or less directly overhead at the constellation Cygnus when motion caught my eye.  Turning to my right, I witnessed 5 (or perhaps 7) faint, diffuse, eliptical white lights in a distictly &quot;V&quot; shaped formation, traveling quite rapidly from north to south approximately 45-50 degrees above the horizon.  I had them (it?) in view for approximately 5 seconds before they dissapeared behind a neighbor&apos;s tree.  They appeared to be relatively close, at a low altitude as I could see a definate change in perspective of the &quot;V&quot; as it first approached and then receded across the sky.  Viewing conditions that night were excellent with no cloud cover at all and no wind.  There was absolutely no sound whatsoever associated with this sighting.  The ambient noise level was very low with no road traffic or other neighborhood noise present.  A cold chill ran down my spine, the hair on the back of my neck stood up and I was absolutely stunned.  It took a couple of hours of lying in bed before I finally fell asleep (totally out of character for me).", "I observed a huge, silent, pale green triangular object moving east over the city.My neighbor had just had surgery and she had asked me to put a note on her mailbox telling the mailman to leave any packages at my address. It was approximately seven p.m. when I taped the message on the mailbox and was walking back to my house.   I suddenly saw something huge over my right shoulder.  It seemed to be only about a block away.  It was shaped like a long triangle- almost like a cone on its side.  It was made up of pulsating pale green lights, and it was moving east very slowly.  I looked around to tell someone--I know my mouth had dropped open. My labrador retriever was waiting at the gate for me, but he was the only one around.  I actually started to stop a car that was coming toward me from the direction of the object, but by that time it was disappearing behind the houses.  I estimate it was visible for about ten seconds.  It&apos;s difficult to gage the size of the object, because I&apos;m sure my perception cannot be correct.  It seemed to be the size of a semi-truck less than a block away. I came inside and told my family, then I called the police department to see if anyone else had seen this huge green triangle over Central Avenue.  The dispatcher said yes, it was a meteor shower.  That&apos;s what everyone is seeing. I&apos;m sure everyone who sees what I saw tonight will be told it was a meteor shower. But what I saw appeared to be some kind of machinery.  A giant, silent piece of machinery.  Shortly after I called the police we noticed an unusual number of planes in the area. I have no idea what kind of machine I saw.  I wonder if Wright Patterson has something unworldly going on.

When we all for some unknown reason looked to our right and witnessed a star dancing in the sky.  It appeared to just dance, back and forth up and down, then it came closer.  Suddenly, it took off in a westerly direction, as we chased it.  Two years later I would witness another event similar in nature in Georgia.  While on bivevac training and standing guard with a Private Rodriguez, I saw a star dancing in the sky, similar to the one I seen, as stated previously.  I related this story to Pvt. Rodriquez and wouldn&apos;t you know it.  The star did the exact same thing.  With one exception, I ran to report it to my drill sargent, he thought i was a lunatic.

They did not appear to be flying toward a certain destination.  The objects were located throughout the sky, widely separated from each other and doing their own  maneuvers. They were not in sinc with eachother.On Ocober 25, 1999 I observed from my car some moving lights in the sky that sometimes flashed red and white and didn&apos;t think much of it. I saw approximately five.  I saw the objects in the southeastern sky. I was located approximately 3 miles north of Moravia,NY just to the south of Owasco Lake. It was approximately 7:05 pm.  On October 26, 1999 my fiance was the one to spot the lights at approximately the same time, 7:05.  He had been in a tree stand hunting deer when he first noticed.  He did not know that I had seen them the previous night. I always pick him up on the side of the road when he is done hunting just as it gets dark. On this night, he was already out of the woods when I arrived and was looking up at the sky.  I knew at that moment he was seeing what I saw the night before.  As I pulled over, he waved for me to get out of the car.  We both saw approximately 20 lights, some flashing red and white throughout the southeastern sky.  The azimuth was anywhere from 90 degrees to 180 degrees.  The altitudes of the lights were anywhere from 15 degrees to 60 degrees approximately.  When we looked at any one specific light, you could tell it was moving compared to the stars.  It would flash and appear to stop and then move straight upward from its stopping point.  Then it would disappear (the light) and reappear very close to where it disappeared a second or two ago.  Eventually in a minute or two, another light, a different one would catch the corner of our eyes and we would focus on that.  At one time, you could see approximately five lights without turning your head to a different azimuth.  The five lights would be at different altitudes, but all of them flashed either red or white.  They did not flicker like stars, they flashed. When an object flashed, it did not flash in a certain time interval.  It flashed randomly.  When the objects moved, they would only move in their own section of the sky.  I did not see an object streak across the whole southeastern part of the sky.  When it moved, it e! ither mo ved straight up from where it was stopped (about two or three finger widths at one time). Some of them would then disappear from view completely.  Many of the objects moved in circular or curved paths. The total distance of the paths of any objects I could see for long enough without disappearing was about five to ten fingerwidths.  None of them were going in a straight path parallel to the horizon. As we traveled back home, approximately six miles away from that area, we could still see the objects, but not as many. I called someone that lived in Moravia to view the objects. They saw them too.  I also called someone in Locke, which is just south of Moravia a few miles to view the objects.  They saw them too.  It was approximately 8:30 pm when we could no longer see them.((NUFORC Note:  Under most circumstances, in a case in which objects are allegedly witnessed for 90 minutes, we would first address the possibility that the witness was observing celestial bodies.  However, in this instance, a similar event was reported from the Dayton, OH, area, at approximately the same time.  We are awaiting those latter reports at the time of this writing.))", "At a rest area in southern California my family and I vidiotaped a number of orange lights above a water tower that didn&apos;t move that also emited smokeI was about Ten or so and My family had met up with other relitives to have a reunion at Disney Land.  After the trip all my relitives drove convoy style back with us to Arizona.   About 10 to 20 miles before the Arizona, California border at Yuma we stoped at a rest area.  It was a hot afternoon and we all had to stretch our legs.  I don&apos;t remember who spotted them first but we all witnessed them.  Across the Interstate 10 (north) about a mile from the road was a red and white water tower.  The type used at airforce bases.  We saw 3-4 orange objects about 500 to 1000 feet above the ground.  What was weird was that they were not moving and they emited smoke slowly abouve them.  Each light would (burn) for about 8 minutes and then disapear.  As soon as one would burn out another one would apperar only in a different spot and remain still. I don&apos;t know the length of this event because after about 15-20 minutes we left to Arizona.  But I remember still watching those lights while the sun went down and we drove away.  Some people I&apos;ve talked to say it was a flare, and I think that is a good answer.  But I know that flares slowly desend or shot up and come back down.  Why did these objects remain still and not drop or desend slowly?   All I want to know is what those were and were they flares that never heard of before.  I would really love to hear from you guys.

She experienced that same thing.  Neither of us registered that it had even happened for a minute or two till she asked me if I had seen it. I said I had and that disturbed both of us.  We discussed if it could have been head lights passing over our apartment window, as we are on the second story, but both came to the conclusion that it could not have been so as it was just to bright.

Broke up into 4 pieces.Approx. 7:00-7:15pm Tuesday evening I was driving west on West Chester road, (about 12 miles north of downtown Cincinnati, OH) when I noticed a Bright white fireball in the western sky. Knowing that the Leonid showers where near I thought &quot;Wow, this could mean they are starting early and should be very good tonight&quot;but quickly realized that the Leonids would be from the East, not the West. It quickly turned bright green and grew to the size of about 1/2 thumbnail at arms length. An orange tail stretched out behind the fireball to a length of approx. 1 1/2 to 2 fists when held at arms length. It arched across the night sky in front of me from the left of my windshield to my right passenger window and appeared to break into 4 large pieces, (now yellow) and drop behind the trees to my right. It appeared very low in the sky and most remarkably, it seemed to move in slow motion for a metiorite. To illustrate just how long it was in the sky, about 1/2 way through its flight, I had time to slow the car down and remove my seat belt to watch it. Just then I saw the headlights of another car approaching from the other direction and since this was a winding country road, I thought I had better pay more attention to my driving and proceeded to drive past this approaching car and when I pulled off the road to see if I could still see the tail, I was shocked to see it still traveling above the tree line over my right shoulder.

This reminded me of the film of the re-entry of the U.S. space station over Australia many years ago. This was the most impressive event I have ever seen. Most of the city saw the object and the radio, (700 WLW) talked about it for the rest of! the nig ht.

Light remained stationary for several minutes (10-20) then moved rapidly across sky towards the south. Then it just dissapeared. Saw 3 planes (could tell by their flashing lights) follow along same path between 2-3 minutes after light dissapeared.", "Saw a very bright streak of light at about 500-1,000ft altitude with bright multicolored flashes of light emmiting from it. Estimated speed of object around 75-100mph, and estimated length of the object at around 300-1,000ft. A neighbor witnessed the object with me and said it could not have been a meteor because it was traveling too slow and did not burn up. Also it was brighter and more colorful than any shooting star I&apos;ve ever witnessed. Witnessed object for about 45-60 seconds.Saw a very bright streak of white light with bright multicolored flashes of light emmiting from the entire length of the object. I would estimate that the object was at about 1,000ft altitude, with the length of the object at around 300-1,000ft, and estimated speed of the object at around 75-100mph. I first saw the light through some tree branches and thought someone was lighting fireworks off. Then when the object passed a tree where I could get a look at it I said &quot;what in the world is that?&quot; because my neighbor was getting out of his car. When he witnessed the object, he said &quot;are we seeing ufo&apos;s or something?&quot; He dismissed the object as being a meteor because it was moving so slow, and because it was fairly close to the ground.

About 4 seconds, moving fast and no sound, and seemed only about 500-1000 ft. high. Looked solid. The second object: a cluster of dim stars in a line, large, moving from north to south very fast. About 5 seconds and higher altitude. The third object: a dim larger star, moving from north to south fast, same altitude as second object: Could be meteor, but no tail. Fourth object: Straight up, looked like a satelite going from north to south, but much faster than previous seen, and also shorter viewing time than other satelites seen, 3 seconds.", "Pinpoint of light travelled from east to west breifly then hovered for about an hour then disappeared.At 21:30 (CST) I looked out of my window to see what I thought was a plane. It was a pinpoint of light about twice as bright as venus and had an orange yellow hue. Watching the light from my window I looked for other blinking lights like you normally see on aircraft wings etc. I thoght something was strange when no other lights were visable. Expecting the object to pass over my house I went outside to get a better look, as I had a strange feeling. I spotted the light outside onlt to find it had stopped forward movement but did sway from side to side as if were hovering, much like a helecopter. We ruled out a helecopter because we could not here it nor were ther any other lights around it like you normally see on a helecopter. Also we can&apos;t think of a reason why a helecopter would hover at that alltitude in a rural setting. Watching the pinpoint of light for thirty minutes or so I finally went to bed. I woke up at 00:30 (CST) and looked to find the light was now gone.", "Best described as a reverse shooting star. A point of light streaking upward quite a distance to the east of me.Not a big event all in all, but thought it might be useful if someone closer saw more detail.  Aproximately 01:50 Thurs. morning, 10-28-99, I was driving eastbound on 120th St. (gravel road in the country, 2 miles south of Augusta). About 10 degrees to the south of due east I saw a white point of light streak up at about 15 degrees to the south of vertical. My impression was that it was also moving away. (Mostly up, but a slightly southeasterly heading. My first thought was that it reminded me of a reverse shooting star. It didnt seem to have a tail other than a tracer effect due to the speed it traveled. It went from just above the horizon to gone (about 60 degrees up) in about 1 1/2 seconds. Again, not a major event, but might lend credence if someone way east of me saw it before it departed. I&apos;m an experienced pilot and know nothing earthly moves that fast.

The object was about the diameter of a full sized split foyer house if looking at it from the side view.  It disappeared when I went outside. I went to the back of our property and looked out over this open pasture and about 1/4 to 1/2 mile away was a small round white object about five feet in diameter flying in a very erratic fashion about 5 feet above the ground.

Glanced up at the sky in NNE direction and saw a series of amber lights...manisfesting East to West almost instantly. Two more appeared almost instantly after just below the first line of lights to the lower lefthand end.  They were bright amber color, as bright as a 100watt floodlamp at 100 yards.  I have a measurement because a neighbor has such a light. They were up for approximately 30 seconds before disappearing instantly.  I called my wife as soon as I saw the lights but they were gone by the time she came out.  But one appeared at a lower altitude and further West that she did see. Afterwards, there were aircraft lights flashing green,red and white below and on both sides where the ambers were...but not in exact same spot. It has been almost a year to the day, that I saw two lights of the same description in the same area.  Where one light appeared and a spark ensued and went down to about 8 O&apos;clock level and grew as bright as the first one.  These lasted about 15 seconds before disappearing.

I thought it was a satellite, judging by the speed it was traveling. When it was straight above, still traveling east, it appeared to split and become two white lights.

This did not appear to be a plane or helicopter due to the erratics manuvuers it was making. It stayed in the same area, approximately 10,000 feet high over the south shore of Long Island. It had an up and down, side to side and even a diagonal motion to it. Periodically there were faint blue flashes emitting around it. It was a diamond to saucer type shape.

Observed a very small, light green (almost floresent)in color, with some white spots, circular shaped light, shoot across a small portion of sky, disappearing over the horizon. When first observed, it appeared to be about 15 degrees above the horizon, almost straight south (slightly west) of my location. Size:  Extending my arm straight out in front of me, fingers pointed upward, it appeared to be about half the size of my small fingernail. The light appeared to be an object only in that it appeared to have a clearly defined border (inotherwords, it was not hazy at the edges). It appeared to be moving from northeast to southeast in direction, traveling in a straight line, dissappearing from my sight due to rooftops at about 10 degrees above horizon. It also appeared to be loosing altitude.  But this appearence may be due to its speed and direction of travel, in relation to my stationary location. Extending my arm out in front of me, while holding a ruler, it traveled 4 to 5 inches while dropping about 2 and a half inches. The entire event lasted only about a half of a second.", "At daybreak, object (with recessed light in nose, and soundless) passed by us in the low clouds. It was barely getting light enough to focus in on it. At its closest point to us, the light went off as it went into the low cloud cover. I was able to determine that from its nose the geometry was delta, or triangular, as I couldn&apos;t distinguish the shape of the rear half of the object.  It was soundless, and there was no wind noises after it passed.Myself and 2 close friends were in our cornstalk blind duck hunting one fall morning.  Our decoys were out, and it was still dark.  Daybreak was upon us, and as it got lighter, my vision of the distance increased. In those days, because of my extremely accute long distance vision, I was the spotter, and my 2 buddies manned the duck calls. The cloud ceiling was very low, as we looked to the East where the faint light of daybreak was commencing. Then about a quarter mile towards the Northeast, I saw a round light skimming in and out of view in the low clouds heading South at about 50(?) mph.  Because of the subdued lighting, identification was impossible.  However, when the craft passed directly in front of us at its closest distance (1/8th mile), my focus zeroed in.  Its light then went out as it went into the clouds.  I was able to determine that its light was recessed somewhat into the nose of the craft, and about a foot in diameter.  I saw only the first 10 feet or so of the craft.  Moving back from the recessed headlight, the shape was &quot;delta/triangular&quot;.

Last night around 6:05 pm (central) he was driving home when he saw a streak of light that seemed motionless. He said that if he had measured it in the car window it may have been about 1 1/2 to 2 inches long. He&apos;s not sure about the width as his view was partially obscured from the trees. He noticed it for quite a few minutes from what I gather. He said it didn&apos;t seem to move, in fact it seemed to follow his car. He said it was very bright and was greenish/white in color. He thought he&apos;d get a better view when he came around a curve and it was less wooded. When he did, where this object should have been it was just gone. He slowed down and looked for it but it was gone. I believe he said it was in the western sky.  If it helps, on the map we&apos;re about in the middle of Tennesse, nearly on the TN/KY border.

I went up the exit ramp, and the van that I had just passed had shut its lights down to a military style blackout drive. (very dim marker lights) I had stopped on the entrance side of the turnoff ramp to catch some sleep. upon stopping, I noticed that this same van had turned off to the right at the top of the exit. I tried for an hour to get some sleep at this location. but I found it was quite impossible.  a train had passed by on the railroad tracks adjacent and to the north of the highway exit. it had stopped as well, and dropped off two railcars at this location. after witnessing two more vans exiting the highway there in blackout drive, and hearing the sounds of alot of heavy, slow moving vehicles in the distance, without a hint of bright light anywhere, I was sufficiently scared enough to leave the area.  about a month later, I had read the PM article on area 51, and its closure ant move elsewhere, after looking at a flight map for the western portion of the US.

It slowly traced the shoreline over approx. 100 feet for several minutes.  It then shot inland at a very high speed with little more than a slight whoosh.  15 minutes later it returned to the same spot. After several minutes of shoreline tracing it seemed to lose control, traced out a 5 point star pattern, each leg being about 50 feet in length and crashed into the water about 50 feet off the shoreline where it broke open. Inside was what appeared to be a fiber optic &quot;looking&quot; cable bunch about 4 or 5 inches in diameter. Wall thickness appeared to be 1/4 to 1/2 inch, smooth inside and out. It floated on the water for about 10 minutes still glowing. After 10 minutes it slowly dimmed and sank. In the summer 1981 in Datona Beach I saw an object shaped like a fat flat hour glass on a disk.

Church and unobscured clear weather view of the sky in direct path. Got up to change channel on TV and was drwn towards the window by bright orange glowing objects outside and to the south behind the church. Six Objects in formation. One other that was much lower and cruising appoximately one hundred feet above the power lines. They came over the apartments where I was living and I could see them quite clearly from the center courtyard second floor catwalk. They (6) stopped in mid flight just when passing to my direct west and abruptly changed direction from due north to west. I&apos;d say that they were each about the size of a quarter at arms length away from the body. The rogue ship that was lower never did come up above the horizon from where I was watching this. At this point a neighbor was awakened by what he thought was an explosion and came outside to where I was standing with another person to watch the sighting. I did not hear any noise from the objects during the ten minutes that they were in my complete view. As they ascended at 45 degrees azimuth they seemed to be shooting sparks out from the rear and I could see small silvery disks being ejected from the object that were not illuminated except from the orange glow of the UFO. They quickly were lost sight of after they descended into the darkness. At this time three other presons were returning home from a late night poker game and immediately came up the catwalk to see what was going on. This was approximately 8 minutes after they were first spotted by myself. The next day I talked to another of my neighbors who also witnessed it but was too frightened to come outside and watch it with us. After nine minutes of observation the two objects to the right and left of the center object blinked out. The remaining two objects sped off at a fantastic rate of speed. I could still see them for only a few more seconds before they were out of my vision range.  After the sighting was over we called the local radio station (KGIL) to report the sighting. The overnight board operator said that he received one other report from someone in Van Nuys, CA. The next morning, we called the local US Air Force to report the sighting. the officer told us, &quot;We do not know what they are.&quot; Also, I observed a LAPD patrol car going down Vanowen St. at Ethel Avenue to the West. I not sure if he saw it too. But, I think that it would have been very visible to anyone that managed to be outside and looking up. I managed to somehow snap a single photo from a Kodak instamatic 126 camera of a single object. It was not very impressive! But, I still have the negative available. Unfortunately, I didn&apos;t remember taking the photograph until four years later!

I had just arrived home from work (I am a practicing Doctor of Chiropractic in Baltimore and travelled straight home after office hours). I was standing on my front porch.  I was totally sober and do not need sight corrective glasses.  The objects moved rapidly...about the speed of fast, low flying fighter jets.  They caught my eye because of the straight line formation that they maintained and the number of them. I originally thought that they may be jets but the comet like tails did not apply...jets don&apos;t have a highly visible tail at night and do not appear as an orange ball of fire. The comet-like tails dissipated into a shower of small sparks.  The largest was in front with smaller objects following.  All travelled in a straight, level line. They all began to disappear at the same time when they reached the north-east sky leaving a twinkling of sparks behind for approximately 1 second after the disappearance of the round objects which then slowly faded away.  This occurred during the Leonid meteor shower period but was unlike any falling star that I have ever seen.  The size, color, speed, formation, number, and sparking tail did not fit the appearance of a falling star (a falling star appeared within 20 seconds of the occurrence but was of a silver appearance, was much smaller in size, fell from overhead to the horizon in the north east sky, and disappeared as it approached the horizon).", "Saw circle of flames that then reduced size to single light,travelled quickly across the sky and was followed by military fighter plane.Driving home from work one night I saw a perfect circle of flames (but not extending past circles border) at what seemed to be approximately 300 yards away and the size of a helicopter.(my first thought was that it was a lunar eclipse,but you could very distincly make out the flames(almost pulsating)) I wanted to get to the place where it looked like it was hovering so I accelerated quickly and at the same time it all but disappeared to a small light and started travelling upwards towards me.When I reached the general area that I thought it would be,it was still rising.I couldn&apos;t tell exactly how far away it was at this point(1-10 miles or more?),but I realized that the farther away it was,the bigger it was.The original circle was  obviously at least half a mile or more in diameter from the distance it seemed to be.

My mother looks to the south behind their orchard and observes two enormously large, what appeared to be circular objects with blinking red lights hovering approximately 500 feet in the air. The craft were spaced about 200 feet apart. They hovered in this position for between 60 and 90 seconds and there was no sounds at all heard coming from these craft. One craft then sped North over there home and the other went due East. When the craft left the area, they left at an unbeliveable speed, no sound what so ever heard, and the red lights that where observed changed to white when they departed.

It was a report of a &quot;Dimensional Porthole&quot; opening in which I saw Kennedy&apos;s head w/eyes closed and a gray behind him..Just heads...Here in Mass. we still seem to have at least one plane and occupant missing, last heard from in Southern MA, and 2 people missing from boats in area between where Kennedys&apos; plane went down and Martha&apos;s Vineyard. Third body was found. His boat was found also.  Anyway, now The 767 today went down in the same area...45 miles South of Nantucket...Nantucket and Martha&apos;s Vineyard are in close proximity close to Southern Mass and Rhode Island. This, coupled with the fireball of last Wednesday, seems to put this part of the Eastern North American Coast into some sort of area that is not very healthy...to say the very least..guess we might even add Payne Stewart&apos;s wayward 35A to this list on the Eastern seaboard.  Just had to tell you.. Also, remember I told you 2 years&apos; ago, I heard a voice upon awakening say &quot;Soon this planet shall not be as you remember it&quot;..well, 3 weeks ago, 3 days in a row, upon awakening, a voice said  &quot;Stay where God can find you&quot;.  I have to repeat that I believe in God, but am no means fanatic and do not attend church at all regularly, not for years... Just want to add to the strange happenings that are occurring.

It is much larger then a star.((NUFORC Note:  Visible satellites do not &quot;hover,&quot; as this report seems to suggest they may.  We suspect the witness is seeing a celestial body of some sort.

I quickly got up and ran to the east door.  Through the glass door I saw around 5 (white with yellow/orange)balls of light travling in a straight line,directly behind eachother, like slow comets with short wide tails.  The tails were aout twice as long as the objects, and slightly wider.  Each tail stoped before the next object began.  They were decending to the east at an approximate angle of 60 degrees. I called for my daughters and we quickly went outside.  We saw them go down below the tree line toward Lapeer.  They went over my house, to the south.  My wife saw the same thing, she was 10 miles west of us in Flint. I immediately called the police.  They received several calls, including the flight administration saying a plane went down.  This was no airplane or meteor.  There were no flames, only a strange, plasma like tail that disipated.

Smaller bright lights appeared and disappeared near it.Driving to church Wed. night with family just after sundown.  I saw a bright orange glowing object at about 30 deg. above horizon due west.  It was the color of the setting sun so at first I thought it was a sundog or jet trail reflecting sunlight.  It was brighter than Venus would be in the same position and about 3 times as large.  It was also elongated.  I called it to the family&apos;s attention and we watched it for about 3 minutes until we arrived at church.  My 9 year old daughter said she saw a small bright light shoot out of it.  I just laughed it off, thinking still that it must be some atmospheric phenom.  After parking at church we all got out of our vehicle to watch the object.  It appeared to be moving very slowly up and to the south.  Suddenly a small bright white light, similar to jet landing lights, appeared in the south and quickly moved to intercept the larger light at what appeared to be a very high rate of speed.  My daughter said it was the same thing that had been &quot;shot out&quot; earlier.  As the small light approached the larger light my wife exclaimed &quot;It disappeared!&quot; but I could see that the small light was actually at the front of the object, very close to it like it was matching the larger one&apos;s speed.  After about a minute it did actually disappear.(maybe into the larger light) Then as light faded in the sky the brighter light started to fade and accellerate on the same course. It faded away about a minute later.

It was heading northeast at about 3000 feet and approximately 300-350 miles mph.  It was first seen below the full moon for about 3 or 4 seconds.  The whole sighting lasted about 20 seconds.  These figures are of course estimated.  No sound could be heard above the outside plant noise (which was moderate).  The bottom of the craft was seen from the 5th floor at the plant.  It looked grayish in color.  The craft appeared to be a little longer than the fuselage of a Boeing 707.  Two large white blinking lights were on the end.  Both lights blinked at the same time.  Another small red light appeared in the middle.  Two small white lights were in front bottom of the braft.  These lights also blinked.  I was outside and looking toward the moon, which was high up in the Eastern sky.  It was cloudless at the time in that section of the sky.  The outline of the craft could clearly be seen because of the moonlight.  The craft was last seen just east of the local GE plant and still flying horizontal.  I later called Rickenbacker Air National Guard Base&apos;s control tower.  No other calls were received about this sighting.

It looked large enough to be close but I didn&apos;t hear any sound from it. It moved directly east towards Lake Michigan and eventually I lost sight of it. I probably saw it for 15-25 seconds. I&apos;m not saying I think it was a UFO, but I don&apos;t think it was a regular plane either. Plane lights generally flash, this object was a solid bright white the entire time. Plus, it had a very bright white tail. Finally, it moved very quickly. I think when a plane moves that fast it makes some sort of sonic boom sound.

This is as fresh as it gets as I wrote down the descritions as they talked verbatum.*** Mother and son were driving South in the town of Sycamore Ill to Dekalb, Il to visit her daughter. They were still within the city limits and on a main road when the sighting occured. The son excitedly told his mother to look out of the window to the right and at first saw the lights of a small low flying airplane. Then she saw what the son saw and she said, &quot;almost had a heart attack&quot;. She pulled the car over to the shoulder extreemly quickly and both exited the car to look at the object. The mother and son both saw what appeared to be a large &quot;fireball&quot; type object streaking across the sky from the West to the East. She described the size as that of a basketball or two in diameter with a long, solid tail coming off of the end that was 10 &quot;heads&quot; long. she said that the head of it was very clearly defined and circular. They both agreed that both the head and the tail were multi-colored and that the head was mostly red with white, purple, and yellow. They both watched the event for what theysaid could have been as long as 4 minutes from the time the son saw it until it dissapeared below the horison to the East. The object was moving quickly but slow enough for them to stop get out of the car and watch it traverse the sky for some time. The son was particulary adiment on the fact that the object &quot;lit&quot; the surounding area enough that when he looked into the car he could clearly see the dirt on the floor of the car in an otherwise dark area. The woman also agreed that the surroundings were definately illuminted by the object but oculd give no exact mesurement because she never took her eyes off of the object. The woman was particulary shaken because she grew up in a house where her brother was a meterologist and spent much of her life with her head pointed to the sky and said it looked like no meteor she had ever seen. She said, &quot;I&apos;m fourty years old and I have NEVER seen anything like this in my life.&quot; The last thing she mentioned was that after the event, both her and her sons eyes &quot;felt strange&quot; and that they &quot;stung and felt slightly burned&quot;. She said that her eyesight was physically diffrent as they drove on and even an hour and a half after the event when I spoke to them her eyes still felt a bit strange.

Extingushed at near overhead.  Cone angle 20 approx. Deg.Observed Bright light to south with streaming contrail of smoke.  Object was apparently entering atmosphere.  Ablation cone of approximately 20 degrees was observed with occasional bursts of sparks.  Object was in a very shallow angle because it was observed in a South to North trajectory from near horizon to approximately 80 degrees (near overhead).  Object ablation cone appeared to flare out near termination of the event at which point it extinguished with a glow that rapidly dissipated.  Total transit time for the object from first observation to termination was a on the order of 20 seconds.  I and my two sons were traveling southbound on Tracy Boulevard approaching the intersection with Schulte Road.  During the object&apos;s transit there were at least 4 times in which sparks burst from the object, lighting up the ablation cone. My son first called attention to the object.  I continued driving and found a place to stop.  As we got out of the truck it extinguished at near overhead.  the trajectory of the object was very nearly South to North.  Estimating the altitude, I would place the path to be directly overhead at Dublin California, approximately 30 Miles to the West.  This is of course the weakest of the estiamtes because I really could not tell how high it was for sure. If I had to guess, I would probbaly attribute this to the decaying orbit of a satelite in a polar orbit.  It was too slow for a falling star and too fast for an airplane.  What most impressed me was how long the object remained in view and the extremely shallow angle of the trajectory.  It would be impossible for me to say that the path was not indeed horizontal((NUFORC Note:  Observer seemed exceptionally qualified.

As them moved along very slowly from the bottom of the craft underneath several thin, but bright pink or red tentacles would roll down about 25 feet, stay there for several minutes and then go back up inside the object. This was repeat over and over again ever so much of a distance. We follow for several miles(5to7), never losing visual contact until they just vanish right before our eyes. also in the local newspaper the police had reported seeing these objects,several days in a roll.These are not the only ufo&apos;s I have seen in this same area. some I have seen on the ground at only 50 yards away (3cigar shaped), a T-shaped object close up just hanging in the air for about and hour and big as a city block. there are others, but I won&apos;t go into that now. thank you for your time, I hopr this is helpful in some way.", "Bright objects, red and green flashing lights (and a diffuse white light off to one side of the larger of the two objects), about 30 degrees over horizon (in the East-Northeast part of the sky.

Too fast and too silent for any aircraft.I almost posted this to a newsgroup last night, but I didn&apos;t want my e-mail address to be floating around or have people write me or flame me.  I found this site this morning so here is where I will post it: I was outside with my mother while she smoked and I began to look up at the stars.  After a short while, I was facing NW but looking almost straight up when I noticed what I first thought was an owl flying around.  Then I realized that the flight pattern - tight figure 8&apos;s and circles - and speed it was flying at would be impossible for a bird or plane.  I watched it further and noted the shape, it had the chevron shape - almost like a boomerang - but the color was kind of like what a gray or silver car would look like by starlight alone.  The size or altitude was hard to tell because there were no buildings or mountains around it, it was almost straight up from my house. I told my mother about it and it took her sometime to finally see it.  By this time, the object&apos;s erratic flight had placed it almost directly above the house.  She ran inside to get some small binoculars, we have no video camera and it was too dim for a photograph.  While she was inside, I noticed a plane approaching the object from the north.  The plane must have been very high up because I did not hear it but I could see lights.  When the plane got to within what to me was about 8-10 inches, the object began to move towards the south while still flying it circular patterns.  It made a final 2 circles and then turned and sped away in a straight line to the south.  I watched it for as long as I could but I eventually lost in the glare of the LA lights.

It was a large triangle shaped object that made no noise and was moving at a fairly high rate of speed.  I know it was triangle because it had a bright light at each point.The object moved across the sky slow enough for us to really get a good look at it.  It made no noise, at least not that we could here and was in the shape of a triangle.  At first I thought it was a plane or some kind of formation used by military aircraft.  I realized that this was not the case when I noticed that this object was close enough to us that if mthey were tradtional planes, we would have heard them fly by.  It never turned or made any sudden moves, just traveled from the southwest to the north-northwest and eventually out of sight.  We passed it off as something no one would ever believe, and something we could ,never prove we saw, but I recently saw a news report here in Columbia that described others who had seen the same thing my friend and I saw, so for what it&apos;s worth, we saw it to but have no earthly idea what it was.  It was triangle in shape with lights at each corner, it was fairly large and made no noise, the middle of the craft looked open or see through but I may be wrong about that, but it definently was not a solid craft because I could see stars in the sky within the triangle of lights.  This is true, I don&apos;t want to be famous or popular, I just want to know what it was I saw, and I wanted to somehow let those that have seen this object that they are not alone.", "Horizon to horizon in 10 seconds.

On approach it was obvious it was not a helicopter or headlight on an airplane. Its appearance was that of a fireball. It had a greenish metalic core surrounded by an orange glow. It could have been flaming except it did&apos;nt have a flaming tail but it did leave an extremely large vapor trail in its wake. My second thought was a meteor but the size of it (a dime held at arms length) I was waiting for a catastrophic explosion similar to when the dinosaurs became extinct but that did&apos;nt happen.

Their aircraft was about 5 miles to the right of us at 35000 ft. also going westbound as they reported seeing the lights to the left at roughly their altitude. ATC responded that there was nothing special on there radar. While we still had the lights in sight, we also reported the sighting to air traffic control and shortly after another aircraft in the area did the same but we did not note its flight number.

When we got there I got out of the passenger side of his car and shut the door. He started driving off headed west as i looked east. There was this gigantic silent maroon/orange/red ball/sphere/fireball thing just fixed in the sky not moving. It was quite low. I was frozen for a second in thought. I actually thought it to be the moon and some sort of apocalyptic thing, although it was not where the moon was supposed to be. I turned around to alert my friend, but he was pulling away. At that point I felt a great fear and kind of panic. I looked at it for another moment and then went into the house and kind of ignored my family. I regret deeply not staying out to watch it or alerting my family. I was seriously freaked out, though! I sat in my room and did just about anything to divert my attention from what i had just seen. Then at about 1:30 AM, i went outside and the moon was just how and where it should&apos;ve been, which was northwest in the sky to where this very strange object was.

I went to the back of my yard which is west.

During the later part of the half hour they moved to the center portion of the southern sky in widening colescing circles. Then before they stopped they moved back to the southwest, for the last five minutes or so. They moved at extreme speeds in the sky. As quick as you could wave your hands in the sky. Their relative size was a little smaller than the full moon. The three lights seemed to difuse a bit as they reached the outside of their circle before coming together in the middle when they crossed paths again and again. After a half hour of my viewing this they came together and ceased. They seemed like 3 transparent lights,shaped somewhat like manta rays. There was a light cloud cover while this was happening and the objects stayed under this even though the western sky toward the beach was clear with no clouds.

We don&apos;t see much of each other but last week I visited her for a few days. My sister and I are very close and we talk freely with each other. As close as we are she reluctantly told me about her encounter with a u.f.o. the following is her experience: She had pulled into the parking lot of the V.F.W. where she had worked at that time ( keep in mind she is a non-drinker, as I have said she is a very responsible person)upon exiting her car she noticed a strange object hovering at the other end of the parking lot above a small patch of trees about 40ft. from her car. She told me that the craft was very large, but couldn&apos;t tell exactly what color it was because at that time of the evening the sky was dark. She told me that the disk shaped object had six very bright lights that flashed around the perimeter of the object as it hovered motionless and silently above the patch of trees. She told me that she stood and observed the craft for about ten minutes and the craft just sat there hovering, then to my amazement she told me that she turned and walked to the V.F.W. and unlocked the door and entered the building to prepare for her evenings work. I ask her if she didn&apos;t think it was strange to just turn and walk away from the strangest event that she will probably ever encounter in her life, her response was that she had work to do before the customers arrive. She told me that a few minutes later that she looked out a window of the building and the craft was gone. She told me that while standing and observing the object she was in awe but had no fear and she felt strangely calm. She also told me that didn&apos;t appear to have any time period that she couldn&apos;t account for. The mysterious part of the whole esperience is that Hollsopple is a small town and only one person that she knows observed the object and he was driving on a highway that was about two miles from the site where she was. As I said Hollsopple is a small town and I believe there had to be more eye witnesses, but my sister said that no one else had said anything except for a few phone calls to a t.v. station in Johnstown reporting a strange object that they had seen in the night sky. I am writing to you after conviced my sister that she should pursue this incident further.

An airplane on the way to Prescott Airport flew just west of and below the objects and they appeared to be much higher than the plane. There was no sound and no apparent movement at first. They appeared as if they were hugh, yellow stars. Then they started moving somewhat like a helicopter would move. Their formation at first consisted of three objects forming a triangle and a 4th off to the side (see Diagram 1). Then the 4th object moved to the bottom and off to one side (see Diagram 2). The remaining three objects then formed a vertical, perfectly straight line (see Diagram 3), moving very slowly. The 4th object remained in its position the whole time. All at once they changed color from yellowish to a dull orange all at the same time. One of the three objects then moved up towards the middle object and almost touched it &amp; remained there for a few seconds before resuming its original position (see Diagram 4). The three objects then formed a straight line again and once more one of the three come up to meet another, almost touching again. We have never seen anthing come that close together without a collision. Finally, all four of them made a horizontal, perfectly straight line and then disappeared all at once (see Diagram 5). We could not detect any shape to the objects or lights on them. They appeared, as stated before, to just be hugh, bright, yellow stars, except that they moved &amp; made various formations. Two of the observers own a business in Prescott Valley. Another observer is employed by them as a salesman and is a former police officer from Phoenix. The fourth observer is a department manager of a local store. We do not know the backgrounds of the restaurant personnel. We will be sending a copy of an official map indicating our position at the time of the sighting.", "Triangle shaped object hovering above farmlandAS me and my friend were headed to youth group I looked out the passenger side I saw a triangle shaped object with three lights on each point and a bright red light in the middle.  It appeared to be hovering which could have just been because of the movement of the vehicle however there was no noise.  It appeared to change its position as we would only see 2 white lights then all of them then only 2 again as if it was turning. Because of the movement of the vehicle it soon dissapeared behind some trees.((NUFORC Note:  Report submitted anonymously.  We have no way to corroborate the report.))", "Vee shaped craft flew low over campfire where  women were sitting.Four professional women were sitting around a backyard firepit drinking coffee at around midnight. A small vee-shaped craft (approx.12-15 feet wide) with dull yellowish lights along the vee flew silently over at tree top level. It frightened us and we quickly threw coffee onto the fire so we could run into the house. Before we could put the fire out, the craft turned and made a second pass over us. I felt that the fire had attracted it and it was checking it/us out. We did not see it again. You may use my report but not my name. Thanks", "((NUFORC Note:  We believe the aircraft were military C-17 transports, flying in formation.  We have confirmation from an FAA duty officer, who also witnessed the a/c over Kent.  They flew over Ballard, Queen Ann Hill, Sand Point, and many other areas.))I saw two craft in the sky headed northwest, on a precise landing path for Boeing Field in Seattle.  They reappeared ten minutes later going the exact opposite direction.I was sitting in my bedroom watching television, when I noticed some lights going through the sky.  My bedroom window faces south, so I get a good view of planes landing at Boeing Field, and lights moving outside don&apos;t usually get me thinking.  This time, it was different.  The lights were moving too slow and their altitude was too low for them to be on a landing path.  At first glance, I thought they looked like Boeing 777s.  But at a closer look, things didn&apos;t seem to add up.  There were two craft, both moving at 200-250 mph.  Their altitude was approximately 2000 feet and they were lined up precisely one behind the other and about 1000 feet distance.  Their running and strobe lights were all green, which I know does not comply with FAA regulations.  They were noisy, just like any commercial jet aircraft. Their course never deviated at all, until they were out of sight.  What puzzled me the most is that they came back in the exact same formation ten minutes later, moving at the same speed, altitude, and direction as before, until they disappeared into the southeastern sky.  My home is located in the Panther Lake area of East Hill in Kent, Washington.  I don&apos;t know if this has any relation to my sighting, but earlier in the day I saw four white helicopters circling the area between here and highway 167, which is about two miles to the west.  These craft had no markings at all either.", "seen 3 bright objects moving from west to east.Seen 3 bright objects moving from west to east in the southern sky.

Everyone, (two others), got up to look, then we all ran into the back yard.  It passed very close to us, maybe 80 to 100 feet high and 300 feet away. It was quite large, 55 to 100 feet long.  It moved very slowly, maybe 15 mph, allowing us a good view of the underside of the craft. There was no discernable sound. We all described the same shaped object with only a few differences. I saw a triangle with two &quot;headlights&quot; positioned about a third of the way back on each side, round white lights on each tip of the triangle and a red light in the center.  The other two witnesses saw a triangle with a yellowish light in the center and flashing red lights around the perimeter of the craft. I lost sight of it as it moved east because I went into the house to get fourth witness. When I returned with the fourth witness the craft was already in a turn and heading southeast. He and I described the object identically, however, as it was turning I saw a bright white light drop from its right side. I did not see where the second object (light) went. The fourth witness ran into the house and dialed 911. That call was received ao 10:01P/CST. We refrred to NUFORC. (Uploaded by investigator. Note: It has been suggested that the witnesses saw a DC9 on a routine nightly flight. There is a flight that arrives at Columbia Regional Airport between 10:00 and 10:15P/CST and leaves at approximately 10:35. But airport director, Bill Boston, said that this flight would probably not be in the area of this sighting.

It was travelling from my left to my right, west to east.  I watched the light until I could no longer see it, 15-20 seconds.  It was behind a group of trees so I never saw it in the open sky.  The color remained greenish with white splotches.When I first saw the object it was just a spere or ball shape.  It startled me so I dashed from my vehicle to the corner of my house, about 3 seconds.  When I next looked the object had elongated into what looked like a streak of green and white.  There were many breaks in the streak because of the trees.  My first thought was that it might have been a firecraker someone had set off, but it lasted to long.  It appeared that from the head area little white lights kept on being emitted.  The light  travelled from my left to my right, which would be a west to east direction.  It maintained a straight path, never vering in any direction.  I never saw the object in the open sky, as it moved behind a tree line in front of my house.  We live on a hill and I had only a slight upward glance to see it plainly.  It appeared to be very close to the ground from my perspective.  I have never seen anything like this before.  I have seen shooting stars and this was nothing like that.  The closest thing I could think of that it resembled was seeing fireworks on the 4th of July, close, right here in my own town.  I contacted our local sheriffs office the morning, 11/17/99, to see if anyone else had seen this light.  They told me that they had received about 200 call regarding this light starting at about 7:02pm est the night of the 16th.  I was told of Eric Shipman who also saw the light, and who has contacted your office via phone.  We had a great talk and I got your website from him in order to file this report.  I don&apos;t necessarily need to be contacted by an investigator, but have no objection to it either.  If you are interested in the number of our local sheriff office it is 740-286-6464.

I could see the men inside they weren&apos;t men in black or anything but they were looking at somthing. When I looked over at what they were staring at they were amazed at what they saw. When I looked right in front of me was a giant saucer shaped U.F.O. It was over a house that was across the street. It was still and made no noise.

I could see it at night as well , But it was never reported as a storm cloud , or even put in the locakl paper . A small town of 2000. i had noticed it two days before . but thought nothing odf it . Since it was been raining in St. louis for about three wks now . but no rain in our area. Anyway , i was out some nights before . checking out the ufo&apos;s  i had seen the nights before . Any way this night , after the rest of my family had went in . My oldest boy and i stayed out . we were watching for any strange happening. so as it went . it was about ten twenty , by now . I had notice to the north of me some lights . coming toward our direction . didn&apos;t think much of it at first . but i noticed it was kind of low for a plane or jet . For that matter. So i watched it for sometime as it was approaching us . It had theese bright lights you might see omn a jet landing at an airport . But knowing that there wasn&apos;t , no airport close enough for it to land on . I kept watching it . By now it wasn&apos;t more than maybe fifty feet from , us. i noticed as it approached it had about six big lights on the front . But after it got wthin a certain distance , of us . it seem to have shut off some of them . As if to disguise , its approach . So by now my son andf i are watching this . now it was about 35 ft. and closing . it was about 25 ft above the ground . we could not here no sound coming from it . but from what  i saw . It must have been between 75-100 ft wide . it didn&apos;t shine no color lights at this time . By it , was crusing maybe at about 15mph toward us . At this point my son and i have got scared , So we hid behind our car . And i would peek up for a minute to see if it was still there . It was within at least 15 ft from us , by now . Now this is what happened next . i had ducked behind the car again . hopping it would pass. So i looked and it wasn&apos;t there , but it was to the west of us, no more than 10-15ft . to our west . itwasjust hoovering about 20ft or lower above the ground . it was within walking distance from where we was . Which was about 10ft . so i took noticed to look at my watch , it was a little past 10:30pm . As we walked over to it . As we approached i could see it had a dome on top . but it wasn&apos;t low enough to see into to it . I could just make out the top of it . As we stood underneath it . I took my flashlight , asnd shined up toward it . Sincwe i figure it would reflect my light . but it didn&apos;t . there was no reflection at all. It was black at least it looked black under it . becuse you couldn&apos;t see it from the bottom . but i was able to see the outline of it . it wasn&apos;t completly round .it had small wings on itsside it looked like . anyway , as i stood underit with my son . i ask him wouldn&apos;t it be great if wee got to take a ride in it . so we looked toward this our house , and started to walk away . When this light surrounded us . And the next tthing i knew it was 11;30 . I could here myself talking to my son . But i could hear , Or knew what i was saying . until we got a few feet away from it . thats when i turned and notice it fly off.

It began to slowly move to the south 5 mph, I was by this time pulled off the freeway &amp; was looking with bynoc,s. I saw a six sided structure that was about 10&apos;in lenght &amp; 3&apos; wide. As it slowly moved away to the south, it tilted at dif. angles, with a bright orange glow at the bottom. The sides where lite up orange but very lightly as if transparent but not, all the edges were outlined with the same oange light, but stronger than the side&apos;s, thus outlining the shape. many times it tilted on it&apos;s axis in about 150 degrees upward, never tlting bellow horizontal, it moved from possition to possition stopping at different angles. meaning the six sided structure above the bright orange light was moving independent to the southern movement the intire object was doing. this six sided structure above the bright orange glow moved in halting movement&apos;s.  I got the impression that it was looking for something. Actually it was very beautiful. Then to my astonishment it shrank down to a small point of orange light (about 1/5 it&apos;s original size) &amp; began to move away faster, it was coming towards me at first &amp; was about 200&apos;to 250&apos;up &amp; at it&apos;s closest 75&apos;. as it moved away about a mile it turned into three orange lights in a triangle shape, this was by naked eye due to my getting back into my truck &amp; chasing after it. it then stopped abruptly &amp; went back towards the north west. I slammed on my brakes &amp; jumped out again &amp; by the time I got my bynoc&apos;s trained on it, it was slowing down &amp; then stopped, it immediately lower itself to the ground. it was about 300 to 500 ft. away now, it went into a big stand of tree&apos;s, I could see it on the ground inside the tree&apos;s, but not so good anymore. but I could still see the glow of the orange lights inside the stand of trees.  I watched for about 4 or 5 min, when I desided to try &amp; get closer ! to the s tand of tree&apos;s, I had to get back in my truck &amp; get off the freeway to try &amp; find where it went down, I had no luck in finding it again even though I did find the spot in the tree&apos;s where it went down. I also discovered a large crowd of people standing outside of a house that wasn&apos;t far from where the stand of trees where, I stopped to ask them if they had seen anything, they hadn&apos;t. After I watched this thing land I began to shake a great deal, no dought due to fear &amp; excitement.  I stayed aroud the general area for about 20 min. &amp; saw nothing more.

My summer vacation was spent working on a farm. At 3 p.m., on a Saturday afternoon, while waiting on a township road to be picked up by my mom and dad (15 y.o.a.) for ride home for the weekend, I heard a very strange sound, somewhat akin to the sonar on a submarine.   I looked around the area and to my amazement observed a gray disk about the size of a hood on a car basket weaving between the high voltage power lines that were located by the road.  On seeing the object I became fightened and wasn&apos;t sure what to do.  I then put my head down on the mail box and closed my eyes.  I heard a sharp distinctive sound, differant from the first.

I have never spoken publicly of it, but now, at the age of 45, I am interested in finding out exactly what I saw. My mother, father and I were returning from our native Vancouver, Canada, back to LA aboard a United Airlines prop (a DC?). We were seated in the tail, port side, and over the US-Canada border area. I looked out the window as we flew through bright gaps in the clouds. The day was otherwise bright, despite the clouds. I observed a circular object, totally metallic with a rim completely around it, a mini silver Saturn, if you will. It was approx. 20-30 ft. in diameter and hovering near the the fuselage, between the wing and tail. It rotated, and it reflected our airliner on its--the UF0&apos;s--own surface. It was silent. I motioned to my father, who momentarily looked grim. He dismissed it as something, but sounded suspiciously evasive. I don&apos;t recall a reaction from my mother or anyone else aboard. The craft was silent and remained in view for several minutes. My parents have been deceased for more than 30 years and thus can&apos;t add more to what I have stated.There was only one object. It appeared to tilt and spin as it hovered by the fuselage of the United Airlines&apos; prop airliner. The sky was a bright blue. I viewed the object as our a/c passed through an expanse of clouds. I was excited; my father was uncharacteristically quiet, subdued. We never spoke of the incident ever again, though my father later in life evinced a belief in UFO&apos;s. My mother thoroughly dismissed the phenomenon. I sighted the object as a child. I am now 45 years of age. I am a teacher, with a Master&apos;s in English. I am currently working on my Ph.D in psychology. My father was a factory employee, a personnel manager. My mother was a typist. I don&apos;t know if my report is of any value to you, being nearly 40 years old and such. I offer it to you for what it&apos;s worth. The incident is etched onto my brain.

They were moving at a high rate of speed, and were maneuvering relative to one another.  At one point they came close together, then moved apart to form a v shape.  Four people, two adults and two children witnessed the event.  Also, the objects made no sound as they passed over.  It was clear with no clouds.

It had a blue light then a red light then a blue light. That was all I could see of the object as I was appraching it at about 35 mph. I began to wonder what it was because it was so low and seemed to be hovering unmoving. I eventually ruled out plane because of the complete stillness of lights. I ruled out crane or building lights for low flying aircraft because there was nothing above two stories in a 10 block radius. I decided as I got closer it must be a hovering helicopter.I was coming up to the lights now and I could tell they were only about 6 stories high so I was expecting to see a helicopter. As I passed under the object I saw a greyish black boomerang shaped object.My mouth hung open and I said aloud to myself what in the #### is that! I could not stop in my tracks as there were cars behind me. I turned aff at the nest street came to a park postion and jumped out of my car. It was not longer then 30 seconds since I saw the object but it was gone . I jumped in my car after surveying the skyline went up to twelfth went up three blocks and came down thirtenth again.There was nothing above thirtennth or low flying craft anywhere that I could see. I came around again for a second pass and again nothing above thirteenth and nothing anywhere in the sky that I cold see except plane high above (very very high) I then realized something also paculiar about the obect although it had red an blue lights (which made me originally think it was normal air traffic )I realized at the third pass when I saw the other plane high up that the object I saw lights had never blinked once any of them. I had watched it for about 2 minutes coming up to it and not on light ever blinked.", "At just past midnight, I observed what appeared to be a small steady white light (no blinking, no green or red); it could have also been a reflection of ambient ground lights against the body of the craft. I&apos;ve satellites at twilight in space, this was not a satellite.  This was within the atmosphere (2500 FT up) NO sound. It moved from NW to SE at very high rate of speed.  Faster than any craft I&apos;ve ever observed.The craft appeared as a single steady white light against a clear sky.  Other craft have flown at the same approximate height and higher, including jets and travel at much slower speeds, additionally they all have some blinking or colorized light which is observable.  This caught my attention because of the steady FAINT white light (or reflection) AND the speed AND the silence.  Things were pretty quite just after midnight!  Yet this craft made NO sound and crossed my field of view within 3-4 seconds.  I could NOT decipher any shape whatsoever.  The light was oblong and at arms length from my distance of view and about the size of an aspirin, although it was not in space, nor near space, it was definitely between 2000-3000 feet in altitude.  The local airports are directly west of my location.  It came from the NW and was headed southeast, which is the Atlantic Ocean. The flight path of the craft I observed was unique.  I have lived at this location for twelve years and do not recall ever seeing a craft flying along the trajectory I observed this craft flying. Unfortunately, it all happened so fast, I was unable to photograph or film the sighting. I would like to know if anyone else by chance saw this?

The object appeared to be hovering towards the city of Casper. It stayed stationary for about 10-15 seconds then it slowly gained speed at first then it accelerated at a very fast rate heading SouthEast and within 30 Seconds was out of sight. The object appeared to be a very bright star while hovering then as it started to move the light became less visible. The object appeared to be at about three to five thousand feet above the ground.", "Large rectangular object, about 100 yards over the power lines.A friend and I saw this huge metallic rectangular object near dusk over an apartment complex.  The object was roughly about 150 feet long, and 40 feet high, with a light shining in the left front corner.  We watched this object for about 10 minutes, it made no sound.

I only had it on for about 1 to 2 minutes when in a blink of an eye a solid spherical object appeared over the Gore building about 150&apos; to 200&apos; feet off the ground. It startled me so I turned off the laser pointer and watched it for the time it set there, (about 2 to 3 sec.) it did not bob or weave, it sat as if it was locked in place. then in an instant it was moving about 60 mph across the top of the building in front of me then turning to move past me on my right, almost strait over my head, it looked like it was only 6o feet in the air as it passed over, the size wasabout 2&apos; feet wide at arms length ) it did not make a bit of sound at all or even make a breeze, I could see the bottom of the object and up the side, the top was black reflecting the night sky, a band around the lower middle reflecting the city lights and it had a reddish glowing tint on the bottom. the texture on the bottom was like it had small pits and pings, very much crater like. As it passed over I ran under it to see it out the other side of the tree cover, but before I could clear the trees I heard a bang sound, when I got into the clearing the object was gone.

Both flew north and disappeared into the clouds.I look up into the sky quite often, anytime I hear a flying object in the vicinty, be it man-made or animal, or anytime I wish to take pictures, look up at the stars, the cloud formations or the local weather, especially thunder and lightning storms.  Rarely do I see some unusual natural phenomenon.  I have seen plenty of those high, distant lights that move acros the night sky, many repeatedly stopping, then starting again in a different direction.  Satellites or what?  I have also seen how people can mistake a common airplane for a UFO with certain angles and lighting and I believe I would be able take a photograph of said object and presto! a UFO.  I&apos;ve even considered writing a book about how to fake UFO photographs with everyday objects. So then, there I was standing in my front yard, facing north.  It was dark and somewhat cloudy.  I look up and lo and behold, straight above me are two flying wing-type craft, flying close together like two fighter planes in close formation, one slightly ahead of the other, below the clouds.  The one ahead was to the east.  They made no noise and left no trail.  Judging by the size and speed I&apos;ve seen of landing jetliners, they appeared to be of the same height and size and traveling at the same speed.  Are there places a jetliner could land so near Sherwood Or.?  Mainly what I could see of them were their lights.  The lights were in the same formation and color (white) as the string of lights on a jetliner, I believe on the bottom, back edge of the wings.  But there was one difference, these objects had NO blinking lights.  As I watched them they slowly flew north and the one to the west, which was slightly behind the other, moved slightly ahead, about as much ahead as the other was before.  I still heard no sound and saw no blinking lights.  They disappeared into the cloud cover.

The object made no sound neither when it was coming toward my house nor when it blew up.At 6:15 PM (1815hrs.) it was dark and clear outside and clearly visable were the moon, Jupiter, Saturn and Mars. There was a cloud bank low on the eastern horizon. There were a few intermittant clouds to the northwest of our position as I had been outside doing work since about 6PM (1800hrs.) A strong sideways facing light came toward our house from about the ssw about 500 to 800&apos; off the ground. The ovalish object resembled a helicopter with a bright spot light but the light had a green hue &amp; did not move around. Surrounding the object was a sort of fog or smoke because the light caught the smoke as a laser light catches smoke. The object itself was difficult to see because of the haze surrounding it. The objects light got very bright then dimmed and then the object imploded. It blew up sort of like a sky rocket does and a small ringed cloud appeared where the object was. The light turned bright green and became plasma like but remained stretched straight out and angled at about 45 degrees down toward the ground. The straight green light remained for a good 10 minutes after the object was gone. The cloud which had surrounded the object shrunk in with the light and exploded outwards into a huge cloud. The green light hung in the sky for upwards of 40 minutes after the implosion. The way the light looked was a lot like the norhtern lights but without the pulsating movements. It was straight to begin with, then slowly drifted together and remained noticable for a long time. No sound was heard when the object blew up. No sound was heard when the object was approching my house. I called 911 and they were real excited about it and had the Fallon Naval Air Station on the phone and would know in about an hour. When I called back the military told the police that it was just a titan missle from Vandenberg AFB and it was nothing to worry about. When I mentioned the lack of debris and the fact that an glowing green cloud hung my place for a half an hour or so they said that they were told that there is nothing t! o worry about. The object blew over my house an nothing fell out of the sky. I have never seen anything with no sound blow up and still have no sound.

The day was very clear and the object was very clearly seen. The object was traveling almost due south at a rate of speed that would make it absolutely imposible to suggest it was a jet aircraft. The craft or object was the same color as a typical commercial jet i.e. metalic looking.  There were no lights noted and no contrails. I looked at the thing for about 10 seconds (the thing was really moving) then it went over my house and was out of sight.

Through the binoculars all I could see was a bright star like glowing light moving N. I put the binoculars down and looking back up said where is it? She said, pointing  about another 20 degrees N, it&apos;s right there. And we watched as it moved out of sight. She said it could have been a plane. I said Oh come on, we&apos;ve been lying here watching it, thinking it was a star all this time it wasn&apos;t a plane. Look there&apos;s a meteor. The meteor shot across the sky which appeared to be the same section where the UFO moved from. She said I know but that&apos;s what everybody would say it was. I said Oh, what time is it, looking at my watch, it&apos;s a quarter to 6, I&apos;m calling the UFO hotline because it wasn&apos;t a plane, what kind of plane do we have that could stay in one spot appearing to be a star, then start glowing brighter and moving doing loops looking like it&apos;s moving from one star looping and going to another star looping going straight for a second or two and looping and going out of sight.

Only this time it moved sw about 20 degrees and disappeared. It is still dark and clear no clouds. Time 6:25...She said look there&apos;s another one. This one was more to the left. It moved about 30 degrees to the left, which appeared to be moving in a straight line. Time 6:30...She got up and pointing to the E she said there&apos;s the brightest star I&apos;ve ever seen. I looked up and to the E, Oh that&apos;s the N star. The sun getting read up come up. I&apos;m still lying watching the the stars in the sky. She came back, and I said well the N star is comming up but these stars are not moving with the rest of the sky. Then I realized these  were satellites or appeared to be satellites since they were not moving. She said that many. There was 6 to 8 scattered across the sky. I had heard about how you could tell which were satellites and which were stars, but this was the first time for me to visually see the satellites. Now the N star is almost over head to the W there are clouds forming. To the E the sun was starting to brighten the sky. It has been a very long time since I have taken the time to lie out under the stars and just watch the sky. It was a very interesting. I&apos;ve always felt UFO&apos;s were out there but now I know for sure. I&apos;VE SEEN ONE! Not up close but they are there! December the 12, 13, or 14, the next know meteor shower, I plan to lie under the stars and again watch the sky from the same spot. Who knows what I might see?", "We noticed a bright lime green colored object coming across the sky right above the tree tops.  It went slowly across the sky from northeast to southwest direction.  It made &quot;NO&quot; sound what so ever. No humming, no vibrations, nothing.  It continued across the sky and faded away.  Eight adults and two children witnessed this.My husband and I was outside looking at our Grandchildren TrickorTreating when all of a sudden we noticed a object that was coming across the sky above the tree tops.  It was a big bright lime green object and we could not tell what shape it was exactly because of the darkness.  To me it was more like an egg shape, but my husband says he remembers it to be more of a rectangular object.  We all watched it closely and quietly because the object made no sound.  This made us feel very eerie and our first reaction and instinct was to get the children inside.  We watched though and it went over our heads slowly and quietly.  It went above the tree tops and into the sky ahead and we watched it as far as we could see.  It never picked up any speed or slowed down.  The green color was the oddest thing about the incident because the object was so mystifying.  There we no flashing lights on it like a plane or helicopter would be.  It was all green.  We are in a flight path for the Hartsfield Airport, but approximately 60 miles out. (N to S path).  This object came across the sky from a different direction than other planes and helicopters.  There were eight adults  and two children witnessing this object.  We were simply amazed at the quietness.  At first we thought that it could be the Stealth Bomber, but this object was going too slow and there were no flashing lights front side or rear like a normal aircraft would be.  Last week my mother in law heard about a sighting similar around the Peachtree Dekalb Airport.  This was on the local news channel and it told of an object that made no sound as it went over and was green in color.", "Orange ball-shaped object soaring fast across the sky in a NE direction.  Had no sound or blinking lightsAs I arrived home from work I went inside to greet my family on December 31, 1999 NewYears Eve.  About 10 minutes later, my husband and I went outside onto our front porch after hearing some noisy people outside. To our astonishment, we had looked up into the sky and noticed a strange round object soaring through the sky going towards the NorthEast direction.  Strangely enough the object had no blinking lights like that of any type of airplane or hellicopter and no sound whatsoever.  My husband and I were speechless after putting together all of the facts known to us to conclude that this was very abnormal. I was so concerned I had to phone my mother and tell her the news and ask her if there was suppose to be any aircraft at all whatsoever that night.  Another odd aspect of our sighting, is that the object was going at a high rate of speed, slow down, and speed up again.  That night after a long night of hardly any sleep because of our strange and unusual feeling that this ! was just not right, my mother called me the very next morning to report to me that there was an article in the local newspaper that I was not the only one to have witnessed such a strange occurance.  One lady who was driving in the area was so astonished, she pulled over to dial 911.  This has certainly been the talk around town in the newspapers and radio shows but, nothing is known to what a large number of people with the same story has seen the night before the new year.  The National Weather Service concluded to knowing that there was no odd weather patterns in the sky.  The Greater Rockford Airport concluded that all air traffic was grounded that evening and nothing on radar.  The well respected policeman and firemen in this area who had seen this object concluded that it was something unother than they&apos;ve ever seen before.  So my BIG question is WHAT THE HECK IS IT!  I need to know for my personal comfort.  In conclusion I have never seen or have been a witness to anyth! ing of this sort but, I do know that this was scary.", "I saw a bright blue stream of light with a long trail behind it directly compass north of my home. It flew level accross the horizon from west to east. At the very end of the flight it split into 2 additional smaller pieces in front of the main light trail. The two additional pieces did not have trails. The pieces and the original light continued in a straight line on the original trajectory. The lights then all went out simultaneously. It was NOT a meteor or a comet. It appeared to about 1000 feet off the ground.My original summary describes what I saw. I can only add that I have seen comets, meteors and enough planes in my life to know that It was not any of those things. I immediately contacted NASA&apos;s Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena and they had no clue what it was but said that they had gotten many calls. I could not tell what the shape of the object was or how large it was.", "A brief flash of sight(like a cloaking device failed for a second) showed a building size craft with &quot;windows&quot;.

The craft dissappered as fast as it appeared((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "A small dark craft of somekind passed about 30 metres directly over my head, shortly followed by another.I was walking home on a reasonably clear night after watching a game of rugby videoed earlier on that day. It was about 1.30am and the road I was walking down wasn&apos;t very well lit up, as it was cold and a bit of mist was about due to the temperature. There was no-one else on the road and all was quiet. I heard a faint swishing noise and looked around to try and locate where it was coming from. As I looked about, I happened to look directly above me and saw a very dark object alarmingly low (25-30 metres) moving horizontally over me. It was really quiet and seemed to have a non-moving centre piece, and on each side of this were these semi-circular wing type objects which were turning end over end (a bit like a paddle steamer cylinder) It made very little noise, like something flapping in the wind. There were no lights that I could see, the only thing I can compare it to would be is a dark shadow. At first I just stopped walking and tryed to keep an eye on it, but the object was so dark I lost sight of it within 10 seconds or so. I stood there for about half a miniute and tryed to figure out what I had just observed I said to myself &quot;That&apos;s some freaky shit right there!!&quot; and carryed on walking. Trying to understand wether or not I had just seen what I thought I had seen, a second identical object passed again directly overhead, or maybe it was the same object that had done a full circle and came back for another look. The object was not very large, possibly 15-20 metres from wingtip to wingtip, and about10 metres wide in the middle. This is the first time I have told anyone about this for fear of looking like a nutcase, but it has been preying on my mind ever since it occured. I am a 29 year old computer graphics student and I swear on my life that this happened as I am relating it to you.I also swear I was not under the influence of alcohol or drugs at the time of the incident.

I saw a circular object, mostly dark brown with a slighty lighter shade in front, flying steadily South-Southeast.  The object showed no lights and made no sound.  It was unusual in its apparent size and altitude.  It might have been a hot air balloon, except I saw no basket or burner.  It could not have been a plane; there were no lights and no wings.  It was no bird; the flight was too high and steady.  The altitude must have been several thousand feet.  I watched for a minute or so as it flew out of my sight.

As I was watching out my window to make sure he was ok I saw a light coming up the street and I thought it was a neighbors car coming up the street and the light got closer and closer till it was upon him and circling around and on top of of him but I could not see where the light was coming from so I kept watching because I wanted to know what was going on.  Before I could make some sence out of it I saw, the reflection of lights that were upon him were glemming off of our work van parked infront of our house, I than saw two round colored lights about the size in-between a tennis ball or a soft ball one was red and the other was amber.  I was also assuming that the craft had to be over my house for the reflection to appear in the work van and as fast as it appeared on the van it was gone like it knew it could be spoted.  The whole experence lasted about 30 seconds I just could&apos;nt beleive my eyes when I saw what I saw.

The object was first seen in the left side of our field of vision, first it was dismissed as glare, or a row of houses, because it wasn&apos;t moving. Then the object proceeded to cross our field of vision moving from north to the southeast. It appeared to be a large airplane, traveling close to the ground and close to us, it almost appeared to be a crashing airliner. The only problem with it being a plane was the absence of sound, nothing could be heard except the wind and passing cars. If a big airliner was to pass that close, you would definately hear it. The driver of the car and I discussed the fact that it looked almost like two or three airplanes following close behind each other,or as if they were connected, fusealage to tail. There appeared to be lights on the craft, with a higher concentration near what is assumed to be the front of the craft, than to the rear of the craft. Since the sight looked so much like a crashing plane, we kept waiting to see an explosion, while keeping a lookout for a landing sight, or some other sign of landing. Once the craft passed out of out field of vision, it was not seen again by us, even though there was ample opportunity to see the skyline in which it departed, once the trees cleared. The color of the craft is undetermined, as to the fact it was dark outside, but the craft appeared to be darker than the night sky, as if it were black, or some other dark color.", "Fireball crafts being launched from a larger craft.It was about 10:45 in the evening and we saw a fireball in the sky.  There were about 8 or 10 more of them in 5 minute intervals.  I believe that they were a craft being launched from a larger craft.

E-mail address:  &lt;mufonga@webtv.net&gt;  NUFORC expresses its gratitude for the report.  PD))Hovering dark mass surrounded by yellow glowThe witness in this case is one of several in the Chatsworth/Fort Mountain community that have reported apparently anomalous events to MUFONGA/ISUR during the past two years. The witness lives in this mountain top community that overlooks the valley lying between Fort Mountain and Grassy Mountain, both peaks lying just east of Hwy 411 in NW Georgia. The site from which this observation was made is about 2800 ft. in elevation. The witness was found to be a successful businessman in good health and a subtantial well respected member of the Murray County/Chatsworth community. This investigation was a joint MUFONGA/ISUR venture and was conducted on 22Aug98. The witness stated that on 8Aug98 at about 9:30PM EDT, he was sitting on his patio deck which has views to the north, northwest and northeast. There was a cloud cover at about 8,000 feet, no precipitation, little or no wind, temperature about 73 degrees. He observed a yellow circle or orb drop down out of the cloud cover to the NE about 1/2 to 1 mile away. It then stopped and hovered at an estimated 3800 ft. altitude (observation made from about 2800 foot altitude).  The witness watched closely for about 10 seconds and described it as being a dark object or center mass, his diagram indicated a small doughnut shaped center, surrounded by concentric layers of yellow glow.  It appeared to be about the size of a basketball held at arm&apos;s length and the glow was about as bright as that of the full moon. The object/light then vanished as he watched. These investigator&apos;s gained permission to surveil the valley for the remainder of the night from the patio deck. At about 11:00PM, these FIs noticed a very bright starlike light (brighter than Jupiter and about twice it&apos;s size) appear appx. 1/4 off of the horizon over the ridges to the NE, it then dropped straight down, displaying a &apos;wiggling&apos; motion as it descended and disappeared. Event duration no more than 1 or 2 seconds, range to light estimated at 1+ to several miles (night observation).  This writer seemed to notice a slight momentary halt in the travel downwards, but this was not noticed by the other FI. An inspection of that vicinity with binoculars revealed no aircraft that could be observed or heard. While not as close or spectacular as the event of 8Aug98, this distant observation did exhibit some of the same characteristics; dropping downward, then vanishing.  It did not appear to be a meteor or returning space junk, both of which have been observed by these FIs on previous occasions (meteor showers many times). There are additional cases under investigation in this area, including the nearby town of Elijay.  See elsewhere in this database for case of 16Oct99, &apos;Glowing Orange Orb Hovers&apos;.  That particular case was reported by a seperate witness in the same general vicinity. Detailed reports of the aforementioned 8Aug98 event were submitted to MUFON HQ and the ISUR database.

Total flight time horizon to horizon was around three minutes.  There was several other aircraft in the sky, jets and helicopters.  It was by far the oddest thing I&apos;ve seen in the night sky.  I don&apos;t know if it was alien, I just would like to know what it was.  At first i thought it was a large aircraft with white lights on the nose and the tips of the wings.  But when it flew past the stars, I could see them between the three lights.  I assume it was three objects flying in formation.((NUFORC Note--The report may allude to a formation of three (presumed) satellites, which were being reported from many sources at about this time.  We presume that the objects are part of the U. S. Navy N.O.S.S. satellite system for pinpointing the location of ships around the world, but that is an assumption.  In years past, NORAD and the Space Command have reported to NUFORC what these three objects are.  However, Terence Dickinson, of the Toronto (Ontario) Star, was able to identify a similar formation that was reported during the summer of 1996.  He found that the objects were almost certainly satellites put up by the U. S. Navy.  Our gratitude to Mr. Dickinson for his research.))", "About 530am I was up getting ready for work when I saw a streak of light that didn,t look like a shooting star it looked all togetther different I&apos;ve seen shooting star before, this just look different like a craft moving very fast in the easthern sky I&apos;ve seen light in this area before but this is the first time I desided to report it. I&apos;ve told no one but will keep looking an try to get some on film if at all possible there is something out there((NUFORC Note--The Geminid Meteor Shower peaked during the evening hours on this date.  That may explain the object, but that is only a guess.))", "A large shinning diamond flying slowly or hovering.I was was driving in the car with my mother , when all of a sudden a large gold diamond came, it was all metal and I was shocked.My mother knew of the object for the first day, but she has never admitted it after that.", "One object to the south &amp; one to the southeast of Kennesaw Mtn.

The five of us were returning a rental truck to lawton, we started our journey from Anadarko. We were following the rental truck, a co-worker and I were on a 58 belair, a classic, and in great shape, it was warm that night, I remember that, the windows were rolled down, anyway, we were following the truck, when we decided to pull off to get a coke. The other party kept going, we took maybe 8 minutes or so, before getting back on the road. We were traveling about 80 mph when looking forward and to our left, we noticed what appeared to be two cars chasing each other traveling perpendicular to our path. We continued our descent into the small valley, we continued to watch the cars chase. As we started our ascend up to the top, it appeared the cars would crash into us. My partner yelled &quot;hit the brakes&quot; we lost control temporarily of the car, but managed to get control back. As I looked right, I could see him pressed up againt the windsheild, staring at the object. The ship stopped, and raised up about twenty feet above us. I glanced up and seen what appeared and very prevalent to be a battleship. The warship was jet black, with red symbols all over it. The image that sticks in my mind is that of the television show battlestar galatica. It looked like a battlestar minus the downward fins it dragged. The ship was heavily armored, but did not have any turrets or missles on it. One thing I could feel from the ship it was a battlecruiser. I glanced forward up the road, I noticed no sound at all with the exception of the car. Then as I looked ahead the entire area lit up bright orange as if it was daylight. I looked up at the ship again, it was there hovering, then it just went straight up, so quickly it reminded me of Star Trek, when the enterprise goes into warp, it looked like that. It disappeared. I now know why the government has been hiding the existence of UFO&apos;s, There are many wars going on around us, we know noth! ing of t hem. That battlecruiser was here observing missle launches going on at lawton. It was not a saucer or cigar, or anything like that, this was a battleship, why would they send a battleship?

Driving down I-37 South when noted that passenger was watching intently out the window on his side of the car.  I looked where he pointed and saw a series of flashing lights, though location was entirely stationary for the entire duration of watching time.  It was in roughly the SW sky of San Antonio...too high for towers, etc...light pattern and stationary status not consistent with plane or helicopter.  There were eight lights in the pattern, bluish, regularly spaced.  ... ... .   . It immediately reminded me of a &quot;something&quot; that I&apos;d seen over 35 years ago (that shape can be seen in several of the Budd Hopkins books, in fact), also in Texas.  My head immediately drew that other shape in my mind&apos;s eye. The flashing was at approximately 2 second intervals...very regular...all lights flashed off...on...off...at the same time.  After about 10 minutes of observing, it was simply not there...though did seem to reappear once we got home...over the far southwestern edge of Brooks AFB (further than the base, but that was the direction). Though the pattern was one I recognized...one that had caused me trouble in the childhood incident...I found myself merely fascinated and not in the least bit upset by the sight.  Otherwise, though, the emotional feel of the whole evening was that &quot;creeps up the spine&quot; feeling...accompanied by a rather &quot;foggy&quot; feeling.", "While on patrol for ((name deleted)), I was driving up one of the back roads. I saw what appeared to be a shooting star or a meteorite. I realized that it was flying much too low to be a shooting star or meteorite. It was a bright blue, almost white light. It shot across the sky, then suddenly dissappeared. This was near Westchester County Airport, so I called them to see if any testing was going on, and they said no. I then asked if anyone called about anything strange in the sky, and they said a few people called about it. This was just too strange for me not to write to someone.", "I watched the UPN UFO special and have been meaning to send my information in since I first heard your director being interviewed by Art Bell.  Last year I saw in Canada an account on &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot; which I taped to show my wife and our friend who was visiting us when the TWO INCIDENTS which the three of us saw on MARCH 12 and 13.  I just reviewed your database and see that one entry is for the 12th. OBSERVATION: Usually every night I take a &quot;walked around the block&quot;, a couple or three laps around the our mobile home south of Florence, Az. Mar. 12:  probably around 8:00 p.m, perhaps 8:30pm (between TV shows) I did my laps and noticed the a band of lights to the west where we can see the glow of Phoenix lights.  Unlike what was seen the next evening, there were gaps in the display.  From our perspective the lights were in one line dipping to the north, higher at the south end.  The lights were white BUT there were gaps between them;  as best as I can recall there may have been 5 or 6 displaying a pattern but with gaps in the pattern, such as #1 was on, #2 wasn&apos;t, but #&apos;s 3 and 4 were and #5 may have beeen of while #6 was light.  Anyway I called out my wife and our friend to see them, and I speculated that perhaps these were flares from night jumping;  (the Coolidge airport where paratroopers have done night jumping is in line with the Phoenix air port, in fact, we are on the flight path for aircraft approaching Sky Harbor from the east or south east. I just can&apos;t remember if I took my binoculars out but I believe I did.  What surprised was that there seemed to be not perceptible downward movement yet this the fact that I jumped to the conclusion that the north end was lowest fit in with my idea that the first flare would be lower than the last flare dropped. March 13:  Again I saw the lights about the same time and again no perceptible downward movement BUT as been widely reported, this time there where no gaps in the lights--which to me meant that none of the flares were duds. I am really surprised that perhaps only one observation was make for the evening before since while there were fewer lights each one had the same intensity.", "While living on the edge of the campus of Campbell College in Buies Creek, NC I saw a large saucer shaped object on the ground.I woke up in the night to take care of my toddler aged daughter.  When I went to her room I realized the interior of the house was lit up from this object, which was about 100 yards away. We lived in a small one story house on the edge of the campus across from the indoor swimming pool.  Land had been cleared next and behind this building for a new athletic complex. This object I saw was in the cleared area and I would say estimate the size of it to be the length of two bull dozers end to end.  There was no activity seen.  However, the luminous light would slowly dim and gradually get brighter.", "Approxamitly at 7:09pm I, and two other witnesses spotted 3 to four what looked to be fireballs fly in formation across the sky, They were too low to be meteors in my opinionI and two others witnessed 3-4 UFOs at approximatly 7:09pm on 11/16/99.

About 10 minutes later, another appeared and did the same thingMe and a freind were sitting in the back of my dad&apos;s truck. We were looking at the stars when I noticed a light in the south kind of moving. My first thought was that it was a meteor, but it was moving a little slow for one. Then it turned to the east which meant that it did a 90 degree turn. I had never seen a meteor do that. Then, about 45 seconds later, it did a 180 and went west. It went that way for 45 seconds. Then, it just shot off to the west. My freind and I kept talking about it. Then we noticed another one just like it. It did the exact same thing, except it was there about 4 and a half minutes.

From out of nowhere, an object appeared directly above and in front of us, and positioned itself in favor of the driver&apos;s side, but so that the passenger had full view as well. After a second or two of adjusting to the extraordinary event, I realized that the UFO was traveling the same distance/speed as we were, as if to keep up with us.  My impression now is that it wanted us to see it, as if it were there only for us to enjoy the light show.  The UFO was beautiful to me.  It wasn&apos;t exactly diamond-shaped, but more trapezoidal.  Geometrical and very angular.  It seemed to be hovering approximately 50 feet above us.  It was glowing a gorgeous, warm auburn, yellowish-brown color.  It was just beautiful and the feeling I get to this day is that it was &quot;showing off&quot; for only my friend and I, since the other 2 passengers had no idea that this was taking place.  After maybe 10 or 15 seconds of traveling a straight line with us, the UFO emitted 2 rays of light from either side of it, which shot out in different directions.  All 3 objects then disappeared.  I don&apos;t know how I managed to keep my eyes on the road for those 20 or so seconds because I can&apos;t imagine that I ever peeled my eyes off the spectacle.  The 2 passengers in the back had no idea anything took place.  I pulled over to the side of the road and my friend and I began sobbing in excitement.  I will mention here that I am certain this amazing event took place only because she was present.  She has extremely unstable energy and is an emotionally troubled person.  Her entire life has been plagued by poltergeists (which I&apos;m sure are just psychokinetic irregularities she createsv) and out of the ordinary experiences.  This type of experience is not unusual for her, and I believe that I was given a gift of sorts to be able to see what I did.

As we continued driving southbound we noticed that the two lights were not moving at all and were too bright to be a plane. After about two minutes of driving southbound we began to move to a vantage point that was beneath the stationary object and noticed a third light completing an equilateral traingle on the underside of the object.  The lights remained perfectly round from the side (headlights) view as well as the underside view. The object produced no sound and held its position as we left it behind us.

The Datyon Airport is just a few miles west/northwest from where I was travling. The object was burning with a greenish yellow color. A long train of fire was behind it. At first it looked like one object. As it went to the east I saw several pieces behind it. (In a train formation) The object(s) never lost any altitude as I watch it move.

It traveled from north to south. It came into my vision at a point just below and to the south of the North Star. It traveled below Cassiopia to a point just about exactly West of me. I am in Reno, Nevada. The object was very bright (not like a fireball)like a white light. It appeared at least as bright as Venus. It took only 3 sceonds to travel this great distance of sky. It&apos;s elevation was very difficult for me to even estimate. I was looking about 12 to 15 degrees above the horizon. The object was as large as my thumb extended at arms length. It didn&apos;t get appreciably brighter nor did it fade out. It just traveled at a high rate of speed in and out of vision. I watch satellites all the time. I can usually figure how high up they are and the characteristics they demonstrate. Including how long it takes them to travel across our sky at 17,500 miles per hour. This was traveling at many times that speed. Even if it was lower, it traveled many times faster than any planes I know of. Within a very short time after I saw this object two aircraft appeared in the sky going in the direction where Lost sight of the bright object. They were very large and traveling at the speed I would expect chase aircraft to travel at. The only thing is they had very bright lights on all the way accross the sky (unlike regular aircraft)and they made no sound. It was very quiet and there was no wind. I watch aircraft all the time and I know you can hear them in these circumstances. These made no sound. They did have, in addition to the regular appearing aircraft lights, red and white strobes. Two things were very strange however; I watched the one that was traveling from North to south, in the direction of the object, for an inordinately long time and distance. I watch planes all the time and I know I cannot see them at such a distance and again I must mention they made no sound. The other aircraft appeard from the East and traveled west to the direction of the Object. I am a cool headed person in my fifty&apos;s. I  love the sky, planes and things celestial as did my mom before me. I have been observing the sky since I was a very young man. I don&apos;t know what I saw but I did see this interesting object and the craft I described. I felt I should report it.

Straight up, moving to the Northeast, I saw a very large triangular sploch of light.  Hard to say it was a fixed shape, more like a luminous cloud with definate shape.  Brighter at the edges, stars could be seen, faintly, through the object but it did dim the background.  Seemed way up in the sky, but was huge, using big dipper as an indicator each edge of the shape was about 1/3 the length of the distance between the last two stars of the handle.  I watched for a few minutes, let my eyes adjust, then called my wife to come out and see.  She did see the object, although by this time it had moved to the Northeast, slowly, and had dimmed.  She went back inside, and I continued to watch, using low power binoculars.  Followed the path of the object to the horizan.  The object went from its original shape to a series of four objects in a straight line, two, then two, that acted and moved like any other satellite you may see.  The original object was not a satellite.  I remember a few years back an experiment that had been run where they released something in space to create a luminous cloud, for some type of research.  Could be similar project?  I have observed the triangular weather satellite formation that occasionally passes overhead, and have always enjoyed looking for satellites.

The path did not reach the ground. What was very odd was that the path left by the falling meteor was exactly vertical. That seems very odd to me. The earth and the meteor would have to be travelling exactly towards each other for it to streak perfectly vertical. It is even more odd considering I saw another vertical meteor 1 week before this while travelling home from thanksgiving dinner. That night I was travelling due west and saw a meteor leave a streak due west from my location. I was just entering the Hemet area where a large valley occurs. The meteor streak appeared over the San Jacinto mountains west of hemet. The streak was again exactly vertical. It was almost as if a star just fell straight down out of the sky. A very odd sight.

It made a banking turn and continued north and out of sight.I am a police officer for a suburb of Columbus, OH.  I had a ride-along passenger, who is a reserve officer for another agency in the area.  We were attempting to find a dark area within the city to observe the Leonid Meteor Shower as it was a slow night.  We had driven back into a railroad yard and stopped the cruiser.  We had been there no longer than five minutes when I noticed an object coming from east to west just west of downtown Columbus.  At first I assumed it was an airplane.  I quickly realized this was not the case.  It appeared similar in shape to an F-117 Stealth Fighter as it approached head-on.  I say this because it seemed to have similar sharp angled features.  After watching it for about 5-10 seconds I told my partner to get out of the car as I was doing the same.  I pointed in it&apos;s direction and said &quot;Do you see that thing?&quot;  He too spotted the object just before it began to make a slow right banking turn.  As it turned, it showed it&apos;s underside completely to us.  It appeared to be an equalateral triangle shape.  There were no flashing lights of any kind on the craft.  It&apos;s underside had some sort of distortion to it almost as if it were camaflouged.  There was absolutely no sound coming from the craft.  It appeared to be relatively close to us and I actually tried to shine my spotlight on it to light it up but it was too far away to be illuminated by it.  We often have the police helicopter fly by as we are close to the heliport and it was much larger in size comparison than the helicopter although it appeared to be at a similar altitude.  After completing it&apos;s turn it leveled off and continued north having just made a 90 degree turn.  It was travelling slowly across the sky; slower than the helicopter would to use it as a comparison again.  It just seemed to glide as a stingray does through the ocean.  It disappeared out of sight to the north of our location.  I called another officer to meet me and we told him about the incident.  He suggested I call Port Columbus Airport.  I end! ed up ca lling the Airport Police and identified myself to them and asked if there was anyway they could find out if the tower had anything unidentified on their radar.  After being on hold for a couple minutes the dispatcher advised me she&apos;d been in touch with Tracon and they had nothing unusual on their radar in the time frame I&apos;d reported.  I cannot say what the craft was but I can say it was like nothing I&apos;ve ever seen and the odd part is that it was completely silent.  I have seen and F-117 fly and I know they are quite loud.  I can also say with 100% certainty it was not any type of meteor.  It was close enough to us that we could distinctly see it&apos;s edges and shape although it was not self illuminated.  I could not say for sure what color it was as it just appeared dark in the sky.  It would have been very easy to miss had we not been looking right at it.  I am truly baffled by what we saw.", "I witnessed a meteor / fireball that passed south of my location traveling from the West to the East at a fairly slow rate of speed.I was driving south bound when my wife asked what kind of aircraft is that? I had to duck down and look up to see what she was talking about. It was a great fireball with several small pieces breaking off and trailing behind it as it traveled from the West at 260&apos; to the East at 080&apos;. I had to look up at about a 50&apos; angle to see it as it passed directly in front of my vehicle&apos;s position due south of me. I continued to follow it even after it stopped burning. It turned a dark amber and I could clearly see that it was a large, somewhat round, meteor. It disappeared into the haze at the horizon between 5 to 10&apos; elevation. I would estimate its speed to be 4 times that of the space shuttle. It was visible for atleast 30 seconds if not longer as we did not see this from the start of the event. Several local TV stations have shown home video of it which I will send by UPS.", "i walked outside to get something from the car.an oval shape custer of lights flying really low was flying west,north-west very slowly.i called everywhere for answers,no one had any.I went to my car to get something.I looked at the moon,it was a clear night and it was just a little slice of moon showing so you could see the dark side.When I went to turn towards the car,my eyes caught the object.It was night time so it was really clear.It was an oval shaped cluster of bright lights.It was flying really low and seemed slow,but it didn&apos;t take long to disappear.It was flying west,north-west.I took my compass outside to see.When it got pretty far away,I noticed that it banked right,towards the north.I then lost sight of the object.I wasn&apos;t the only one to see this object.I called out my wife and my 9 yr old son to witness this.I&apos;ve seen strange lights here before,but,we just brushed them off as having a strong imagination.This time is different!We saw it very,very,clear!There is no doubt in my mind about it.I called airports,news rooms,police...no one knew anything.I like to consider myself a rational person.I don&apos;t drink or do drugs.I&apos;m a hard worker.I&apos;m family oriented.I don&apos;t want any sort of publicity or attention.I would like to see pics fitting that description tho.Also,shortly after,an airplane was flying quite rapidly in the same direction.", "3 vehicles traveling NNE to SSW at 25 mph or less.

Seven o&apos;clock in the evening during June the sun is still quite high in the sky, but due to the thunder storms it was light, but not bright sunlight. Above us was clear blue sky for miles, so I discount the chance of any lightning strike any where near us. We were all sitting on a picnic table when all of a sudden we experienced a bright flash of light. All except my wife saw different colors, myself saw red, the brightest red I&apos;ve ever seen. The others saw blue and red. My wife remembers seeing bright white light. Thats all any of us can recall, except my wife, which was sitting right next to me, was getting up off the ground about 30 feet away to my right (west) of our position. We were all extremely bewildered at what had just happend. It all happened in a split second. We looked around for possible scorching on the ground in case of lightning, there was nothing. We left the area immediately. Later that evening we all experienced a painful neck. My wife had severe pain in her pelvic area, hips and lower back. My wife went on to carry our first born for 10 months with no problems during delivery. The baby was dehyderated but was healthy. She is currently a sophmore in college. We have two other kids, The second, a boy is extremely bright straight A&apos;s all his life (a sophmore in high school). His TAP test scores are in the 99% of the nation.

Reappears 10-15 seconds in another location.  3 jets scramble the area.While sitting in a hot tub only minutes after we entered. My wife saw a light and asked if it was a star in the east at about the tree line. It was almost the same size and distance to resemble a star. But as we looked, it slowly faded. I replied, well I don&apos;t think stars disappear. So we kept watching. Every 15-30 seconds it would appear in a different location but at the same level of horizon but many miles apart. This happened about 10-11 times. While this was happening there were 3 jets that would alternate flying west to east and circle back. As the jet got closer the light would reappear then fade. At one time as the jet appeared a smaller light left the light object as if a missle tracking a target. This light either circled the jet or just faded as it got closer to the jet. I commented to my wife that I was expecting an explosion as I felt it was just like the Patriot missle that would track and explode the Scud missle. As soon as this streamer light (which did leave a visible path trail) faded. 2 lights the same size reappeared and one was just above the other. They lit up for 3-5 seconds and then faded. All this time the jets circled or criss crossed. After 8:15 the objects did not reappear( at least in the East) but I did see jets circling in the north only minutes later. Also about an hour later the satelite dish which is Dish network was split screen for about 10 minutes. This may just be coincidental. I am very interested if anyone may have seen the same thing.

The light was turning colors from white to blue to red and then to white again.I watched for a few minutes and noticed it was slowly moveing to the south. I also seen it begin to move up then down then back to the southeast then back to the south. Then it would make a circular loop clockwise. I yelled at my wife and daughter to see the object. They came and watched with me not believing what they were seeing either. I then called my nephew and a coworker each living in different parts of the county to see if they could see. They did and also was at a loss as to what it was. They both seen it do the exact samethings that I was seeing. My coworker Scott Duran Used a tree limb  to line the object up with to see how it was moving and told me that it would be in one patr of the tree limb then suddenly be in a different part. There was little to no wind that night so we knew the tree limb wasn&apos;t moving. We watched until it got to the south were it stopped moving to the west and just sit there moving up,down,left, right, and doing a loop every once in awhile.It would always remain back at the same location but appeared to be going away from us.

Approximately 200 feet above and to the right of where we played. Daytime Characteristics: Clear, sunny, no clouds.In 1975-1976 my father was employeed to cut firewood about 40 miles north-west of Prescott Arizona. We were living in the National Forest there for over a year while he was working. Essentially, a three month summer camping trip turned into a year and a half camping trip. Anyway.... I&apos;ll be brief in describing what I saw. 2nd incident: My brother, sister, and I where playing near the edge of a dry creek-bed to the west of our camping spot. My brother, who was almost three at the time reached over and tugged on my shirt. He pointed to the sky above our heads and asked what that was...he pointed to a large cigar-shaped metallic object hanging silently about 200 feet above and to the right of our heads. It was really close. I instantly felt like we were being watched. I got scared, grabbed my brother by the arm and  yelled for my sister to follow me back to our camp. We all ran...not looking back.

I would extimate that the length of the  object was approx 1/40 the diameter of the moon.  It passed across the moon in about four seconds.  As it passed, it cast a shadow on the moon.  The shadow on the moon was slightly higher than the object itself.  The shadow was the same size as the object (I suspect the object was very close to the moon, very large, and moved very fast).  The object was dark against the bright moon.  The shadow did not seem to be any darker than the object.  The object looked like a fat cigar or a skinny football.  As the object moved across the moon it could not be seen (no lights).  The object did not appear to be orbiting the moon (did not appear again).  Could it have been an asteroid?

Light bacame bright and changed into elongated form then split into 3 or four objects heading east somewhere around ~20,000 feetI was in the American Airlines flight 785 scheduled to leave New York Laguardia at 17:55 on 17 November 1999.  We left about 15 minutes late from the gate and didn&apos;t take off for about another 35 minutes.  After we left the ground the pilot came over the PA and said we had Philadelphia out the left and would soon see Wilmington.  I looked out my window to the North.  I knew it was north because I had located the big dipper and had found the North star.  We were heading close to due west.  Out my window I noticed a light and thought it was another airplane.  The light appeared to be at a slightly lower altitude than the one we were at.  I watched the light and noticed that it was getting brighter.  Thus it was either getting closer or increasing in brightness.  I thought it was an airplane and started getting nervous as it appeared to be coming directly at us.  That is it&apos;s brightness increased.  I then noticed that it got extremely bright in the center and appeared to have an airplane like shape.  That is a bright center and tapered to the east and west as if it had two bright wings.  All this time it appeared as a bright white light.  Next I heard the pilot say something about a meteor out of my side of the plane.  I then noticed that the bright flattened shaped light appeared to explode into two or three more objects heading due east.  I then truned and told the fellow next to me that he should look at the meteor too.  He did and also saw what followed.  The bright initial light appeared to slowly fade into nothing.  The 2 or 3 objects that were left then headed due east.  One after the other apparently on the same course.  They moved very slowly and had a long tails that were about the same distance or a little less than the distance between the two stars of the big dipper which point to the north star.  The tails appeared to be the same length.  The were about the same luminosity except for the front which was slightly different.  I did notice that after the length of the tail there was no sign of ! a dim ta il, it was totally dark as was the rest of the sky.  The objects moved off to the east at constant altitude.  The total episode taking from 30 seconds to as much as two minutes.  I was distracted by the pilots comments and then that it was a meteor so I didn&apos;t watch it continuously and really did not see the objects disappear.  I did notice that at some point they were no longer visible.  The trajectory of the objects was neither up or down in the vertical direction.  The witnesses included myself, the person sitting next to me and at least one pilot.  I am not sure about whether other people on the plane had noticed the event.  I am not sure of the time but believe it to be between 18:45 and 19:15 Eastern.", "Driving through Plomosa Pass towards Bouse Looking NE towards Prescott about 60 degrees up from horizon myself,husband and daughter witnessed three unexplained sightings of bright Amber lights.

Holding my hand at a distance, the tail was longer than my hand.  The main part was throwing off debris.  They quickly burned out.  There were two smaller objects trailing the main object.  They were keeping pace with the main object.  In respect to actual meteorites the object appeared to be moving rather slow.  The object did not change direction at all while I was watching it.

It was coming from the South West, a compass reading of 225 degrees and was headed North East, a compass reading of 45 degrees. I was observing this unusually bright pure red light, waiting for it to turn or pass over me to see if it was an aircraft with the typical complement of flying lights. I watched this object for two minutes, then my daughter called to me and I looked down to her for two seconds. When I then looked back up at the red light, it was no longer there, instead there was a bright white cloud, it was the size of a silver dollar held at arms length. I ask my eight year old daughter to look up at this bright white cloud and I pointed where this bright white cloud was. After two minutes the white cloud had dissipated.  There was no sound of an explosion.  I live in Westminaster, California where I observed this red light.  To me this red light looked like it was coming from Long Beach, California and when it disappeared it was over Huntington Beach, California.

My brother and I were star gazing and saw what appeared to be a LARGE vehicle that had the appearance of a conventional aircraft but it had 6 sets of wings and was dotted with lights around the perimiter of the craft. It was also silent and very close.The sighting took place around 1980, but is still etched in my mind and will be forever. My brother and I would be outside every night to look for unusual things in the sky. One night just before dark on a warm summer evening with no clouds,we were looking at the apex of the sky when all of a sudden a huge craft floated silently ovrhead. We were both stunned at what we were seeing, our jaws dropped in awe. The craft appeared to a normal convetional aircraft at first but then we realised it was no air plane. The object had 6 sets of wing like appendages and the whole exterior of the craft was dotted with white lights and what appearerd to be a runway of sorts in the center. The object moved slowly over head and was completely silent. the oject also gave the appearance of being somewhat translucent,Im not sure how to explain it. It was just light enough to see the object so it could have been a reflection of some kind. I was about 18 years old at the time and my brother would have been around 20. We never reported this untill now for fear of riddcule. We did however tell our parents and some friends but they only laughed. I feel it important to note that there were no drugs or alcohol involved in the sighting.

Please let me know if you need additional information.", "4 Unidentified AirCraft , 1 blinking a bright red , 3 others blinking a blueish green in a quad formationMy friends and I were sitting on top of a hill. Our one friend always said he saw weird stuff up there, but we never believed him. Just 2 nights ago amazed my beliefs. A single aircraft was blinking a reddish light, and on occasion it would blink a single off-white light 3 times.The weird thing was, where it came from , it would keep going back. Back and forth repeatedly. 3 others eventually showed up, flashing an off-white color 3 times. The part that shocked me was when all 4 got near each other they stopped. And headed opposite directions from where they were coming. I didn&apos;t hear an airplane, nor a helicopter. This was very strange. They would keep coming back to the same spot where we saw them again and again. Going back, and than coming back. Again, no helicopters or airplanes were heard. When all 4 finally left, or so I thought, an object appeared out of nowhere. A really bright light showed up, it kind of looked like the North Star, but it wasn&apos;t. It would get dimmer and dimmer. And flash back to a bright white light. The really bothered us, so we drove away. I&apos;ll tell you one thing, it made me a believer.

We had been there for several days when another group of people arrived and camped next to us.  We did not know them, but we all became aquainted pretty quickly.  We were all hippies (at least that&apos;s what people called us then).  One of the men from the other group was coming back from the outhouses and he was walking along a narrow dirt road that led back to our campsite.  He was only a few feet away from the central campsite when he suddenly stopped and looked up into the sky and said, &quot;What the hell is that?!&quot;  We all gathered on the road next to him and watched an amazing display of flashing lights that covered an extremely large portion of the sky above us.  Each flash was independent of the others and there was never a flash in the same place twice.  (On your form I estimated that there were 400 flashes but I actually have no idea.)  We stood there for at least 45 minutes or so watching and trying to figure out what it was.  We knew it wasn&apos;t aircraft because it was totally silent.  (In the desert sound carries for very long distances).  We knew that we were near two airports.  One was Palm Springs Airport and the other is a military air base nearby. I don&apos;t know the name of it.  When the planes went over we could hear them very well long before we saw them.  These lights did not trail in any one direction like you would see on a plane with blinking lights on it.  It was as though we were seeing the lights from several objects that were zig-zagging all over the sky at incredible speeds.  I was not aware of anything being blacked out behind these objects.  They were flashing at such incredible speeds all over the sky that it seemed we were only seeing lights not objects with lights on them, but the flashes were such a bright white light that I wondered if this was some kind of natural lightning phenomena.  As far as I can remember there were no flashes that occured simultaneously.  Each flash was independent.  The weather was clear, cool and dry.  (It gets cold in the desert in December!)  There were no clouds and no moon that night.  The only other light that could be seen was the faint glow of Palm Springs on the horizon.  We eventually got bored with it and went back to what we were doing.  Every now and then someone would look up to the sky and say, &quot;It&apos;s still happening&quot;.  It went on for approximately 2 or more hours. I would have reported this sooner, but I didn&apos;t know who to report it to until I heard an interview with Peter Davenport on WERE 1300 radio in Cleveland today.", "I was lying down, and I look in the sky. I see a sphere and I thought it was a plane. I look closely, but I see it is not like a plane or helicopter. I look and it is going back not in a straight line, but moving back in a little circular mode. It is bigger than a star, smaller than a moon. I know it was not a plane or anything like that.The object looked like a sphere. It was moving back in a circular mode toward the mountain. It seemed like it was going fast and was going farther from my site. I ran to get a binocular but it was gone. I got my mom and she came too, but it was not there. The object seemed to have several orangish lights. I know it could not be a plane or helicopter. After the object was gone, I looked in the sky also, and it seemed like there was some redish cloud, not to red but it seemed a different form of color and the object was moving that way. I am not bsing at all and please call me or anything if you need any more information. I can talk to you on the phone etc. Thank you very much.

I also noticed a blue smoke pattern about 500 feet away from the light and looking like it was tapered and also pointed toward the ground in a 30 deg angel. While we were driving, we slowed, and a few vehicles around us slowed, all looking at this light. The light focused on the tail, expanded it&apos;s beam, and lighting up the source with a very bright white light, totally involving into a ball, and disappeared.   A large ball of white smoke expanded around this source and disappeared.   After about 30 seconds, the white smoke disappeared, but the blue trail was still illumines for at least 5 minutes..", "Viewed a UFO through bedroom window on Christmas Eve, as its bright lights woke me up; kept me awake for over an hour as it moved slowly across the Williamson County, TN horizon.I awoke around 4:00 am on Christmas morning due to a bright light outside my window.  I&apos;m a light sleeper, but I was roused from my slumber because I felt like something was &quot;out-of-place.&quot;  It was a weird intuitive feeling that someone/something was outside peering in.  I had the window blinds open and since I&apos;m nearsighted, the bright light was blurry and very large (grapefruit size) through the glass, until I put my glasses on, then as the light came into focus, I could tell that it was something in the sky.  I watched it for a bit, but after seeing that the light was stationary, my curiousity prevented me from going back to sleep.  The light hovered; it was not a airplane or helicopter.  And there were smaller red lights, located around the edges of the white central light, which blinked slowly.  As I watched the light through the window on and off for over an hour (I finally got up and got ready for a trip to see family), I noticed that the light moved from window pane to another; meaning that it was slowly moving across the sky.  The UFO was hovering above the ground at what I would estimate at several hundred feet (a little higher than a radio or cell tower).  My window faces south/southwest so the UFO was hovering above northern Williamson County, TN; I live in southern Davidson County near Brentwood.  My apt. is on the 3rd floor atop a good-sized hill, so I have a fantastic view of the horizon through my bedroom window. I&apos;m a 31-year old, well-educated, white male, and I have seen UFOs before, but I&apos;ve never reported one until now.  A UFO that I saw a couple of years ago hovering in urban Nashville was seen by several people and the local newspaper (Tennessean) ran an article, but I did not notice an article regarding this UFO siting.  This siting was extremely vivid and I&apos;m convinced that it was &quot;real&quot;; because the image has stuck with me, I&apos;ve decided to report it to someone that might find the information useful.", "After seeing a star pulsing colors me and my 8 year old son shot some pretty good 35mm stills through a 270mm lens with 800 speed color film.((NUFORC Note:  The report suggests to us that the witnesses may have been observing a &quot;twinkling&quot; star.))", "ufo streaked across the sky, like to know what we saw.My wife and I were sitting outside when she noticed a light in the sky behind me and exclaimed &quot;look at that.&quot; I looked up and observed a bright light moving rapidly North in a straight line. I watched the object until trees on the horizon blocked it from view. I thought the object was probably something burning up entering the atmosphere as it streaked across the sky, and when it was almost out of sight I thought I saw a splinter of light seperate. There were no navigation lights and it was larger than any meteor I ever saw. I have seen satellites but this was larger and brighter. This object left no tail, which is curious to me as I witnessed the space shuttle reentering the atmosphere to land in Florida. I am a pilot and my wife is a nurse.", "I was driving with my daughter.  I saw this fast moving object come from the behind the moon.  I told my daughter,(she&apos;s 16), to look at the fast jet.  Approximately 10 seconds past and this object was very far away from the moon. We kept looking at how fast this was moving. I&apos;d say after 30 seconds the object was across the atmosphere. Totally opposite from where the moon is. I saw 2 lights on the object. No flashing lights.  My daughter said she saw a red light.Friday night I took my daughter out to dinner. We were driving east on Deerfield Road going into Highland Park,IL.  As I recall it was about 6:30 pm(18:30.  At first I saw 2 very bright lights by the moon.  I could tell that they were airplanes.  I saw the flashing lights. Then about a minute later I saw a bright light come from behind the moon. This object was moving very fast and heading to the south at a very high speed.  I told my daughter to keep her eye on it.  I told herthat it&apos;s going to fast to be a jet. I saw 2 white lights and my daughter said she saw a red light. I did not see any flashing lights, like you see on a airplane or a jet.  From the location of the moon being in front of me. This object was heading in a southerly direction.

They had no idea what it was so they took a left away from the lights.  As soon as they turned the lights must have came over two miles in two seconds the lights got right behind them.  About ten yards away.  The lights were like huge spot lights in a perfect strait line behind them. The lights followed them around curves and up and down hills, the kids were now going about 80 miles and hour and it was still behind them.  Suddenly they stopped and disappeared.  What was wierd was the 8 lights in perfect pairs of two spread out across the road, reaching beyond the telephone poles on both sides, but never broke any of them.  The lights were about 8 feet above the vehicle the kids were driving.  The lights were not higher than the poles, but never touched them.3 boys were driving down a country road tuesday night about 9:00.  They were not to far from one of the boy&apos;s house.  They came to a &quot;T&quot; in the road and were going to go right.  When suddenly they saw 8 Bright lights in pairs of two about two miles away.  They thought is was four pickup trucks lined up, parked in a field.   Not many people live out there so they decided to go left instead of right, just because they didn&apos;t know who it was.  When the boys tured left, the lights started to move towards them in a perfect line ( **  **  **  **)just like that.  They thought all of the vehicles were coming towards them through the field in a strait line, so they stepped on the gas peddle.  They said it was not 2 seconds later and the eight lights were about ten feet behind them, the lights made the whole inside of the truck glow.  It was like 8 huge spot light hoovering above the road.  What was wierd, the lights stayed directly behind them for about a mile and a half as the boys drove eighty.  The lights spread across the road, and they were even much wider than the road, why did it not affect the telephone poles or trees, the lights went right through them.  The lights were directly behind the boys, or maybe just a few feet above them but not much.  The boys topped a hill, and went down it but the lights suddenly stopped.  The lights stayed on the hill, and the three boys will not go back there.   The boys are not lying, one of them has gratuated from high school, one is a junior, and the other a senior in high school.", "Abduction to underground facility.On the night of the event, I went to bed just after 2AM. I seemed to be having a strange dream.  In the dream I was back in the house I grew up in.  I was in my bedroom.  What was odd about this so called dream, was that this bedroom didn&apos;t look at all like my bedroom.  The furniture was not like bedroom furniture, it was more hospital-like.  A person came in the room that appeared to look like my sister.  We had conversation, then she left the room.  Another person that looked like my mother came into the room.  We also had conversation. I was told that I was tired and I needed to take a nap.  I was told to go lay on my bed.  When I approached the bed, I noticed it looked like a hospital bed.  I remember thinking if this is supposed to be a dream, why am I seeing this.  I took a closer look at this bed and I noted a table to the right of the bed.  On top of the table was some sort of rectangular device that was beige in color.  There were wires coming out of the side of this box that connected to the bed.  At the back of the box there were wires that went into the wall.  I took my left hand and touched the bed.  I could feel some sort of low electric current.  I new something was very wrong here.  My first instinct was to run.  I turned around and ran out of this room.  To my left was a rampway.  I ran down this rampway and around to the front of this sort of building. When I had taken to run , I heard someone say &quot;Uh-Oh&quot;.  I turned around to see if anyone was following me. I saw a man in a light blue spandex looking outfit. I went to run, to the right of me was, a person that looked like my deceased grandmother. She said &quot;take me instead&quot; at that point I realized I was not dreaming, I had become fully awake. I feel as if I went into shock, My heart was beating so fast and I was shaking, I looked down, I had on the pajamas I had worn to bed and I was in my bare-feet. I couldn&apos;t believe that this was happening to me. It would be very hard for me to descibe the place because it was so unreal. As I was t! rying to run from this man chasing me, I looked ahead and there was another, he was leading a woman that appeared to be drugged. I felt I had nowhere to run, so I turned and faced my pursuer, he had his arm reached out to grab me. To avoid any bad repurcussions I placed my hand in his hand. When I looked at the face of this man his eyes were covvered with some sort of visor but I could tell this man was not fully human, when I placed my hand in his hand he had a strange grin on his face, he then placed my hand on his groin area. The feeling I had was as if I was cattle, I was lead over to what looked like an orange van and I noticed the van had no wheels. The back passenger door slide open as I was being put into the van I remember praying out loud but could only repeat the same line over and over again &quot;Our Father who art in heaven&quot;. Inside the van were what appeared to be three children around the age of twelve and they said to me &quot;We worship too.&quot; I noticed the childrens&apos; mouth weren&apos;t moving. I was sitting in the van opposite the children, the two beings in the blue got into the front compartment of the van, I could see into the front compartment because there was a glass partition above the seat I was sitting in. I noticed a control panel running along the front of the van interior, then I turned to look at the three children, they were just watching me. I said to the children &quot; aren&apos;t you afraid?&quot; and the said &quot; no, this has been happening all our lives.&quot;. I had then noticed the van had started acsending vertically. I looked at the children and I asked if we were from the same planet and they replied &quot;yes&quot;. What struck me funny was that I was looking out the window and It was beautiful looking at the lights of what appeared to be a city. These children were just watching me. At some point I remember asking &quot;Why is this happening to me?&quot; and &quot;There is no God, otherwise he wouldn&apos;t let this happen to me..&quot;. I became very angry and I turned and started banging on the glass partition. I felt something on the l! ower bac k section of my skull and lost conciousness. The next thing I remember is being lead to a room by my initial pursuer, we were standing outside the doorway of a room, when I looked in the room I saw appoximately fifteen people casually talking, they were all dressed in white. The being that was holding my hand started speaking to a man in the room to the right. The man in the room said to him &quot;I&apos;m not a telepath, you&apos;ll have to talk&quot; at some point I heard GH3 and also the man&apos;s name which I will withhold at this time. The man to the right said &quot; I&apos;ll tell them your ready&quot; at this point I lose conciousness again. When I awake I am in this orange-red lite room. I will keep this less graphic as possible. It was a none human on top of me and I felt as if my upper arms were restrained, I reached up and touched the face it was definately not human skin, I looked to my right and could see where the red light was eminating from, there was a run of lights pulsating the orange-red color. This lighting made it rather dificult to make out things in the room clearly. The being on top of me was making a strange none human type of noise that sounded almost like a lion purring but faster. I looked to my left there were other exam tables and a person lying on it and the same was happening to this person as was happening to me. I tried to fight this but was totally helpless. I lost conciousness again. I came to in my bedroom with excruitiaing pain in my lower abdomin, I looked at my clock, it was 4:01am. I triede to get out of my bed, it was very hard I felt drugged, I started to cry and scream at the same time. I have three older children in my house that are very light sleepers. I sat on my floor crying and screaming for a good ten minutes. Not one of them heard a thing at 4:01 but one of them at around 2:20am heard a commotion in my bedroom but went to sleep. When I went to use the bathroom I had found physical evidence that something had happened to me. 1 1/2 later the mans name that I heard in the white room to the ri! ght I fo und on the Internet, I pulled up at picture of him and it was the same man. This man is known in the U.F.O. community. Whether or not this is the actual man, I don&apos;t know, if the can make me think I am seeing my mother, sister and grandmother then they could also make me see someone else whom I&apos;ve never met.", "On 3 separate occasions over a 3 minute span, we saw objects moving around and interweaving with each other at a high speed and they appreared to be moving upward.Clear, cold, windy night.  2 witnesses who had never seen anything like this before.  The lights were so fast compared to an airline.  They also disappeared very quickly.  We have never seen anything so spectacular in the sky before.", "While stargazing, a dark black object entered into my line of sight and headed toward the city. Very fluid and fast. No sound. A little bit of light seemed to be reflecting off of the forward section of the object. Then it disappeared into the city glow.The time of my sighting is quite an odd coincidence and coincides with many events that are happening in my life. That particular night I was just feeling the cusp of a new contentness and so while hanging out with my friends in their upstairs apartment, I decided to go outside for a quick breather to be alone with myself. On the balcony (note: the balcony is only 2 feet of the ground), I was contemplating all the coincidences that had happened that entire week and even up to that day. I had no idea that something bizarre was also going to be added to the rest of them. Well I guess I felt frisky, so I hopped the balcony and walked over to the sidewalk and layed back to stargaze. We live in the Kinnear section of Queen Anne (the west side of the hill). And our apartments look out over Magnolia. I was only out on the sidewalk for a good five to seven minutes when the sighting occured. I want to stress the fact that I did &quot;ask&quot; for a sighting that night like so many other times I&apos;ve done in the past but have been so awfully disappointed. My family does have a UFO/e.t. history so I thought I was being neglected, I should say. Before that night I had never seen a UFO or a visitor contact. To continue with my sighting; I noticed a good amount of planes that night and I noted that they seemed to have more blinking lights these days. They may have always been that way, but maybe just now I realized it? I could hear all these planes just fine, but the object I saw made no sound at all. I must have been staring out into nothingness (basically straight up) when a dark object entered into my line of sight. I want to note that I did not see it coming out of the corner of my eye, but rather it entered very near to the exact spot I was looking at. I was a dark shadowy object that emitted no light and was heading sort of in a SSE direction toward the city. I believe when I first saw it, it was completely dark. But as it flew in toward the city I think it did start to reflect some city light (I only speculate here) on ! the forw ard section of the craft. As it drew near the glow of the downtown area it sort of faded away and disappeared. I&apos;m not sure if it merely flew into a misty pollution of the city lights or if it purposely made itself invisible. Anyways, the object made no sound and I really have nothing to compare it&apos;s size to, since I was looking straight up. Compared to the other planes I saw that night it did seem like it was flying about as low as the normally can go, and it seemed more solid, as the object I saw was circular in shape. Also, when comparing the object I saw to all the rest of the planes that night. This object sort of &quot;swooshed&quot; in and was not using a direct line of flight. All the other planes up there seemed to be stiff and rigid in the flight plans, while this was like a bird swooping on in. That&apos;s about it. The important thing that this sighting has taught me is that, despite my family&apos;s history of seeing UFO&apos;s and E.T.&apos;s, I am even now doubting my sighting. And unless an E.T. comes up to me and taps me on the shoulder, or a gov&apos;t agent comes up to me and explains the entire truth behind the whole enigma, all of us will have doubts. Descartes was really on to something I guess. Thank you.", "another person and i were driving home on a semi - unoccupied road. i noticed a strange glow, an almost greenish light in the sky, in a triangular shape. it was moving a bit but mostly hovering and then it was gone. a few seconds later it reappeared, and then it flashed on and off , moving quickly in the sky. my friend and i were astonished but not afraid, we stopped the car and turned the lights off, and a minute later it stopped glowing and we could not determinee if it was there anymore. the interesting thing about this was that after we started the car back up, we statrted to talk about another subject and did not remember this event until 2 weeks later.it was hard to see any detail, it was at night. this happened in a populated area but there were not many cars around. the object was emitting a pulsating light or glow with a greenish tint. it was in the distance so i could not say anything about the size. it hovered a bit, and at one point moved in a circular track. when it moved along the sky, it zipped very quickly and the light went on and off. after a while there was no more light, i dont know if the light was gone or the entire object was.", "PALE GREEN LIGHT MOVING VERY FAST FROM NE TO SW.

The lights were far away from eachother at times but seemed to mirror eachothers movements. At times, they would be directly on top of eachother moving in the same bizaar manner. A manner that did not seem logical for human purposes.  I thought perhaps rescue helicopters far off shore but I ruled this out because of the incredible speed and the bizaar nature of these lights.

The weather was partly overcast at that time with a cloud ceiling of approximately 2,000-3,00 ft.  I looked to the NE and saw a large chevron/boomerang shape moving slowly under the cloud layer.  At first I thought it was an airplane but this object had no fuselage or tail.  I watched for about 7 sec. and stuck my head in the kitchen door and called a friend outside to try to get another point of view.  She came out and I asked her if she saw the object or heard any sound.  At this time the object was passing overhead at about a 15 degree angle.  She could not see it, I supposed because her eyes were not yet accustomed to the light.  I continued to observe and I got a real good look at it.  There was no moon to the south/east/north so it was not a shadow.  I could not see a defined leading edge of the &quot;wing&quot;, it looked so black and impossibly thin.  It almost reminded me of smoke.  I kind of thought it was a flock of geese, but it did not change shape.  As I continued looking I could see the faded orange glow of the Poughkeepsie Galleria mall lights along the rear edge.  I could see surface texture so the object was not smooth.  The orange glow was jagged, and there was a small &quot;squarish&quot; bump on the right side.  The craft still made no noise.  I continued to study the object untill it dissapeared from view in the treeline.  I estimate the size of the object to be approximately 200 to 300 feet wide from tip to tip.

After hovering for five min&apos;s, the object moves Eastward.On the night of Tuesday, January 28th, 1973, A double tiered &quot;Windowed&quot; Saucer shaped craft is observed from my bedroom window.

The bottom side of the craft was completely dark with the exception of two lights (bluish-white in color) that went around in a circle. (Clockwise from my point of view.) Then after hovering for about five minutes, the craft begins to move towards the East, flying along at its low altitude of roughly a hundred feet give or take, then vanishes from view.", "silent large titanium colored craft with black windowsWas standing in my yard looking at 5/8 moon.  As I looked there was a craft moving from left to right.  At first,  I thought it must be airliner,  but no vertical stabilizer, then no wings, no engines.  No sound,  no trail.  Figure it was 10 thousand ft altitude,  maybe 5 miles away. Almost a thumb width at arm&apos;s length. The color was that of a titanium golf iron or wood, very polished and seemed to be reflecting the sun.  But the sun was nearly down,  and the craft was not in a position to reflect any sunlight towards me. Craft was moving NE to SW;  climbing at say 20% and accelerated out of sight. I&apos;ve seen a drawing of this craft somewhere,  probably a book.", "I saw a smoky gray cylinder with blue vertical stripes dividing the cylinder into thirds.  I have no idea of the altitude, since I don&apos;t know the actual size, but when I held my fist at arm,s length there was still a full inch showing on both sides of my hand.  The object traveled slowly from west to east directly over my home.At 08:40 I was leaving home for work as a federal security officer.  I looked into the sky  to check out the &quot;contrails&quot;.  There were absolutely no clouds in the sky, and only a few contrails.  Just below the contrails I noted a smoky gray cylinder floating through the sky from west to east.  It appeared to be about the same size as a 747 would appear at about 5,000 feet. It proceeded to fly directly over my home.  I noted also that it was divided into thirds by blue vertical lines.  As it went behind a tree in the yard, there was a flash of some type of energy in the middle third of the cylinder.  I then stepped to the other side of the tree to try to pick it up as it came out the other side, but it never came out.  The size of this object The object protruded about on inch when compared to my closed fist held at arms length.  There was no tail or wings and no noise of any kind.  There was also no wind that might have moved any noise away from me.  I tried to convince myself that this was just a jet liner, but I watch jets in the sky frequently and have never seen anything like this before.  I tried to blow it off but the next night objects of similar description were reported by Mr. Davenport on Coast to Coast. I wish someone else had seen it and reported.  But according to the data on your sight, they have not.  There was something very strange.  The image almost seemed to be computer animation and the flash of &quot;energy&quot; in the middle section looked just like a cartoon drawing of an explosion.", "My sister and I saw an object that apeared to be 3 spheres connected togeather by a Y type of structure in the middle.My sister and I were parked on an access road off of HYW 74 and just east of the GM plant. We were watching the annual fireworks display put on by the GM company. It was a clear night with a small amount of wind blowing from the west to the east. About 15 minutes into the show the light from some high fireworks lite up an object traveling from the east to the west. It looked strange and was traveling against the wind and didn&apos;t have any lights on. I was able to get a closer look at it with a pair of binoculars that I kept in the car. As the object passed over the GM plant the lights of the plant illuminated the object and gave us a better view. My sister and I took turns veiwing the object with the binoculars. We watched it until it faded into the darkness in the western sky. My sister and I then independantly made seperate drawings of what we saw. We then compared the drawing and they were the same. The object looked like 3 sphere&apos;s connected togeather by a Y type structure. One shere was attached to each end of the Y and the object appeared to rotate around the middle of the Y. There was&apos;nt anyway to determine the size or speed or distance or color of the object. We only know what it looked like illuminated by the GM lights.", "Driving along road that runs parallel to military base, a bright white/amber light shot over the sky at an extremely low distance, could not have been a falling star due to its horizontal to horizontal movement and the closeness of it to the ground.  It was enough to stun me and the other occupant of my car and then was gone.", "A very slow moving, white with a greenish tint streak of light moving in a northern direction.My wife wrote to you earlier of my observation.  I was traveling home on the evening of the 16th, and at 6:05 p.m., a light out of the corner of my eye caught my attention.  When I looked up into the sky, just above the woodline, I saw a streak of white light with a greenish tint to it traveling very slow in a northern direction.  There seemed to be broken up in sections, like the lights might have been windows.  I had heard earlier that day that there was a meteor shower scheduled for that evening, so I thought I was seeing one of the meteors.  But it traveled so slowly, so I continued to watch it while driving down this curvy road.  The view of the object was cut-off by the woodline every so often so I couldn&apos;t tell if it was a low flying airplane of some sort.  I&apos;ve been in the reserves for 13 years now and I&apos;ve flown in transport planes and they can fly at a very slow rate also, so my next guess was that, maybe a C-130 or something like that.  I knew that in a moment I would come to a clearing and I would get a good view of the craft, because by the time I came to a curve, the object was completely obscured by the woodline.  When I came to the clearing, which was only 8 seconds from the last time I saw the object, it had vanished.  It was a clear, starlit night.  I heard nothing, but I had the windows up.  There wasn&apos;t any traffic in front of me or behind me during this event.  It wasn&apos;t a reflection of any lights on the inside of the vehicle or the other side of the vehicle.  The craft, or object, was moving ever so slow in the same direction as I went around a few curves.  I&apos;m not a believer in UFO&apos;s, but I don&apos;t renounce them either.  I&apos;m the type of person who has to see it to believe it.  I would like to know what it was though.  I know the heading of the craft is right because the next morning (this morning) I took a compass to the sight and noted my bearing.  Just thought you&apos;d like to know.  Thanks for listening.", "It was spotted quickly, not looking for it, we all saw the same.  It had two balls of light, diagonal shaft of light attaching them.  It moved across the horizon from West to East.It was approximately 40` above the horizon.  Both spots of light travelled at identical speed, and had exact position of balls of lights remain at the same diagonal position to each other as they moved.  At the time they were the brightest thing in the sky.  There was no sound.  We do have a flight path above our island, and therefore realise that this was definitely not a plane.  We observed it for approximately 15 seconds whilst the light got weaker and orange then red until it disappeared.  The shaft of light disappeared five seconds  before the two balls of light. It was approximately 9.45pm on 29th December 1999.", "JUST PAST MIDNIGHT I LOOKED OUT MY LIVING ROOM WINDOW AND SAW A LOW FLYING FLASHING LIGHT GOING EAST ONLY ABOUT 150&apos; TO 200&apos; OFF THE GROUND I WENT TO MY FRONT DOOR STEP ON THE PORCH THE OBJECT DIDN&apos;T MAKE ANY NOISE THE WHITE FLASHING LIGHT WAS ON THE PORT SIDE OF OBJECT ON THE BACK OR STERN PART OF OBJECT THERE WERE THREE RED LIGHTS IN THE SHAPE OF A TRIANGLE WITH THE PIONT DOWN IT ALMOST LOOKED RED BARS CONNECTING THE RED LIGHTS LIKE CONNECTING THE DOTS SO TO SPEAK,IT STAYED ON EAST BOUND COURSE UNTIL IT WHEN OUT OF SIGHT.SAME AS ABOVE, JUST PAST MIDNIGHT AT 0009HRS FROM MY LIVING ROOM WINDOW I NOTICE A WHITE FLASHING LIGHT FLYING LOW TO THE GROUND.

When I focused I noticed an object of the same aproximate mass just NW of the plane. At first glance it appeared to be a balloon but the fact that the small plane had begun to turn back in its direction caused me to take a good look. the plane did not fully turn back and the object got my complete attention. I lost my theory of a balloon when i noticed its steady and deliberate nw trajectory. It did however move very slowly without any sound. It was overcast in SLC today but as it came closer I did notice a slight shadow on the west facing underside. thats when i realized it definitely was something unusual. I watched for aprox 8 minutes, hoping to peek the interest of motorists on 3600 west street. not knowing what to do I continued back to work glancing back several times, the last time I looked back (aprox 10 min into event) the object was gone. I work at a very consertive place and aginst my better judgement I reluctantly told two of the more open minded people what I had seen. Im sure they think Im nuts but I had to share this event! If i was to form an opinion as to the objects purpose/origin it was what I would think an unmanned observation craft might look like, I say this based on the size, shape and demeanor of the craft. Lastly I would sure like to speak to the pilot of that small plane &amp; I hope because of the proximity to SLC Int airport there is a radar record of this event.", "A white circular-shaped glowball at night appeared in front of me at my bedroom window.

I said, &quot;Oh My God, it can hear us, it can see us!&quot;.  My step sister screamed and fell to the floor.  I looked back at her and then back out the window.  It was not there, but then a split second later, it appeared in front of me.  It was about 2-3 feet in diameter.  I looked into it and it went on forever; no concrete thing in it.  I then felt a butterfly sensation in my chest and a great sensation of love and joy.  I had never felt anything like that.  Then i felt 3 hard thumps in my chest.  I felt violated and scared, but decided to wave to it and say hi.  As i did, it left and flew across the street over a house top and it felt like it had ripped something out of my chest.  I have been unable to sleep since.  I recalled this event in 1994, and would like to explain it so i can have a deep sleep without being scared.

Below cloud deck but still high. Silent, and travelling at great speed (at least 9 times faster than a commercial jet).I saw the object at the above time and location, from my back garden whilst having a cigarette. It appeared from the NE above the roof of my home, and headed towards the SW. It was travelling at great speed. I estimated it to be about 9 times faster than a comercial jet. My home was under a flight path from Heathrow, so I constantly saw jets high in the sky travelling over from the west to the east. The object was a dim, slightly glowing orange disk. The center was brighter than the outside edge. It was high, but still below the cloud deck, which was at its usual hight that evening. There were clouds dotted around the sky, and no other objects/jets etc visible at the time. As an amateur astronmer I instantly knew that this was not any kind of natural phenomena. Nor was it was like any kind of aircraft I had ever seen before. This was all the more obvious because of its great speed and silence. When the object had traversed about two thirds of the way across the sky it suddenly changed direction by about 10 degrees. The change of direction was &apos;instant&apos;, showing no curvature or arc during the maneuver. The object was silent for the entire time I saw it which, due to its speed was only about 4 or 5 seconds. The object left no vapour trail of any kind. It disapeared into the SW over houses and out of my sight. The direction was roughly towards the town&apos;s main park...Cassiobury. As it was Christmas eve I had family and friends staying with me. I went into the house and told them all. They advised me to contact the local newspaper, but I didn&apos;t. The reason for me remembering the time and date so well were of course due to the fact that it was December the 24th. Although I have always found this kind of thing interesting I have never seen anything before or since, and I am not the kind of person to &apos;fake&apos; something like this.

The lights covered 90 degrees of arc in approximately one minute. There were no white or green lights.  There was no sound. There was no sound.My wife and I were going for our evening walk.  We were watching the sky for possible meteors as the Leonids were approaching.  We noticed these two red lights moving from South to North, but could not see any shape of an aircraft with the lights.  The lights were very odd.  They looked diffused.  We had to keep re-focusing on them to keep them in sight even though they were directly overhead and not that far away.  We estimate the lights at an altitude of 10,000 to 20,000 feet based on the planes that were in the sky at that time.  We live about 24 miles from O&apos;Hare airport in Chicago. At any given time, we can see at least a dozen planes in the sky.  The sky was perfectly clear.  The strangest thing was the lack of any sound and the way the lights appeared.  Lights from other planes in the sky at the time were sharply visible.  These were fuzzy.

My sis and bro looked thru binoculars and saw they were disk shaped with multi-colored lights.  They hovered a bit, moved around a bit, then in a blink of the eye shot straight up and disappeared.  Later that evening while getting ready for bed, I looked out my window to look at the sky again and saw a floating, red, glowing ball move slowly from the woods to right outside my window and then float away down the street.  I called my sister into my room and she witnessed it just as it was moving away.  When I saw the movie &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; they showed almost the exact same type of orbs moving with the UFOs.  Anyway, we all asked our friends the next day if they saw the lights and no one we knew saw them.  It was incredible and I wish I could remember more about that night but I know what I saw and I&apos;ve never seen anything like it before or since.They were saucer or disc shaped with multi-colored lights.  There must have been at least 50, maybe more.  The night was clear and calm.  I can&apos;t remember what time of night or even the time of year it was.  That data I gave is all approximation.  My sister first observed them while walking home.  They were moving around quite a bit apparantly.  She came in the house and got my brother and both went outside and looked through binoculars.  They kept yelling for me to come outside and look but I was on the phone.  Finally, I hung up and looked and it was the most incredible thing I&apos;ve ever seen.  I couldn&apos;t look through the binoculars because I was wearing glasses and it was difficult to focus.  We watched for quite a while it seemed.  They descended slowing towards the ground in no particular formation spread throughout a portion of the sky just northwest of our neighborhood.  There could have been a hundred of them, I really can&apos;t remember and couldn&apos;t tell at the time.  There were many.

It was very obviously far away, fast moving, and high in the atmosphere.  Just from my own perception and from it&apos;s rate of travel and straight path, it was obvious to me that the object was very massive and huge, MOUNTAIN-scale.  It was travelling in an inertial straight line skimming the atmosphere, leaving a fire trail and sparks behind as it went.  I would definitely qualify it as almost an asteroidal near miss event.

We were about one half mile from a group of about forty workers putting support members in the ground for the pipeline.  My partner pointed out a bright light on a mountain directly across from us about 40 miles away.  As we watched the light it appeared to &quot;step&quot; down in four moves to the bottom of the mountain.  It then came towards us accross the treeless tundra (light got larger than the moon which was visible), stopped, and went back to just a bit to the right of the original mountain site.  The light did this three more times (about three seconds each trip) as if searching the tundra.  As the light came closer the last time, I turned on the spotlight and directed it towards the light.  It approached us coming to about a quarter mile away and slowly came closer.  The light was then about three times the size of the moon.  As it was getting closer we got scared, shut off the spotlight and sped off down the haul road. We could see the light at its present size accompanying us on our left side the two miles to the construction camp.  We slid in to the warm-up shack and ran inside where there were about ten men  on break.  We all went outside to see what it was but it was gone.  The next morning at breakfast it was found that many people had seen this &quot;light&quot; and truckers coming up the haul road could see a large red light on the back of the craft.  No description of the body of this craft was given because of the darkness.

For about the first thirty seconds as it approached, we looked for airplane blinkers, and the object definitley passed &quot;close&quot; enough to see some sort of shape with absolutely no blinkers. Then I tried to get the object sighted in my finder scope but could not (that was for probably another 30 seconds). Then four other observers wandered out into the backyard and they watched, while I ran back inside to fetch my binoculars.  It took about another 45 seconds for me to get back.  I quickly found the object in my binoculars and watched for about another minute or two.  I tried to be conservative in my time estimates -- several other observers think it took much longer on the order of 4-6 minutes.  There was no sound at all.  The object was glowing a fairly bright orange.  It moved entirely in a straight line, with no apparent trail.  It was also fairly large visually, about as large as an airplane looks when passing overhead still in ascent (we are very near Lambert Airport).  The object generally went east to west, at about 45 degrees from us when it passed the closest.  Although I had the binoculars and noted that there was some apparent shape, I could not steady the view enough to determine the shape.  Another observer with keen eyesight described it as a &quot;flattened egg&quot; or oval.  The time of 19:30 CST is a very rough estimate, as none of us thought to check our watches at the time.  It was definitely well before 20:15 CST. The object did not originate anywhere at all near where there is supposed to be some meteor activity.  My first guess would be a sattelite reentry. I am 33 years old, and I am a new amateur astronomer.  I do not believe in extra-terrestrials, but this was a bizarre event nonetheless, confirmed by several observers.  Four of the other observers were in their 30&apos;s &amp; 40&apos;s, both male and female, and there was a 6 yr. old boy who also watched.  As I said, the more I think about it, the more likely it becomes that it was a reentering sattelite in my opinion.  Nobody was &quot;under the influence&quot; -- there was no alcohol at our gathering.", "Three balls of fire, one larger than the others, flew across sky and disappeared over horizonThree balls of fire, one larger than the others, flew across the sky and disappeared over the horizon. They travelled single-file, with the larger ball in the lead. They did not have tails, and did not look like meteors. They were white in color, bright white light, reminiscent of fireworks, but they did not die away like fireworks. The objects were seen at the University of Toledo, witnessed by 4 students (including myself)and 1 professor.", "Viewed a ball of hot pink light above the treetops.  It was moving sporadically up and down and side to side. Then after approx. 2 min. it blinked out.While setting up to view the Leonids Meteor Shower my friend form work ((name deleted)) and I happened to see a bright light to the South West. The whole object was consumed in this hot pink light. We viewed the hot pink light as it zig-zaged across the sky making sharp patterns and turning back in on itself.  It would accelerate up and down as well.  ((name deleted)) went to get his binoculars out of the car while I kept an eye on the object.  While he was getting the binoculars it just blinked out.  While on the phone with Mr. Davenport we thought we saw what was another UFO in the south east but determined that it was only a star after closer observation. There was no way that the first object we saw was a star or a conventional aircraft. Of that we are both absolutely sure. Since Mr. Davenport was on the phone when we saw the star we thought it necessary to include it in the report and let him know that we were in error.  Having said that we end this report.", "This was an object that could hover stationary and then accelerate to 2,000 mph or possibly much higher... it would move instantaneously with a blur of speed to a point 30&ordm; to 90&ordm; across the night shy. I lived on air bases all my life- please read the following information. I have sent this stuff the Art Bell... this WAS REAL. It was NOT FROM THIS WORLD !!!Dear Whitley, (I also sent this to Art.) I am in a most unique position. I have been observing the night sky since 1983 from a snowcat in the high Sierras. Where I am, from midnight to morning, there is no light pollution. I have seen some extraordinary night- sky natural phenomena that were quite spectacular- I would love to tell you about them. I once saw a Macy&rsquo;s- sized chunk of ice light up the entireTahoe basin a cobalt blue as bright as day&hellip; it must have been as big as an iceberg&hellip; skipped across the upper atmosphere in a swath of cobalt- blue light spewing green and gold sparks. Rock and metal, I imagine&hellip; the ionizing H2O lit the night sky like a magnesium flare.  I was perched on a crag of rock at the top of Echo Summit kicking back in my Bombardier snowcat at the top of Sierra At Tahoe ski area taking a break and watching the comet two years ago&hellip; when this GIANT meteorite- if you could call it that, it had to be almost all ice-gouged it&rsquo;s way sluggishly across the top of the atmosphere&hellip; Though spectacularly beautiful, such sights do not make the spine tingle and the skin crawl, the hair stand on end..&hellip;but I saw something that did one night, and that story follows&hellip; Please read this letter. I think you will find it interesting- I love Dreamland- I am fascinated by the people who call in who have seen UFO&rsquo;s- because I had an amazing encounter with one, and so did my father, who was a United Airlines pilot for thirty years. I never DREAMED I would have such an experience. My God, when it happens to YOU it changes the way you look at the night sky FOREVER. As you will read, the craft I saw could not even be from our corner of this solar system, as it defied the local constants of physics completely. Here are my stories. Absolutely true. They read like installment- articles because they were posts I made to a together-list on the net. If you think it would be of interest to your listeners, I would enjoy talking to you on the air about my years in cats at night in the high Sierra. I am articulate and though this is not the same, perhaps, as being an abductee, still, my range of night sky observations make for interesting listening. Call me if you&rsquo;d like to talk about it. I enjoy relating the stories. In January of 1992 I was sitting in my Bombardier snowcat on a run at Sierra at Tahoe, Echo Summit, Hwy. 50, South Lake Tahoe. It was around 3AM, I was making snow on Broadway. I was rested, had NOT been drinking or taking any kind of mind- altering substances !!! I am NOT a recreational drug user! I was facing to the east... the night sky was very dark and clear, with almost no light coming up from the Tahoe Basin, which was about ten miles to the east. I saw an oddly bright orange ball of fire coming up in the direction of the basin...it had unusual detail in the corona, kind of a flickering. I thought about it and decided I was looking at the exhaust of a large jet taking off out of Tahoe airport and flying directly away from me... thus the orange ball of fire. It did occur to me as odd, because large jets had ceased regular service to Tahoe several months earlier. It was raising up quite quickly...then it abruptly- and by abruptly, I mean instantaneously! took off north at a speed that made it a streak of bright orange fire. Then it stopped of a dime, hovered motionless for a second, then proceeded to do a number of these maneuvers over the next sixty seconds. I got the major willies. I was not scared, but I knew that nothing any human could build in THIS age could withstand those kind of forces- OR accelerate with the speed of the USS Enterprise going into Warpdrive. I jumped out of my cat almost instantly, looking all around to see if there were any other sources of light that could have caused a reflection on the inside of my windshield- but there weren&apos;t, and there it was, still making the same movements. I would guess from the detail and from the fact that it was to my side of a couple of peaks in the far off distance that it was three to five miles away... Then it shot straight down out of sight- and reappeared a few seconds later, shot up to about 5,000 feet above me- hovered for a minute, then instantly rose at a speed beyond anything previous, shooting straight up into the sky on a pillar o! f orange light that looked like a neon tube, and kept going, right on out of the atmosphere. I could see it for a long time, it was visible all the way out of the atmosphere. I had tried to call another cat operator to check it out but he was out of his cat at the time and busy with the snowgun he was running and did not look up. However, I was to learn this last year that I am not the only one in the Tahoe basin to see this type of craft. During my sighting of this orange fiery object, the manuevers it performed  gave me the willies- I was not fearful, the thing was a long way off- but it was covering a lot of miles on it&apos;s one-second trajectories. It moved across the night sky approximately 40 to 60 degrees...left to right, right to left, with huge altitude changes, and some of it&apos;s movements were shorter and more nearly vertical. I could not think of any possible reason for these weird manuevers. It was moving so fast that there was no real appreciable acceleration or deceleration... it was stationary, then there was a streak of orange light, then it was stationary somewhere else for a moment. I was very happy and excited to witness this. I always wondered if maybe I would see some strange phenomenon in the sky, being up in a cat on the top of the Sierra where visibility is so good, but never thought I would see anything so clearly impossible by present human technological standards... and never before or since have I seen anything so wild.. Four months after the UFO sighting in 1992, I went to a local pizza parlor where a friend was putting on the showing of a Christic Institute film called &quot;the secret war&quot;, narrated by Elizabeth Montgomery (see it if you ever have the chance- it&apos;s about the Iran Contra affair) and at the show was a very odd, spooky looking guy who said nothing until everyone was on the verge of leaving, then asked if he could have a moment to speak to everyone. He admitted that he was not there for the movie, but rather, wanted to know if anyone present had seen any ufo&apos;s in the Tahoe Basin... I thought about that for a moment and went over and said, yes, I had. He then asked me if it had been coming from the direction of the lake. I said it seemed to be...HE THEN ASKED ME IF IT WAS AN ORANGE BALL OF LIGHT. I said, yes.... WAS IT MAKING JERKY MOVEMENTS. I got the willies all over again! I looked more closely at this guy... tall, thin, gaunt, wild- eyed, looked like he had been maybe had a real bad fright he never got over&hellip; Spooky... I asked him, how the HELL did you know WHAT I SAW? He said,that&apos;s what EVERYBODY&apos;S BEEN SEEING. Turns out he had seen one like mine a couple of years earlier and had been so affected by it that he had been traveling around the Lake Tahoe Basin asking people about sightings, and he had come up with a bunch of people who had all observed similar craft- coming out of the lake or from near the lake, orange- white balls of fire, jerky, high- acceleration movement and eventual flight straight up. He asked me if I wanted to know why they made the jerky movements. He said he had talked to people from Nevada who &ldquo;knew about these things&rdquo;... said the air force &amp; CIA had learned from the Roswell craft that the controls in these things were bioelectronic, that the beings set their hands into little recesses in the seats and interfaced their own nervous systems into the craft&apos;s guidance systems, which were part-biological, and that focussed microwave beams could disrupt and disable the craft- and that the ! operator s did these maneuvers in order to avoid being shot down! Well, I don&apos;t know if I believe that. for one thing, why couldn&apos;t they just go blazing straight out of the atmosphere at a zillion knots, that should be sufficient to avoid being shot down. But I do know this- I know what I saw that night, and it was not of this planet. No human- OR human machine- could take such forces without becoming pate&rsquo;... and no structure running under the known physical constants of our little part of the universe could suffer such G forces without turning into little pieces of scrap metal. It seems to me that these things carry around with them the local constants of some other part of the universe. In fact, I have a friend who works for the air force at Edwards who wires obsolete fighters to be used as drones to be shot down by pilots in gunnery school who told me about the Aurora project... 9G&apos;s, but pilotless... flies on some kind of propane pulse engine... it&apos;s what they&apos;ve been seeing and hearing in LA, the things that leave the smoke rings up high in the sky... and that is a primitive and slow craft compared to what I saw that night. This last winter, I started at Sierra and had been working for a few weeks...while in the cat barn, I heard a couple of snowmakers talking...one of them said, &quot;Keep your eyes out for those &quot;UFO&apos;S&quot; Chuck, the security guard, has been seeing! Yeah, said he saw some BIG ORANGE BALLOF FIRE MAKING JERKY MOTIONS IN THE SKY...Ha Ha Ha Ha!!!!&rdquo; I turned around and said, WHAT DID YOU SAY!!! WHO saw this! They told me and I tracked him down... a retired man who works at Sierra as a security guard... turned out he and his wife were on the deck of their house last summer off of North Upper Truckee Road, looking south toward Meiss Meadow... which puts their sighting about the same place MINE was, - TRIANGULATION tells us more accurately where the things seem to be coming from- and he described the EXACT SAME THING I SAW. IDENTICAL. He was worried about me telling people, he didn&apos;t want people at Sierra to know, he was afraid they&apos;d think him crazy. What I have related here is all true. SOMEthing IS going on !!! I can&apos;t BELIEVE we humans fly around in machines that can do what I saw that night. I DON&apos;T think that it&apos;s US. It&apos;s THEM. Whoever they are...I just hope- they&apos;re friendly. &ldquo;My father was a pilot for United Airlines for 29 years... once he returned home with a wild story about seeing a UFO... and here it is. My father is a very humorless and pragmatic individual who never had much interest in gags or jokes... so I was interested to hear his tale of seeing a UFO once in 1970...I was fourteen... he came back from a flight and told me this story... &quot;We were enroute from Chicago to LaGuardia when ground control advised us to be on the lookout for a large object that was on their radar and had been observed by several airliners in the area...as we got closer to the object we picked it up on our screen... we had a United VicePresident aboard, a captain, co- pilot,(my dad) second officer(engineer) and four stewardesses...all of whom saw the object-There were two other airliners watching the thing when we got visual on It. It had been doing high- speed erratic manuevers but was stationary when we got it on radar... then it started pacing us, staying several miles ahead and to the right...then ground control asks us, is it still there? It just went off of our screen! Right out of the MIDDLE of the screen...We had it in visual contact, as did another aircraft, but it just blinked off of everyone&apos;s radar, one by one...we were most interested in it at that point...then it shot across our flight path to our port side, and it was so fast you almost couldn&apos;t see it, just a blur...then it paced us for a while on our port side...it was a large sphere,maybe a hundred feet across or bigger...it had a green light on top and a red light on the bottom, both lights alternately tracing a path around the perimeter of the body of the craft, the green doing a half-circle across the top, left to right, the red doing an arc across the bottom half, right to left...then it shot at us at perhaps 2000- 3000 miles per hour, passing under us to our left perhaps several hundred yards below us. The shock wave rattled the airplane violently, as if we had hit a huge air pocket...&quot; About a week after my father came home with this story, a letter marked &apos;confidential&apos; came in the mail from the air force. My father was out of town on a flight. I was very curious to know if it had anything to do with his sighting. I opened it. (I knew he wouldn&apos;t care) It requested my father to attend a meeting in Manhattan in a week to discuss the sighting and it specified that he was not allowed to discuss the sighting with ANYONE, including family. This confirmed to me that he had seen what he said he did.Then, the capper: in 1993, I was watching a special, a Sixty-Minutes sort of thing on UFO&apos;s, and there was one segment that went as follows: in 1970, two airforce fighter pilots were scrambled over Norad in the Rockies to check out a large UFO which was in Norad airspace and not responding to identification requests. Both of these pilots, since retired, were able to get fairly close to the thing before it took off at a zillion miles an hour...they said, (and it was another of those getting- the- willies- moments) it was a large sphere with a green and red light, both moving in a semicircle around it, alternating left to right. They saw exactly what my father saw, same year, same continent, just 1800 miles away... This was the story he told us, my mom and me. I was very surprised and as it was extremely out of character for him to make up a story like this, I believed he had seen SOMEthing....", "pulsing colored lights streaking across the sky northwest to southeastMr. Peter Davenport UFO Reporting Center", "We saw a disk from the side so it appeared like a cigar.

It was bright, &quot;neon&quot; green with a bright orange, firey trail running behind it. It had brighter lights along the sides. It was flying in an arc as if it was about to crash but we did not hear a crash or see any explosion. It was not &quot;falling&quot; but was flying under power. I could not determine whether the flames were &quot;normal&quot; or were a sign of distress. We only observed it for 3 seconds and it did not change direction during that time. It only continued in a downward arc and went behind the trees where we couldn&apos;t see it. When we saw it, we were traveling along Sunset Drive in a northern direction. It was directly ahead of us, not high in the sky and arcing down as it went. After it went behind the trees, we continued to scan the sky for about 7 minutes as we drove but we didn&apos;t see anything else.", "Driving to movies with my daughter and mother and just before arriving daughter noticed a light in the sky to the west...it wasn&apos;t moving but was really bright.Heading West and arriving at Gurnee Mills Shopping Center,my daughter pointed out a bright light in the West sky.At first thought it was a reflection but could tell it was in the sky.Parked car and got out and looked up again just to see if it was still there,it was!Almost directly above us but more to the West and it wasn&apos;t moving,kinda looked like a sideways diamond or disk but it was bright like the sun!I made my Mom stop and look and she got a good 45 sec. look before the object got brighter and appeared to blink out.The sky was clear with just a few scattered clouds but none as high as the object appeared to be.We all thought it was very strange how it was there one minute and then brightened and dissappeared.There was no aircraft around that we could see or hear.Object was the size of a piece of rice if held at arms length up to the sky.", "very bright orange light travelling slowlyBright orange light travelling north at a slow pace, aircraft was seen flying underneath it, then about 2 mins later no bright light was to be seen.", "Since the first sighting of this craft, my son has seen it on a number of other occasions. Each time it was traveling in the same general direction, but at a somewhat higher altitude than the first time. It seems to have passed over the house just slightly earlier on each event, shortly after sundown just nearing the end of twilight. For your information we live in the flight path of commercial jets traveling to and from Chicago and Las Vegas, I believe, at an altitude of about 30,000 feet. Additionally, with some changes in flight approaches to Teterboro Airport in Teterboro, New Jersey we have an occasional inbound Gulf Stream or Citation at about 1500 feet one of which recently crashed in Pike County. I thought that you might find this as interesting as I did. At 8:00 P.M. on 12-22-99 I received a phone call from my son ((name deleted)) to tell me that at about 7:45 P.M. or U.T.C. 00:45 he sighted a Black Triangle shaped craft fly over our house in rural Northeastern Pennsylvania. Lackawaxen Pennsylvania (Pike County) is about 75 to 80 miles Northwest of New York City. Philip is always outside star gazing, bat watching in summer or just hoping to see a U.F.O. He was outside on the deck looking at the best full moon in 133 years. Because of the brightness of the moon he got a pretty good look at the craft. He says it had a wing span of about 80 to 100 feet wide. It was not smooth on the bottom but somewhat bumpy or rough I guess. He says that he only heard it about 3 seconds before he saw it. It came out of the Southwest and headed Northeast. ((name deleted)) estimated the altitude at around 400 feet. The sound it made was not a propeller or jet aviation engine, but rather what he described as a vibration such as you might experience in an earthquake. It seems to have not been going particularly fast.((name deleted)) describes it as having a whitish glow in front and several red navigation lights on top. He feels that it was not wide enough to have a pilot on board and could see no cockpit type configuration which lead him to conclude that it was some sort of drone craft which he had read about somewhere. One point which I was fascinated by is that he says the wide part of the triangle was the front and the narrow point of it was the tail section unlike a stealth fighter. As stated above, since the first sighting of this craft, my son has seen it on a number of other occasions. Each time it was traveling in the same general direction but at a somewhat higher altitude than the first time. It seems to have passed over the house just slightly earlier on each event, shortly after sundown just nearing the end of twilight.I might clarify something contained above. The whitish glow in front of the craft upon more extensive discussions with my son seems to have been exceptionally bright aircraft type aviation landing lights. The red light on the corners of the craft at one time appeared to be more of an orange color (different craft?) or multi stage lighting? I hope that you find this information useful! A few additional Comments in the words of my son: I have seen it a total of six times since the first sighting. In the first sighting it went about 150 to 200 M.P.H. and has increased to an estimated 500 M.P.H. as of the last sighting on Thursday 2-3-00. I am not certain that it is the same craft each time since the size and light colors have changed from sighting to sighting. Each time the craft is a black triangle. I think that this area is being used as a test area for military aircraft. The path it follows is almost always the same directly over the house or just a little North of the house but not very far away. It is something that you cannot hear as it comes up to you, it sort of sneaks up on you then when it goes over above you it makes a very loud noise like a diesel power generator on a train. Then after it passes over you it gets quiet again very fast.", "Metalic silver sphere at a height of about 500-700 ft. up roughly 6-8 miles from me over the area of Southcenter Mall near Seatac airport.I am a 34 YO apartment manager and small business owner living in Seattle. My father is a retired U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. fighter pilot, so I have quite a bit of knowledge when it comes to things flying in the skies due to his shared experiences and the many hours of spending time at USAF bases and air shows with him. On Tuesday, December 21st at approximately 3:30 in the afternoon, I was driving alone southbound on Interstate 5 just past downtown Seattle and noticed a silverish-grey, spherical metallic object hovering in the sky at what I would guess to be at a height of about 500-700 ft. up and at a distance from me at around 6-8 miles in the southern sky (over the Southcenter Mall area). If I were to put my hand at arms length, it would have been just slightly smaller than my thumbnail. It moved up and down several times...not like a balloon does in a floating manner with a wind, but moving up, stopping for a second, then moving down then stopping. It did this several times then went from left to right a few times in the same manner. The area it covered in these maneuvers would be maybe 30-40 ft? (probably about an area the size of my fist at arms length) Then it seemed to shrink in on itself and just vanished completely. There were a few passenger aircraft in the sky due to it&apos;s close proximity to SeaTac International Airport, but nothing close enough that it would have been a danger...at least not during the time I witnessed it. Total time from the moment I saw it until it vanished was about 30 seconds.", "Fast moving object with multicolored lights crossing east to west.My boyfriend and I (both systems analysts, 30 and 36 respectively)were trying to identify constellations from a field behind his apartment building.  There were no immediate city lights, the sky was incredibly clear.  The moon had not come up yet into view. We first noticed the light in the middle of the big dipper. An unknown sized craft moved from east to west rapidly, it was much higher than planes that were coming in on approach to land at our nearby airport. We thought it was a shooting star, quickly discounted that in favor of a satellite, but then halfway through the movement across the sky, multi-colored lights suddenly started twinkling on it. It took about 15 to 20 seconds to cross the sky, maximum.  It was about 1/3 as fast as a shooting star, stayed in a fairly straight pattern although it did seem to curve off at the end.  We walked out into the field trying to follow it, but it disappeared into a horizon of tree tops.  There was no sound and we did not observe a contrail. It was moving too fast for a jet, we both felt.", "Saw 2 craft white in color. 5 small jets were circling crafts. saw third craft half hour later. one jet following aircraft.It was late afternoon but the sun was still up. My wife and I were on our way to Denver through Kansas on I-70 just passing Fort Riley army base. I saw chem trails from several jets which I found very odd because they were flying very close to the same altitude. I looked at what they might be doing when I noticed that they were flying around a white object.  I took out my binoculars and asked my wife to tell me what the white object was they were surrounding.  I then spotted another white object about the same size.  maybe a couple of thousand feet direct south from the other.  I then came to the realization that I was witnessing a very, very possible military unit responding to an actuall UFO. The objects were bright white, my wife thought they were military crafts or clouds.  But when she looked through the binoculars she said she had never seen anything like them and couldn&apos;t tell what they were.  I immediatly stopped and had to look for myself.  My father was in the air force and have seen many aircraft and weather balloons. occasions.  The thing that impressed me was when one decided he had enough or was just having fun and took off in a S.W.direction.  The one jet that had been assigned to that particular object had to put on the after burners and had a tough time catching it.  The second object followed the first.  I started driving again at 65 mph and if these things were weather balloons they were go in and out of the jet stream. We had been watching now for about an hour, the two finally were far enough to where we could only see two small white objects on the horizon, but far enough that we could no longer see the jets.  Then we saw the third and it was real close.  We could also see two jets returning back to where we first saw them.  The third object had a lone aircraft escort. We got so close, but the wierd part is how it moved when it moved it was like if you were following a rainbow(The harder we tried to close to it, it some how moved so fluid you could not detect any motion). We got real close I would say it was less than a half mile in front of us and less than a mile in altitude.  It then moved slowly away from us (East) then in less than a second it was no longer there.  Another reason I don&apos;t think it was a balloon is because the horizon was a burnt orange but the objects stayed a bright white.  The next morning my wife was sleeping and I saw another object, less than a mile off of my nine oclock.  I have to keep my eyes on the road so I kept looking forward than looking back at the object. I saw three jets speeding in the same direction of the object so I watched the object as close as I could but it did the same thing as the third object the day before.

Appears to be surrounded by a haze, could not definitely say the shape but looking through with binoculars it appeared to be cylindrical.Wednesday, November 17, 1999 My sister and I were looking out the window to see we if could see the meteor showers. Living across the Hudson River in NJ from NYC we knew our chances our were slim since NYC is so lit up.  But for about an hour we are watched this light in the sky above NYC.  It flashed colors of bright blue to green to yellow to red and then repeated itself.  I have been to Pine Bush, NY and a few times we thought we saw something when we realized it was a star affected by the atmosphere.  But this was different.  I focused on larger stars and the atmosphere was not affecting them like this one. It was not moving towards or away from the horizon.  It moved slightly north to south and was, and I am guessing at this, about 3 miles above the skyline.  Planes landing at NYC airports were below it.

I never had a sighting I was confident was a ufo until this morning.  I was going out to the truck to go to work this morning at 6:30am.  I noticed to the west, the sky was completely cloudy, but to the east everything was perfectly clear.  As I looked to the east, I noticed an amber light that was brighter and larger than any of the visible stars in the sky.  When I became aware of the stationary nature of the object, I began to talk out loud to it, asking it to come closer.  When I said that, the light grew in intensity, but was still a considerable distance from me.  At 6:35am, I got in truck and began to drive in the general direction of the light hoping to get more detail.  After driving a half mile to the east, I stopped the truck and rolled down the window.  Even though light was still some distance from me, I waved at it.  Almost immediately the amber light went off, revealing a constant, smaller red light.  In a matter of two seconds, the red light had moved beyond visible distance toward the east.", "Star-like light that moved in different directions, heading south, south-east and dissappeared.I was visiting my mother and sister and we were sitting on a boardwalk bench on the beach.

I said aloud,&quot;What the...&quot; and the light retracted into what looked like a bright star that did not twinkle. We all looked at this &quot;Bright Star&quot; for a couple of seconds and then it started to move fast. First, it moved in a horizontal direction, then it dropped down as if it were falling. Then, it moved diagonally upward, and then horizontally heading south, south-east and disappeared. It all happened so fast, but we didn&apos;t take our eyes off it. I have never seen anything unusual in the sky in my life. I have to say,THIS, was unusual.

Ill be brief in describing what I saw.  3rd incident: I was sleeping in the back our station wagon (car) that was parked in the same camp mentioned in incident #2-cigar. Our camp was located under some large ash trees and adjacent to the creek bed. I woke up during the night and was looking at all the stars of which I could see through the trees...there was a row of trees near the car and then a large clearing. Anyway...I saw what I&apos;ll describe as a large fireball. I saw it fly from my extreme right-hand view. It swooped down near our camp, but far enough away that I couldn&apos;t really estimate size. It was, however, fairly large. Maybe as big as a small house....anyway...It crossed my field-of-view and flew to my extreme left-hand view. I lost sight of it through the trees. After a wait of several minutes I saw it further away gaining altitude and heading more west. I lost sight of it after that and didn&apos;t see it again.

It then sped up and away.My brother and I were changing a shifter in his car when our dog started going nuts.  The dog ran up and down the driveway barking wildly, as he did only when someone was coming up the driveway.  I ran out (we had the car parked over the old cellar steps) to see who was coming up the driveway, and saw that the dog was looking up.  I looked up to see what he (the dog) was barking at and saw this grey triangular outline with orange lights against the clouds.  The triangle was moving slowly going west to east.  It had glowing orange lights in each angle of the triangle.  I measured the size by holding my arm out and judging the lights to be about the size of a large pea at an arms length (that would be one of the three lights).  The object was perfectly silent.  On the farm at 5:00 in the middle of summer it is pretty quiet.  There was no wind at all.  It was very still and perfectly quiet.  Absolutely no sound came from the object.  It moved at what seemed to be a very slow steady speed as it went directly overhead, with the dog going nuts the whole time.  I called to my brother to get out there to see it but he was putting something together on the shifter and didn&apos;t come right away.  As the object passed over our farm and went over the feild. it began to speed up and raise in altitude.  This change was very obvious, even to me.  It really sped up and it cruised up right off into the clouds.  At about this time, my brother came out and asked what I wanted.  I said &quot;man you missed it&quot;.  The dog ran out into the feild and went probably about 1/2 mile before he gave up and came back.  Just directly West of our driveway was our neighbors runway.  He was a crop duster and when he landed, he flew at pretty low altitude right over our house. Our dog was very used to that and could care less when it happened.  This was very different.  This is absolutely true.

After the jet flew out of sight toward the S/West and I could no longer hear it, I saw a football shaped light approach from the S/West and a much lower altittude. It was approx. 25-30 degrees above the horizon line and moved at a very quick pace. It grew in intensity as it passed over Huntington,but it never revealed a strobe or flashing beacon light. It looked like a football travelling horizontally. from my S/W(my left) to N/E(my right). I watched and followed it till it went out of my view. The sky was crystal clear,the waning moon was visible and I could even see white con tails that streaked the pre-dawn sky. Not a sound could be heard as it traveled at a very quick clip.

As we looked up we both noticed a silver/reflective object in proximity to an airplane we had been watching. The plane was obviously moving to the west and leaving a big billowy trail, while the object to its north seemed staionary in relationship to the plane and did not have a trail. I pulled to the side of the road and we watched.  The plane moved on but the silver object seemed to not be moving.  Then a little wisp of cloud passed in front of it.  We waited to see if it would reappear, but it did not and the cloud floated on. The sky was basically clear and bright blue.

I noticed a very bright light in the sky in front of me. It was approximately 30&deg; above the horizon. (Although, looking in that direction there are hills, so it was probably more in the range of 35-40&deg; above the true horizon). The light was moving fairly quickly from left to right across my field of vision. My first thougtht was it was an airplane with its landing lights on. It was an extremely brilliant light, very white or blue-white. Then it appeared to stop, and I thought perhaps it had been turning slightly towards me and now was facing me so the apparent motion was stopped, although there was only one light rather than the two one normally sees from an approaching plane. But it continued to stay motionless and the light did not appear to grow any closer or brighter. I then thought perhaps it was a helicopter with a bright light on it. But I continued to watch it for several minutes and it made no movement. I also heard no sound (There were no sounds out there in the countryside other than the occasional low &ldquo;moo&rdquo; from a nearby cattle pen). After watching for several minutes, I went into the house and called the others to come outside to look at the light. We all trooped out the back door and I pointed out the still stationary light. Witness 2 asked what is was. I said I didn&rsquo;t know and explained its movements so far. Witness 3 asked if it could be a planet or a star. I said it was certainly much larger and brighter than any star or planet I&rsquo;d ever seen, that it looks bright like nearby aircraft landing lights, and it also moved from left to right and then stopped. Then I noticed it seemed to move slightly to right, and said so. Witness 2&rsquo;s boys (Witness 4 and Witness 5) agreed. We all kept watching it while speculating on what it might be. It appeared to move both left and right and up and down occasionally, but with no pattern I discerned. These were precise horizontal and vertical movements We all noticed the same movement. Witness 3 wondered if we were perhaps seeing the movement as some sort of optical illusion. But we were all seeing the same movements. After Witness 3&rsquo;s speculation, when I noticed movement, I did not call it out, but waited to see if someone else would notice and call out the movement I saw. Both Witness 2 and both boys at least once each called out movements (that I saw but did not state until after they said something). So at all times we were seeing the same movement. I asked the boys what they saw (as they good eyes - no glasses, and we had no binoculars). Witness 4 said he saw a darker area around the light. Witness 5 said to him the dark area looked kind of like a doughnut. I thought perhaps there was a smaller light above the light and asked the boys if they could tell if there was more than one or what it looked like to them. Witness 5 said it looked like there was a light on top going up and down. Witness 4 agreed that it looked like that to him. I thought perhaps I could see that movement, but I couldn&rsquo;t tell for sure. We continued to watch and talk about the light, until we needed to leave for our hunting trip, which was approximately 5:30 am. Total time viewing the object from first sighting, until we left was at least 20 minutes. The weather was clear and dry, temperature approx. high 30&rsquo;s It wasn&rsquo;t possible to tell how far away or how high the object was, although I would venture a guess of a mile or two distant. In size it appeared to be something about the size of a pea held a arms length. At one point while we were watching, I used lights from two houses or farms as reference points. The &ldquo;light&rdquo; appeared to be equidistant (left and right) from the ground lights , making it the top point in a triangle. When we went to leave I looked at this again and the light was farther to the right (south), but still at the same apparent height. Even disregarding the movements of the light, I&rsquo;m certain we weren&rsquo;t seeing a planet. I later looked up the planet positions for that location, date and time, and found that Venus was the only planet that could have been visible in that general direction. However Venus was only approximately 5 degrees above the horizon at 5 AM, so I don&rsquo;t think we could see it at all, because it wouldn&rsquo;t have risen above the hills yet. Venus would not reach the correct height until around 8 AM. There were (5) witnesses altogether: Three adult males in their forties, all business executives from Houston, and the two sons (ages 14 and 12) of one of the men.

It was not moving particularly fast, maybe about the speed of a small propeller plane, and flew in a straight line, not erratic at all.It also made no sound that I could detect although there was a quite a bit of noise from the power plant that may have obscured the noise, if any, that may have come from the object.I had never before heard of any reported UFO&apos;s having the same strange shape that I saw.

There were two large, apparently spherical objects, moving in absolute lockstep as though tied together structually, although I couldn&apos;t see any such connection, glowing so brightly that they lit up the desert with an erie deep red, possibly monochromatic light, displaying no other detail than two perfect circles of red light, which, at closest approach, each occupied about as much space in the sky as does a full moon.  They passed almost directly overhead, at a stately pace, and then seemed to very gradually accelerate and bank off to the left, moving rather quickly by the time they disappeared from sight. I stopped and took a motel room in El Centro, and heard on the news that either one or two helicopters (two I think, but I&apos;m not sure on this point) from a nearby military base had crashed or somehow been destroyed that same evening.  I, of course, immediately assumed a connection, but made no attempt to report what I&apos;d seen.

I proceeded to film the object while my husband was watching it, he later told me that the object (while hovering in one spot) had small individual lights rotating around it. I couldn&apos;t see them while filming, because it was a great distance away. The object appeared to bounce across the sky from right to left. The object decreased in size as it slowly faded from view. As soon as it was gone we saw a silver streak zip across the sky to the west.

I was driving and my cousin was commenting on the sky in which he noticed an object coming Northeast toward us.  At first glance we thought it was a plane because there was a small airport for personal prop planes to the southwest of us.  I then told my cousin that it was nothing to worry about.  The plane looked as if it was coming in at a slow rate of speed.  It then began to speed up keeping the same distance from the ground.  So I told my cousin that it looked to me like it was getting ready to crash.  We were about a 1/4th of a mile from the object and as we watched it in fear thinking it was going to crash into a field on the southwest side of us.  I decided to speed up to an  approximately 70-80 miles per hour to get a closer look at it.  As it came over the highway it slowed down to a complete stop, where it sat motionless.  By this time we were about 20 yards and came to a screaching hault about 10 yards from it, in which the car engined stauled.  The object was about 30 feet in the air and the white lights were so bright that we could not make out a complete description of it. We could hear no jet engines or propellors.  So we automaticly assumed that it was nothing that we had ever seen before.  After three to five minutes of absolutley no noise and no movement, the object slowly began to move southwest across the highway. It then turned on its side and hovered closer to the ground.  It began to move away from us, carefully manuvering between trees and eccelorating to an approximate speed of 40-50 miles per hour.  We then left the area and headed for home.  When at the junction of &quot;H&quot; and &quot;72&quot; Highway we watched as a state patrol and at least 4 police cars headed down &quot;32&quot; Highway (which is ajacent to &quot;H&quot; highway) going southwest toward the area the object was moving. I now work at an Airline company and have many friends who have been in the Airforce and Navy and none of which who have even heard of an object that can do the things that this one did.

It was Yellowish-orange  with a little blue on one side.  Very bright and moving incredibly fast- much faster than the planes in the area.  It appeared out of nowhere and disappeared from view within about 5 seconds.  Biggest, brightest, fastest moving thing I&apos;ve ever seen in the night sky. I thought the meteor showers were over for now, but that&apos;s what I would have guessed it to be. Went inside.  Came out an hour later and saw two more within a few minutes of each other.  They came from different directions and were slightly smaller and less bright than the first one-or perhaps a little further away. My husband saw a fourth one- more like a flash of light.  We then saw a fifth one, much smaller and white instead of yellow- looked more like a shooting star. I am guessing there were probably many others which we didn,t see, since I was indoors after the first one, and didn&apos;t come baack outside for a hour, when we saw the other four.  Also, there have been heavy contrails made in this area every day in x and circular patterns- all day.

I told the other guys to checkit out. For approximately an hour, we watched these things dance across the sky in awkward patterns. The seemed at times to defy the laws of physics. One very prominent feature was their ability to accelerate at a very fast rate. When they did so, the craft expelled sparks (or what seemed to be sparks from a great distance). These craft could turn on a dime and sometimes seemed to stop. It almost appeared as if they were playing tag. At one point there were at least 5 flying across the sky.

In fact, I don&apos;t know of any aircraft that can do the things that the craft were doing. The craft were pretty far from us on the horizon, I am guessing a few miles. I could tell that they were flying at speeds exceeding any mach level we have achieved.

My opinion for what it&apos;s worth is that I witnessed a transition from one vibrational phase to another.", "lightMy brother-in-law called me this evening, he had been out on his usual run for the evening.  He sd that all of a sudden he had a weird feeling come over him, his earphones began to have static.  HE looked behind him and there was nothing there,then all of a sudden a bright light shined over his shoulder, and dissappeared in a second.  Sd that then he noticed several airplanes ( seven or eight)flying overhead in a different directions.  Most were not commerical, he thought thhat was strange too because he sd that he had never noticed that much activity in the sky in the past.((NUFORC Note:  We have not received any other reports of unusual activity in Illinois as of the time of this writing.

I was looking out the driver side window of my car when I saw 4-5 bright red lights low in the sky.  At first I thought it was a large plane getting ready to land at the Martinsgurg airport because it was in that direction and there are large planes that land there.  But the lights were far enough apart that it grabbed my attention and I thought  &quot;that is a VERY large plane.&quot;  At that point the lights appeared to make a sharp turn very quickly so that they were suddenly in front of me at a height that I could see them straight out my front wind shield.  They were all evenly spaced and looked about the size of lights you see on an airplane when it is about 500 feet up and the first light had a tail like a comet.  I slowed my car to watch it as did the car infront of me. Then the lights disappeared and there was no trace of the lights and I looked and looked for them.  I looked at my car clock so that I could document the time and it was 7:05pm. It was a prefectly clear night.

Would flicker out and then reappear at least five times.  One the third sighting, it split into two lights before dissappearing.My wife and I were driving back to Dallas from San Angelo, TX.  We were perhaps 40 miles outside of Coleman when I saw a light in the sky perhaos twice as big as a star, and with more of a yellowish hue.  I thought it might be just an extremely bright star, but after perhaps two seconds, it flickered and went out.  My initial reaction was that I had witnessed a shooting star, which somehow approached the earth at such an angle as to appear to not be moving (coming straight at me).  I then wondered if perhaps I had somehow witnessed the death of a star. My wife did not notice this first sighting, and I said nothing. Perhaps 3 minutes later, it reappeared at exactly the same spot in the sky, and this time, my wife noticed and asked what it was.  My next assumption was that it was a flare-gun, but I also thought that a flare should be seen falling back towards earth.  Instead, this light remained in place for several seconds, then flickered out.  We began watching the sky intently as we drove.  Perhaps 5 mintues passed, and again the light appeared, in what I would guess to be the same place.  (We were driving, and it is possible that our road&apos;s curves would change the location of the light).  This time however, the light divided in two... but the two lights remained the same size as the first original.  Each light moved horizontally outward from the original position.  If I had been holding a ruler up against the windshield of my truck, I would say that each light moved half an inch from it&apos;s original position.  To diagram what I mean, Suppose &quot;O&quot; is the Original position, and &quot;N&quot; represents the new position of the lights.  Here is how it would look:  N&lt;---O---&gt;N These two new lights then flickered and went out, remaining for about the same duration as the others... perhaps 3 to 5 seconds. At least twice more we witnessed the light, but only once did it split as I described.  Each time, the instances occurred perhaps 3 to 5 minutes apart.  Due to the number of sightings being between 5 and 6, I would say the entire episode lasted perhaps thirty minutes, all while I was driving perhaps 70mph.  There were no sightings after passing through Coleman, although I did see two planes, which I would tend to describe as a &quot;military search plane.&quot;", "At 10 minutes to 10 PM on 12/9/99 in Scottsdale, Arizona I saw something that I have never seen before.

It was traveling at a faster pace than a plane and the illumination and/or object seemed to be changing while it was in flight. Several odd shapes within a V and M sort of formation. The illumination was easier to see than the shape itself, it just kinda of glowed above the cloud cover. It was about the size of a harvest moon, but not that far away.

Both red lights were on, with a slow blinking. I ran to the door and called the other two witnesses.We were standing in the back yard. It was moving very slow, no sound, very large,(long). It had an aura that was fuzzy, a dull light color that blended in with the early evening. There appeared to be the outlines of two or three rows of windows that were a shade darker than the body of the craft. It was very low but, above the trees.It was about 100 yards or more away, VERY CLOSE! It was still moving west, and then started veering (slowly) to the NNW.

I didn&apos;t give much thought to seeing a shooting star, as I have seen many before.  Suddenly, some motion in the sky to my left and towards the front of the house caught my eye.  As there is a streetlight there I could not quite see clearly with the artificial light as four sphere shaped objects came into view.  Once they were above me I could see them against the background of the clear night sky without the contaminating light from the street.  Three of the objects were traveling in a tight, equilateral triangle formation, as the fourth traveled behind and perhaps two to three times the distance between the objects in the triangle formation.  I am an empirical person, and I attempted to explain away to myself these objects as something else, but found that I could not as I watched them until they disappeared over the trees.  I can not be sure what the altitude of these objects was, but they seemed to be fairly close to the earth.  Due to the fact that they were only visible to me (from horizon to horizon) for about 5-10 seconds, I tend to think that these objects were traveling at a fairly low altitude.  These objects emanated a slightly bluish-white aura, yet also appeared to have a dull, metallic appearance to them that seemed to reflect light coming from the earth rather than emitting any themselves.  They did not appear to be all that large.  I watched closely to see if there would be any variance in the symmetry of the triangle formation and noticed none, except for the fact that the triangle seemed to &quot;flatten,&quot; maintaining the perfect equilateral formation yet appearing the way that it should have relative to my viewpoint.", "I waked out my back door and saw something that looked like the Hindenberg zepplin.Itwas a cool windy day with cottonball clouds blowing from west to east.

I could not make out any markings that would Identify the planes. They moved like airplanes we have seen at air shows, like B17s. They were flying from the south, along Elliot bay toward the north.

At first I thought they were from two police helicopters which were tracking the movements of a fugitive; i witnessed this in Kansas City once.  The lights certainly appeared to hover but it was obvious a few seconds later that the lights were from an aircraft which was moving westward with a slight movement to the north.  The object appeared to be a large jet liner on a final approach but that was impossible because the nearest airport here is to the southwest.  The aircraft was, in fact, moving roughly parallel to I-70.  All that I could really see was that when the aircraft was nearly on top of me it had a row of lights, 8 or 12 in all, which formed a shallow &quot;V&quot;, with the point of the &quot;V&quot; aimed in the direction of flight.  It made no sound until almost overhead, then a muffled sound of a jet engine.  Once the aircraft had passed, the jet engines were silent, but it was not the sound of a shutdown, but sort of a fast fadeout.  Its speed was about the same as propeller aircraft (200 mph).  Since I have seen and heard this aircraft before I have assumed that it is based at Whiteman Airforce Base. In light of two news items in local papers I have decided to report what I recently saw and heard, as accurately and concisely as I can.  The delta shape reported by some, including a friend who saw one of these close to Whiteman, near sundown, where he was working reminds me of the shape of the B-2 bomber, though the B-2 is delta shaped only on its leading edge,  however I speculate that for such an aircraft to fly at low speed, which Jane&apos;s reports that it can, there must be extra flaps which are necessary to improve on the aircraft&apos;s lift, flaps which have never been shown to the general public.", "one fireball traveling east horizontally across the sky,sparked and broke into five balls one by one in a trail of sparksMy family and I were traveling by car on route 322 west when the sky above us revealed a white ball traveling slowly across the night sky.

I said to my wife and kids, &quot;Look at the size of that airplane&quot;. It was very large and seemed to be a triangle shape. I realized it was moving much to slow to be an airplane. The night sky is very clear here and I could see the size of it by how much of the stars it was blocking out as it moved southward. It was in my estimate the width of about 3 football fields and had 3 very bright lights that were white. One light was on each corner of the craft. It appeared to be of a triangualr shape. My son asked me why we couldn&apos;t hear it and I realized that as close as it was, we should have been able to hear it. There was no sound. Very rarely do we see aircraft in the sky over San Manuel and when we do, they are at a very high altitude. This craft was at approx. 5000 feet and about 1 mile to the west of where we were sitting. Suddenly, the craft turned to the west and either disappeared or turned off its lights.", "Oval object bright green in color transverses sky from NNW .. stops .. hovers .. accelerates to East .. stops .. hovers ... accelerates in zigzag pattern to West .. climbs .. sweeping turn to North ... disapearsCommercial Driver northbound I-5 at or near MP 64 observed a bright green oval shaped object with a bright green tail streaking in from the NNW and decending at approximately a 60 to 70 degree down angle.  Object appeared to be about the size of a Pea held at arms length. There was Northbound commercial air traffic visable in the sky, estimated to be in the vacinity of Olympia, Wa., and the object appeared to level off at or near the altitude of the air traffic and stopped and hovered for about 15 seconds.  Object then accelerated in an easterly direction, appearing to pass behind the air traffic, and stopped approximately 1 second later having transversed an estimated 45 - 50 degrees of arc.  Object hovered there for about 30 seconds.   Object then reversed direction and accelerated in a zigzag pattern to the West at about half the speed that it had traveled to the East.  There was no tail during the period after the first stop and hover.  When object reached a point that appeared to be at or near the location of the first stop it began a sweeping turn to the North, accelerated to what appeared to be the velocity traveled upon first observation, the tail reappeared, and the object began a climb at what appeared to be the same angle as the decent.  Object was visable for about 1 second then blinked out.  Color of object was approximately the same green as the exit signs posted along the road.  Speed and actions of object tend to eliminate possibility that it was any type of known aerospace technology availible today.

We saw what appeared to be a large single spot light to the south (possibly between us and town).  We stopped in the drive way and turned off the vehicle.  The light did not appear to be moving at all.  After a few minutes the object began to bank to the east and then back to the north.  At this time it appeared that there were in fact three lights on the object.  It seems possible that the lights were on the wing tips and the front landing gear of an aircraft.   There were a few strange things: 1. absolutely silent, no noise of any kind, not even when the object passed by and was leaving our area.  We appeared to be directly behind the object (usually you will hear some sort of &quot;rumble&quot; after a plane leaves.)  2. The object was not moving for a number of minutes (I realize that an airplane coming straight towards you does not appear to be moving).  3.  It had an odd red flashing light on top, in the middle of the object.  It looked like an old style red ambulance light flashing. I have been a private pilot for about 15 years and an airplane buff all my life.  This object baffled me.  It was one of those situations that makes the hair stand up on the back of your neck. I should also mention that we are located about 25 miles south of Robins Air Force Base in Warner Robins GA.  This may have been some sort of military plane, it did not look like an airplane and it did not look like anything I had ever seen before.", "Four lights showing through overcast in a diamond shape patter.  Then a  a fifth light appears on right and drops in a curve toward ground.This was just reported to me by my wife.  I was watching a UFO documentary on the History channel (Sunday, 5Feb) and mention of a diamond pattern was made.  My wife had walked in the room and heard that and stated &quot;I saw that&quot;.  When I asked what she was talking about she told me of a diamond shaped lights peering through the overcast sky, as she was outside looking up between treetops.  She said her first thought was an aircraft, but noticed that the lights were stationary.  While she continued to observe the lights, very quickly another light that was as bright as the four being observed, moved directly from the right of the diamond pattern, arced downards, and dropped straight down towards the ground (in a matter of seconds).  She lost sight of that light when it went behind trees.  She then looked back up and the diamond pattern was gone.  She told me she was expecting to hear of an aircraft crash on the news latter that night.  I asked her when it happened and she stated Wednesday of last week.  I work at night and was not home at the time, but I do remember of a reporting over Seattle, presented by Peter Davenport on the Art Bell radio show.  I went outside and had her point out to me where she saw the lights.

Is NICAP still in service?  I was returning from playing for a dance. By the way I am not a drinker except on NYears Eve. Far and few between back then too. A friend was with me but she fell asleep just seconds before I saw this brilliant blue like a arc welders light on off ramp grassy area at I 80 interchange at Overton NE. My dashlights turned red. There were other reports of strange lights in area bt were attributed to weather inversions. 67 and 68 were banner years for ufos in midwest. Saw some other strange lights but nothing since. 10 years before that I was at the site of an alleged abduction near Kearney NE. Airforce debunked that as a hoax and the man was rumored as mental case BUT I saw his file. I was later told it was impossible that I would see his file but a lay at the courthouse was evidently as curious as I and she showed me when I asked. The paper from a mental evaluation said he was normal. Later in 1990 I wrote a song about it. In 1993 I wrote a screenplay which became a published audio book. Although most of book was satire; the account was quite accurate. Since my ufo encounter I have become quite a inspired writer and have had dreams that would come true. My latest creation is the &quot;Millennium Song&quot; published lyric in a national country music roundup publication Jan 2000. A group Millennium.org should have that in there archive. I also met a actress known for her interest in ufos in early 1970s. That has also inspired my interest. I was a rockabilly on tv in the 50s and folk blues writer from 60s till now. I also work as a custodian at a school in area. I sent my story to Hollywood in 1993 and had good comments from one director. But no  movie has been produced. I however felt like I might be the real mister millennium considering all the strange things that have happened. It was probably just a coincidence that &quot;Millennium&quot; tv show and X Files came a couple of years after my book circulated the studios.", "Three lights in triangular formation. One craft or three I could not tell.My wife and I were returning to work after a lunch break. I stepped outside and looked up to see the moon. Instead what I saw were three dome shaped lights that were moving north at a constant rate of travel. All three lights were the same color something between a subdued peach &amp; burnt ocher. They did not blink or flash. The lights were either three individual craft moving in perfect triangular formation, or they were attached to one indistinguishable craft. All moved exactly in unison! The craft covered about 40 degrees of sky in less than ten seconds and maintained a constant velocity. No noise accompanied this sighting. I shouted over and over at my wife to &quot;Look at this! Look at this!&quot; She was closing the door behind me and turned and observed the craft for about seven seconds. After continuing across the sky in a straight line the UFO disappeared seemingly winking to nothing as it went into the night. My wife was extrememly shaken. I too felt this, but I also felt excitement. Disbelief. Never have I seen anything even close. I am an Army veteran and am trained in aircraft identification. This was absolutely not a conventional powered aircraft. Nor is it anything I have ever been instructed to watch for. Very chillingly this craft is a near identicle copy of a recreation I observed very recently on TV of a UFO reported all over Britain in one night and investigated by that fromer MOD official whose name I cannot recall.

At first, we assumed that these reports resulted from the missile launch from Vandenberg AFB at approximately 1816 hrs. (PST) on this date.  However, many witnesses in Oregon express strong opposition to this theory, stating that what they saw did not look like a missile launch, and the object observed illuminated the ground with a beam, or cone (?), of light.  This sighting occurred 82 minutes after the missile launch.  Moreover, our theory is predicated on the assumption that a missile launched from near Los Angeles could be seen from northern Oregon.  That may not be correct.))", "Even though I am a private pilot, I spend every hour of jet flight viewing the earth below.  COvered window allowed spotting overtaking triangular craft.This occurred, most likely, a few days after Halloween of 1996. Verification easy to obtain. This was an identifiable flight, as the pilot&apos;s seat was replaced at maybe 1 a.m. in a delayed stopover` at Reno from San Francisco where I departed. Wile I am an old private pilot, I still can&apos;t resist covering my head so I can stare out the window and watch the earth pass below. The city we were passing appeared to be very large and moving off to our left, northern, side at an angle of maybe 30 degrees.  The subject craft appeared in silhouette below and just far enough out from us for me to spot it from a passenger window.  It was an EQUILATERAL triangle with NO protrusions of nose, canard, tailfin, fuselage or jet tube.  There were no lights of any kind and it appeared totally black.  It overtook us rapidly. My guess is that it was 500 feet below us and the equilateral edges were maybe 60 feet or more per edge.  I reasoned that we were doing 580 or so and it was moving past at 100 kts faster. The time it was in my view, as the city lights did not extend but maybe half way, was maybe three or four seconds.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.

I happened to glance up just as I got out of my truck in the driveway and noticed it above the roof of my neighbors house.  At first I thought it was a light colored garbage bag carried in the wind-it was blowing pretty hard-when I realized it was moving at a steep angle to the wind and in a steady, straight line.I saw one object, approximately the same size as a small plane, pass over my neighborhood under the low cloud cover.  It was circular in shape and at least flat on the bottom.  The only illumination was reflected ground light-I live in a city of 60000-and I would estimate the object to have been about 1000&apos; up.

Days at work during ongoing projects are commonly 15 hour work days; weeknight shopping is usually out of the question!  Otherwise, I have already submitted my original report along with drawings and maps.END ADDENDUMOriginal observation of bright lights of craft 20-25 miles away; lost sight of craft for awhile as I meandered through hills on way home; sighted craft again as I descended into Fairfield; huge (!) craft hovered motionless 800 to 1000 feet above major highway as if WANTING to be seen.  I stopped at side of highway to observe and although hundreds of other cars passed by this thing also, I seemed to have been the only one willing to stop.Odd! Fascinating! Scarey! Astounded to hear on Art Bell program of 1/21/00 that some police had seen similar object.  This thing is huge...several football fields in size.On or about October 1, 1999 I was just finishing up at a job site in San Rafael, California. At approximately 10:00 pm I was heading home to Fairfield which is about a 45 minute drive eastbound across Highway 37 through Vallejo and then northbound on Highway 80.  Travis Air Force Base is about 5 miles east of Fairfield.  The whole trip is about 30 miles. I am a professional Account Manager/ Project Manager with a bachelors degree in Design; I have also spent about 10 years as a flight attendant.  I know what various aircraft look like and what the typical lights on aircraft look like even from a distance.  My vision is extremely good and I am a well balanced individual.  Still, the events I am about to share always puts one on the defensive...trying to put all this into some perspective is difficult because I have no point of perspective from which to start!! I originally observed what I thought was a &quot;single&quot; very bright light far off in the distance at a position of about 10:00 o&apos;clock and 30 degrees above the horizon (at 22:00 hours)during my drive home from an ongoing project. I had made this same trip at night multiple times before during the previous week and had never seen such a thing in the sky.  The weather was clear as a bell with no clouds at all.  The brightness of the light and the seeming motionlessness of it really caught my eye.  It definitely registered as &quot;odd&quot; to me.  The area where I was driving (east on Hwy 37)is not lit.  It is a long, flat stretch of highway single lane which crosses a marsh land.  There were not many cars on this particular part of my drive.  I had nothing better to do than watch this thing and the road.  I began to wonder:  #1 about how far away this thing was and #2 why I could percieve no movement.  I speculated that it must be moving directly toward me OR hovering in one place.  I deduced, however, that it probably was not a helicopter because it sitting was TOO still in the sky. As I drove on, I was still many miles from home.  The single bright light slowly shifted on its axis toward me and became two bright lights.  Combined, these lights were definitely a &quot;show stopper&quot;!  The brightness, the distance and the motionless of this held my curiosity.  Suddenly, as soon as this &quot;thing&quot; had rotated towards my position so that I could see its two lights, it also started a &quot;strobing&quot; effect with one of it two lights (the right one).  I then knew that this was something I had never seen before and that it was definitely not a usual thing. Traffic and terrain took my attention away from this object at this time.  There were some small hills to pay attention to and quickly I lost track of this object.  I had actually forgotten about it as I traveled through Vallejo and up into the hills onto Highway 80 east.  There are some massive foothills I travel through at this juntion of highways 37 and 80. Dropping down into the Fairfield area is quite a site once you punch through the blackness of these hills. As I came into site of Fairfield, I could not believe my eyes.  Furthermore, if I had not seen this thing from such a distance away, I am not certain that my eye could have picked it out from all the other city lights and recognized it for where it was and that it was what I had seen before. I have been a resident of Fairfield for 20 years; I know the developed and undeveloped areas; I have driven this stretch of highway thousands of times and this was definitely out of the norm. At this point in time because of the elevation of the hill I was now driving down, I was higher up (!) than this craft which hovered motionless down in the valley.  I was looking down on it (spellbound) and approaching it fast. As this craft sat motionless over a vast dark barren area just to the side of the highway, there was no mistaking it&apos;s presence.  It was RIGHT BESIDE the highway as if it were taking a scenic tour and WANTING to be seen.  Furthermore, it was so low that as I passed it, I layed my head on my steering wheel to get a look at the underside.  I have no brains for math, but I am certain that one could compute the actual feet above the ground with some simple geometric calcs. As I came down the hill, a CHP (California Highway Patrol) car came by me at a high rate of speed.  I thought at that time that at least HE had also seen this thing and was also going to be a witness.  I do not, however, know where he went.  I leveled out onto the flat part of the road, I kept trying to maintain my speed, watch the craft, wonder if anyone else was seeing this event, and find a spot to pull off on the shoulder to get a better look. As I passed under and beside this craft, this is what I saw: a craft the size of at least three football fields long, triangular shaped with lights all around, two bright lights in front, and shapes underneath (2 circles and 2 straight lines beside each other)the craft which were backlit with light seemingly &quot;seeping&quot; from inside the craft. As I struggled to comprehend what I was seeing and trying to find a safe place to get over and stop, I still couldn&apos;t fathom why, with all the cars around me, there weren&apos;t 30 accidents or 30 people pulling over to get a better look.  Either they didn&apos;t realize what was just above their heads because of other lights and traffic around them OR they were as terrified as I was. But I stopped.  I pulled over off Highway 80 right beside the Inn America motel.  As I got out of my car and stood in front of it, the craft had already started to move slowly across the highway towards my location and headed in the direction of Travis AFB. I called Travis AFB about a week later to ask if they had had any reports of any strange events.  They said they were unaware of any of these events.  Additionally, I did call the local newspaper and they had no reports of anything. Last but not least, I was driving home a different route (Hwy 680 west which also hooks into 80 north) and I noticed some very bright lights up in the hills to my left on two successive nights soon after this major sighting (dates unknown).  I did not put these events together at the time, but I do remember thinking &quot;gosh what in the heck was built up in those hills so quickly.  That&apos;s alot of light for the middle of nowhere&quot;.  I have never seen those lights again. I do alot of driving late at night along both these routes commuting from San Francisco to Fairfield and this was one STRANGE but exciting event!!  Thanks for having a site where one can report such things.", "Huge triangular UFO travelling extremely slow, but with impossible right and left darting movements.My wife and I were camping at the Plumas Eureka Camp Grounds, approximate elevation of 7,000 feet. It was Monday evening, near 11pm, all but one other camp site had folded up and left for home. The night was clear with no moon. The object came from NW travelling SE at a very slow rate of speed (estimate 40 to 70 MPH). Too slow to remain airborn. The shape was triangular (at the time I was calling it Delta Wing Shape). It was approx. 1000 to 2500 ft above us. The triangular shape was decerned by the stars it block out. There were circular white lights emmitting from the bottom of the craft.The craft appeared to be HUGE, over 200 feet. It was eerily silent. The remarkable thing was how it made these occasional sporadic quick moves, as it darted left or right, like a kit being jerked by string. No human could have withstood the movements without being severe damage to body or brain. We watched the craft until it dissapeard over the mountain. It never changed altitude. We asked people in Grey Eagle the next day about it, thinking everyone would be talking about it. No one saw it. After packing up and coming home we thought about it for a day or two. Then thought someone should be notified. Called the USAF. They weren&apos;t interested, told us to file a report with the Sherrif if we wanted. Now, we were starting to feel foolish, but called the Plumas county Sherrif anyway. I was hoping he would tell me he had many reports.

Thinking we had passed all the lights, I looked back towards the rear of the wing and noted that the lights  were now traveling with us in a line parallel to the back of the wing. After one or two seconds the lights simply vanished. Shortly afterward, we broke through the clouds and were not, as I had imagined, near Sante Fe. It was another 25 or 30 minutes before we made it into Sante Fe. After landing, I asked our first officer if anything unusual had occured during our flight. The officer asked me to be more specific and I recounted what I had seen. I find the officers response to my questions as interesting as what I had seen during the flight. I was told that &quot;our aircraft&quot; or &quot;aircraft of this type&quot; do not use yellow lights of any sort, they use a red light on one wing, green on the other and white on the tail. I was then informed that there had been no radar contact with any other PLANE that close to us during our flight and stress was placed on the statement by saying that if any PLANE had been that close to us, it would certainly have been picked up by radar alerting the cabin crew to such a presence. Even more interesting, while showing an egar attentiveness and curosity to the details of my account, the officers remarks were professionally reserved. Additionally, this individual asked me a number of questions about what I had seen and yet never gave more than vague and obscure responses to my questions. Because of this officers manner, one could speculate about a few things: When saying &quot;our Aircraft&quot; or &quot;aircraft of this type&quot; don&apos;t use yellow lights, was this person hinting that perhaps a military or some other sort of craft might use yellow lights? If so, what sort of craft might that be? By stressing no radar contact with any PLANE that close during the flight, was the officer illuding to the possibility of radar detecting something else? Was I being subtly asked to read between the lines? During our conversation, the officer seemed to carefully avoid anything that might have led to answering questions about what the cabin crew actually saw with their own eyes. I have learned that airlines frequently assign less seasoned pilots to fly the small commuter planes, allowing them to rack up the flight hours required to pilot the larger, jet passenger planes. No doubt the admission of an unusual sighting during flight might well be considered a professional liability for a young pilot just starting out with a major airline, therefore, I am electing not to name the airline or make any further public comment about my interaction with the officer for the time being.", "An object moving at a high rate of speed stopped in midflight and held a stationary position for a couple of minutes or so. It then shot straight up...and disappeared from view (apparently it flew out of the atmosphere-at least that is the sense everyone felt). Then, from both east and west directions, military jets converged onto the spot where the object left from. They circled around and final left the area. Daytime characteristics:clear, sunny, and no clouds. The object appeared a silver dot in the sky not unlike an airplane would.In 1975-1976 my father was employeed to cut firewood about 40 miles north-west of Prescott Arizona. We were living in the National Forest there for over a year while he was working. Essentially, a three month summer camping trip turned into a year and a half camping trip. Anyway...I&apos;ll be brief in describing what I saw. I was about eight years old at the time. My father, mother, a coworker, and I were standing around my father&apos;s truck. My mother noticed an object traveling at a high altitude moving from east to west. She pointed it out to the rest of us because we normally didn&apos;t see many planes flying out in that area. However, confusion set in when the object stopped in mid-flight and held its postion for what seemed like two or three minutes. Then, without warning, it shot straight-up and disappeared from view. As that occured...several obvious military jets appeared on the horizon (east and west) and converged on that point where the object left from and circled around. The military jets then left as quickly as they came. The sense that we all got was that the jets were chasing this object, whatever it was. The next day, my mother called the nearest airforce base (I believe it was Luke). They basically told her that they didn&apos;t have any aircraft in the area. I saw two other objects during my stay near Prescott...please refer to cigar shaped and fireball.NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Made no sound as it moved at a slow steady rate speed. As it came closer towards being directly over head it looked more like a star  radiating light striations. Then it suddenly blinked out.While taking an evening walk with my dog, I noticed a large rounded light appraoch low in the sky. I first thought that it was the medivac heliocopter that can be seen on a daily basis but as it got closer no discernible noise could be heard. I walked up the street where the trees would not block my view and I stood still - waiting for it to pass directly over me. I noted, that compared to western horizon and the hills and low mountains in the east that it may have been at 1500 feet or less and was no more than a mile away. The degree of angle may have been 30 to 35. Sky was clear and the moon was brightly waning. It became larger as it appraoched ( size of a penny held at arm&apos;s length). By now it looked more like a slow moving, pinkish star low in the sky-complete with raditing striations. Then before it got over head , it just simply blinked out. Never made a sound. Other identifiable craft could be seen flying at much higher, safer altittudes (silouetted against the sky w/red,green &amp; white strobes on them). But none of them were like this fallen starlike object. in addition I could see a thick dark contrail where the object had been before it winked out.", "The witness saw the object obove the tree line, in the distance which he could not determine and it moved from NE to NW at 8 degrees above the horizon.  There were no sounds or trails left from the object and it disappeared below the tree line.  He saw this object on Sept. 7th when there were so many sightings over the Florida area and he reported that sighting in great detail.  He felt that he should report this also since it looked the same.This information is submitted by MUFON of Hillsborough and Pinellas counties in Florida.  Because this object looks like the reported object seen on Sept. 7th 1999 he felt that it should be documented as often as he sees it in his area.  We have contact with this witness at all times and his testimony is regarded as credible information.((NUFORC Note--Our gratitude to Lorraine Gerber, Assistant State Director for MUFON for Northern Florida, for this report.))", "I have been seeing a light above Hot Springs as I drive from Malvern Avenue to Bath House Row. It flashes very fast, stobelike, not like the steady blink of a planes landing gear. Sometimes it moves in a line, sometimes it is stationary. It blinks out after a short time. Usually see it about a minute or less. There are other lights in the area a radio tower and The Hot Springs Tower. I also see planes in the sky. But this is different and I see one almost every night.It is a blinking light, white or yellow in color. Round shape but more of a flash of light. Doesn&apos;t appear to be solid to me. Most often it is moving in a straight line. It almost seems as though it knows I see it because as I look at it, it blinks out.", "2 horizontal lines - 3 top, 4 under zigzag type.  all 7 of us saw the lights as a different colorThis first time was when we were walking off my field after doing a healing circle.  I had insisted that we just walk in the dark and not put on the flashlights.   The lights were as described above. All of us saw them as one color, but none of us saw them the same color as any one else. I saw the most beautiful, clear orange color.  They stayed in that formation traveling from north to south above the Kittatinny Mountain range. One year later, I went up to Sunrise Mtn (same range) at 5 AM.  I have no idea why I awakened and went up there.  There were 2 young men who were frightened and saw the same lights, they tried to take them on their camcorder.  I explained to the boys that I did not feel they were harmful in the slightest.  Then went home and back to bed. Shortly after that when I was enjoying my field (on the top of a hill), I was watching 2 hawks circling overhead.  The clouds were formed in a funnel shape, the smallest point at the top, the hawks climbed higher and higher until they disappeared (which isn&apos;t logical) Then I felt myself being lifted off of the ground, grabbed onto the car to hold myself down.  Wish I was brave enough to have gone with it. A couple of years later, a mother and her two sons were coming to my house in the evening and saw them.  The mother and older son was happy and excited but the younger son was scared. It seems that I sense when they are around, such as last night even though the sky was overcast.  It seems a new comprehension comes to me when I sense they are around, I don&apos;t know what, I just know it is there. This is their formation: x      x       x x      x       x       x I am hoping that someone else has had such an experience and can share with me what they felt. I have overworked myself for the last 2 years, bone tired, ended up with asmatic bronchitis and slept for a week. Then, last night I sensed them again.  This morning my energy is back. Another thing is that I bought some fiber-optic beads in different colors in October.  The orange of those beads is the closest to the color that I saw that night. Such a pure orange. Another thought, it could just be co-incidence, is that my ability to channel healing and physic work improves after I sense or see them.  It could be psychological .... maybe you have an answer. Also, I haven&apos;t got the slightest idea how I ended up with your website. I should be cleaning the house.  I just finished an e-mail to Governor Whitman about work conditions and asking for an Early Retirement Package.  How did this come up???  And after so many years.

I looked closer and realized what I was seeing and asked my mother if she wanted to see a UFO up close.  Then I awakened my Mother-in-law and my husband, when we came back upstairs it was heading slowly off towards the mountains.  When it reached the mountains it turned sideways to where the &quot;bottom&quot; of the craft was facing the house, the clouds arond the mountains were glowing with the light from the craft.  The first craft then desended behind the mountain and a few seconds later the second craft, coming from the southeast, approached the first at a high rate of speed and desended behind the mountains in the same area as the first.  The clouds stayed aglow for about forty-five to fifety minutes after they were no longer visible from behind the mountains, then the light just vanished. The first craft was only about a half a mile from the house when sighted, we live on five acres.  The craft was scaucer shapped with a small dome on the &quot;top&quot;, with extremely bright &quot;yellow&quot; and &quot;white&quot; lights around the exterior circumfrance of the craft and illuminated almost the entire five arces.  The &quot;bottom&quot; of the craft had a triangulare shape within the circumfrance of the craft with a red light in the center of the trangle.  Only the &quot;yellow&quot; and &quot;white&quot; lights rotated, or pulsed, counter clockwise around the craft, the red light was constant and glowed.  The second craft was the same configuration as the second where the lights are concerned, yet it was much smaller than the first.", "There was 1 small orange light that apeared in the sky that I had been watching, after about 2 minutes, the light just turned off.I had been sitting in my living room watching TV, when I just happened to look out the window and I saw a bright orange light in the sky.  The only thing at first that I noticed about this light was that instead of having one or more lights that blink, this was one light to slow and staying to long to be a meteor.  It was not an airplane, of that I am sure planes fly over my hous all of the time and this was definately not a plane.  After about two minutes the light just dissapeared.  I looked all over to see if it had chanced to fly behind a tree, it hadn&apos;t.  I am not prone to see things not there.  I am a very rational and scientific thinking person.  I had even delayed reporting this event for fear of being called a cook or something of the sort.  I believe that whatever I saw it wasn&apos;t a plane or meteor.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides just an e-address.

It remained in the same area but changed positions clearly.  It stayed in the sky for at least the 15 minutes we stood outside and looked at it. we checked it again and it was still there as we looked through some binoculars about 30 more minutes.  After about 1 hour and 15 minutes.Same as above.  Regular guy, retired and my family was over for leftover Thanksgiving meal when my son called with the first sighting.

Numerous sightings.Large light appears as work lights,several small lights all around. The small lights occasionally moved to the larger lights,very fast. These were observed on several occasions. Location was also Daly City, at old 101 hwy. All sightings were late october thru March. I have observed these lights or ships, moving sporadically along the shoreline, also flying over the mountains near S.F.CA. My nephew has seen these objects many times. Nephew has a pager and cellular store in Pacifica. I was helping with the store for 2 years.  Triangular objects seen also.", "((NUFORC Note:  The witness&apos;s description of what they observed that night is not inconsistent with a celestial body, a star or planet, we feel, but that is a guess.  Bright celestial objects certainly can be reflected off the surface of bodies of water, I believe.  Also, the fact that the object moved across the sky slowly is consistent with a celestial object.  Our &quot;analysis&quot; is pure conjecture, and we were not present to observe the object reported.  However, we receive many reports of objects that turn out to be &quot;twinkling&quot; stars and planets, and we feel, therefore, that we are able to identify such reports fairly readily.  We apologize to the parties who submitted the report if we are wrong, which is possible.  PD))  while night fishing we watched a silent craft slowly hover over a large pond over a 4-6 hour period making its way across the body of water. It looked very much like a star in the night sky but was very close cause we were able to see its reflection in the water proving it was in the imediate sky. we also witnessed it avoid detection from any planes flying higher above. so to us that also proved intelligence and with the reflection in the still water we were convinced something was several hundred feet in the sky, able to fly for hours silently, and directly over the pond. again it looked almost exactly like a star in the sky but was obviously not.the object we witnessed for several hours was silver and the size of a star at night in the sky so much smaller than a plane more like the size of a car. The reason i believe it was defintely a ufo is because of two undeniable concrete observations: 1. it reflected in the water very obviously and the stars did not because of their distance. It would be hard or close to impossible to detect with the naked eye because of its size and likness to the stars. but we watch it slowly move over a 4-8 hour period across the water from one side of the pond to the other. we continued fishing all night while we monitored its location. when the sun began rising we decided to leave and go home approximately 5 miles away. 2. we continued discussing what it could have been besides a ufo but we were having trouble with anything man made that could fly without sound and didn&apos;t need to refuel for that long. so at the house when we got there we decided to have a beer and go out on the back porch and finish our fish stories and the talk of what it might have been. by now the sun had rose and it was daylight i was the first out on the porch and i started to search the sky for the ufo cause i was still trying to be skeptical when i saw it in the sky above the lowest set of clouds above the house. so it was above the lowest clouds but not as high as airplanes. i called my friend out and we both witnessed the shiny star like object in the sky. now we were both convinced as there were no more stars visible due to the daylight and this object was clear as day and stationary as clouds occasionally passed in front of it. So it was now complete daylight and i saw it clear as anything a silver shiny object still looking like a star even in daylight hovering in the sky all alone. it wasn&apos;t shiny like eye wincing or flashy but rather like a star just shiny enought that we couldn&apos;t make out any detail. I wish i had a camera or proof cause i have no doubt that this object was sokme type of flying craft and displayed intelligence by the fact that it travelled with awareness to its surroundings. I formulated a weak but possible theory that it might have been studying the pond and eventually maybe us because we were fishing and did catch some. And that we noticed it and when we were leaving it i believe moved from across the pond to directly above us cause i asked my friend while we walked back to the car &quot;hey wasn&apos;t it across from us cause now its directly above us&quot; but with it being night i was still skeptical and with the way the moon seems to follow you in a car i thought it was just my perception. but after seeing it in the daylight and at my friend&apos;s house i have no doubt this object followed us for what reason i have no idea casue it did nothing unusual besides be in the sky. I saw something very clear from 12:30 pm at night until 8:00 am or so in the daylight and it was very clear to be a craft but shiny enough that i can&apos;t give any more detail. i tried very hard to see something distinguisable something to add to its desciption but it was a perfect replica of a star impossible to further describe which to me is the perfect camouflage and a mastery of craft. we watched it for maybe an hour in the daylight then my friend drove me home and we just came to the conclusion that between us we know we saw an ufo and all these crazy descriptions that people describe are not acurate to what we saw. i have to say that i know i saw a ufo for at least 10 hours and it never moved eratically or made any noices but the shininess did dull to almost it being invisible during the night when a plane passed over it then it slowly reglimmered to its star like shininess. again showing it having intelligence. I believe it either watch us catch the fish or knew we could see it  and from either one of those reasons followed us to my friends house which without it interacting with us tells me that this object was very confident in itself and in an observation mode where it feels no threat or fear of being exposed. i have never noticed anything like this since but without the water to use as a marker so to speak i! don&apos;t s ee how i could notice such a well hidden craft. this is what i believe people should look for decoy stars not what they see in the movies. please let me know if you have any other credible stories very similar to this cause this is the truest your likely to find cause this is what we honestly saw and i can&apos;t embellish it more cause this is all i saw but seeing it in the daylight has made me a concrete convinced believer!", "The night before I saw The Ship My Freind called me out to see a fast moving object orangr in color Move ocroos the sky faster than even a comit or meteor.I Ran out but I could not see it in time.The next night 10/28 My freind automatically was drawn outside {Almost like it was a given like a Dashavo)As he called me outside to look at it This time my instinct told me something was about to be seen.Sure enough I saw a red diamond.It was shooting red sparks from the top and was morhping into all different shapes very slowly.It Went from a red diamond discharging sparks from the top.Then it changed to a rod type shape or bowling pin and then finally saw it turn into a black triangle as it moved at about 10miles per houraway fom us at that point.It had a dim white glowing aura that surrounded it and as it changed shapes it seem to distort the atmostphere around it.I new it was not a balloon or flares because it made a 150 mile uturn  first slowly descending then slowly ascending to about 50,000 feet tip of the jetstream.By this point it beacame a a small star size white dot and it stayed in stationary position for 10 minutes.I used A telephone pole to to see that it was stationary.It then went even higher up in the stratusphere and slowly moved towards california.Ithought it most odd there wasnt an airplane small or large in sight in the sky. Highly ironic because I live where you can always see  planes all the time at 5:55 in the sky.Just about a week earlier before the sighting we had an earthquake wich is highly rare for phoenix.The whole event of seeing the ship seemed strange like you were watching some kind of sourcery or magic show.It was very unatural and not of this dimension.As it moved away from us it apeared to go 2 moves forward and then onemove backwards like stretching out a ruuberband.It almost looked like it was emmitting some kind of magnetic aura about it.6 months earlier using the jon bro technique i photographed a rod as big as a city.towards california.phoenix is a definite hot spot r! ight now for ufos.I dont know why phoenix but it semms to be a cental geographically locacation for dispursment of craft.", "Light remained stationary- unlike any star-large-disappeared with the horizonDriving east on A.C.

I have told lots of people about it but never officialy reported it, because I did not know how.  And of course we did not have the internet back then.  I am guessing on the year because it was so long ago. It was in the summer around 1979, give or take a year.  We were at my cousins house in Lake Tamarask, CA, just North of Desert Center, CA.  We were in the front yard looking North against the mountains.  The mountains were at least 15 or more miles North of Lake Tamarask.  At the base of the mountain was a single white light.  It had to be a fairly large light because at that distance a vehicle light would have been hard to see.  From where we were at the light looked about the size of a dime.  The light was moving in the formation of a square, and again from where we were standing it was a small square, about a foot long by 3/4 of a foot high.  But in reality the distance had to be quite a large distance since the light was so far away from where we were. I am guessing it had to have been at least a mile or more it was moving.  The kicker is that it was moving very fast and at that distance there is no way that a vehicle or normal aircraft could move that far that fast and turn such sharp corners.  My older sister, and my cousing who is about 12 years older than me was also watching this, and I am sure there were more people watching but I cannot remember who.

At first I thought they were lights on a new antenna or something until I realized they were moving.  The lights were bright, they sparkled (not blinking like a plane) and they each appeared to have a small tail.  They did not appear to be too far away, although I guess the distance could be deceiving. I stopped my vehicle right on the road and watched them for about 10 to 20 seconds.  During that time they traveled about a quarter of the way across the sky from west to east.  They remained in a straight line at the same distance apart the whole time.  I did not hear anything, although my windows were up.  Another car approached from behind so I turned onto the next road, hoping to see them again, but never did. I know what a meteor looks like, and this was not one. I thought it may be a plane on fire, but nothing like that was reported. It could have been space debris?

We had planned to drive out to the eastern Plains in a few hours to catch the peak of the Leonid meteor shower and wanted to get the scope ready to examine Saturn while in the darkness of the countryside. My husband was actually looking through the scope and my mother and I were standing up looking at the planet unaided when I saw movement in the sky just below and to the right of Jupiter. I looked and saw what appeared to be a very large, irregularly shaped &quot;object&quot; moving at an accelerated rate through the sky. Now when I say I saw it, I&apos;m not sure that entirely describes how I witnessed it. This thing, whatever it was, was camouflaged exquisetely. To be perfectly honest, I don&apos;t know how it even caught my attention in the first place. It almost appeared to be a piece of the night sky itself. Immedeatly, I started screaming and pointing at the object as it glided silently almost entirely undetectable. I was screaming &quot;Oh my God, look! Look! Look! It&apos;s f---ing huge! What the f--- is that?&quot; My mother spotted it a half second later and began screaming as well. When my husband saw it he began saying it might be a military aircraft and to watch closely as it passed by the stars that were in it&apos;s path. The military theory was quickly extinguished when we saw light from the stars behind it pass through revealing that it was actually transluscent. We began to run to keep it in our sights but then lost it in the glare of streetlights. We were unable to re-establish visual contact with the phenomenon. We returned to the house and scrambled to call Buckley Air National Guard. The individual there procceded to remind us of the meteor shower and offered the number of the Denver Airfield. The person there was equally apathetic and offered us the number of NUFORC. All three of us  then drew pictures of the object independently without disscussing the details and ! came up with three remarkably similar shapes. The shape, like I&apos;ve stated before, was an oddly irregular boomerang shape. I say boomerang for loss of any other descriptive word, for the object lacked the symmetry associated with a boomerang yet retained a decidedly boomerang shape. It appeared to be a slightly different texture than the sky which is probably the only reason it was visible at all. It&apos;s speed and apparent size were also immense.", "Formation of lights of varying degree.  Yellow to orange.  Moving slowly from west to east above all airplane traffic.  Have video from two cameras.", "((NUFORC Note:  Object was reported from Birmingham, AL, and reported on WBRC TV news there.))Green fireball falling from skyI had gone out for a cigarette, and was looking approximately South to Southwest of my position. I had just glance away from that direction, when a green flash caught my eye. I turned in the original direction and saw a green fireball with a tail, like a comet&apos;s.  I would say it was not more than 1/4 mile from me. It was not real large, I probably could have covered it with my thumb at arm&apos;s length. It was approxiamtely 100 to 150 feet in the air when I first noticed it.  I lost site of it seconds later as it went below the roofline of a hotel in front of me.  I listened for a impact, thinking it had to hit the ground, but heard nothing.  I called two hotels that faced the direction of the fireball, but neither saw or heard anything.  The fireball did not make a sound as it fell.  I don&apos;t know where it came from, it just suddenly appeared in my vision.  I immediately went in and wrote the basics of what I saw down.  Beyond this there is no more to add.Mr. Davenport,  As I was standing looking south to southwest, the object was comingfrom my right to my left. athough during the time I saw it, about 5 to10 seconds it didn&apos;t appear to go very far.  It didn&apos;t shoot across thewhole sky, but seemed to appear and then drop out of my sight in thesame area of sky.  The tail came off the object at a 30 to 45 degreeangle.  The object seemed to be falling slowly, I believe this is sobecause I had time to start seeing the object out of the corner of myeye (at which time it didn&apos;t appear to be to high off the ground) turnmy head and focus on the object before it fell out of view.  Our local news reported it as a &quot;exploding meteor&quot;.   They also saidthat the object was seen as far as Alabama.  That strikes me as notpossible, but you&apos;d know better than I.  They apparently got calls allday long about the object.  Also our local airport, McGhee Tysonreceived calls about it.Should out local paper have an article on it in tomorrow&apos;s paper I&apos;llforward that you.Sincerely Mr Davenport,I posted a report to your page earlier this morning, Green Fireball inKnoxville, TN.  My name is ((name deleted)).I saw a news report after I filled out your form.  They said they hadreceived numerous calls about a green fireball in the sky over BlountCounty, just south of Knox County.  Apparently I was wrong on how far itwas from me, although it looked that close.  The local news is reportingas a (yep you guessed it) meteor. This is my first siting of something like this, now I understand yourcynicism about the news media.  I&apos;ve seen meteor storms and such, neverhave I seen a green one.  I apologize if my report may be a little inaccurate, especially on thedistance I thought it was from me, but it did look that close.Sincerely,((name deleted))", "Best recall as a SUnday night.  From east side of ferry boat spotted string of brilliant red balls that apeared to be diving into the sea far away.  My first inpression was that a plane had fired a string of red rockets, but the things didn&apos;t trail smoke, didn&apos;t explode or fade out.  My impression now, almost fifty years later was that another such string followed the first.  There were no aircraft in sight in the area.Rather simple observation it seems, but I came across letters to home describing the unque event.  Being a sailor and stationed on a ship, I was not at all aware that this sighting coincided with the great defense alert along the coast, espcially around Washington that night until I read in the Book of Lists of the report by an airliner coming in from over the Atantic that red lights approached him at &quot;thousands of miles per hour&quot;.  If those strings of lights were the ones I saw at that same time and date, what I saw were not diving into the sea, but passing over the very distant horizon.", "It moved over the sky in high speed and the air controler in Gothenburg and Malmo and even pilots have seen it.

Formation was dim and would not have been seen without having been looking at the general location. The V shaped formation was like a migrating geese formation or the leading edge of a YF117. However the formation was about 2 1/2 fingers wide, which would have been close for an airplane, but there was no sound. The formation would have passed overhead, but it wasn&apos;t observed until 30 deg from azimuth. Also, it would be unlikely to observe leading edge lights while going away.

We left about 15 minutes late from the gate and didn&apos;t take off for about another 35 minutes.  After we left the ground the pilot came over the PA and said we had Philadelphia out the left and would soon see Wilmington.  I looked out my window to the North.  I knew it was north because I had located the big dipper and had found the North star.  We were heading close to due west.  Out my window I noticed a light and thought it was another airplane.  The light appeared to be at a slightly lower altitude than the one we were at.  I watched the light and noticed that it was getting brighter.  Thus it was either getting closer or increasing in brightness.  I thought it was an airplane and started getting nervous as it appeared to be coming directly at us.  That is it&apos;s brightness increased.  I then noticed that it got extremely bright in the center and appeared to have an airplane like shape.  That is a bright center and tapered to the east and west as if it had two bright wings.  All this time it appeared as a bright white light.  Next I heard the pilot say something about a meteor out of my side of the plane.  I then noticed that the bright flattened shaped light appeared to explode into two or three more objects heading due east.  I then truned and told the fellow next to me that he should look at the meteor too.  He did and also saw what followed.  The bright initial light appeared to slowly fade into nothing.  The 2 or 3 objects that were left then headed due east.  One after the other apparently on the same course.  They moved very slowly and had a long tails that were about the same distance or a little less than the distance between the two stars of the big dipper which point to the north star.  The tails appeared to be the same length.  The were about the same luminosity except for the front which was slightly different.  I did notice that after the length of the tail there was no sign of a dim tail, it was totally dark as was the rest of the sky.  The objects moved off to the east at constant altitude.  The total episode taking from 30 seconds to as much as two minutes.  I was distracted by the pilots comments and then that it was a meteor so I didn&apos;t watch it continuously and really did not see the objects disappear.  I did notice that at some point they were no longer visible.  The trajectory of the objects was neither up or down in the vertical direction.  The witnesses included myself, the person sitting next to me and at least one pilot.  I am not sure about whether other people on the plane had noticed the event.

The red light wasn&apos;t blinking, it was shining steadily. At one point he said there was a beam of white light coming from the object. He came in running to tell me, he was excited and scared. He said it was very strange because if it had been an airplane he would have heard the motors, that&apos;s how close it was. But as it was there was no sound at all.

While driving south on interstate 680 in Omaha, I saw a dark black object, barely distinguishable from the nighttime sky, moving across the sky from east to west.  The object had no lights or any visible source of illumination.  It seemed solid in nature, but being only a shade lighter then the surrounding nighttime sky, it was very difficult to see any detail.  No sound was heard.  I could not tell the size of the object or its distance from my vehicle.  Using the perspective of a coin held at arm&apos;s length, it was about the size of a penny.

Janurary 27th of 2000. It was a clear evening, there were many stars out, no moon. I looked up and to my right I saw the object slowly moving towards me. It was a fire orange type of circle. I noticed that it had something attatched to it at the top. That part was not lit up. I could barely make it out. I told my friend, who lives across the highway from me to go outside and look up and see it. She went out and right away noticed it also.  We both watched it together while talking on the phone. It moved slowly for a few minutes and then it stopped. It stood still for about 2 minutes. At that time I noticed that it seemed to spark off a little and I thought I might have seen a red tail. My friend thought she saw that too. But it was only for a second, and then I thoguht I saw it again, just for a second. Then it started to fade out and move slowly towards the east. It almost disappeared to where I could barely make it out, but I strained hard to watch it. It lit up a little more and I watched it move across the sky very slowly. It seemed to move from side to side and it seemed to be moving down a little to where the mountain was. Then I could not see it any longer. I then told my husband to go out and see if he could see anything and by then he could not, it was no longer in the sky or in eye site. I witnessed this object for about 10 minutes. I have seen this before on three other occassions. The first time I saw it was two years ago. Then on this new years eve, while I was outside watching the fireworks, I saw two of them. I was very afraid all of the times that I saw these. I am the type of person that is realistic, and down to earth but I know what I saw did not sit well with me. I was frightened.

One craft or three I don&apos;t know.This is an addendum to a report I made approx 16 hours ago concerning a craft of unknown identity spotted in Austin TX. Craft Size: It was between a quarter and half-dollar held at arm&apos;s length. Of course that is an estimation and I cannot give it any weight. I can say that the circle / lights were distanced 1 1/2 circle / light  diameters apart and if linked would from an equilatoral triangle. An imaginary cicle periphery drawn around the three lights would be 2.5 times the size of each light. The craft proceeded north triangle point leading. The lights had depth to them and appeared as shallow domes of light. The effect was something like viewing a tent with a lightsource inside. You don&apos;t see the source but its interaction with the tent material. So too were these lights. They appeared to softly luminesce these shallow domes in a very off orange color. As I mentioned somewhere between subdued peach and burnt ocher. During and immediately after the incident I recorded other visible activity in the sky and this consisted of three other, conventional, aircraft. None interacted with the object and appeared to be normal air traffic. The closest was at least 3-5 kilometers away and the farthest between 8 and 12. Two were generally northeast and one (the farthest) was west. Austin-Bergstrom international airport lies east southeast approx 5 miles away. I hope this comletes this report accurately for you. If I can clarify anything further please let me know. A copy of my initial report is enclosed below. My wife and I were returning to work after a lunch break. I stepped outside and looked up to see the moon. Instead what I saw were three dome shaped lights that were moving north at a constant rate of travel. All three lights were the same color something between a subdued peach &amp; burnt ocher. They did not blink or flash. The lights were either three individual craft moving in perfect triangular formation, or they were attached to one indistinguishable craft. All moved exactly in unison! The craft covered about 40 degrees of sky in less than ten seconds and maintained a constant velocity. No noise accompanied this sighting. I shouted over and over at my wife to &quot;Look at this! Look at this!&quot; She was closing the door behind me and turned and observed the craft for about seven seconds. After continuing across the sky in a straight line the UFO disappeared seemingly winking to nothing as it went into the night. My wife was extrememly shaken. I too felt this, but I also felt excitement. Disbelief. Never have I seen anything even close. I am an Army veteran and am trained in aircraft identification. This was absolutely not a conventional powered aircraft. Nor is it anything I have ever been instructed to watch for. Very chillingly this craft is a near identicle copy of a recreation I observed very recently on TV of a UFO reported all over Britain in one night and investigated by that fromer MOD official whose name I cannot recall. I believe the show was &quot;Sightings&quot;. The event is less that 2 hours old and I am back at work, but my mind is not focused and I feel as though I am running on Auto.

As we drove, I had noticed a light high up in the sky, a few miles away.  It was a beautiful white light, with hues of green and red around the edges.  At first I thought it was a star, and I pointed it out to my mother.  The sky was very clear, and it was a cold night.  There didn&apos;t seem to be many cars on the road as we drove home.  When I looked up again, I noticed that the object had moved some distance ahead of us.  Keeping my eye on it, we turned down another road.  The object slowly moved from left to right, then flew behind us, and then in front of us.  It seemed to follow us like this all the way home.  It flew very smoothly, yet seemed to be able to travel many miles relatively quickly.

It didn&apos;t appear to be moving.  As I drove towards it, the light got dim and it started moving very quickly and as it passed over I saw it was a triangle shape (but the sides were concave not straight).I was leaving work very late.  I was driving west on Roosevelt Road from 25th street in Westchester.  It was a cold, clear night.  The stars were easily visible.  As I drove, I noticed a very bright light in the sky (almost exactly south southwest).  It was high enough in the sky that, at first, I thought it was a star.  But as I watched, I realized that it was really bright, which is why it caught my eye in the first place.  So bright, that when I looked away, I had blue circles in my vision.  At this point I realized that it couldn&apos;t be a star, so it must be a plane.  I continued heading in its general direction.  It appeared to be about 3 miles away or so.  I judged that it must have been over the next town, Oak Brook.  As I approached Wolf Road, the light suddenly dimmed and, for the first time, it appeared to move in my direction.  I turned south on Wolf Road because its direction seemed that it would pass over just a few blocks south of my position.  At this point, I really just wanted to see what kind of plane it was since I have never seen a headlight that bright before.  The roads were very empty that morning, so I drove very slowly with my head hanging out the window watching it approach.  I stopped directly under it as it went over.  It appeared to be triangular, except that the sides were sloped inward.  It didn&apos;t seem to be more than a few hundred feet in the air.  And it wasn&apos;t until later that I realized I never heard any noise, not even as it passed directly over me.  I didn&apos;t notice any lights on the bottom of it, but, after it passed over, I did see a blinking light on top, which appeared to be the same kind of beacon all airplanes have, with a few other red lights near the front portion on top.  It was heading directly northeast.  I realized after it passed over that I forgot to look at the front where I had seen the bright light earlier.  So, I decided to follow it.  I turned east on a side street.  I watched as it moved away, so slowly that it appeared to be floating.  I decided to! turn no rth so I could get back to Roosevelt Road and continue the chase.  I lost sight of it due to trees and houses for the two blocks ride.  When I came back out on Roosevelt Road, maybe 20 seconds later, it was gone.  I stopped my car and searched the entire sky, but it was nowhere to be seen.  I had my cell phone in my hand the entire time, but I was so distracted that I never made a call to anyone who could have witnessed it too.  So, I went home.  I didn&apos;t think that much about it until a few days later when I heard a local television station news break teaser.  It was something like, &quot;are there UFO&apos;s in the night skies over Illinois?&quot;  But, I forgot to watch the news that night, so I didn&apos;t see the story.  I decided over the weekend to search the internet for the story.  That is how I came across this web site and read about some other sightings almost identical to mine.  So, I decided to report it.", "I was driving due west in downtown Fort Wayne around 8:30 PM and saw a very bright green &quot;fireball&quot; pass overhead. I was amazed of the brightness of the object since I had never seen any meteorite like it before. It was at approxitmatly 45 deg. when I first noticed it going in a due east direction. The object was a very bright green. It &quot;appeared&quot; to be at 3000 feet altitude so I turned around the block expecting to see it hit the ground. As I was going in the opposte direction it fragmented into maybe 6 or 7 smaller pieces. It fizzled out behind a 40-story building as I was about 3/4 miles from that building. Fort Wayne doesn&apos;t have many tall buildings so I had a clear view of the object until it ended. I&apos;m not sure if it made a noise or not when it passed. Duration of time visually was between 1-2 min. I&apos;m sure there was others who saw it since I was driving on a 4 lane(one way) street in middle of town.I work as a Maintenance Technician at a Country Club and see things as they are but this is uexplainable to me.", "Flaming Green Fireball reported over mountains in San Bernardino County Sunday Jan. 2, 2000.MUFON-San Bernardino County received the following Green Fireball report via our local UFO Sighting Report Hotline.  Sunday, January 2nd, 2000, approx. 9:30PM A Redlands resident, who is also a licensed civilian pilot, witnessed a flaming green fireball descending slowly, making a (jet-like) roaring sound. The witness reports that at first he thought it was a 747 going down, it was so large.  The object appeared to move at a speed of about 4-5 knots and was estimated at an altitude of 4 to 5,000 ft. when he saw it.  He watched it descend in an easternly direction and said it appeared to him that the object crash landed here in the area.  He describes the object as round in shape, as near as he could tell by the objects extreme brightness and the color was &quot;a beautiful green - like burning metals&quot;.  Size as large or larger than the full moon.  He called the local Sheriff Dept. and newspaper and was told that it was a meteor.  He said, &quot;He&apos;s seen alot of meteors in his day but this didn&apos;t look like any meteor he&apos;d ever ever seen before - if he didn&apos;t know better he&apos;d swear it was under intelligent control.&quot; (Source:  Cinde Costello, MUFON SSD, San Bernardino County, So.

It was an exceptionally clear evening and we were marveling at all of the stars out that night, when I asked him if he had ever seen one of those hundreds of satellites we have orbiting our planet.  He responded that he hadn&apos;t, and so I told him that I could probably spot one for him within 10 or 15 minutes, and began scanning the skies for one.  We were in a quiet neigborhood, but the neighbors porch-lights were making it difficult to see good, so I walked north between the two houses where the night-sky became more &quot;observable&quot;.  I was looking straight above me, when out the corner of my eye I saw a really fast moving blur to which I began to blurt out to my frind, &quot;Look!, a shooting star&quot;....But I only got out the words &quot;Look! a shoo.......&quot; when My eyes were able to focus on the object.  This was NO shooting star, NO aircraft man has ever built, and NO weather related phenomena!  I could very CLEARLY see a long, thinly shaped triangle with only the edges lit up in a pale whitish outline.  I had only focused on it for maybe a second or two when I noticed a 2nd one behind it a ways and to the right of the first one.  They were flying precisely at the same speed and kept the distance between them so steady that they could have been flying as ONE! (unlike our known aircraft that fly in formation.....they always seem to deviate a little from one another as they fly overhead)  There were no blinking lights at all, only the complete outline of the triangles were dimly lit and the light seemed to gently fade from the outside edges inward, where the center of the craft appeared almost translucent......sky-black with just a hint of reflected &quot;ground-light&quot; of whitish-green.  It is very hard to determine the altitude of anything in the night sky, but to the best of my knowledge, they seemed to be flying rather low, maybe at an altitude of between 1,000 and 3,000 ft.  Agai! n, in a night sky, size is difficult to determine also, and once again, I believe they seemed to be rather small craft, somewhere between 8 to 15 ft. in length, and maybe 5 to 9 ft. at their widest point, which would have been at the aft end of the triangular shapes.  At this relatively low altitude, one would think that you would be able to hear some kind of sound, even if it was the sound of air rushing around them, as they flew at a very high rate of speed,.....but there was NO sound whatsoever!  I would have to guess they were traveling at a rate of maybe 500 to 800 mph, heading north in a straight line.  At this speed and altitude, and given their rather dimly-lit appearance, I only observed them for maybe 5 seconds and they were out of sight.  During this time of observaton, I was calling out to my friend and pointing towards them, asking if he was seeing what I was, and wondering why I wasn&apos;t hearing a response.  Turns out, unfortunately, that one of his kids had called out to him, and he had turned and gone inside the house and didn&apos;t even hear me talking to him, much less SEE anything! I am a 50 yr.old aircraft mechanic of 32 years, living in Minnesota for the pat 20 yrs.  I often fly comercially and recreationally, even though I do not posess a pilots license.  I have always been interested in astronomy and enjoy observing our night skies, and believe me......I will be observing our skies even more now, after witnessing this account, even though I don&apos;t really believe I will ever see anything so compelling as what I saw on that night in early October, 1999.", "I had taken the dog outside, and while I was waiting for him to do his business,I looked up to stargaze on this extremely clear night. I saw what I first naturally assumed to be a flock of birds in a V formation, but this was 2 hours after sunset, and they were flying East to West, then headed Southeast, moving silenty and elegantly.I had taken the dog outside to do his business at 8:00 P.M. C.S.T., and I knew the exact time because I had checked my watch. The sun had been set about 2 hours, and because a cold front had passed through the area a few days before, the sky was extremely clear. While I was waiting for the dog , I just looked up into the clear night sky to stargaze on this unusually clear night. Toward the East I saw what I naturally assumed to bea flock of birds in a V formation. They were moving relatively quickly, silently, and elegantly from East to West, then after a 15 seconds  or so, headed Southeast. I noticed no significant sounds nor any flapping ofwings, and their color was brownish, and individually each more all winged shaped. I found this weird because I&apos;ve never known birds to flock orfly in a V formation well after sunset and so silently. I only told a few close friends and my wife of this event, and only after I saw it reoported on this site, did i finally decide to report it myself.", "I saw a shooting star coming into earth and the light went off and this big object with two wings(not feathers) appear and all of the suden went up and across and the straight into the horizon.I was looking at the moon eclipse on January 20, 2000 at 10:00pm.  At 10:30 pm on the south west sky I saw a shooting star so I turn my head and saw the light of the shooting star disapearing and appearing an object with wings.  They were two wings and something in the middle of them but it was not an airplaine it look more like a handglider but did not have any lights at all.  It was a clear night so I so it perfectly. The object was brounish grenish on the bottom of the wings.  So when the object stoped in middle air like loosing control all of the sudden took off vertically and then it went sideways(zigzag) very fast and then it took off south very fast and disapear in the orizon.

Vivid green lights could be seen from the outside of the object with red lights in the center. We recorded the object on and off for approximately an hour using an 8mm comcorder with a 64x digital zoom.  We ended up with about a half hour of tape.  On the tape, the object  appeared to be circular in shape with the green lights coming from the outside and red lights coming from a dome in the center.  It appeared to move closer and then farther away, at times becoming indistinct on the tape at its closest.  Then, near the end of the tape, it seemed to take on a mushroom-like appearance and became white in color.  At around 02:00, it seemed to move from south to north.  I can send a copy of the aforementioned videotape.((NUFORC Note--Upon receipt of this report, we first suspected a twinkling star as being the cause.

Rockford is near my hometown, so I check this site almost daily.  I am not a witness.  The article is posted on the 1/2/2000 page. The airport is Rockford is pretty busy, passenger jets and many cargo planes.  It looks interesting. What follows is a partial quote from the article. &quot;The unusual sightings were reported Friday night by several spectators at Rockford&apos;s downtown New Year&apos;s Eve celebration. Accounts continued surfacing Saturday from outlying areas as well. Most described reddish-orange lights moving across the sky about 10 or 11 p.m. -- before most fireworks demonstrations began. Veroni, who was celebrating on Main Street north of downtown Rockford, was startled enough to stop at a gas station and dial 9-1-1. She said she feared a Y2K computer foulup had launched missiles at the United States. &quot;It was either missiles, or -- man, I&apos;m telling you -- spaceships,&quot; she said. &quot;It was like nothing I&apos;ve ever seen.&quot; &quot;", "Greenish apearing fireball with spark tail heading slowly eastward.I greenish fireball heading East.

I drove South, out of town, on 181st ave. until I reached Tilstrom Rd. (possibly spelled Tillstrom). Preparing top turn left on Tilstrom Rd.

I heard my husband calling the cat to let it out the door near the room where I was sleeping.  The door closed with a familiar bang and a short time later I heard my husband talking quite loudly in the hallway.  It sounded like he was talking with my daughter and I changed my position in bed, straining to hear what they were talking about, wondering if I should get up and perhaps reassure my daughter for some reason.  Their voices were loud but the tonality wasn&apos;t stressed or upset so I just continued to listen very carefully trying to hear what they were talking about.  There was qite a bit of loud opening and closing of doors  and a very loud thump on the wall behind my pillow which confused me.  I tried to figure out what would make such a sharp loud bang on the wall.  I at first though maybe our dog could have somehow made the noise but quickly realized the dog could not have hit the wall because of a low stack of firewood that would prevent the dog from getting close to the wall.  I then wondered why the dog wasn&apos;t barking.  If someone was in our yard the dog is slightly aggresive and would surely bark.  At the same time I started wondering about a very, very loud mechanical whirring noise outside my window.  It was a noise I recognized as hearing before but had never been able to really identify or explain.  It was much louder than usual.  Near this same time my body felt suddenly electrified as if a force field or some kind electromagnetic field was emanating from and enveloping me.  It was a light buzzy type of feeling I somehow felt responsible for but then I felt a discrete circle of electricity, like a hula hoop, pass up my body up past my head and then back down my body again.  It was a very powerful force and made every small hair on my body stand on end as it passed up and down me just once.  As it passed over my head I felt a little worried that it would pull me right out of my body and did my best to hold on tight.! I was actively trying to figure out what was going on and streams of rational explanations ran through my mind and were discarded.  As my eyes shifted to follow the pattern of exposure to the strange electric field I noticed a dark ephmeral figure at my bedside.  It was about even with where my hands were folded on my chest and I had the impression it was holding me in place.  I stared wide-eyed at it, not particularly frightened but angry that it was violating my personal space.  I immediately noted a much larger figure directly  looming over my head from behind me.  I could just see the edges of its presence and thought it odd that it could get between my pillows and the bedroom wall.  I wanted to  push the smaller bedside creature away from me but knew I couldn&apos;t move my hands or legs, so , instinctually, I raised my head in its direction, gave a little snarl and bit at it!  Even at the point of doing it I realized what a strange funny thing that was to do and was a little amused at myself.  It was very irritating to have these things so close to me but I didn&apos;t really seem to have much choice.  I was still trying to figure out what was happening to me.  I started to think back to some experiences I had had years ago and recalled that a psychic had told me I was being crowded by spirits who wandered towards me because I was so bright.  The psychic had helped me send the spirits away and told me if and when I meditated to stay in the Christlight.  I wasn&apos;t sure if this experience had anything to do with spirits but I was comforted to know I could perhaps look for the Christlight to protect myself.  At the time I couldn&apos;t remember the term &apos;Christlight&apos; and instead started mentally asking for the Godlight and then I asked  Christ to protect me a couple of times and finally and suddenly the creatures were gone.  One of the most striking things about this experience was the distinct way the whirring sound from outside slowly moved away when the creatures left.  As the sound from outside receeded I was left froz! en in ab solute stunning silence.  I laid there for only a moment impressed with the incredible absence of sound and  awestruck by how deafeningly loud things had been just moments ago, and then realizing I was able to move again I lept out of bed and ran into the hallway to check on my family.  They were all absolutely sound asleep.  I tried to wake my husband (who sleeps in a seperate room) to find out why he had been talking to my daughter earlier but he was really sound asleep and wouldn&apos;t reply to me.  I checked the children again and even looked outside for the dog, who was also asleep in her doggie bed.  I walked around the house and looked out the windows and opened the front door to see if I could hear anything like the whirring noise but all was silent. I was a little frightened at this time but I decided whatever had just happened was beyond my control and there for some reason just wasn&apos;t much point in being scared about it.  I went back to bed, turned on all the lights in my room, noted it was just after 5am, and laid there trying and make sense of the whole experience.  I relfected back onto the very vivid dream I had been having just before I had woken up and all this had taken place.  I wondered if the dream had anything to do with the experience I had just had.  In the dream I had been participating in some kind of a game show.  It was sunny and bright.  I was required to dress in a bright yellow pantsuit with little fuzzy white socks and white clogs like nurses sometimes wear.  I remember dressing and thinking the fuzzy socks were funny but that I needed to wear them to be eligible for the game show.  I was very happy and peaceful throughout the dream.  Anyway, after dressing I drove to a large marble office type building with a large airy anteroom and lots of glass windows and large smooth marble pillars.  A smiling man in a normal looking business suit greeted me warmly and put his arm on my shoulders to guide me to my first task.  He was talking to me and kind of giving me a little orientation so I would know what was coming next and I could do my best to win the game.  It didn&apos;t seem like a usual game show.  There were no lights or cameras and no audience just a few people here and there walking about in the background.  I noticed there was a gentleman just ahead of me in line for the tasks.  The first task my guide said apologetically was to spin horizontally about six inches off the marble floor of the room.  He put his arm around me and placed a little yellow piece of plastic the shape of small ruler but different ( I can&apos;t describe it but could draw it) in front of us and we kind of fell forward like we would hit the floor but instead began to spin over the yellow object.  I was smiling.  It only lasted a couple of seconds and then we ju! st stood up and the guide told me I had done very well, much better than the fellow before me.  I was quite proud of myself.  Next we turned to where another man was holding a large book.  He put the book very close to my face and then slowly drew it away from me.  I didn&apos;t think I could read or recognize what he was showing me but everyone seemed pleased.  Behind him was a very large blue screen with white letters or symbols being quickly flashed on it.  I was allowed to look at the screen for a few moments and then I was taken to another large screen and allowed to sit down and watch the symbols being scanned onto it.  The letters or symbols were moving very quickly similar to scanning rapidly through text on a computer screen.  I didn&apos;t feel that I could understand any of what I was being shown because it was moving so fast, but again it seemed they thought I was doing a good job.  In my dream this game show thing went on for three days because I kept doing a better job than the other contestants.  Finally on the third day I was used to the routine and the guide and people working there were like old friends.  On that third day, at the point after the spinning session, when the man showed me the book, I recognized the particular book he showed this time and I recognized words on the cover of the book and being normal english letters.  The book cover included the word &apos;Fisher&apos; and I knew it from the scientific supply company from which I sometimes order supplies in my &apos;real life&apos;.  I was very interested to see this book and I wanted to look at it longer.  It suddenly struck me that what I was being shown was very important if only I could understand it.  I felt that book had valuable information related to my field of biology in it and I wanted very badly to have a longer look at it.  Instead I was directed to the seat and the usual blue screen where I studied the flashing symbols until I was done for the day.  I felt that they didn&apos;t realize that I couldn&apos;t understand the information on the screen because it ! was movi ng so fast.  I then thought maybe the information was somehow being absorbed by me but then reconvinced myself that they had just made a slight error in their planning and that they really didn&apos;t know I wasn&apos;t able to read the symbols so quickly.  I felt that they thought they were doing a very good job, a good thing.  This third day I was told I was the winner and I would be getting my prize in a few days.  I was very happy and wondered what my prize would be.  I knew it would be something really good. I woke from the dream feeling very proud of myself and contented and excited about the prize.  Then I started having the experience already  discussed at the beginning of this letter.  I feel strongly that the dream and the experience following are related. I am not a very religous person or someone who has spent more than a casual amount of time investigating the psychic world etc.  I have had some other strange experiences that could be considered both paranormal and otherworldly in the past and my interest in these matters has stemmed from a desire to explain what I have experienced.  On your web-page introduction the question &quot;Why me?&quot; grabbed me by the shirt front.  I am an open minded, creative, intelligent person but mostly no different from anyone I know.  I certainly don&apos;t look remarkable though not hideous.  42 years old, married 20 years, mother of two, student of genetics and developmental biology soon to be a college professor.  Can you help me discover the purpose behind this phenomenon and help me figure out, why me?  I apologize for the somewhat jumbled nature of this letter.  I am relieved to get it written down at least.", "Nightime,black craft/no lights, flying under conventional aircraft,craft had a thick body with short stuby shark fin like wings!I was sitting in my backyard and looked up to veiw the passing of what sounded like a jet in the night sky. I made eye contact with the object (flying in a northwesterly direction) which had displayed a flashing beacon and looked very typical of the kind of aircraft one might veiw in the night sky. Then my eye was drawn to an other object which was flying below, also in a northwesterly direction(this craft was heading more north than west)however,this object was flying at a great rate of speed and traveling at a much lower altitude. The object looked &quot;completely black&quot; and traveling &quot;without lights&quot;. It seemed to be traveling without sound as well,however,there was noise from the conventional aircraft flying at a much higher altitude above,so maybe the one craft masked the sound of the other. The black craft had a very long &quot;thick&quot; body with two very odd looking short stuby, shark fin like wings attached, however I was viewing the object from the side and it was at a slight angle,so the object could have been triangular.The craft appeared to be ascending!The cloud cover is quite thick tonight (a marine layer) and the black craft almost blended in with the cloud cover. As it passed over I could see patches of cloud mist against the craft&apos;s black body. I would have never noticed it had it not been for the sighting of the first aircraft flying overhead.The black craft looked very out of place and it gave me the distinct impression that it was trying to remain hidden.It looked very ominous and strange.The black craft was about the size of a thumb veiwed in the horizontal position at arms length.I would guess that the object was at about 6000 to 7000 feet,but that&apos;s just a guess(the conventional aircraft was much higher.) My veiw of it was only for a few seconds,then it vanished.I have been watching the night and day sky for years and I  have never seen anything like this!It was very weird!!!((NUFORC Note:  The following information was submitted 22NO99 to supplement the first report.))(clarification) of sighting and reporting of black craft on 11/19/99The altitude of the craft was hard to estimate.Craft was probably smaller than thumb at arms length! The Black craft was very visible against the cloud cover! There are two airports nearby. Sherman Oaks is a few miles southeast of Van Nuys Airport and about 6 miles west of Burbank Airport. No lights could be seen on any portion of the craft!", "I was washing dishes and I looked out my kitchen window and seen 4 diamond shaped objects circling my field.

As I continued watching the non blinking red light come directly in front of me, now about 1 mile away from my view and below eye level, I could tell that this object was a saucer shaped vehicle with a small dome above it and very bright red light on top.

I could not tell my father what I had seen, because he did not come home until I was fast to sleep.  The next morning at the breakfast table, while my mother, father and brother were sitting down and the radio playing music, I told them what I had seen yesterday.  All my mother and father did was looking at each other and then looked back at me.  Two minutes later while I was he my breakfast the radio announcer reported that there was a UFO that flew over the city and that there were over a thousand witnesses that called in to report the UFO.  After the radio announcer finished the news flash, my mother and father look at each other and then looked back at me.  They did not ask me any questions or talk to me about the incident ever.  Weeks after the incident I started having what was commonly called ESP, because my mother always watched game shows, I most of the time said out loud what the number was.  My mom even new I had the ability for numbers, because several times she would ask me to go with her to the race track and pick some h! orses, b ut I always refused.", "Crew of B757 at FL330 passed on south side by white light making at least 200 knots more than we were.  We were at .80 Mach and G/S of 483knots.  Queried ATC about possible military target passing us, Memphis Center had nothing there.While flying at 33,000 feet on a commercial flight from LAX to CLT on Dec 26, the 2 pilot crewmembers and 2 flight attendants were observing an earth satellite passing overhead from the cockpit of a B757.  It was well past sunset at about 0100Z 27 Dec 1999. The earth satellite appararently flew into the terminator (it disappeared while high overhead).  Within a moment or so, a white lighted object overtook and passed us in fairly close proximity.  The object was first noted south of our west to east course at a distance estimated to be from about 2 to 5 miles.  It appeared to be at nearly the same or a slightly higher altitude.  The object showed only a bright white light that appeared to be slightly disturbed by turbulence, or very slightly pulsating.  It&apos;s course appeared constant as did its alititude.  It passed us and faded rather quickly from sight in a very brief amount of time, perhaps as long as forty seconds.  A query was made to Memphis Center ARRTC as to any possible traffic.  The controller said he had nothing on his scope that could be what we saw.  We saw nothing on our TCAS, set to observe other transponders within 4,000 feet of our altitude and withi;n 20 miles of horizontal distance.  No red (left wing)position light and no fuselage red rotating beacons were sighted by any of the witnesses.  No magnetic or electrical disturbances on our aircraft occurred. At least one passenger noted the object pass by our craft from the passenger cabin.", "My mother and I have seen a U.F.O. at very close range. We can identify this object as a flying object unknown to mankind.I was seven years of age playing on our front lawn, my mother was out in the side yard hanging up the laundry on a close line. The event that was about to take place at that time is forever etched in my mind. Back in 1962, my mom, dad, little brother and I, lived in northern Manitoba, Canada on a large hobby farm. Our nearest neibour was 1/4 of a mile away. To my knowledge, nobody else in the area seen what my mom and I saw on that warm August afternoon. A slow moving object caught my attention from the corner of my eye. I looked up over the garage located across our front yard and saw a large football shaped flying craft. It was approximately 100 feet away from me, flying approximately 30 feet above the ground. The craft was approximately 20 feet wide and 10 feet high. There was no sound of a motor. This craft seemed to be very high-tech as it had no wings or engine to be seen. The occupants of the craft must have known there was life forms on the ground, namely our family. I believe they said &quot;Hello!&quot; with a spectacular display of lights which illuminated there craft in top to bottom (3 foot) strips of blue, green, red, yellow, and other fasinating colors. The craft changed direction as it flew over the garage from north to east. At this point my mother looked up from her cloth line and saw the slow moving craft (traveling at approximately 10 miles per hour) heading in a eastern direction. I seen this object with my own eyes...we are not alone in the universe. Perhaps there are many types of life forms from far away places roaming the sky above and walking among us. Another unexplained encounter happened during the summer of 1975 in the province of British Columbia, Canada. I was walking in a rugged open area 200 feet from the Fraser River when an unusual object caught my attention. There on the ground was a foot long cylinder and about 10 inches around with rounded ends. As I looked down at this object I noticed it&apos;s mirror-like appearance. As I looked closer I noticed there wasn&apos;t a scratch on the metal-like object. I reached down and picked up the object, it seemed to weight about 5 lbs. From that moment on until I found myself walking away from the area...I have no memory of what happened. I still search my mind today and ask myself what happened to the strange cylinder? I would have never put it back on the ground. I know I would have take! n it wit h me to find out what it was. Today, I believe that what I saw and held in my hands was a landed probe from outer space. Perhaps the same type of probes seen flying over crop circles throughout the world. Whatever I held in my hand could have had a hand in the loss of my memory. I believe it did.", "Near end of 1AM fireworks while standing outside Metro station in DC observed at least 5 cylindrical things moving at high speed across skyI attended &quot;America&apos;s Millennium&quot; celebration on the national mall in Washington DC New Year&apos;s Eve.  Up until 1:00 AM the weirdest thing I saw was a dumb guy climbing dangerously on a large tree.  I had no expectation of a UFO sighting then nor at anytime.  After the 12:00 fireworks and some music and laser lights (which were disappointing), I decided we (me and my friend) should start leaving, as the crowd was incredibly huge.  We walked through part of downtown DC including the George Washington University to the Foggy Bottom Metro Station.  As we got near the station the crowd swelled again as people try to get to the few escalators going down.  It took a very long time to get to the escalator, so I stood and listened and people-watched.  At about 1:00 AM there was the sound of explosions and it made me &quot;jump&quot;.  It was just the 2nd round of fireworks being launched from a barge in the Potomac River behind the Lincoln Memorial.  Thank God it wasn&apos;t real bombs.  All we could see were the flashes of light behind 12-story buildings and some reflections in office windows.  The fireworks lasted about 6 minutes, and after about 2-3 minutes of fireworks as I was inching my way along in the crowd, I noticed near the western horizon what appeared to be (a) shooting star(s).  I was not looking directly at it though.  I said to my friend, &quot;What good timing for shooting stars!  It&apos;s great to see that during the fireworks.&quot;  Then I saw more, and this time I got a better look at what they were.  (It also occurred to me later that the &quot;shooting star(s)&quot; never &quot;burned up in the atmosphere.&quot;)  I saw a pair of dark but lit cylindrical objects &quot;flying&quot; in formation from NW to SE passing almost directly above me.  Definitely not meteors.  They looked identical.  They moved at high speed, but I was able to see them well enough while they lasted, since I was now looking for more &quot;shooting stars&quot;.  Less than a minute later a single cylinder moved from WSW to ENE at about the same speed and had the same appearance.  I then ! said, to no one in particular and not loudly really, &quot;Am I seeing UFOs?&quot;  My friend was either caught up in the fireworks and/or crowd and didn&apos;t notice anything.  No one said anything after my last comment, but then very few people around me would have been able to hear me with so many people jabbering and the incredibly loud, echoing fireworks.  At this point I was almost at the beginning of the escalator.  I guess &quot;resistance is futile&quot;; I felt I had no choice but to get on the thing.  If I could do it over again, I would have grabbed my friend and tried to get out of the way so I could hang around and look for more of these things, whatever they were.  I have searched the Washington Post&apos;s of the last few days but have not been able to find anything on any UFO sightings.  I am now searching the internet for the same (for the first time) and happened upon this site.  I hope this helps me resolve what it was I saw.  I am keeping a wide-open mind and not jumping to conclusions.  Anyone else?  Please speak up if you saw them.  Thanks!", "AS we left our home I spotted two large bright shapes in the southwestern sky. With outstretched arm the two shapes were lentil size. Both were suspended in the sky. At the same time we could also see fopur jets passing by these objects.  As one jet came within close range of the object furthest east that object appeared to lose control and began decending leaving a trail.  It then appeared to have recovered from this loss of control but it left a trail in the sky causing it to look like an up-side-down comma.  It then righted itself.  The jests has passed by then and one was returning from a southwesterly direction.  The two bright objects remained in the sky approximately 10 more minutes.  After leaving me at work, my huband spotted only one object in the sky and it dissappeared a few minutes later.  They were so bright they looked like small suns.  The jets were atoms in comparison to these objects.  If the jets had not left trails one would never have known they were there.", "OBJECT WAS OVAL IN SHAPE AND HAD MANY LIGHTS ON THE INSIDE PERIMETER.

We have assigned an artificial date in order to cause the report to sort to the late 1970&apos;s.  PD))I have been trying to get more info for you on this siting.It was reported in the Verde Independent newspaper in Cottonwood,Az.,but they do not have the info in microfilm form and I started paging through the individual days circa 1976 and gave up.Too slow.On a particular night,a craft hovered above the Childs hydroelectric plant run by APS (Arizona Public Service).This plant was built around the trun of the century to supply half the electricity for Phoenix.It uses a famous spring source ten miles away that is piped to the vicinity and dropped through a long drop to power hydro turbines.A small group of houses surround the site.Three or four engineers and their families live here and operate the plant.The nearest town is Camp Verde,approx.25 miles of dirt road away.It is literally in the middle of nowhere.A famous hot spring is directly across from the plant on the other side of the Verde river.The date of the event was 1976-1979.I did not keep the article,but it was big local news,on the front page I believe.It hardly hit the papers in Phoenix.Two facts lend corroboration: the people who reported it and were interviewed were employees of the very conservative public utility APS.Just reporting the event could have caused these folks a lot of grief,possibly their jobs.Secondly,on a drive out to this area about a month later,I stopped to help a lady change her truck&apos;s flat tire on this remote road and she was the wife of one of the engineers.This lady had a typical western accent and beehive hairdo.Not a hippie at all.While helping her I asked where she was going and she said that she lived at Childs.I then asked her if she knew the employees that saw the craft hover above the plant.She said that she was one of them and that they not only saw it,they met the aliens personally.It&apos;s hard to discount someone like this,in my mind,unless they wanted to create attention and lose jobs.Not likely.Their report was that the craft hovered above the plant and sucked energy from it,causing the power dials to drop and create a very noticeable change in electric transmission,something they would have to report to APS of course.I am not sure of the time and duration,but the lady told me that she they did not want to cause to much trouble or get too much attention,so they! did not tell the news that in addition to this experience,they not only saw them but met them as well.I did not want to pry and forgot to ask what they dressed like or how they communicated(English?).I did ask what the aliens were like,and she replied,&quot;THEY WERE JUST LIKE HUMANS ONLY THEY WERE VERY NICE,VERY PEACEFUL&quot; or something to that effect.It has been almost twenty-five years since then,but I have always thought about it.Last year I went to the Verde Independent and started paging through 1977,1978 and gave up.It took hours and page-by-page in those large bound volumes was difficult.As much I seem to remember that it was on the front page,it might have been on a subsequent page.I would like to know more and help if possible.I think that APS must have an archive department and could search as well.Perhaps the employees could be located and re-interviewed.The triangular craft sightings last year or so in Az. that was recently covered on FOX news on T.V. mentioned the many sightings of it culminating in F16 fighters going up to check it out over Phoenix.The show said that the sightings began in the Prescott area.Actually I have heard of friends who were out by the Hot Springs that night and saw them in that sky.The Hot Springs and Childs are about the same distance north of Phx. as is Prescott,only about 35 miles further east.", "We were at camp,up in the sky something cought our eye,it was a light.It didn&apos;t move for about 15min, just hung there with no noise, and then...was gone like a shot, just gone???I was only 12 years old when it happened.  I was at a boy scout camp at a place called Hawk Mt. in Pennsylvania. We were walking up to the phone to call home, because the cabin we were at had none, and up in the sky we saw a light. It is weird, but it really caught our eye, we couldn&apos;t stop looking at it.  We (((four names deleted))even started trying to guess what it was, it might be a helecopter we thought, but it made no noise, it couldn&apos;t be a plane, it was not moving at all, we had no idea what it was.  Then while we were still looking at it, what seemed to takt forever, it just took off like a shot, I mean it was gone!!!

It was quite apparent that these bright, round, lights hovering in the southeast on the horizon (we were looking North) were different from anything we had ever seen before, and we immediately knew what we were watching was paranormal.  Three bright, non-flashing, hovering lights that stayed in a tight formation non-moving for approx 5 minutes, which then took off in a tight formation at a high rate of speed in one direction, and then another, always staying together in a tight unit.

This HUGE object seemed to &quot;take in&quot; the three bright objects immediately, and started moving at a slower, more lumbered speed and was so big and had so many spot type lights, that it lit up the fog enshrouding it in such a large area around it, that you could tell approximately how large it was, and how slow it moved compared to these tiny lights.

Fast with trails.  Aware of us observing.Noticed a &quot;star&quot; split apart and began watching it join and split several times.  Then noticed several lights  moving thru the sky seeming to chase each other and following the exact turns of the one in front of it.  Moving at a high rate of speed and then slowing to almost hover.  My friend and I watched this for about 40 min and decided to go away from the city lights to get a better view of them. Each smaller light eventually returned to the larger one and it seemed to &quot;catch&quot; it.  The larger obgect matched the speed and trajectory of the smaller object as it merged for just a moment and then returned to its previous position. And then it got weird, I had noticed that they left a slight trail on the retina like a flashbulb dot but just a trace so you could see the lines of their movement.  I began playing this game with them where I&apos;d look into an empty portion of sky and one would fly right into the spot I was looking at, stop and then began zipping around again.

It cast my shadow on the ground as I ran.  Looking back it was moving over the field without a sound casting very bright beams of slightly bluish light.

About 5 miles from our exit I spotted what appeared to be an airplane flying over the hills near the Highway. I noticed that the object was not moving and was sitting staitionary above the hill. The Sun was not up above the surrounding mountains yet at this time and the sky was clear with no clouds. I looked very carefully for a tower that may have been supporting this object like a beacon. I did not see a tower and brought it to the attention of the person driving the car. When I first noticed the object it was giving off a bright white light. As I observed the object it very slowly faded color from white to a very bright red light before it disappeared behind the hill we were going by next to the road. The light reminded of an airport beacon which changes color as it rotates from white to green. the light changed at a much slower rotation, if indeed it was rotating at all. I have seen many beacons and it did not have the same look when it changed. it was as if the light faded out then came back on red increasing in intensity. I cannot speak for the person driving as to his background in observation. I am a trained weather watcher for NOAA and an amatuer Radio operator. I am an amatuer astronomer and very familiar with most types of aircraft. The object if it was above the hill was very small it appeared to be about 200 feet above the top. about the size of an F-16 or smaller. Since we were traveling about 60 MPH then if the object was not above the hill it was moving at a speed which made it appear to be sitting stationary in relationship to us. I looked very carefully at the object and did not see any rotors above the object which would have been associated with Rotary wing aircraft. It could have been a Harrier Jump jet, on training exercise holding position and signaling someone in the distance. but with the gust of winds we had that day, the pilot was doing an exceptional job of holding his craft stationary. when we passed the obstruction to ou! r veiw t he object was gone. If the object was a beacon on a tower and we could not see the original spot when we came around the hill, well the other towers on top of the other hills nearby were plainly visible that morning and I could not see any structure supporting this object and like I said all the other towers were plainly visible.", "((NUFORC Note:  Sounds like a twinkling star.

I had just looked at the clock and it was between 18:10 and 18:13 in the evening.  It was dark and the sky was clear.  A lighted objected caught my eye.  It appeared to be low in the sky, traveling at a high rate of speed from north to south.  The light appeared to be incandescent (white/yellow). What caught my attention was that there was no red/green lights or a flashing on/off light that is common to airplanes.  In the short time that I saw the object, it appeared to have two compartments (all that I could perceive).  The lights in the rear compartment seemed to dim until they went out. After that the front compartment lights went out as if they were switched off.  When the lights were out, I couldn&apos;t see the object anymore.

As one approached, I returned to truck for camera and saw  bright lights in the sky.At 5am, before daylight, my brother-in-law and myself separated to deer hunt on the edge of a very large corn and hay field bordered by a cat-tail marsh and enormous red maple and  white cedar swamp. I saw what I thought were headlights coming from some distance across the field and hurried to reach a hill. I intended to get there ahead of anyone else since it was a choice location to observe the surroundings for deer. Once I arrived at my spot on the 25&apos; hill I sat down to await daylight, my compound bow nearby.Again I noticed the lights toward the east and moving along just over the ground at adistance of several hundred yards, left to right.The two of them were white and appeared to me to be attached to a silent truck or an ATV. As they moved they passed behind brush, became erratic,as though someone was running with handheld flashlights.The lights went out and I assumed whoever it was had reached their destination. Moments later a single light re-appeared, this time rising above the horizon and toward me, I moved to get down from the hill as it grew larger and higher in the sky. I then realized it was nothing I had been thinking it was. At perhaps 20 yards, with it over my shoulder, I tried to put some distance between us. I headed toward my truck and a camera with difficulty in the darkness, As I looked back it was descending, glowing over the marsh, and then there was a silent explosion of bright light as though a wick had burned through the sky and reached a large quantity of flammable material. The sky was clear and the air absolutely still, Once I reached the truck I could again see a low light moving across the field as before. I then saw a bright &quot;star&quot; well over the horizon in the direction I had come from, but, I thought at greater distance. It began descending slowly and I tried to photo it but it faded while I fumbled looking through camera. At about 5:45 am there were again low lights over the field, then two lights side by side in the sky growing in intensity, brighter like two suns, only small. I could now see my brother-in-law and went toward him. The lights went dim until gone- took 5 seconds to disappear in the sky. Daylight was gathering, we watched as more small lights like headlights moved along erratically out in the field, then out of sight.  As soon as it was light enough to make out the landscape, a fog formed, which was a remarkable transformation from the clear pre-dawn. In conclusion, I feel the lower lights were probably &quot;swamp gas&quot;, ignited in the hay field and following a &quot;fuse&quot; back to it&apos;s source under the water in the marsh. As tidy as that is, I&apos;m troubled by the sky lights. My brother was visiting from Vermont that night where he works for the state, he suggested I write an account of my experience that very night, which I have referenced here,in order that my story wouldn&apos;t get confused with other people&apos;s comments, etc.                Background: I have hunted, fished and hiked for 22+ years, I work oudoors before daylight often till after dark,I am a com.fisherman.

Our analysis indicates that the anomalous objects are normal contrails behind jet aircraft preparing to land to the north at Neward, NJ, airport.   The well known UFO investigator/skeptic, Phillip Klass, we have been told, reached the same conclusion from having inspected an identical tape sent to him. Hence, this report of rapture appears to us to be premature.))DAYTIME VIDEO RAPTURE! ANGELS AND UFOS!On 11-11-1999 I went outside to look at the sunset, as I did I saw luminous patches of sky. I went inside to get the 35 mm camera. I came outside and took some shots of the bright lights in the sunset. Now these lights were more like pieces of sky, like sheets. I quickly ran out of film so I went inside to get the videocamera. When I came bacl out there was a sphere type ufo over my neighbors house in the distance. I started to film. While I was filming it another ufo appeared in the frame from nowhere. It appears as a small dot and grows ito a cigar shaped ufo, clouded or encased in mist. The Cigar and the sphere are under fire. There are small  very fast moving spheres running from right to left perfectly horizontal. The two ships fire a weapon at these ultra high speed spheres. Now, these spheres were not visible to the naked eye, only visible when the tape is played back and only clear in a frame by frame view. The  cigar ship that is above and to the left of the atationary sphere spits out a long silver thread shimmering like snail trails. then the snail trail blows up to become another ship. The three form an isoceles triangle. The two cigar ships are changing color from green to red. Upon close examination of the avi file you can see the ship change color as it charges it&apos;s weapon the green flashes are charge up and the red is discharge. Remember I have the videotape proving every word I write. The craft fires a green plasma ball. The green balls of energy deflect the ultra high speed spheres the spheres come in two colors black and white. After a few moments of shooting like crazy the amount of ultra fast spheres decrease. Then Huge patches of a Luminous substance is manifested right out of thin air. These patches are like the ones I first took the photos of. Then several large patches of Luminous &quot;Stuff&quot; gets sucked into the bottom of the extraterrestrial craft from the bottom. Now you must think I am making this up. But I have the tape. It was made with my Son and my Daughter present. In the middle of the tape my wife comes home from work and finds us on the porch with the camera. This is not a joke! This is the most seious footage that has even been acquired. You can see stills here:((URL deleted)) Theere you will also find a copy of the letter sent to the President and Vice President as wellas to all 100 U.S. Senators. These craft have the ability to appear out of nowhere. They do it without warning. They are laying down suppressive fire during some type of extraction process. They are performing some unknown business in our atmosphere. This is an EXTREMELY BIG deal. BUT! If you don&apos;t come to my aid, by viewing and questioning and doing your part. The extraterrestrials that so want to meet us will be even further delayed. It&apos;s that simple! When will we be ready! If you are ready write me.

This proved to be true.When I was young I lived, with my family, next to my grandparents house in Plumstead, London England. We lived facing Plumstead Common and, as my grandparents had a t.v., we used to go next door to watch Wells Fargo on B.B.C. every Friday night. My grandfather used to go over to the Windmill Public House on the far side of the common, in the evening, for a drink. On this evening he arrived home early and told us all that there was a flying saucer over the common. My grandmother thought that he was drunk but my mother, father, sister and I went to the front door of my grandparents house and saw a large, red flying saucer hovering right in front of us - at a height of about thirty feetand at about thirty to fourty yards away. The disk was about fifty feet in diameter at its widest part with a protruded central cabin area which was about twenty five feet in diameter. It had circular windows through which people could be seen and behind them was a central core - about ten feet in diameter. It hovered in front of us for some time and we could clearly see the people - not aliens - moving about inside. It started to move over the house so my sister and I ran through the house to watch it as it flew away but, when we looked - it had gone. The incident was reported in both national and local papers but were either &apos;rubbished&apos; or grossly distorted. I thought that this sighting was as spectacular as seeing a jet aircraft - nothing more or less. No-one had mentioned that UFO&apos;s did not exist and that what we had seen was a figment of our collective imaginations.

The object appeared to be right over the airport. I turned on the ground control radio to listen for any radio traffic about it.We saw the object and thought a plane was in trouble at the airport. We realized it was not a plane but thought it might be a meteor since a shower was expected later that night and the following night. I believe the object fell apart over the airport. The object appeared to be directly over the airport and was travelling at a rather slow speed. A few minutes later someone from Fayette County Emergency Communications Center called our dispatch office and asked if we had a plane go down.

We had been deer hunting all day and were discussing the day&apos;s events when I caught a light out of the corner of my eye.

Observed it through a telescope. Seen a cluster of 15 to 20 disk shaped objects.I am an amateur astronomer. I started observing the night sky with my telescope Saturday night, 12/18/99, around 22:30 pm central standard time. Observing location was SW Houston at my place of residence. At approximately 01:15 am central standard time on 12/19/99 I noticed a object moving across the sky with the naked eye. At first glance it looked like a commercial airliner because the speed was about the same. But there was no sound and no blinking lights.  The light was constant with no fluctuation and was copper/amber in color. The object was coming from the southeast and moving toward the west. I was facing the south and looking up.  The object was at about 75 to 80 degrees.  This made me curious as to what the object was. I swung my telescope around and was able to lock onto the object with my 9X50 finder scope. Then I focused my finder scope.  At that point I could tell the object was not an airplane or jet liner. I could make out multiple disc shaped objects all clustered closely together. At that point I lined up the objects in my Astro-Physics 130 mm telescope.  I had to refocus because I was previously observing the moon. I had to bring the focus in closer because the object was definitely closer to earth. My telescope was set up with a 22mm panoptic eyepiece.  This was giving me about 35 times magnification.  I tracked and observed the object across the sky.  There was 15 to 20 disc-shaped objects. They were like bubbles that had been partially flattened. They were dark and transparent looking in the middle of the discs.  The discs were emitting an amber colored light around the outer edge and it was constant and nonfluctuating.  Some of the objects held a steady position as they moved across the sky while others swayed back and forth. All of the discs were of the same size.  I followed them as far as I could to the west util my view was obstructed by a tree. By then the discs were very dim. The cluster stayed together for the duration of my observation.  After I lost site of the objects, ! I contin ued to observe the night sky for another hour.  There was no other objects sited during that time.  I took my compass and lined it up with the direction my telescope was pointed at the last site of the objects.  The compass reading was 275 degrees.  This is almost due west.

The size of the object was x3 the size of Jupiter and was twinkling the color of the green light in a stoplight. It was probably just a meteor but it was a very cool meteor.see above.", "Bright light resembling bottle rocket or firework travelled from west to east.I had just entered my car in the nursing home parking lot, and as I started to close the door my attention was caught by a bright light appearing through the trees to the left. My first thought was that someone had set off a bottle rocket; then I thought, as it was so bright, that it was a firework.  I got out of the car to listen for the &apos;boom&apos; and began to realize that the &apos;bottle rocket&apos; was on a horizontal trajectory and was not making any noise.  As it travelled overhead I tried hard to make sense of what I was seeing: the light of the leading part was very bright and there seemed to be trails of light off of it, but they did not expand in size the further they got away from the further they got away from the main source of light - they seemed more like dashes. I don&apos;t know how many of these following trails there were - more than one, I am sure.  I can&apos;t judge distance.  It seemed so close.  And it seemed to travel leisurely, unlike the brief blips of shooting stars I have witnessed. The &apos;bottle rocket&apos; continued to the east, disappearing into the trees to the right. Another man who was also in the lot at the same time and I briefly discussed the event with him.  I asked him what he thought he saw.  He said it was a large plane with trails of &quot;fire&quot;.  We both agreed that it made no noise.  I said that it seemed very close. We looked up to where it had been and could see the blinking lights from a far away plane; we agreed that it seemed to be much closer than the plane.

I stopped the car in the middle of the street and ran toward the buildings trying not to loose sight of the object, I lost it.triangular, black , shiny black , from my position looked like flat of unidimensional tilted 6o degrees which allowed me to see the triangular shape.  Floating, no signs of engines, no noise, descending slow, tip of triangle foward.  I thought it was the stealth bomber B17, or maybe the blackbird sr71, but the way it was just suspended in the air and the way it came out of the clouds and desappeard have me thinking to this day.  Most shocking to me was that was flying contrary to the path taken by the planes coming to O&apos;hare Int.  I feared a chrash, there are planes here all the time. We never talked about it till this day.", "large umbrella shape of a Strob light emitting a light every 5-8 seconds apartWe were driving on I90 to spokane for christmas and in the distance there was a bright strobe that when flashed it lit up the entire sky. At first i thought it was a tower, but continued to travel West towards us. It was about the size of your thumb nail (the strobe) as it flashed, couldnt see any shape to any craft.Which flew over our heads. couldnt tell the speed of travel because I was traveling 75 mph on the freeway.

Out of Noble,OK. The report sound&apos;s like one I had seen Dec. 14, 1999.  I never heard anything more on what I saw.  I hope you investigate.  Cause I know I saw what I had reported. Thank you, ((name deleted))((END ADDENDUM))", "I looked up, at about a 165 degree angle, and spotted what appeared to be a silent white radiant elongated diamond shaped object, it was the size of a number two eraser held at arms length, it looked to be two to three miles away and was slowly coming down.  It was flashing &quot;ON&quot; and &quot;OFF&quot; at 4 times a second and was twice as bright as the sun.On August 7, 1999 between approximately 10:35 AM to 10:55 AM (PST) I was sitting down outside for awhile in my front yard facing to the North, when something caught my attention in the corner of my eye.  I looked up, at about a 165 degree angle, and spotted what appeared to be a silent white radiant elongated diamond shaped object, it was the size of a number two eraser held at arms length, it looked to be two to three miles away and was slowly coming down.  It was flashing &quot;ON&quot; and &quot;OFF&quot; at 4 times a second and was twice as bright as the sun.  At first I thought it was a piece of aluminum paper, so I watched it because it being as twice as bright as the sun. I continued observing, for it was slowly come down towards me, while it was flashing &quot;ON&quot; and &quot;OFF&quot;.  When the object dropped behind the house across the street from me.  I thought if it was a piece of aluminum paper that that would be it, but it was not so.  Because now this object appeared to the right of the house across the street, to me this object appeared to be two or three blocks away.  The object continued moving slowly to the right and up, until it was an inch above the house next door.  At that point, the object stopped and stayed stationary for about one or two minutes, still flashing &quot;ON&quot; and &quot;OFF&quot;.  The object then started to move up and to the left away from me, just as slowly as it came down, all the while flashing &quot;ON&quot; and &quot;OFF&quot;.  At this point I knew now that this object was not a piece of aluminum paper, but a vehicle of some type.  The object continued to go up higher and higher into the sky, until it was two or three miles away.  It then stopped and stayed stationary, all the while continuing to flash &quot;ON&quot; and &quot;OFF&quot;.  A minute or two later I then saw a jetliner coming from the right towards object and when the jetliner came to within the distance of my fist, held at arms length, the object stopped flashing and the light went out.  When the jetliner pass the object, the distance of my fist held at arms length, the object began ! flashing again &quot;ON&quot; and &quot;OFF&quot;, again 4 times a second.  A minute or so later another jetliner came from the left towards the object and when the jet later came to within the distance of my fist, held at arms length, the object stopped flashing and the light went out.  When the jetliner passed the object, the distance of my fist held at arms length, the object began flashing again &quot;ON&quot; and &quot;OFF&quot;, again 4 times a second.  The object then continued up and away from me till I no longer could see it.  Total viewing time was about 22 minutes.  The skis were clear and no visible winds.  I live in Westminaster, California and live seven miles away from MacArthur airport and see airport traffic almost every day for the last fourteen years.  I was enlisted in the United State Air Force for five years, stationed on five different bases including one base over seas, been to several air shows and familiar with all kinds of aircraft.", "About 9:15pm on June 25, 1999,  I saw bright green balls coming from the island across from us.  I told my father and he saw thm too.  They would come singley, and then in multiples numbers- and sometimes appeared to be in a formation.  They were going in a north to northearstly direction.  Then came in Southeastely direction towards our island.  They were in a formation and would travel towards the trees but would move to miss hitting them.  Then went over the cabin anout 12-15 feet above.  They were about 9 inches in size and were pulsating inside.  We could see that it appeared they were exhausting something.  This lasted approximately 25 minutes and we saw about 75 of them.  I might add that we had stormy weather that afternoon.. However it wasn&apos;t  storming at this time((NUFORC Note:  Report from 1st witness.  We spoke with these witnesses on several occasions, and they seemed quite credible.

Between 1:15 A.M. and 1:20 A.M., I observed 3 pale orange lights in a perfect triangle. At first, I thought they were 3 meteors. I first noticed them just behind Orion&apos;s belt. They were moving at a constant rate of speed due west. They left NO tail. The formation DID NOT change shape in any form. At arm&apos;s length, there was about 1/2 inch between the lights. If they were at extreme altitude, at the speed they were moving, there should have been a sonic boom. At lower altitude, if an airplane, I would have heard the engine sound and didn&apos;t. I watched them for about 15 seconds until they faded from sight just south of the bright star about 40 degrees to the west of Orion. They moved this 40 degree distance in approximately 15 seconds.

When I lift my head up and was looking towards the sky. I noticed this bright object in the air.  At firset I though it was a couple of planes. But to my surprise it was a UFO floating in the air. It looked like a mountain of diamonds brightly shinning. It was floating down. Under the bottom of the objcet it had like a black shadow. I couldn&apos;t believe my eyes.  I ran downstair to my friends house and told her to come outside and to see this UFO. By the time she came out the UFO was still there and she saw it.  It was floating down and going behind a building. I notice that it was alot of plans flying around the area. Some planes ere flying very low also their where flying in a circle.on Sunday, December 12, 1999 at appriomately around 8:10 pm I went outside on my patio to take my mop out.  I drop some matches on the ground I bend down to pick them up. When I lift my head up and notice this bright thing in the sky. At first I thought it was a bunch of planses of something.  I looked again and I notice that it was not.  It was a bright around cirle of lights floating in the sky. The more I looked it looked like a custer of diamonds. It was bright ligths and had an oval shape on top.  and under the bottom of the round circle. It look like a black round shadow under it.  At first I could believe it.  I ran down to my firend house and  told her to come outside and to see this UFO. I told her to hurray, hurray. When she came outside we ran to the area and I pointed the UFO to her. It was floating and getting lower. As it got lower it went behind this building and we could see it again.  While all this was going on I notice all these planes flying around in a circle.  Some the planes were flying very low. some were moving very fast. The UFO was in my area of town for about 5 to 8 minutes. But the planes kept on flying around in the sky. My friend called her daughter boyfriend out of the house to show him, but by the time he came out it had dissapeared. But the planes were still circlieg around the the area. We stood out for about 40 minutes waiting to see if we could see it again.  We even went driving around to see if the could try to find the location where it may have landed. I went back upstairs and try to use my computer and it was not working right.  The next day when I went to work the computers on the job was nothing working right.  Another friend i was just talking and she mention to me that her computers on the job was down for some reason.", "Spent a sunday in July 1967 at Crystal Beach with friends, at dusk I spotted what appeared to be a speed boat in the Gulf heading toward shore.It was not what it first appeared to be.On a Sunday in Mid July 1967 I spent the day at the Beach with 10 other people between 8 years and 19 years of age, the sky&apos;s were cloudy and we pretty much had the beach to ourselves. I was 19 years old and the oldest. We drove to the Beach in 2 cars, when dusk was approaching, 4 of the group decided to go into Galveston to go dancing, they left in one car. Crystal Beach is located on the Bolivar Peninsula off of the road that connects the mainland to the Galveston Ferry, which takes cars to Galveston. We (7 of us) started driving on the sand watching the waves as the sun was dropping, 2 of the girls were sitting on top of the hood catching the breeze as we drove. We were in a brand new chevy, listening to the radio. While watching the sea as the sun went uner the horizon my attention was caught by what appeared to be a speed boat heading straight towards land, it moved the way a speed boat moves on water, the color at first was silverish, then it turned to amber, I told the others to look at it, at some point as we watched, the driver and I realized that the object was moving far too fast, and headed straight at us, at this point he had stopped the car, I told  the 2 girls to get in the car and we proceeded to drive out between the beach houses on one of the dirt roads that connects the main road to the beach, it is a very short distance, it was going on nine oclock p.m. I was sitting front seat passenger and watching behind us from the open window, I was startled to watch the object closing on us far too quickly and it was changing colors. As we made the turn onto the main road the object had caught up with us, I can&apos;t discribe how fast this took place, the radio stopped playing. It then proceeded to tail us, I won&apos;t go into what was happening between the occupants of the car, however it was not any type of craft that any of us had seen before, and it was obviously a flying saucer, which was supposed to not really exist, we were scared (real understatement here) Since I was the oldest everyone was l! ooking t o me for answers, I was praying. Suddenly the driver pulls over to the side of the road slowing down and coming to a stop, I was dumbfounded with that action and asked for an explanation, he silently showed me that the key was locked in the ignition, as I watched him trying to turn the key I noticed the car lights had also gone off. We carefully told the others that the saucer had taken the cars power, to stay calm, we rolled the windows up and locked the doors. The craft was hovering directly to the rear, very low, and clearly visible. I was watching it through the rear window. The craft had 2 decks and a dome on top, all 3 levels had port holes. At the center between the 2 large decks was a wide rim which held panels of colored lights, these lights rotated around the craft constantly. The craft was translucent, glowed with light, the paneled lights were green, blueish white, and orange, the panels were rectangular in shape, the colors were pale, but seemed to pulsate as they moved around showing more vivid color back to pale color. I could not see inside the port holes, the glass was thick and dull looking and crusted around the edges, the craft had rivets at the deck joints. I was watching closly for activity and trying to keep the kids quiet and calm. I started to realize that I was becoming hypnotized by the lights going around and I forced myself to stop watching them, and told the others to not watch the colored lights. The car then started, the driver took off immediately, the craft again tailed us as we drove down the road, it tailed us right up to the turn off that would take us back to civilization and I-10 East, and then it veered out to the right (top of craft tilted) and was gone, it left a streak even though it was night time, here is a strange part of this encounter, the car radio came back on, and the DJ announced its 12 midnight. The loss of 3 hours startled all 7 of us, we just could not believe it, it had seemed to have lasted less then 30 minutes. We started to report it, then decide! d we wou ld be branded as crazy. I am reporting it after all these years because this is the first time I have found a place to report it. I would like to talk to an investigator, if I can be emailed a number I will call. I have some questions and can give other details about my observation.", "witnessed very bright light,it rose into the sky very large,the size of a football field. It had lights placed in a sporadic fashion on the bottom and made no sound as it moved toward us. It banked to the right and was gone in a few seconds going toward the Olympic Mountain Range over the Puget Sound. We spoke to the Police Officers that witnessed it shortly after at the Police Station. We were advised by the Police Department to report the sighting to the Natl. UFO Hotline which we did. It began when we heard the Officer on a Police Scanner call in about a very bright light in the sky above his car in a area that was at the time being developed. We left and went into tne vicinity and witnessed it from about a mile from his locatin. He was joined by another officer. I am writing in response to hearing other sightings recently that seem to be very close to what we witnessed.AROUND July 1978 WE WERE AT MY PARENTS HOUSE AND HAPPENED TO HEAR ON A POLICE SCANNER THAT A POLICE OFFICE IN LYNNWOOD WA. WAS REPORTING SEEING A VERY, VERY BRIGHT LIGHT IN THE SKY. HE WAS ABOUT A MILE FROM DOWNTOWN LYNNWOOD WHEN HE SAW A LIGHT THAT BEGAN TO DESCEND FROM THE SKY. HE CALLED TO REPORT IT AND THEN REQUESTED ANOTHER OFFICER JOIN HIM. AT THE TIME WE WERE IN EDMONDS AND LEFT TO GO TO THE VICINITY THEY WERE. DRIVING INTO DOWNTOWN WE DECIDED TO GO UP ON A HILL THAT IS ACROSS TOWN (MAYBE A MILE) FROM WHERE THE OFFICERS WERE. WE SAW A VERY BRIGHT LIGHT THAT WAS STATIONARY IN THE SKY AND WATCHED IT UNTIL IT BEGAN TO MOVE ACROSS THE SKY TOWARD THE DIRECTION WE WERE OBSERVING FROM. THE LIGHT THEN BECAME A VERY LARGE TRIANGULAR OBJECT THAT SEEMED TO HAVE ALMOST SOMEWHAT ROUNDED SIDES TO IT. IT CONTINUED OUR DIRECTION, IT APPEARED TO BE AT LEAST AS LARGE AS A FOOTBALL FIELD. IT MADE NO NOISE AND HAD LIGHTS THAT WERE POSITIONED IN AN ODD WAY.  DO NOT RECALL THE LIGHTS AS HAVING COLOR. IT QUICKLY BANKED TO THE RIGHT AND WITHIN A FEW 2-3 SECONDS IT DISSAPEARED OUT OVER THE PUGET SOUND TOWARD THE OLYMPIC MOUNTAIN RANGE. WE SPOKE BRIEFLY WITH THE OFFICERS THE THE LYNNWODD POLICE STATION AFTERWARD AND THEN WE WERE ADVISED TO CALL THE UFO HOTLINE AND MAKE A REPORT WHICH WE DID.

Out of nowhere, neither ascending nor descending, a circular &quot;thing&quot; appears - it simply just appeared. In appearance, the &quot;thing&quot; has the gray/white color that lightning has, and it appears as if to be glowing in an electric manner whereas the edges are very jagged and leave the same impression and feeling that electric sparks do although this has no variation in color but for gray/white colors. As far as the contours and shapes go, there is no shadow or light falling on the &quot;thing&quot; itself, so it does not look three-dimensional. Instead, it is a &quot;flat&quot; two-dimensional, yet perfectly circular, &quot;thing&quot; that appears right in front of our eyes at an unapproximated distance. However, an approximated, yet unqualified, guess is that it is is 20 seconds at 45mph down the road. Its altitude can only be estimated from seeing it by the top of the highest pinetree in the pinetree-horizon. It does not do justice, though, becauseits size is much greater and very hard to estimate. Looking at it, its radius would be approximately 1/4 inches measured by the eye, which is corrected by contact lenses that were in at the moment. For the record, I see an optician every six months. The &quot;thing&quot; traveled in a very controlled line to the east without leaving a tail of light, smoke, or other trace after itself. It did not move in anything such as a sinusoidal wave and it was neither ascending ! nor descending. It was simply a straight line to the east - not coming from the west, but appearing in a spot that would make a straight line between my eyes and the &quot;thing.&quot; As the grande finale, it quickly disappeared around the house-corner after being observerved for less than 1 second. I ran around the corner but saw nothing, then to the front of the building, but saw nothing there either. Note that although it was not near the building, it was at such as angle that it disappeared &quot;around the corner.&quot; Final notes from the characteristics checkboxes: The aura or haze around the object only apply if the whole thing is considered a &quot;solid jagged glow&quot; as described above. It left no trail, it had no lights (it were a huge light itself). It emitted no objects or beams. It never changed color, landed, or made a sound. No other aircraft was spotted, and no electrical or magnetic effects were experienced - we were standing outside in the grass with no electrical dependencies around.", "((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch out of Vandenberg AFB at this time.))Saw a Very Bright Light Moving slowly/silently for 30secs. it had a very large fan-like projection of light behind it. when it disappeared a large blue glow remained for 5 minI was cooking dinner for my Son and I when his friends, who were playing outside started yelling hey its a Ufo!!!!  So we ran to see.  we saw a bright white light about the size of a quarter or a little bigger..at arms length.. it was projecting a big V shape of light behind it like this &gt;o   it floated silently toward the neighborhood for about 30 sec before it disappeared behind a cloud.. we all expected to see it again as the cloud was quite small, but it was gone.. no Light no sound.. nothing just gone.  Then we noticed a Blue glow where the big (&gt;) of light had been it was a florecnty dark blue color and it gradually faded over a 5 min period.

Craft was randomly shining light onto ground below it.Driving northbound on I-75 towards Lima, Ohio. We were just south of mile marker 117. Conditions were foggy and dark. Noticed mirror sphere like object moving slowly through a field just east of the highway. Object became noticed when the ground beneath it was lit up. There was no visible source on the craft as to where the light was coming from. The object was noticed as mirror like due to the fact that the ground was being reflected off of it when the light would activate. Unknown on the exact distance of the craft but it was fairly close. I pulled onto the shoulder where I could observe the object better. The object was moving southbound very slowly. The light would activate randomly and had no particular pattern. The light was no particular color and you could detect movement by the reflection off of the object while the light was on. When there was no light from the craft you could barely see it due to the fog but you could make out faintly the outline of the top portion. Traffic was sparse and other cars/trucks passed but no one had stopped. After a few minutes the passenger of my vehicle rolled down his window. We could hear no sounds but could still see the object. It them simultaneously lit up and area of trees to the north of us and the area where we were parked on the shoulder. The lights went off and the object left at a moderate speed north bound over the tree area it had just lit up. You could actually see the fog flow around it as it moved and thats when we got a good look at it. It had no visible windows or lights on its surface. It was smooth and shiny.

It then started to fly a little faster and started going eastward towards San Bernardino, it became hard for us to continue following it, and unfortunenately we didn&apos;t have a camera with us to prove to anyone that we did see this.

I stood in the courtyard of our appartment complex and snapped 3 fotos of the Moon in about 10 seconds.  I viewed each shot on the digital display, on the back of my camera, just to mak sure the shot was good, and then immediately took another shot.  I was unaware of anything in the photos but the Moon and the sky.  It was only after downloading them into my computer, and viewing them, was I able to detect a strange green dot in each of the images.  I use a viewing program called &quot;ACDSee&quot; that really puts up the images fast, so, after noticeing the green dot in each one, I clicked on each image in succession, and could detect that whatever it was, it moved from left to right and then back left again.  I then decided to enlarge and enhance them to try to detect what the object actually looked like.  It turned out to look somewhat like a marker-bouy, possibly hexagonal at the bottom, and with a center that protruded upward from the larger haxagonal platform at the bottom.  After enhancement, the object in the 3rd image seems to have a yellow luminance on the tip of the protrusion, but the object definately has a green appearance overall.

Further east toward the Chicago skyline and in the center of the sky I saw what looked like a bright green fireball following by a trail of red.  There seemed to be several red balls in the tail.  The bright green object was at least 1/3 of the total length of the object.  The objects moved together train-like and didn&apos;t seem to change distance.  It moved northeast across the sky.

The light landed at Holloman AFB ever so slowly decellerating to a stop on the airstrip. As the light decended there were 3 stealth fighter jets circling at approximately a 14 mile radius. All 3 jets landed directly after the event.As we were leaving the White Sands Natl. monument at approximately  19:15 pm mst. after watching the solstice full moon rise, I noticed due east a  piercing white light, about half the size of my little finger held at arms length, decending from approx. 5000 ft. vertically very slowly toward the middle of Holloman AFB. I stopped the car, grabbed the binoculars, and watched the object decend for approx. 2 minutes. 2 others got out of the car and 2 others watched from within the car. I noticed 3 circling stealth f-117 nighthawks circling the light in an approx.14 mile diameter circle. The object was approx 7 miles away and through the binoculars looked just like a very bright light with no stobes, beacons , or any other kind of aircraft type navigational lights. As the object neared the ground I noticed the underside of the light changing to a mellow yellow-gold glow. I then passed the binoculars off to another friend. The light did not seem to stop and hover, it decended in a very deliberate yet exponetially slower manner until it landed at what appeared to be the middle of the airfield. I could not resolve a shape to the intense light, yet at the same distance I had no problem resolving the very dim navigational lights outlining the circling stealth jets. The light could have been a helicopter with some sort of amazingly bright battlefield night light, or an aircraft with a super set of landing lights approaching head on from my position, but from my perspective it definitely looked like a vertical decent of a very bright star with no discernable outlines of any solidity. I could hear the stealth as they flew overhead, but there was no sound from the starlike object. The 2 of us outside with the binoculars were impressed  and amazed that our airforce has come so far with their technology, the others observing from within and outside the car didn&apos;t think much of bright lights descending into an airbase and dismissed our awe as silliness.

It was about 19:05, and we had crossed over the Adams-Allen county line about 4 miles ago. I had heard about the meteor shower expected to start that night, so I&apos;m trying to look at the sky frequently. About that time, I noticed a bright green light about 10-15 degrees above the horizon, at about my 10 o&apos;clock position. From the angle that US 27 runs, this would have been about due west of me. I thought it was too low to be a meteor, but kept glancing at it, thinking it was probably an airplane. After a few seconds, I could start to see a short, green tail below and to the left. This got my interest, so I kept watching it. It appeared to be moving in our general direction, because it was getting higher in the sky and I could see more of the tail. Thinking this was going to be one spectacular meteor, I slowed down and pulled the car over. By this time, we had been watching the fireball for about 30 seconds, and it was now so high in the sky that I had to lean forward against the steering wheel and look almost straight up to see it. The tail was bright green, and took up a good 30 degrees of arc. It wasn&apos;t nearly as bright as the fireball, which was an intense white-green light, but it was bright enough to be easily seen. The tail was also as wide as the fireball, and had a cluster of about 5 bright greenish-white points of light in it, immediately behind the fireball. Trailing farther back in the tail were about 3 more lights, not grouped together. All of these were about the same color, and were bright enough to be easily seen in the tail, but the fireball was by far the brightest. I was stunned enough by what I was seeing that I didn&apos;t pay as much attention to some of the details as I should have. For example, the exact number lights in the tail, their motion relative to the fireball and each other, the exact time or duration, or the exact spot I pulled over at. I had n! ever see n anything like this, and kept thinking that it was moving awfully slow for a meteor. We sat and watched, discussing what we were seeing, while it moved farther down the sky toward my 4 o&apos;clock position, or about due east of me. As it got closer to the horizon, I noticed a gradual color change from the intense green-white to an orange color. Also, the fireball and tail were much dimmer and hard to see now. The trailing lights were all we could see as they became dimmer and darker orange, until I lost sight of them about 10-15 degrees above the horizon. I wasn&apos;t sure if the change in color and intensity were due to the meteor burning out, or if I was simply looking through too much atmosphere to see it well. From start to finish, I estimate the whole event took around a minute, maybe a minute and 15 seconds. My son saw most of this also, and was able to describe it in good detail to my wife later that night.

They said that it had been 30 minutes since I last talked, and it had been only a minute or so.

((name deleted))", "A nighttime sighting of an arrow or triangle shaped craft, which moved very slowly, almost hovering, with no noise.The living room in my parents apartment, where I was at the time, faced east, or slightly northeast. I was lying on the floor watching television, when above the hills to the northeast I noticed a far off light, or lights. This was not at all unusual, as we lived near an airport, and planes flew near us all the time. While I was watching television, I noticed that the lights appeared to be getting ever so brighter a little at a time. They were obviously moving toward me as I watched them, yet at the same time it was taking an inordinate amount of time to do so. As the lights got gradually brighter, it was obvious theat they were moving toward us at an extremely slow rate. I wondered about this, and remember thinking to myself that if this was an airplane, it was going unbelievably slow. The time was about 8:00 pm. I finally got up and went to the window for a closer look, and although you could tell it was moving toward you, movement at all was almost impossible to detect. When the object finally made it&apos;s way close enough to be overhead, I went out to take a look at it. As it passed overhead, we noticed a distinct &quot;V&quot; shape to the formation. Again, it moved at an incredibly slow pace. The best way I can describe it is to say that if you look at the minute hand of a clock, it is difficult to actually see it move. You can if you stare closely, but if you look at the clock, then look away and look back, you will notice that the hand has moved. It was alnost the same with these lights. Movement was almost undetectable while staring at it, but after a few minutes, you noticed it had moved. Anyway, I remember commenting at the time that I heard no sound at all, not even a hovering noise. Some people say it was light aircraft in formation, but I really doubt it. There was absolutely no &quot;play&quot; in between the lights. In other words, When airplanes fly in formation, there is some variation in movement between them as they go along. There was no evidence of that at all. One truly had the feeling that this was one structure. Also, there was no sound, and while going overhead, it practically hovered. We watched the lights as they moved southwest, and then lost sight of them. Thinking it was over, we went about out business. At about 9:20 pm, I left the house to meet a friend of mine. I walked out of the apartment and up the driveway, when I was visually struck by what you see in figure 3 in my illustration. As I turned up the driveway, the lights were right in front of me (and above). I don&apos;t know if I can relate the size of it, or how wide it spanned, in writing. It was no longer a &quot;V&quot; shape, which could be attributed to the angle at which I was viewing it. I actually had to turn my head from side to side to see it all. It was huge. I immediately ran back to the house to alert my parents. As near as I can figure, based on the distance away our apartment was, to run back inside, tell my parents, and return with my father, would have taken about 45 seconds to a minute. In this time, when I looked up again, I saw NO discernible movement in the lights. Thay seemed to be right where they were when I first ran back inside. This again made me realize they were not airplanes. My dad and I watched them for about 15-20 minutes more, as they traveled in a northerly direction. As they moved, we were in a position to view what would have been the &quot;back&quot; of it. I then noticed that as it made it&apos;s way north, the light (or &quot;a&quot; light) from the back shot forward in a bee line to the front of the formation. Then the lights slowly proceeded north until out of sight.", "saw 6 to 7 white round obects with green glow going,.. across the sky towrds the East, not in a fast pace, but slow...the objects had tails like heat emitting from them,.not all the same size.The sky was clear and crisp, able to see everything, stars included.was driving past high school when something caught my eye. I looked to the left uf me towas driving home from the mall when something to the eft of me caught my eye. I glanced up to notice 6to 7 round shaped objects,each a different size and had a green glowing emition from the front of them leaving a trail behind them,Paula Arche at which I thought might be firworks, but thought it was odd since this was November. The &quot;fireworks did not go straight up, they went across the sky in an eastern direction. I watched this sight for at least 3 to 5 minutes when they went out of sight.", "Very bright white light, moving at approx. mach 2 or 3, in a northerly to north easterly direction, along a perfectly straight line, approximatly parallel with the horizen and also trailing a short sparkly tail with perhaps some greenish light in it.  As the light receeded, and very quickly dimmed, several individual, smaller lights became visible in the tail.  These lights were spaced (in quite significant length) out along the line of trajectory, and also disappeared very quickly.   I thought of the comet Shoemaker Levy as it broke up before it impacted Jupiter, when I saw the individual lights trailing out in what seemed like a great distance.  I cannot understand why these individual lights were not immediately visible, when I first saw the object.  They only appeared when the initial bright light had faded.  There were perhaps 3 or 4 individual lights trailing behind, with perhaps the space between the last and second last light larger than the space between the second last and third last light, etc. I was in my car travelling north along Campground Road when I saw it. Earlier this Fall I saw a very similar bright light, travelling in the about the same direction, at about the same speed which at that time, I dismissed as fire works as I only saw it for perhaps one or two seconds as it passed overhead.", "While driving, saw an unusually large bright triangular light in the distant sky; upon slowing, it appeared above as a grouping of bright lights.While driving on Route 341 between Kent, CT and Warren, CT, I noticed an unusually large and bright white light in the sky above a low-lying hill/mountain located to the north.  The sky was still somewhat light from the daylight. I continued to drive, glancing at the light for a few minutes, at which point I realized that it was too large to be a star and/or a planet (and probably still too early in the evening to even make out a star/planet).  The light was shaped like a triangle with rounded corners, and there was a slight illumination around the outside. It was not moving, but stationery. As I continued to drive, I pondered what it could possible be, thinking that it might be a weather balloon or perhaps a helicopter of some sort.  I slowed my car to really focus in on it.  And then just stopped.  All of sudden, it was directly above my car, clearly visable from the driver&apos;s side window.  The movement from the distance was undiscernable, and as to whether I really saw movement or not is beyond me. The object that was above me was made up of maybe 10 or 11 very large bright white lights -- kind of like klieg lights -- maybe six of which arced around one side of it, and the others staggering away from the arc -- I believe these ones were a bit smaller.  Almost like an arrow with a rounded point. (It would be best to show it drawn.) The lights were so bright, that it was impossible to see what they were attached to.  It lingered above me in the sky.  I turned off the radio and unrolled the window to see if I could hear anything.  There was no sound.  Realizing that I was stopped in the middle of the road (dangerous), I continued on the road for about 15 seconds to the nearest intersection, where I pulled off and immediately got out of the car.   Whatever it was that I had seen was no where to be seen.  After studying the sky for a minute or so, I got back in the car and drove back in the direction I had come from to see if I could find it again.  Nothing.  Continued on my way (stopping in the town of L! itchfiel d) to meet a friend of mine in Waterbury for the evening.  While telling her about what I had seen, the color left her face.  During the afternoon, she had received a call (she thought it was around 3pm or 3:30pm) at the newspaper from a male who had witnessed a similar event with a friend while leaving the Home Depot.  For natural reasons, this added validity to what I had experienced.  This morning (Monday, January 10), I contacted the FAA, who directed me to the UFO reporting center. If you would like to contact me, I have provided my work phone number (thus, a collect call would probably not go over real well...).  I would be more than willing to speak to someone at my expense if a mutually agreeable time could be arranged.", "Small 3 foot gray cone passed in front of my police car hovering a foot off the ground. Another officer was with me. It was on a gravel road in the country.", "SEEN IN BROAD DAYLIGHT- large craft that looked like two pie plates facing each other with a short cylinder in between, yellow and orange...I was sitting in history class in the eighth grade (four years ago) when I happened to glance out the window and see a large object about 50 yards in diameter floating over my neighborhood in the northwestern suburbs of Austin. It looked to be about half a mile away and moving slowly at a speed of 20 to 30 mph. It was only about 50 feet off the ground so I know that others must have seen it as well. The top and bottom pie plate-shaped portions of the craft were orange and the center cylindrical portion was yellow. I don&apos;t think it was metallic because I couldn&apos;t see any kind of a shine (and the sun was very bright at the time with no cloud cover at all). I blinked a few times to make sure I wasn&apos;t seeing things and then turned to one of my classmates to see if I could get another witness.

I looked for a spot to watch the meteor shower. I drove up a dark road north of Tucson, in the mountains looking down into the valley. Approx twelve other people were present, including a few students from Univ of Arizona. Sometime after 11 I heard someone say (not shout) &quot;what is that?&quot;. I looked to the east and saw three huge bright lights heading in our direction. As the craft banked, it was clear that it was a solid, triangle-shaped object. As throughout the night you could occasionally see planes flying towards Tucson Int&apos;l Airport, it was easy to get an approximation of the size. It was at least twice the size of a large commercial airline, and probably three times the size. Without a doubt, it is the largest aircraft I have ever seen. As the craft passed by, it made NO SOUND. This was not a trick of the wind as you could hear other planes all night long. Approx five minutes after the craft passed, three military planes passed overhead in loose formation, heading in the general direction (east to west) of the first craft. Five minutes after that, three more jets passed over in a tight formation moving fast and in the exact direction of the original craft. Several people had to plug their ears when the second group of three passed. I am an executive level individual, which I only tell you to hopefully help validate what this report states. If I were asked, I would think that what I saw was a large military transport of some sort. I know the size is accurate since there was plenty to which to make comparisons. It was the only aircraft to emit no noise that night. It made a graceful arc in front of our location, so the shape was easy to see. I would judge the speed as similar to a jumbo jet while landing (ie it seems they are going slower than they really are). I had a hard time finding this report format, so this is a bit dated. If someone would like additional info, it is ok to call or e-mail me. Anyone who states these craft do not exist does not know what he or she is talking about. I am not saying it was aliens or anything like that, but the craft is there. Thank you.", "Green light moves at high speed across the sky.While driving West on the EC Row highway (in Windsor), between 1:40 am and 1:50 am, we spotted a bright green light above the highway.

We also exclude it from being a falling star (green color).", "The object was was a cross between a sphere and a disk.  It was very bright.

Being an amateur astronomer, I was out stargazing like usual. I immediately noticed an unusual object on the eastern horizon, it was approximately a magnitude -2 and yellow in appearence. It was very out of place. Having once lived next to an airforce bombing range, it reminded me of a flare dropped by a military aircraft. It slowly rose above the horizon heading straight over me, heading due west.  As it approached I realized it could not be a flare as flares do not travel from horizon to horizon. Upon my realization that it was not a flare, aircraft, or satellite and that it was something I have never observed, I retrieved my binoculars. By the time it was directly overhead I could see that it was two individual lights {approximately 1/8 to 1/4 of an inch apart at arms length} with the aid of 10 x 50 binoculars I could see a 3rd light slightly ahead and 1/8 of the size of the two outer most lights. As the object headed towards the western horizon the two outer most lights appeared flicker once about every five seconds. It had no navigation lights, made no sound and took approximately five to seven minutes to travel from the eastern horizon to the western horizon. It did not fade out of sight, it just disappeared below the western horizon.", "Single craft, only one bright blue white light that flashed every 2-3 seconds, illuminating entire craft.  Visible until disappeared on horizonTravelling from Cheney to George, Wa, I was awakened by my stepfather (who was driving) at approximately 12:45 a.m.  He said jokingly that there was a UFO outside my window.  A bright blue-white flashing object appeared coming from the west, parallel to the freeway. I estimate it was 2000-4000 above us, moving at barely subsonic speed.  There were no green or red marking lights, only the flashing light.  As it went nearly directly overhead, each time it flashed, I could make out the shape of the craft.  The flash came directly from the center of mass of the object.  The easiest way to describe it is to (no joke) start with a mental picture of the Batman searchlight image, then make the &quot;wings&quot; a little thinner and angle them back another 20-30 degrees.  There appeared to be a pointed projection where the &quot;head&quot; would be and it continued towards the rear like half of a pencil thin fuselage might be attached to the integral &quot;wings&quot;.  Then halfway out, on each side were similar projections, front and rear of the &quot;wings&quot; and again at the tip.  I think there were 5 in all: one center, two midway, two at tips. The brightness was such that it would be equivalent to several parking lot searchlights combined: several million candlepower!  We joked about it for 30 seconds or so, I looked out the back window, and it flashed brightly until it disappeared below the horizon to the east.  Presumably it was headed for the air force base near Spokane.  There must have been others that noticed it, as there was still quite a bit of traffic on the freeway.  We heard nothing, but at 75 mph, wind noise is significant.  The abscence of normal marker lights was strange. I am a soil scientist.  I read quite a bit and know a little bit about aircraft-not too much.  This did not look quite like the &quot;flying wing&quot; (B-something or other) that is commonly talked about.  Maybe other descriptions will help you piece this puzzle together.  Hope this helps.

This apartment was adjacent to a house in a residential neighborhood, 3 blocks north of Central Avenue.  The moon was either full or nearly so.  This area of the city more or less overlooks the city, at least the beautiful Sandia Mountains can be seen from this address, and on a moonlit night, appear as a clear and distinct outline.  We had exited the car and were walking to the house when we saw the disk or saucer shaped craft traveling completely silently from west to east in a straight line, at a constant speed, and without pause.  As we observed the craft, us looking directly south, the craft was probably 30 to 35 degrees from our zenith, and was rotating counter clockwise looking from underneath.  I would estimate that the time required for a complete rotation was about 7 to 8 seconds.  The craft bottom was flat or a rounded form close to flat with no light. As a matter of fact, there was no lights on the craft with the exception of the port holes.  The sides seem to rise from the bottom at an angle of about 60 degrees to the horizontal and were the same around the circumference of the of the craft.  I would estimate that there were about 12 port around the circumference of the craft.  The distance was approximately 1/4 mile or perhaps a little more.  If there had been someone looking out of the port hole, we would have been able to clearly see them and wave to them.  We are not talking some distant light in the sky.  Top 1/3rd to 1/4th of the side seemed to rise to the top of the craft at an angle of about 45 degrees from the vertical.  I could not see the top of the craft.  In the early morning hours, at this location in the city, things were very quiet.  We heard no noise whatsoever. It floated quietly by and into the distance, over the Sandia Mountains. Some time later we were spending an evening with another couple and we shared this experience with them.  As it turns out, the wife had been leaving work at a nursing home on the east side of Albuquerque, and had seen this same craft on the same night.  So, there you have it, my one and only definite experience with a UFO.  None of us shared this experience with anyone; not police, government, air force, nor anyone else, except occasionally with friends, when conversation would drift into this area.  I have always felt very fortunate to have had this experience, and I remember it almost as clearly now, as I did the next day after it happened.  I just heard Peter Davenport on Art Bell&apos;s show( the very end),  and I felt inspired to share this experience. I just felt that this experience was &quot;my experience&quot;, and it was never important that anyone verify it, or agree with me, or even know that it happened.", "This was large.

It appeared to be a dark grey shape, like a wing, just a bit lighter than the sky.  Perhaps it was a B-2?All the object did was fly across the sky.  I was observing from a point about 1 mile west and slightly south of the Ohio State University. It took about 15 seconds. I didn&apos;t hear any noise. Though it was shaped like a wing (flying wing/boomerang/triangle are ways to describe it), and it was dark grey overall, there were lighter markings as well (lighter grey specks) -- perhaps camoflage paint?

He may have meant to type 18:00.  PD))", "An arc-shaped object, moving at possibly a high rate of speed, was seen moving from overhead to south. The object was almost invisible, but seemed to be reflecting ambient light either from ground lights or from the eclipsed moon, as the color was almost that of the eclipsed moon.At about 10:22 CST, my brother-in-law and I were outside in his backyard. We had been observing the lunar eclipse through his telescope, but having become bored with that, we turned the scope on M42 in the constellation of Orion. I had already located M42, my brother-in-law was in the process of changing the lens to a higher power while I was observing the constellation and waiting. I noticed movement above me. Looking directly overhead, I saw what I first took to be an atmospheric disturbance, like a vortex of air. The night was exceedingly clear and full of stars, without much ambient ground light, and there was no wind. However, the leading edge (as this was the direction it was moving) of the object or vortex was faintly illuminated by a light of nearly the same color as the eclipsed moon (reddish-brown). It was almost invisible, and for a moment, I doubted what I saw, thinking perhaps it was a floater in my eye. I asked my brother-in-law to look, and he immediately spotted the object and exclaimed &quot;what is that?&quot; The object, as I said, was an arc shape, about 90 degrees of a full circle, with a relative size of a baseball held at arm&apos;s length. Within the arc, there was no apparent blocking of the starfield, such as there would have been had the object been spherical or disk-shaped and reflecting light on its leading edge or underside. It moved very quickly from overhead to between Sirius and the constellation of Orion, toward the southern horizon, when it seemed to pass beyond our range of vision. There was no sound, and no wind. I would guess that it was visible no more than six seconds. In addition, the arc shape did not remain constant, as it would if it were the leading edge or underside of a spherical or disk-shaped object. It seemed to flow, not-unlike the way a line of geese or ducks flow and waver as they fly. My brother-in-law, who has better eyesight than I do, even said that he thought it was numerous objects flying in an arc-shaped formation, but that they flowed and shifted, not unlik! e geese. However, I have considerable experience &apos;in the wild&apos; and have seen flights of migratory birds both during the day and at night. First of all, to have formed this impression of an arc, there would have to have been numerous birds flying at a great height, much to high to have been seen from the ground at night. If the same formation had been seen during the day, and if they were ducks or geese, then they would have had to have been moving at super-sonic speed. To move across the sky in that amount of time, the birds would have had to have been much closer to the ground, in which case they would have been easily discernable as being birds of some sort, and at that height, given the size of the arc, could not have been more than five or six birds, in which case they could hardly have been mistaken for an arc shape. Also, they made no sound, whereas ducks and geese will honk and quack as they fly, and even when not, you can hear their wings - but there was no sound. Instead, my best description of the object is of a non-solid sherical object, clear, with light either reflecting along its forward edge or underside. As to size and speed, I can only hazard a guess or impression, as there was nothing to judge by; it could have been very large and high and moving very fast, or small and low and moving slowly. But my impression was that of an object about the size of a house, flying at two-to-four thousand feet, at about the speed of a cruise missile.", "It was big, it was bright and a huge light.  Kinda like a white railroad light but triple the size and gave off a floating effect to itThe light was round, it was white, but the outer part of it shimmered a little.  There was a light underneath the craft because me and my girlfriend followed it for 4 miles down Williams road in Columbus OH, and from the beginning of the sight of seeing this object It glowed more when we was away from it and hovered for quite a while. When we was on top of it was when we seen the light underneath it, nothing like I could describe.  It left a trail, similar to a contrail, but very differant.  The other objects must have came from the mothership of something, because they had a goldish shimmer to them we seen these later on after we turned away from the white glowing object.

Then returned the same direction they came from when 2 South bound Jets headed towards them.Nov.18th &apos;99  [about an hour after dark] To all: Tonight I saw what can only be discribed as UFO&apos;s - (4)four of them to be exact.  I swear it&apos;s true.  I just happened to be outside smoking a cigerette and was watching the big passenger liners on thier way to Lindberg field to land. Suddenly what I saw made me think: &quot;Why are the stars moving??&quot;  Four Lights, like stars started to move toward each other; like this: *    -&gt;               &lt;-     * *    -&gt;               &lt;-     * Then they came together:     ** Like this:     ** Next I heard, then saw 2 Jets coming from the north in full afterburners, headed towards them.  Before the jets could get close the 4 stars/UFO&apos;s took off back the way they had come. (they were together for about 5-6 seconds).  Two of the UFO&apos;s went so fast that they were out of sight in just a couple sec&apos;s.  The other two went back to where they had been when I 1st saw them and stoped there - looking like stars again.  When these things stopped they stopped instantly!  Now for some reason unknown to me, the 2 jets went after the 2 UFO&apos;s that kept going, not the ones that had stopped(??)  The entire show happened in just about 20-25 seconds.  I kept watching but nothing else happened so I went inside as it was geting chilly. So, thats it - absolutely true. Unfortunately they were too far away to make out any kind of shape - they just looked like big lights in the night sky!  I was so lucky to look up just at the right time to see them.

We have corrected it here.))", "Bright white &quot;landing lights&quot; in straight line formation moving south to north at just above tree-top level. No sound; moving slowly.  All 3 lights extinguished simultaneously.I was leaving my house for work in summer 1998.  I stepped from house into driveway and noticed three bright lights approaching at just above treetop level from the south.  I first thought they might be helicopters with search lights.  But then I realised that the lights were beaming forward and not down.  Straight line formation...some distance between lights but I am unable to estimate how much distance.  I listened for engine sound, but heard nothing except crickets and distant creek sounds.  The formation moved slowly from south to north.  I was dumbfounded because this is a rural area and nearest airport is about 15 miles south of here.  Just as I was wondering why three aircraft would be flying so low, in formation, and with landing lights on, all three lights extinguished suddenly and simultaneously.  I then observed no strobe lights or wing/tail markers.  And of course, still no sound.  I strained my eyes trying to see anything in the darkness that followed the lights being extinguished, but could see nothing on this otherwise clear night.  End of incident.  I regret not filing this report sooner, but I have been fascinated by recent similar sightings reported on the Art Bell show.  Except my sighting was NOT in triangle formation, but was instead in straight line formation.  But it was 3 lights for sure.  And the sudden, simultaneous extinguishing of the lights was certainly most peculiar.  For three seperate aircraft to do this would require military-like precision.  I hope you don&apos;t mind receiving this report since it is 1.5 years old, but I thought I should finally tell somebody what I saw in early morning hours of June/July 98.", "1900hrs 3 orange/yellow lights appeared in the south east sky.

I noticed how black the sky was and a few stars and saw something shaped like a rectangle, like the size of the windows on this form that we use to fill out information.  I was traveling about 70 MPH and saw this shaped traveling in the sky along side of the car. I thought it was a shooting star, but it didn&apos;t have a tail and it was airborne too long.  It never disappeared in the sky!!!!  As I slowed down, the object got closer and I was able to see it much clearer.  This object had several windows that were seperated by some kind of bar and very bright lights.    I was stunned by what I saw and pulled off the road to get a better look, but The craft disappeared.  My husband said there were several shooting stars and meteors sighted that night and airplanes were chasing the stars, but these were not stars and this was not an airplane.!!!!

Then the triangle slowed and went behind the clouds, but I could still see it a little as I drove on toward the east, the same directions it was headed toward.", "translucent, silvery boomerang shape, totally silent, with short, feathering discharge from the back edgeAm am a professor of sociology at San Francisco State University.  I was walking my dog on the top of one of the bare hills in the city. It was a totally clear day.  When I looked up in the sky there was a translucent silver boomerang shaped object overhead, discharing a regular undulating wave of something (not a contrail)which never chanaged in length. The discharge was along the entire back edge.  It was totally silent. It appeared to be about as long (edge to edge) as a jetliner.  I have no way of estimating how far away it was, but it was an absolutely clear day, and the object was clearly visible but earily silent.  I continued to watch it move for about 3-4 minutes.  Then the dog wandered away, and by the time I found her,(maybe three or four minutes) the object was no longer visible, despite the fact that there was considerable visibility from where I was watching.", "2 bright lights in northern sky on a right to left angle approx. 40 deg.traveling North on I 71 at mile marker 75 myself and a trucker behind us were on our usual run.  We always look at the sky and note the constalations and locations of planets and, this morning, commenting on the &quot;bust&quot; of a meteor shower and were hoping to see remenants.  In a moment of silence on the CB radio, I was looking at the night sky with no cloud cover, I scanned from the west to the east when at about 11 o&apos;clock from my vantage point there were two &quot;stars&quot; very bright and very close together at at right to left angle.  These &quot;stars&quot; were so bright I thought I had lost my bearing and was seeing double on  a planet.  Just then, the other driver said, &quot;Do you see what I see ahead?&quot;  I said, &quot;Yeah, they were never there before&quot;  We both were watching them and these very intense lights began to fade.  This was weird because unlike a light bulb going out they faded slowly for a good 5 to 6 seconds into the darkness.  There was no movement and no clouds to dissapear into if this were a plane.  We talked among ourselves and concluded, based on the landing lights of aircraft in the area that these lights were far too bright, too far apart and too motionless to be that of conventional aircraft.  We both decided that I should report this to you.  Thank you.", "approx 22:21 saw a bright light hovering just east of my front driveway. No noise. The brightness would intensify then subsided then intensify again. Then I would see bright particiles releasing and falling to earth in a straight line. As this ball of light slowly moved toward me. Another one appeared from the east again moving at a faster rate. The 2nd one I noticed approx 22:24. The 2nd one stopped. The light will would intensify and then subside like the first one and release light participles as well. Both move westernly. The first one disappeared and the 2nd one changed course and move easternly. Approx 22:28 a police car passed by my house as I was still observing the 2nd ball of light. It appeared that he was looking up in the sky in the same direction as I was but not sure if the officer saw it. Police car kept driving and turned into another street.", "two diamond shaped &apos;craft&apos; during eclipseThree normal aircraft passed befoore these.

I wasn&apos;t expecting anything unusual during the lunar eclipse. This is my first sighting as well.", "Two bright objects perpendicular to one another and appeared to be heading on a fast collision course, when one passed over the other, the lower continued east, then just disappeared, seconds later, the other continuing north, disappeared also.The viewing location was in my pasture about 32 miles west of Tulsa, Okla and 5 miles south, in the area 6 miles west and 2 1/2 miles south of Mannford, Okla near 2 east and 2 south of Silver City, Okla (but it&apos;s probably not on a map). About 1 1/2 hours after sunset my wife and I were unloading hay out in an open pasture for the cattle. The evening was cool, clear, and silent, with no wind or clouds,and I don&apos;t believe there was any moon yet. I saw the Orion constellation in the east and looked higher and saw the constellation above Orion that looks like a little letter &quot;Y&quot;. Directly over my head I noticed a bright roundish object moving at a high rate of speed from due west to due east. It was brighter than any star in the sky and appeared to be a single glob of white light. Thinking it to be a meteorite I told my wife to look straight up. She did and listening, there was no sound, and no trail behind it or anything. I then noticed motion in the southern sky and saw an identical bright white object speeding due north. Both objects were now in clear view and I judged by their heading, that they would barely miss crashing into one another. They kept coming, never slowed, and they didn&apos;t burn out or weaken in intensity of their light. They both seemed fairly large considering the distance, or altitude they seemed to be at, larger than a big jetliner I would say, yet there was no noise, no vapor trail, no winding jet turbo-drone type sound, and going way too fast, yet it was perfectly quiet. The object coming from the south passed just over the top of the object coming from the west and both continued straight ahead on their same respective courses. As I watched the first object continue due east, it unexpectedly disappeared at about a 60 degree angle up from the east horizon as measured along the path of my line of vision. It went from full bright white, to dim blue white, to gone in half a second. No sparks, no tail, no trail, nothing. I looked back north to the other object and it continued bright and was getting further away, racing along at the same high speed. Low on the horizon to the east I could see the soft glow of the city lights from Tulsa, hidden from my view by hills, yet illuminating the humidity and/or dust and pollution hanging in the air. I noticed an airplane low to the east northeast about where the Tulsa Int&apos;l Airport is located. The plane looked like it was heading west, and probably had just taken off. The plane had a solid white light on the front and a red blinking light to the side, as is common. I strained to hear the plane, but it was still too far away, as it is at least 45 miles to where the airport is located. I realized when looking back to the bright white object that the object was traveling at least twice or more than the speed of the airplane, and was much brighter. As I watched the object speed due north, now in the distance, it suddenly dimmed to off white for a fraction of a second, then just vanished from sight. Maybe both objects individually turned off their light at different times, but there was never so much as a blink of any colored light, or any warning light, only a bright white, a single, same intensity, solid white light. I&apos;m thinking that maybe the altitude where they were passing through was high enough that surface reflection was occuring from the sun, which had already set in the west, an hour and a half earlier. As we watched the first object speed east it could have gone into the Earth&apos;s shadow, making it invisible to us. Same with the second object a few seconds later, as it was higher because it passed over the first object at their point of crossing, so it may have reflected sunlight for a little bit longer time until it got too far to the north in the Earth&apos;s shadow and just seemed to disappear. We looked back to the airplane, and it continued it&apos;s slow progress forward. We are both used to seeing satellites circling the Earth, falling stars, meteorites, meteor showers, comet tails, etc. I&apos;ve never seen anything like this, both were clearly bright, fast, and seemed to have purpose in their close pass at each other. We stood a few more minutes and looked around, scanning for more information, more clues, but there was none. I have no idea what the objects were, or what they were doing.", "Unusaual object moved across the sky at a rather low altitude, twice dropping some kind of glowing embers from the bottom.While walking back to our apartment my girlfriend and I noticed a bright star-like object in the sky.  The object was coming from the east, star-like object in the sky. The object was coming from the east, traveling in a westerly direction toward us. (We are 6 miles from the west coast of Florida) The object grew larger in size as it approched us. The only way to explain it is that it was a large mass of light, white in color. Our first thought was that is was something launched from the cape, but as it got closer we could tell that it was traveling at a rather low altitude. Suddenly it dropped something from the bottom of it like glowing embers that rained toward the ground. When it dropped the embers, the color of the light mass turned to a more reddish color. It continued to move closer to us, and turned to the south. At it&apos;s closest point to us we could see that something large was projecting from the light mass. I believed it to be a flat beam of light however my girlfriend believes that it looked like it was of substance, and not light.  It slilently moved by us slower than a plane, but faster than a balloon. As it traveled away from us to the south it&apos;s color slowly changed back to more of a white color. When it was a couple of miles away it again dropped these embers, which again rained down through the sky, and it again turned to a more reddish color. The object was visible for about 10 minutes until it was just a small red star in the distance, and then we lost sight of it. I&apos;m not good with altitudes, but if i had to guess I would say that it was only a couple of thousand feet up. As far as size, the light mass seemed to be about 100 feet in diameter, and whatever was prjecting from it was three times that width. I am 38 years old, a college graduate, a business owner, and until now, a non-believer in UFO&apos;s.  Whatever this was, it was like nothing that I have ever seen before.

We observed a bright light come over the horizon above the tree line, moving at a tremendous speed. Initially we assumed it to be a low flying jet aircraft (rarely are any aircraft other than small private planes seen in this area at all)due to the extreme speed. The light came from a true north bearing of 268 degrees (my husband deals with map and compass locations on a daily basis), travelling almost due east (true bearing). As the light approached us, we expected to hear the engine of a possible military aircraft due to the fact that Fairchild AFB is approx. 80 miles SW of our location. When the light was directly overhead, it began to fade and finally disappeared. In spite of the fact that we waited a number of minutes, there was no sound whatsoever. It should be noted that our home is located in a very rural area, and the ambient sound is almost non-existant.

Could move in all directions in darting motions.When I was approximately 10 years old, my mother and I witnessed two objects traveling above us as we were driving on 45th ave. in Everett east toward I-5.  They were above us darting just under the clouds and traveling slightly faster than us.  I remember thinking that their shape was like the paper airplanes I used to make with pointed fronts, like elongated triangles, but they were translucent and the light reflected off them, though they looked like they were projecting cloud-like images on their surface. As we turned north onto I-5, they flew over the freeway, still just under the clouds and east, then turned north also and flew at about our same speed for about 5 minutes.  Then when we were between Everett and Marysville, they shot east toward the mountains at a highly accelerated rate.  It was so fast that it took only maybe 2 seconds for them to disappear from sight.  We never reported it because we had no proof, but after listening to a radio show about the UFO center I was encouraged to give my account.  We really aren&apos;t even sure of the year let alone the time and date.  I just remember that it was not very cold, a partially cloudy, partially sunny day.  Until I called the UFO center, I had never heard of anyone else seeing a UFO during the day.  These two could travel forward, backward, and side to side with the ease of a hummingbird.

The object was not traveling in an exact straight line because at times it seemed to be slightly moving  from side to side but continued to move in a southerly direction. I had time to get my binoculars and on closer inspection of the object when it was almost directly overhead of us I could see a dark triangular body (because of the stars behind it) around the orange colored donut shaped light. I could also see a dark triangle in the center of the orange light. I estimate the object to have been maybe 1,000 ft across from tip to tip. As the object continued south the orange light became brighter and seemed to display brighter flashes now and then, almost like the afterburners on a fighter jet. After a few bright flashes another object looking very similar seemed to appear in front of the original object, and it happened very fast. You could also see a rope like outline connecting the two objects. Then a third, fourth, and fith object appeared out in front of the last in a similar fashion. At this point we had been watching the objects for about 10 minutes and they were near the southern horizon below the Orion constellation when they faded quite rapidly. Neither me nor my friend have ever seen anything like this. We live in southern california 75 miles south-east of Los Angeles, and this object when it first appeared to us it was in the north-west maybe over the L.A. basin at a very high altitude, then when it was almost directly north of us, maybe over Antelope Valley - Big Bear, it made a sharp turn to the south and came right over us and kept on a southerly course towards Mexico&apos;s airspace.", "THREE OVAL CRAFTS FLYING AT VEARIOUS ALTITUDES AT EXACT FORMATION ONE ABOVE THE OTHER.

It struck me as very odd, because it looked just like someone had taken a translucent, plastic model of a plane and put a bright light inside it.  The whole craft was a distinct bright white color.  That was the part that seemed odd, since normally one only sees lights at the extremities of a plane.  I watched it travel from due south towards the southeast at a normal pace for a plane of that distance and altitude (it could have been higher than a mile). The shape was very distinct with wings and tail fins in normal proportions. As I was watching it and noticing how strange it was, all of a sudden it split in two from nose to tail fin and one half went towards the northwest and the other went towards the southwest.  The whole event probably took between a minute and two minutes.  After the object split, the two sections took off in their respective directions at an accelerated speed and were soon lost to sight.  I might not have reported this incident, since it happened so long ago, if I hadn&apos;t come across a similar event reported in this database from Lewiston, NY on 10/2/99 at 12:00.  In my sighting, the large wings were in the front, just like a real plane.  I also heard no sound (it was clear AND quiet).  Again, there was no vapor trail.  I&apos;ve told people about this for the last 30 years, and they all think I&apos;m nuts; it&apos;s nice to see that someone else has had almost the same experience!", "My brother and I witnessed a bright pulsating light in the air.  We were very close to Area 51 at the time of the sighting.  I was able to capture approximately 10 minutes of what I believe is very striking video.Early November 3, 1999 my brother and I were searching for Area 51.  After a long tiring drive down the roughest dirt road I&apos;ve ever seen we tired and gave up.  Then as we drove down Extraterrestrial Hwy.  I noticed a light in the sky.  It appeared to be below the moon, but was brighter and larger than any star in the sky.  I video taped the object for several minutes we then stopped the car to get a better video.  I was able to capture about 10 minutes of video before my battery died.  We thought the object was amazing, but figured once we were able to view the video we would realize it was just a star.  However, I don&apos;t believe what we saw was a star.  We did witness an airplane fly through the general area (I&apos;m not sure if that is on the tape, however), but it was hard to tell where the plane was in relation to the light.  To the naked eye it appeared to be a bright light, but when I was able to zoom in on the light it appeared to pulsate.  At one point I was completely zoomed in at holding completely still and the object moved about. Recently I watched a show about sightings over Phoenix in 1997.  One man&apos;s video taken a few days before all of the other sightings was an exact match to the sighting my brother and I had.  The light was still in the sky an hour later when we reached our hotel.  I have made a copy of my tape and would very much like to have someone with some expertise in the field view it.", "We were watching the meteor storm in the southeastern sky, and noticed a bright object rise above the tree line.In the distance off to the left very far away from the first light was the second,and off to the northeast was the third,closer than the second object,but farther than the first. All three objects moved together at the same time,and moved up and down,and east to west and back.we observed all three objects for atleast 2 hrs. then we returned to the house to notify others that witnessed the closest object,after a few minutes,I myself returned to the woods behind the property, and from that point on cannot remember anything!!! I wokeup in my friends house the next morning and no one could explain how I got inside the house ,allentrances were locked and secured and no signs of entry were to be found !!!!!! I have no keys or anyway of entering their house without someone letting me in.....all three objects were bright white with occasional flash&apos;es of red and green on the outer perimeter of each object,and all three even though very far apart moved together in unison!!!!!These objects were observed on a totally clear night with no visible moon or ground lights!!!!This incident was witnessed on top of a small hill with almost no ground obstrutions except for a few trees!!!!!In other words a unobsructed view of the sky!!!!!At 2:35am. Myself and my bestfriends son were trying to watch the southeastern skies,in the backwoods property behind my friends property.We had already been outside watching for meteorites, starting at 2:00am.At 2:35am. We both noticed an object ,a very bright object rise above the southeastern woods!!!The object was hovering yet moving side to side and moving in very deliberate movements...Behind the first object but off to the left, yet very far in the distance was the second object,it was definately moving like a mirror image of the first..After aprox. twenty minutes off to the northeastern sky a third moving bright object dropped into view and almost seemed to line itself up with the other two objects. Once it lined up with the other two ,all three started to move in unison,first north to south then up and down this pattern of movements continued for atleast one and a half hours!!!!!! After awhile we went back to my friends house and woke up the parents of my 16yrold companion.They both observed the first object from their backporch for about 5 mins. At that point the parents and the 16yr. old went back into the house. I returned to the backwoods to resume watching the three objects. From that point on,I walked farther into the woods and observed the first object coming closer to me!! F rom that point on I donot remember anything more!!!!!!!! In the morning I awoke aprox. 10:00am. upstairs in a house that was locked and no one recalls either hearing me enter the house or letting me in!!!!!!The lady of the house seen me upstairs laying down completely clothed and still wearing my wool hat,and shaking,but still asleep she did not wake me at that time but expressed astonishment,later that I had gotten inside the house with absolutely no one hearing me enter or anyone letting me in the house I have no key to their house and the only other entrance is a very noisy sliding door that was shut and secured!! I know that we could&apos;nt have been the only one&apos;s to have seen this but no one else has admitted to ! such!!!! !!", "low slow bright light, no soundwhile traveling south on county road 7 about four miles south of old selma road a triangle shaped craft approached from the east at about 20 mph.  It crossed the road in front of us heading towards the GE plant in Berkville in Alabama, the only bright spot on the horizon to the west.  Upon seeing the triangle I slowed my speed to under 25 mph, and watched it travel another 1/2 mile, stop, and retraced its route.  It was approximately 120 feet in the air.  I stopped my car about 1/4 of a mile after passing underneath it.  Turned around to see it retrace it&apos;s path &amp; come back at a slower speed, approximately 10 mph.  Went another mile, or so - &amp; vanished. Thank you for your return call Sunday evening.  You had me as a Mrs. Montgomery.  I neglected to give you my last name, sorry. The craft was triangle in shape, with bright lights on all three corners, one or two lights down the sides, all white lights.  One toward the front was especially bright.  It created shadows from the bushes &amp; trees, and lit up the brush so you could see colors.  Was flat across the back with no lights on the back.  The triangle was black.  The underside was void of any distinguishing marks.  The night was very clear, and somewhat warm.  Lots of stars, and very little moon.  The area we were in is very unpopulated, and has many fields where crops are during season.  It made no sound. There is a commercial airport with a air force reserve squadron five miles to the southeast.  There is a major airforce base about five miles to the northeast.  Danley field, and maxwell afb respectively. Prior to seeing it the radio on fm fading in &amp; out with a kind of squeally noise.  It only happened once, and lasted only a few seconds.  Not tyical for this area.  The closest we ever got was about 200 feet. On a personal level I am 35 year old mother of three daughters, marrried, 3 years of college, business major, home school my children, and work as a clerk in a movie store, accounting background.  This was witnessed by myself, and three daughters.  Who up until now have been very skeptical about ufos!", "while friend and I was going to sizzler to lunch something, near Hill AirForce Base caught my attention, something was going straight up in the air at a high rate of speed and it looked like it had windows and friend and I was on the freeway and he could not look at it while he was driving, because I asked him to look out the window, thinking about my past ufo experiences made me remember this one when I did not want to. But I wanted to report it now, because I&apos;m compelled to.I spotted a disk looking shape craft flying high and fast. I even saw windows. Jets fly at an angle so as to approach the runway. This object was moving straight up until gone. The way I figure it. Aliens were visiting, Hill Airforce base, for some reason or another that day, I tried hard to forget, because I don&apos;t want to dream about it any more.  I lived in Utah at the time.", "Three bright lights in the front and sides and a red light at the bottom on the object.Object low in sky.  At first thought it was an airplane flying extremely low or about to crash and as I got closer it was stationary and made no sound.  There were three large lights that were very bright and larger than any light I had ever seen in the sky on an object and on the underneath side of the object was a red light that did not blink and the object looked oval in nature.  It was about 200-300 feet above the tree lines over a field.  I turned the corner to get a closer look and it was gone.  Nowhere to be seen.", "Large triangular object with white lights along the side.  SilentI was driving along highway 429 South between Liberty and Siler City.  On my left, I saw a large (1/2 football field) sized triangular object with solid white lights going along the side.  The object was motionless above the trees  beside the road.  There was no sound.  I pulled off onto the emergency lane and stopped.  Noted that perhaps 4-5 other cars had slowed/stopped also.  Kept watching this object until it just disappeared.  One moment, it was there and the next, it was gone.", "I heard a noise like thunder, went to the kitchen window and saw a black diamond-shaped craft hovering over the porch.I woke up hearing a noise like thunder.  Out of my bedroom window I saw an orange fireball flying by, so I went into the kitchen to look out the window and told my sister to come and see the meteor coming down.  When I opened the curtains my sister and I saw a black diamond-shaped craft hovering over the porch.  It was about ten feet wide and had large green lights on the points of the diamond.  A very low rumbling sound shook the house, the window glass was rattling and the sound seemed to be going through my chest.  We watched it for a few minutes, then the thing slid off the porch roof horizontally, then lifted up and flew away.  It was blacker than the sky, and it seemed to be flying fast and slow at the same time.  Then 4 jets from the Westover Air Force Base chased it but were far too slow to catch up with it. My sister and I started to walk out of the kitchen, but I don&apos;t remember going to bed.  I woke up a few hours later, my parents were home and they were yelling at my sister because she was sitting in front of the TV with her eyes bugged out, shaking.  Then I noticed that I was tucked into bed with my slippers on, which I had not been wearing when I got up to look at the object.  My hair was spread out on the pillow and my arms were crossed mummy-style when I woke up.  My door was locked, so my parents had not tucked me in-- and I was too old for that anyway, since I was 14 at the time. The strangest thing is that I never spoke to my sister about this, and I had a false memory of having told my best friend about it.  It was five years before I fully remembered what had happened.", "I was filming a sunrise when a object appeared.  I have it on tape. It was round and I don&apos;t know what it was for sureSame as above. I couldn&apos;t see the object until I played it on a TV.", "I WENT OUT ON MY SUPPER BREAK TO RELAX BY THE RIVER ACROSS THE STREET FROM MY OFFICE BUILDING WITH BINOCULARS IN HAND TO DO SOME BIRD WATCHING. THIS AREA IS NEAR THE NORMAL FLIGHT PATH FOR INCOMING COMMERCIAL AIRLINES COMING IN TO VANC.INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, SO WE SEE A LOT OF AIRCRAFT. THE AIRLINER I SAW ON THIS PARTICULAR EVENING HAD A COMPANION HOVERING ABOVE IT. I NOTICED IT BECAUSE THE SUN WAS REFLECTING OFF IT LIKE A MIRROR. IT WAS A SMALL (COMPARED TO THE JET)SHINY SILVER BALL THAT STARTED OUT RIGHT BEHIND THE JET AND THEN MOVED DIRECTLY ABOVE THE JET. I WAS IN SUCH SHOCK I PUT DOWN MY BINOCULARS BECAUSE I COULDN&apos;T BELIEVE MY EYES.SECONDS LATER I PUT MY BINOCS BACK UP AND UNFORTUNATELY LOST SIGHT OF THE OBJECT.this whole incident only lasted a minute or two, but it was very clear to me that i witnessed something very odd. we see many incoming jets of various size and shapes but never have i seen a free floating silver ball like the one i saw buzzing that jet. it appeared to me that anyone on that jet would not have seen anything because of the way the ball was following close behind and then accelerated to zip up and over the top. it was very small (perhaps 3-4 ft across) and i&apos;m sure i would not have even noticed it if the sun had not reflected off it. when i went in to work and told my co-workers i saw a ufo, they all scoffed at me, so i haven&apos;t told too many people. it definetly was an unidentified flying object. when i heard the art bell interview of feb8 i was so impressed by peter davenports sincerity, integrity  and dedication i decided to make this belated report. i hope it is of some benefit to you.", "Pulsating (like a strobe light) object in the sky, traveling south to north, then turning east.The object was traveling south to north and the entire object was pulsating, much like a strobe light.  It eventually turned east and disappeared, perhaps because my view was blocked by trees.  The sky was clear and other objects we saw in the sky both before and after did not pulsate.  I did see another airplane with flashing lights but it was not pulsating like the other object.  It may have been nothing but I thought I would report it in case anyone else saw it.  I&apos;m sorry I can&apos;t give a more detailed description but that is all I saw.", "My family and I were driving through the United States, and my father took a back road...and we stopped the car to take pictures of the mountains. I was asleep at the time, but my father then yelled, &quot;Matt, look at that fighter aircraft!&quot; And I woke up to see the last of it, and it was a white triangle, travelling at a amazingly fast speed, my eyes could barely keep up, yet it wasnt making any sound, this was in broad day light too. And then it was gone. My mother claimed she saw another one.", "Seemed to stay in one area for approx. 2 hours, is still there at 03:17 and during the event the object seemed to change color and intensity and brightness.  at 03:19 the object is now totally gone from our sight. The shape appeared to be diamond, but also appeared to change shape. Distance was a factor in our views of it, causing each of us to see differently.When first noticed the lights thought it was a star or a sattilite, but relized that the light was to bright to be either and it was constantly changing colors.  They appeared to move in a westerly direction and I believe I saw something shoot off to the left and to the right of the object.  I believe the colors to have been;  Red, Green, Yellow, Blue, White, And the shape seemed to me to be a diamond.  Can&apos;t be certain of it though, seeing as my wife believes she seen a constantly changing shape. At the time of the occurance, My satillite reciever began to lose the signal, then turned off two or three times had some problems turning it back on. After the last time it turned off and got it to turn on again, happened to look out the window (faces south) and seen the lights.  I then proceded to call my sister and have her confirm what I was seening.

However, a &quot;twinkling&quot; star is seen to move &quot;across&quot; the sky with all other heavenly bodies as the earth turns on its axis.  PD))"]
