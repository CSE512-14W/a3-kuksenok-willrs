["Writer 47 Yrs old located at W.End Henry Cowell Rewdood State Park at my Private Residence 3200 Ft. off the Pacific Coast Santa Cruz, CA watched 4 ufo&apos;s triangulate what appeared to be an area of approx. 40 miles quick turns, extream speed estimated to be South Southwestern sky possible over the ocean and mountains as from my vantage point and the estimated distance from me they could have easily move from over ocean to land.  Of the four vehicles only 2 appeared as almost 200% larger than the other two.  The smaller vehicles seems to tags the 2 larger vehicles in a almost regular formation or line of the larger vehicles.  The night was cool and crystal clear with what was unlimited visability, so clear and dark that I could see the gas in the milky way very distictivly, planet colors, etc.I was sitting on the front steps at my home looking at the sky, no moon out, 3200 ft. elev. in the Santa Cruz Mountains.  As I looked over the topsof the trees at some distance maybe 5 to 10 miles out I noticed 4 circular vehicles.  As I watched for the 5+ minutes they appeared to move in quick trangular steps, almost as in a pattern.  I believe the position they moved was in the South Southwestern skies as my view was a southern exposure, always just hugging the tree tops so they would have must have been at an altitude that varied from maybe as low as -2k ft. to maybe +10K ft.  At a noticable lowere left corner these vehicles, not necessarily together, the larger circles (more of a whiteish/blue with occasions of amber in color) would go from this position to a position through my center vision (assuming tht is 3200 ft.) to almost twice that height moving up and right at say 40 to 50 degrees to their top altitude so this is where I beleive they had moved to maybe 10K ft.  Each of the larger disc&apos;s would have a trailing smaller disk.  Comparativly looking around -2x smaller than the large disk (they had a more reddish color but at time appeared to stobe and the color became more of a flashy silver or shiney electric blue arcing color) and the smaller vehicles alway followed the larger disc without exchanging from one larger to the other, always staying in an almost direct pattern following the larger disc.  I as watched I thought of what this may be, certainly not aircraft as the speed of the position changes, ratio and excess of position movement was way to complex.  Testing my thoughts on this I watched the larger disc move from )using the lower triangular position above left slightly below the trees but visable throught the tree tops, it would (using the old one-thosand &amp; one, etc. method of counting seconds) move from this position to the top position of the triangle before I could get to to one-thousand...  Accounting for the estimated distance of 5 to maybe 15 miles the fact it would have travelle! d from maybe 2000 or less feet to easily 10000 feet in that time, coverning my visual horizion of say 1/10th these objects were booking some MPH. I heard no noise, no booms, nothing except wind in the trees.  As each disc continued to do this I sat and watch the larger discs move at different points no mirroring no pattern copy but very simular triangular moves, each being followed by the smaller dot as compared to the larger disc the smaller vehicles actually looked like dots, but circular with diamaters.  The smaller dots would at time mirror the larger disc but as a rule they would appear to stray a minor fraction of the larger disc course change and as a rule they appeared to keep varied distances from the larger disc.  No real rules that I could see where the smaller disc would stay exactly in position like a trailer may in the wind, but more like if a rubber band was attached slinging behind.  The smaller dots stayed the larger disc with mainly the same move but at a varied speed, sometime as if to pass it (but never did) and other times as if it was being bungeed in reverse to leave it (but never did) only to follow at diffrent rates back to the larger disc.  As I watched for almost 5 minutes this dance between the 2 larger discs and 2 smaller dots for each larger disc the rate of my counting off the timing was almost always consistant until the very end of the sighting.  As I watched the patterns (triangles) near the end the motions by both started to flatten out this pattern until one large disc trailed off to the right at about 10 to 15 degrees from my horizon, from a dead stop and as I thought of these seconds counting in my head, the departure off and up into the horizon was so fast my count was like one...and it was gone with the dot.  The second large disc and dot stayed around for about another 30 to 45 secs. and it appeared to dash off straight in my direction, it was not quite as fast of a departure more like the pattern timing but I expected to see it get maybe a bit larger as it came str! aight towards me but it didn&apos;t and if it did I am certain because of the speed my eyes and mind probably couldn&apos;t determine a size change.  In closing the only other comment is that the larger disc kept the almost bluish/white with an occasional amber coloring, but the dots were always in flux and only seems to go electric blue in color as they reached the apex of that bundged thrust either in reverse or in a forward return motion (like on a bunge cord down the up) as you reach the thrusting end motion.  I sat for may 20 more minutes looking to see if there was any further action and I saw nothing unusual, a few obvious planes, a satellite a shooting star or two, but nothing else that evening.  That&apos;s pretty much my report.", "2 oval shaped objects with 3 jets following for about 10 minutes, then there was 12 black helicopters flying in same direction. Looked like the copters were looking for something on ground.I was driving north bond on state route 62 towards Columbus, Ohio, when my five year old girl spotted the jets. looking out the window at the jets, my wife and I noticed they were following two oval shaped obects that were flying very low (maybe 500 feet). we could see all this for about ten minutes before they got out of our site. Then maybe about 3 to 5 minutes there were black helicopters everywhere (12 total) looked as though they were searching for something on the ground, because they were sweeping the area that they were covering a couple of times before moving further north. This all took place a bout 1 mile south of Grove City, Ohio. Got home and turned on scanner, but did not hear any reports. Did call local police deptand they said the black helicopters were on a training patrol.", "Huge oval shaped craft which had an amber glow quietly flew at tree top level over my friend and I.Back in 1989, my friend and I were college students attending the Penn State Mont Alto campus.  The day we saw the object we were returning from a little excursion to the mall.  We parked the car in the lot below campus and then  proceeded to walk back to our dorm room.  As we were walking up the hill, I noticed this glowing light coming off South Mountain.  At first we thought it was the moon since it had a glow much like that of the full moon.  But then we noticed that it was slowly moving towards us quietly just above the trees.  We stopped and watched as it gradually made its way directly over us.  We were petrified!  The object was probably over a hundred feet long, oval shaped and glowing.  It made no sound and seemed to stop the wind from blowing as it passed overhead.  I can remember feeling warmth radiating down upon us.  Moments later it shot off at an incredible speed into the evening sky.  As it was speeding away it looked like a bright star, gradually diminishing until it completed disappeared..", "object observed in rural setting; one very bright rounded light with sharp crisp rays (one observer did not see rays); through binnoculars red and green smaller lights observed-no rays; very slow moving; seemed to ascent &amp; desend (oberved through trees so not positive)then disappeared (perhaps behind trees); seen a few minutes later(by 2 people only) from open field and described as not being visable at first then turning on like a dimmer switch; yellow ball moving fast across sky with no rays observed and no sound; then disappearingObject first seen by visitors leaving rural home after dinner.  Property located in NW corner of Tuscaloosa County, AL.  Direction of object would be to west of property.  As first observers turned notherly and drove .2 miles to a paved road they continued to see the object to the west.  They returned to the home and object was observed by 4 adults for approximately 45 minutes before disappearing from view (perhaps behind trees &amp; hills).  One observer called 911 to report and asked for telephone number to Columbus Air Force Base (Columbus, MS). I was given number to Command Post 601-((number deleted)) and I think the person I talked with was named Brady.  He told me they were not and could not launch aircraft to check out situation because of holiday weekend and the fact they had no aircraft were presently flying.  He called me back with telephone number to the UFO Center (206-722-3000).  I could not reach a person due to holiday but was given web site address.  Therefore I am reporting it  via that site on July 5, 1999.  You may contact me with questions via e-mail but I cannot accept collect telephone calls.  You may call at your expense if you are interested in doing so.((2nd message))Thank you for your quick reply.  I have a typo correction to make.  The question #240 address state should be AL (Alabama) not GA (Georgia).Also, I will be forwarding a map to you to identify the location where the sighting occurred and a sketch of what the object looked like to 2 of the 4 observers.I will look at the other &quot;new reports&quot; with interest.I must admit that I was uneasy and a little frightened by what I saw.Sincerely,((Name deleted))", "Sky was clear with the exception of a few clouds. A large silver/white cigar shaped craft moved from behind one of the clouds. No sound, no wings, no tail, no contrail, nothing hanging down bottom of craft.I was sitting on my porch looking up at the sky. The sky was clear and sunny with the exception of a few clouds. As I was looking at one of the clouds a craft moved slowly from behind it. My first thought was &apos;What the heck is that?&apos; It was a large white/silvery color and rather radiated very bright white reflextion/light. I did not see wings, a tail, anything hanging from the bottom of the craft, no blinking lights. The craft left no contrail and made no sound. It was cigar shaped and about the size of three Goodyear Blimps end to end. I watched it move across the sky at a steady rate of speed until I could no longer see it because of trees in the next door neighbor&apos;s yard. I am a graghic artist and know how to &apos;look&apos; at an object. I have never seen anything like this before. Two weeks later my roommate and I were out in the back yard working in the folwer bed and I sat down to rest...looked up and saw another craft just like the one I reported above only smaller in size. I called to my roommate and pointed to the craft. We both watched it travel across the sky. Both craft came from the same direction.", "U.F.O, Seen while driving home.On my way home today while driving down the street i was watching a big white jet flying across the sky. Well the reason I was watching it was because of these huge contrail&apos;s behind it. When i noticed a airplane. that resembled a space shuttle. And coming right toward&apos;s the spaceshuttle loking airplane was a cigar shaped object. The colors were actually not color but like a dark moving metal with some reflection to it. I wanted to pull over but there was to much trafic. When I turned the corner and looked back up it was gone but the shuttle was still flying. this all happend around 12:50, it was very ecxiting.", "I was walking to church very early on the morning of May 5, 1965.  Cutting across the rear of the adjacent school parking lot, a bright streak of light caught my eye. After a few seconds, the streak reappeared and I followed the light in the direction it was traveling.  Whirling to my left, the streak of light came to a halt and revealed a shape like that of a jet aircraft fuselage.  It had a tail fin but no visible side wings.  It had an overall color of light yellow and lightly colored bands of various colors running along the length of the fuselage. The object emitted no sound and there was no noticeable trail of exhaust.The incident I&rsquo;m about to reveal occurred when I was about nine years old.  For several days after this incident, it was something I thought about quite a lot but soon I put it aside in my memory and never really thought much about it until several years later when I was a teenager.  It was then that I sat down, drew a picture of what I saw and jotted down a few short notes about what happened.  Although this happened some 34 years ago, it feels (the emotion of the event) as though it happened just yesterday and I remember it quite clearly. I was walking to church very early on the morning of May 5, 1965.  It was still dark as I was heading to church to serve at the 6:00am Catholic Mass.  From the subdivision where I lived there were a set of concrete steps from street level up to the back of adjoining school grounds.  I got to the top of the stairs and began walking across the rear school parking lot when a bright streak of light, off to my left, caught my eye.  I looked to the left but saw nothing.  I continued to walk around the side of the school building when again a bright streak of light caught my eye.  This time I stopped and faced the West to see if I could catch this streak of light.  After a few seconds the streak reappeared and I tried to follow the light in the direction it was traveling.  As I whirled around to my left the streak of light came to a halt (at a position about 180 degrees from when I first caught sight of it) and revealed a shape like that of a jet aircraft fuselage.  It had a tail fin but no visible side wings. It&rsquo;s overall color was light yellow, which seemed to glow and it had lightly colored bands of various colors running along the length of the fuselage.  This horizontal pattern continued up through the tail fin.   It&rsquo;s hard to determine exactly how far away this object was from me.  It was not hovering directly over me but it was stationary, off some distance in front of me as I faced the East.  It seemed to be quite huge.  I&rsquo;d say, at arm&rsquo;s length and using my thumb as a site, this object had to be some 10 feet or more in length. The object emitted no sound and there was no noticeable trail of exhaust such as there would be from a typical aircraft moving through the sky.  My gaze was so fixed on the object itself I cannot say whether or not the object&rsquo;s illumination cast light on the ground or nearby homes (less than 100 feet away) that it seemed to be hovering over.  I stood there looking at this object for what felt like a full minute.  First in awe at something I had never seen before and then extreme fright.  I turned and began to run as fast as I could around the school and toward the church.  I could feel my heart pounding and as I began to run my legs felt wobbly and I fell down.  I got up but again my legs felt very heavy and I fell a second time.  I began to cry and covered my face.  I felt that if I could cover my face I would be safer.  After what seemed like a minute or two, I got up and was finally able to run but all the while feeling like the object was still stationary in the sky.  I ran all the way to the church, opened the front door and went in.  I was 9 years old at the time. Although I always have had an interest in space exploration and science fiction I do not remember being preoccupied with such stories before this event that could have led me to dream or make up this story.  I do admit that when this event occurred I did embellish the story about physical evidence that would indicate the object did appear.  I thought that my parents or other adults would never believe me without this added information.  I had claimed at the time that a rock I threw struck the side of the object and that the object burned the top of a chain-link fence.", "Seemed to be a sattelite but for 3-5 seconds it brightened to near the brightness of Jupiter.I have been watching the skies for meteors many clear nights this summer. I have observed many high flying jets traveling to Detroit, Chicago, Indianapolis and who knows where else. I have also seen, at numerous times what appear to be satellites moving in the sky from south to north and southwest to northeast. I use a good pair of binoculars and have seen no running lights or heard any muffled roars when these satellites pass over. Last night I saw a movement near or just slightly northeast of straight up. In the first 2-3 seconds of viewing, I thought I was looking at another satellite. Then about 3 seconds into view the object brightened almost instantly to the apparent brightness of Jupiter and it was seen as about the same size of Jupiter. Approximately 3 seconds after it brightened, it started dimming again. The objest was traveling from the northeast to the south. The half moon was behind some trees to my south as I was laying. There was a row of trees blocking the moon. By the time I found the object in my binoculars ( maybe 5 more seconds ) it had dimmed and then it looked exactly like a dim satellite in motion and brightness. It disappeared from view behind the row of trees in the vicinity of the moon. There was no trail visible and the object never veered from its course. ( If I had to guess what I saw I would say I saw a satellite with the ability to instantly turn on a light source; other than that it looked like the pinpoint of light you see from passing satellites. I live @ 20 miles north northeast of Louisville International airport and am used to seeing various running lights on all types of planes. This was not an aircraft, unless, of course, it was one trying to look like a satellite. I am a 52 year old retired male who has spent most of my life looking at the sky occasionally. This is the first time I have ever reported anything like this to any organization.", "A lower orbit satellite appearing object moving unusually slow for a satellite became a billiant orange ball 3-4 times it&apos;s original size for about 5-10 seconds and then collapsed back to it&apos;s satellite appearance and contined slowly on in the same direction.A large group of people were enjoying a camp fire and watching satellites and shooting stars cross the sky, an unusually slow moving satellite moving from the north to south over Mt. Adams area caught everyone&apos;s attention.  It at first appeared to be just a satellite(small and white) and we watched it for about 5 seconds when it began inflating into a perfect sphere of solid brilliant orange light which was at least 3-4 times it&apos;s original size. It continued in the same direction and same speed displaying this absolutely gorgeous brilliant orange light-so bright that it was fire ballish in brilliance. The orange light  was absolutely opaque displaying a well defined crisp spherical shape, the light was extremely concentrated and brilliant. There was no hazy light  or fan out around the object, there was no tail.  It continued to travel as this inflated fireball for 5-10 seconds. It then deflated and returned to it&apos;s original satellite appearance (small and white) for another 5-10 seconds until it faded into the night sky. It did not change speed or direction.", "Woke up at 1am, went out onto deck outside bedroom and looked up at the sky through the trees. Saw 50 or more craft, flying West toward the coast. Silent, with blue lights glowing from underside of craft.Woke up suddenly and went out onto our deck through the sliding glass doors from our badroom. Looked up through redwoods, and saw 50 or more craft flying west. The craft looked like three disks connected with a thin bar, creating a triangle shape. The underside of the craft emminated a beautiful blue glow, and no sound was heard from where I stood, about 2 miles from the hill they were all flying over. They were moving very slowly. For some reason, instead of continuing to watch them, I went back to bed before they had moved out of my vision. I attempted to wake my husband to show him, but I curiously could not! Nothing would wake him. It seems as if someone else would have seen this, as it was such a large amount of craft that I saw.", "UFO came over house where my girlfriend and sister were. It was bright orange. It stayed, then left, and they saw it explode far up in the sky.Last night my girlfriend saw a UFO. We live in far Northern California, Humboldt County. She was at her sister&apos;s in the yard at 10:30 p.m. They were unloading fruit from the truck. She saw something come from the north. Then it came right over them, rather close like a helicopter. At first she thought it was the police, but then thought that didn&apos;t make sense, because there was no reason for the police to come. But she also noticed there was NO sound. Also, it was bright orange. It stayed over them for awhile, then suddenly turned left and took off. She knew no plane could do that. When it started spinning and took off, she said there were many different colored lights around it. It went to the left and went, but then she said something happened. Suddenly it exploded, and she described the pieces falling like pieces of a falling star. She was very frightened from the experience. She speaks Spanish mostly, but fairly good English. I know her very well, and she and her family are very wonderful and reliable people. Her husband didn&apos;t want her to say anything because he said people would think they were crazy. She and her sister both saw it happen. They know me real well (as I run a very large Neighborhood Watch) and asked me to look into who they could report it to, or if anything like that was reported by anyone else. (Also, she happens to be pregnant, which concerns me, because I study the subject of UFO&apos;s a bit.I am familiar with alien abductions, fetuses, etc. Of course I would not discuss that subject with her. Just want to give you the details.) Anyway, I don&apos;t know who to contact about this. We&apos;d like to find out if there were other reports, but living in a seme-small town, the police department is closed Saturday, and we don&apos;t know anywhere to call. There are more details that you ask for here, but I don&apos;t know the answers. She does. So I&apos;m filling out what I know. Hope to hear from you. I will put you in touch with her. (I will leave a message on your hotline if I find that number on your website, so I have marked the box below, in advance of making the call.)My friend saw a UFO in the sky at night. It came towards them and stayed above them for awhile. Then it took off, and seemed to explode.((NUFORC Note:  The following text is the first report submitted by the same sourcs.))Last night a girlfriend of mine, saw an unidentified object in the sky. We&apos;ll call her Lucia (she wishes to remain anonymous). Lucia was driving to her sister&apos;s about 10:00 p.m. Her sister lives in a trailer park. When Lucia turned into the driveway of the park, there was a very bright beam of light coming from an object that was located ahead of her (north). It was low in the sky and the beam of light shone at a slight degree just above her. She was startled at the light and the object. So she turned left into the trailer park and parked in front of her sister&apos;s house. She was frightened and honked her horn so her sister would come out. Lucia&apos;s sister, and her sister&apos;s boyfriend came out of the house. At that point, looking to the north, the object no longer had a beam of light coming from it, but it came over the trees and then stayed stationary right over the house. It was very hard for me to determine how large the object appeared to them, as Lucia speaks limited English and her sister only speaks Spanish, however an enterpretor was there. Lucia&apos;s sister said when she came out of the house, it was about 10:15 p.m. The three speculated as to what the object could be. When she first observed it while driving, Lucia thought it was a helicopter, but after seeing it out of the car, it did not appear to be a helicoper. It appeared to be a large orange-like object. Lucia also noted and said to the others that it made no noise. They all agreed it was not an airplane, as it was stationary in the air above them. They were all frightened. Then after about 10-15 minutes, the object started whirling...spinning, and three lights appeared when that happened. The lights were different colors. When that happened the object immediately headed eastbound, but still at a lower altitude. Suddenly, Lucia said they saw what appeared to be an explosion...like two pieces (like falling stars they said), falling down from the object. At that it disappeared. They thought it exploded, which accounted for why they couldn&apos;t see it anymore. They said it did look like an explosion. When they came back into the house, it was about 10:30p.m. The thing I was most concerned with is the fact that Lucia is pregnant. Knowing what I have researched about alien abductions, I am concerned (however, did not tell her that). As we were all talking today about the incident, I asked if anything strange or unusual ever happened to them. Lucia&apos;s sister said there have been many UFO&apos;s seen in Mexico. Lucia&apos;s sister said when she was 14 yrs. old she lived in Colima, Mexico. At about 10:30 p.m. she went outside to use the outhouse. She found herself back in her home at about 3:00 a.m. She didn&apos;t know what had happened to her and mentioned it to her mother. She emphasized to me, while telling me the story, that she was extrememly nervous and upset after the episode of missing time. Anyway, her mother said she was imagining things, that she was crazy, and not to talk about it. Still, later in years, when she was about 3 months pregnant with her child (now 10), she was living in Santa Ana, California, in a house that was not well lit by the sun. One day a very bright light shone through the windows, and she collapsed on the bed. She awoke sometime later, and had some marks on her body. Her husband thought they were &quot;hickeys&quot; from another man. As Lucia said, it was the main reason her sister&apos;s marriage broke up. Today Lucia&apos;s sister she said she was very disturbed about what she saw last night. She said it brought back those memories of what I just stated happened to her. She is very nervous now and wishes she never saw the object, because she is afraid. Her boyfriend would not speak about it. Lucia said he is scared. Lucia and her sister said, that once you see an object like that, you will surely see it again, and they are both afraid.", "I noticed what I thought was a star shining way too brightly. I called my wife to have a look and she confirmed that it was no star. There seemed to be many colors flashing.1 object was seen about 10 inches above the northern mountains ( approx 15 miles distant )There seemed to be a series of pulses of red, amber and green with the occasional blue which was brighter than the other colors. It was moving very slowly in an eastern direction. We scanned the sky and noticed another to the east much farther off and another to the west which was much brighter and semmed to be much closer. I looked with my binoculars and could actualy see that the closest object to the west of us looked to be revolving with the light patterns. My wife looked and confirmed what I was seeing. The fourth object appeared close to the first object and could be seen moving in an easterly direction and went out of sight behind a tree. I&apos;m no expert in judging distances, but I estimate that the closest object in the west had to be at least 100 feet in diameter for us to see it so clearly. It did not appear saucer like at all, but rather more spherical.", "Hovering over mountain about 10kms away from our house.

Stars do not move arround as this did and, satelights hold a steady course. Ionly noticed this point of light becauseits behaviour was very unusual.  It was able to move at great speed from a standing start and then stop abruptly.  No speeding up or slowing down. It did this aeveral times, in random directions over both land and sea . There was one other witness, a woman I am no longer in contact with.  I think she was a primary school teacher from New Zealand.  She hadn&apos;t been on a yacht at sea befor she was helping me on my watch, I was telling her about stars and satelights to calm her nerves, which was how we came to notice it.  I am not sure of the duration of time we could see it because a fleet of trawlers arrived and I had to consentrate  on sailing by them.  When I looked afterwards it was gone The boats name was ((name of boat deleted)) she was registered in London, I wrote the sighting down in the log book.  No one Ihave asked has any suggestions what it could have been.  I have not seen another UFO before or since.", "Hunter views UFO and is later buzzed by two military aircraft.It was a cold, clear morning sometime in December of 1998. I had been out hunting from a tree stand on my in-law&apos;s private land, which is several hundred acres within the Holly Ridge swamplands, off of highway 210. My tree stand was about 75 to 100 feet high with a clear view in all directions. The entire time I observed numerous commerical or military aircraft flying at high altitudes (out of hearing range), leaving the usual contrails over the entire sky (there is a military base about an hour from my position). I thought nothing of it at the time, other than I had never seen so many contrails in that area before. At approximately 11:00 am, I descended from my tree stand and started walking back to my truck, which is about a 20 minute walk. At one point I heard a jet flying high above me, and I looked up to see a small, white jet moving north-west and leaving a contrail. A bright metallic object then caught my eye, which was close to where the jet had just passed, except it seemed a much lower altitude than the jet itself. The chrome object was stationary, was directly above me, and made no noise and left no contrail, which is probably why it had caught my attention considering everything else I was seeing left a trail of some sort. It seemed like the shape of an egg or sphere. I stood there staring at it for about a minute, when it then proceeded to move slowly in the opposite direction from where the jet was heading. I had to back up a bit to continue watching as it was disappearing behind some trees. After another minute or two of observation, the object simply vanished. I watched for several more minutes and did not see it again. I then proceeded to my truck and drove home. The following may or may not be related to my sighting, but it is certainly worth mentioning. As my hunt was unsuccessful, the next day I returned to the same location. This time it was a cloudy, wet day. At approximately 9:00am, I heard several jet engines approaching from behind my position in the tree stand. Keep in mind that my stand is very high, as I am sitting above the tops of most of the other trees in my vision. I looked to my left and observed two military F16 or F15 (?) class fighter jets flying at a low altitude. As they passed, I picked up my binoculars and viewed them for a closer look. They were moving at a very rapid speed and quite low to the ground, and I think they were using their afterburners, as I could see the flame emitting from the engines. As they passed my position, they seemed to slow down and the afterburners were shut off. A short moment later they began maneuvering back into my direction, this time seemingly heading right for me, at a much slower speed. I was awestruck when they headed right for me at an incredibly low altitude. As they approached my position, the noise from the jet engines was almost painfully loud. One of the jets broke left and the other right from where I was sitting. They literally buzzed my tree stand from both sides, so close that I could easily see the pilots in the aircraft. They must have been no more than 75 yards on either side of me and just a little bit above the tree tops. The one on my right banked as it passed me, showing me a clear view of the plane&apos;s underbelly. When I first described this incident to me family, I remember mentioning that they were so close that I could see the bolts holding the jet together. After they buzzed me they turned around again and proceeded in the direction they were originally heading before they decided to freak the hell out of me. Shortly thereafter I got back to my truck and went home. I believe that was the last time I hunted on that land since it was the end of the season, and have since moved out of the a! rea.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.

It traveled an approximate distance of 150 miles in the sky at an elevation of around 20,000 feet. It crossed this expanse of sky in less than 1 second. From this point of A to B, it then did an 90 degree turn and traveled from east to west where it traveled in this dash pattern for approximately 50 miles in the sky in a split second where it simply vanished.", "While I was looking at the Moon, through my telescope. I noticed a black spec. I then blinked to make sure it was not something in my eye. Upon further inspection I noticed this spec was circular and very black. I also noticed a shadow underneath it on the surface of the moon. The moon was approximately half full and the object was moving in the middle of the illuminated area and traveled in a straight line toward the dark half. I watched it until it disappeared in the darkness and kept watch for the next hour in hopes of seeing it again but to no avail. This object would have to be hundreds of feet in diameter for me to be able to see it. So I researched Lunar orbiters and found that the biggest one was about 2 meters in diameter, which would be impossible to see. So what was it?? Has anyone else seen something similar??", "2 craft appeared from the west chasing one another acrost the sky before they took off down the ohio riverand out of siteThe objects i viewed cme into my view over harmer hill on the western side of Marietta.

My brother distinctly recalls itbeing the day after the July 4th celebrations. Here are more details of the sighting: I am a UFO investigator in the Yukon Territory and am submitting this report on the behalf of my brother who had a UFO sighting near Chicago. I interviewed him on July 22nd. He is on the road a lot so if you need further information from him just contact myself. The map attached shows the witness was driving along I-90 south eastbound. The witness first observed the object at point A and last observed it at point B.  Arrows indicate the approximate direction of the UFO at both points; A and B. The curve in the road allows for a nice triangulation if the object was stationary. It appeared to be stationary to the witness. He initially thought it might be a blimp or a tethered balloon, perhaps something to do with the July 4th celebrations. However, the cylindrical and slightly tapered shape perplexed him. Didn&apos;t match the shape of a blimp or balloon (See attached drawing). The object looked fairly large and was just above the horizon and an estimated few thousand feet up. It was gray in color He observed the object for an estimated 5 to 10 minutes while driving between points A and B and lost it due to the right-hand curve in the freeway at point B. The turn caused his vehicle to face away from the object. The time was roughly 3 in the afternoon. The sun was shining but the overall sky had a whitish-greyish cast, it wasn&apos;t a clear blue sky. Hope this is of use. It may be possible to inquire in the area if there was some sort strange shaped blimp/ballon in the area the day after July 4th holiday. Please let me know if you find out anything. Sincerely ((name deleted))Whitehorse, YT (867)((number deleted))", "Moving very slow. Then it disappearedMy friend and I are realy into looking for the paranormal and U.F.O. conspiracy. We were laying on the trapoline looking at the stars, and then we saw a slow moving object.

It was going around in circles, reversing direction, stopping, accelerating, and then slowing down,then it would speed back up and circle around and back and forth, it was crazy. It was very far away, big, and flew all the way from one side of the sky to the other on the horizon as fast as you could move your arm with a sparkler on 4th of July. It freaked my wife out. All of a sudden she wanted to know about ufos. I own 2 local businesses, my wifes a legal secratary. It wasnt a helecoptor, meteor or anything easily explained, and it definately was controlled by something. It flew off and got so far away we couldnt see it anymore, it just faded out. It was a crystal clear night, you could see every star in the sky. We arent nuts. There was a commercial aircraft flying with wing lights flying that was closer and lower then it, and it was going way slower then the ufo. It was silent.

All lights went out, the radio, all electrical equipment, while the engine kept running.  I got out of the vehicle to see what was wrong and heard a loud humming.  I could not see anything even though it was a clear night.  The trees and a nearby water tower blocked the view that I thought was near the sound I heard.  This was a realtively new vehicle at the time and had never experienced any electrical problems whatsoever.  It never experienced any electrical problems after the incidents.  While I am not certain it was connected to a UFO sighting, I had heard of vehicles that had experienced UFO&apos;s with the same type of symptons.  I am interested if any other folks have experienced similar incidents. I will never forget the erie feeling that I had, especially after it happend three times in a row in the exact same place at about the exact time.After my first encounter with the incident I made it a point to drive slowly through the same area during the next htree evenings thinking that something might be wrong with my vehicle.  Nothing was wrong with my vehicle.

It was raining slightly and foggy. About one mile south of the I-45 and Loop 610 Interchange, almost at the Hobby Airport exit, we all three saw a bright green sphere that moved parallel to the freeway, about 150-200 feet from the ground. It didn&apos;t make any sound. The object was almost in the clouds or fog and it cast a bright green glow in the fog and clouds directly over it. The object then changed direction; it turned slightly left and crossed over the freeway, headed south-southeast (towards Clear Lake and the NASA headquarters). When it was on the other side of the freeway, we could also see a deep blue color on the lower 1/3 of the sphere, but the green glow was much brighter. It then disappeared in the clouds. In order to calm ourselves, we all assumed that this was a meteor or maybe an aircraft heading toward NASA that was partially obscured by the fog. This happened 10 years ago and I remember it as if it were yesterday. At the time this happened, all three of us were employed as clinical chemists at a major hospital located in the Texas Medical Center.", "Spotted flying approx 250 ft above rooftops, craft 100ft long approx.  Six to eight lights on each side of central red light.  Hovering and slowing over Rookery Park area of Calne.  No noise at all.  RAF Lyneham stated that only one Hercules aircraft was flying over the area at the time.  Does not fit the physical description, sound of that type of aircraft.Leaving Rookery Park area by car, the two of us noticed lights above the rooftops.  They were in a straight line, 6 to 8 white lights on either side of a red central light.  The object seemed to be hovering horizontally some 250 ft above the rooftops and appeared to be about 100 ft long.  We stopped the car and got out to listen.  We couldnt hear anything.  The only aircraft flying in the area was a Hercules from RAF Lyneham.  We often have Hercules flying over the town and they have a distinctive drone sound, are easily identifiable.  We called Air Traffic Control who couldnt say what we had seen, although they said it had too many lights for a Hercules.  The object seemed to move sideways through the air, without &apos;banking&apos; to turn and began to hover.  At this point we lost sight of it.  We could not see any other features apart from the row of lights.", "Translucent watery appearance with waves like heat waves.While driving to work this morning at 7:45 AM on the west side Mississippi River Road North, which paralles the Mississippi River and it&apos;s levee; Out of the corner of my eye, I saw what was thought at first to be a flock of large birds flying in a V formation, not an  uncommon sight in this area.  Upon looking directly at it, I saw an object which had a definate triangular shape, but transparent, with a watery, wavy appearance, like heat waves seen on the highway from a distance. The outer &quot;frame&quot; of the object appeared more prodominate that its&apos; interior.  The weather here has been rainy for the last 24 hours, the atmosphere, although not foggy, was heavy with humidity and misting rain.  I observed the object fly in a silent sweeping motion across the sky, in an easterly direction from a sugar cane field across the River Road, across the levee and out of sight.  It&apos;s altitude was approximately 100 feet, its speed was approximately 80-90 mph.  It&apos;s size was approximately that of a midsized passenger airplane.  I&apos;m guessing about it&apos;s size, altitude and speed, however, it was plainly visable, although transparent, &quot;a clear mercury look&quot; . I even blinked my eyes thinking that I was seeing &quot;spots&quot;, the object was still there.", "as (craft) ? travelled S. it&apos;s narrow end was forward, it was a shinny metallic in tone.Clear skies, 12 noon. I was glancing about the tree tops at my home and noticed this shinny metallic object, I live near a Reserve Air base so seeing aircraft is typical we have a stelth here and many tankers. This object was just not right, it was silent, and travelled at a altitude that was upper mid levels, to low to be commercial and to high to be leaving the base. It&apos;s speed was not extremely fast. ( if you held a quarter up to the sky, it would travel the span in 3 or 4 seconds at upper mid levels about 15 to 20 thousand ft.) It had no contrails and with a passing of a cold front it should be cold enough at that elevation to produce them. It had no propellers as in Heicopter, nor did I view it to have wings. It also made a no banking turn to the south east. Than out of my sight range. I had a son run to get my camera but was to late. At these levels I could see that the ( craft) was a egg shaped more short than long. My observation skills are good, I am a meteorology student, working on METAR. I am open minded, I believe I have had a several spanning year contact beginning at the age of 7, and have never told anyone till this moment.", "We witnessed a large peach-colored cigar-shaped object move at a high rate of speed in a southerly direction.The object caught my attention because of it&apos;s unusual color. We live on a high ridge between the Sea-Tac airport and Boeing Field, and are used to seeing all types of aircraft at all hours of the day and night. This thing was not like anything I&apos;ve ever seen! I ran back in the house and grabbed my binoculars. My husband joined me in the yard where we watched it appear in the gaps between the trees, until it grew so small it disappeared. I estimate it followed I-5 southbound. The total elapsed time from first spotting it until it disappeared covered several minutes.", "bright light fading to dim, followed by another dim light, both disappeared.Sitting by the shore, noticed a BRIGHT light overhead tracking to the southeast.While I thought it was an airplane ( it was a circular light much brighter than a planet - venus/jupiter) for a moment the light suddenly dimmed and then it appeared to look like a satelite tracking through the sky from the left to the right while looking east over the ocean only a second later it suddenly dissapeared. It was a very clear night and plenty if other stars visable. It completely faded away and not into the horizon, was still relatively overhead. At same instant it disappeared another light not as bright was noticed tracking in the same direction on a different track at a slightly higher speed. This light stayed at a steady intensity without the bright flash that the other had made in the same spot. The second light dissapeared at a spot ahead of where the first had vanished.", "I saw a glowing orange oval shaped craft hovering in the southern sky.I hope this information can be of use to you. Sorry for the delay in filing a report. I live in central NJ in Middlesex County. As I am an avid skywatcher, and we are on the flight path of Newark Airport, I see many airplanes at various levels of the sky. (Not to mention the chemtrails.) On Sunday July 11, 1999, in Sayreville, NJ, travelling south on a local road in my car I glanced at the wide open sky and saw slightly to my right, a light, obviously a plane. Scanning left, almost in front of me, I saw another light, again, obviously a plane. (Both were high in the sky.) I continued to look and slightly to my left (almost due south) when I saw the &apos;object&apos;. It was like, plane, plane, &quot;Oh, my god, what is that??&quot; The &apos;object&apos; was a large roundish oval. It was about the length of a bic lighter held at arm&apos;s length, maybe a little longer. It glowed with an orange glow. The glow sort of looked like the glow of a light bulb when there isn&apos;t enough power going to it. On the top of the oval was some sort of cabin-like structure that sat close to the top of the object and closely matched the curve of the oval. It could have been easily missed as it was the same glowing orange color. There were possibly windows or something on this &apos;cabin&apos; but it was hard to see as it was so close to the main body of the object. There were three lights on the bottom, one at the &apos;front&apos; one in the &apos;middle&apos;, and one at the &apos;end&apos; that lit quickly in sequence, the first one on/off, the second one on/off, then the third one on/off. I remember red and green but I don&apos;t recall the middle light&apos;s color. I have seen many blimps fly over and it was not a blimp or any other type of flying vehicle I had ever seen before. Also there were no &apos;tail fins&apos; and it had a smooth bottom with no cabin. I didn&apos;t notice any noise, but if it made any I was probably to far away to hear it anyway. It didn&apos;t have a distinct outline like a blimp, but you could see the roundish-oval shape clearly. It hovered and didn&apos;t seem to be moving. Unfortunately, I was moving. I glanced in my mirror and saw I couldn&apos;t pull over and the driver behind me didn&apos;t seem to be looking at it. I was alone at the time. It was about 6:30 or 7 pm and the sun was just starting to set. It would have been easy to miss the object, despite it&apos;s size I guess because of the dull glow and the color of the sky. I lost sight of it in a cluster of trees and couldn&apos;t see it again because of them. This is my first sighting despite many hours of skywatching and I hope you can use this.If you need to contact me e-mail me a number and I can call back during the day as I work nights. If possible I will try to send a drawing via snail mail.", "I was going S/B on Hwy 75 on my cycle when I saw a dull orange glow at approx. 30 degrees up directly ahead of me over the road. As I approached this glow it suddenly extinguished, but this occurred with the top and rightside and then the leftside being turned off one after the other. I now knew this was some type of craft and I could still see the black shape in the clear/bright night sky. I slowed my cycle and pulled almost directly under the object, which was still hovering but making no sound that I could hear over my cycle&apos;s noise.  As I stopped beneath I would est. it to be the size of a hockey puck at arms length.  Now the hair on the back of my neck stood up and I got goose bumps and a chill all over my body.  I then decided descretion is the better part of valor and took off.  I went about a half mile and stopped but could no longer find the object in the sky.Description: About the size of a hockey puck at arms length, disk shaped with a flat bottom and some type of dome in the center top which tapered towards the outer edge.  As I got more underneath I could only see the black circular shape with no lights or any distinctive features seen.  This craft hovered the entire time and I observed no movement and could hear no sound coming from it.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke over the telephone with this witness, and found him to be extremely credible.

A silvery &quot;cigar&quot; rose vertically out of the huge canyon to the north of the Bear Valley Ski Resort parking lot off Highway 4 about 20 miles west of the state line. The &quot;cigar&quot; was inclined about 65 degrees like /, but rose nearly straight up, maybe 80 degrees. The direction it rose was SE to SSE and it&apos;s path was probably an arc. It rose to a spot near overhead in about 3 seconds &amp; I then lost site of it. The UFO object was probably a disk seen from the side (cigar shape) of about 20&apos; to 30&apos; feet. When I first observed it, I was looking through my good quality binoculars and actually tracked it for a second or so. I then picked it up again when it was overhead without the glasses.

This would place the onbect roughly over The Geysers, a famous geothermal field run by Unocal Geothermal and PG&amp;E (which was originally developed by my grandfather and his mercury mining associates, and curiously enough also where my father worked as production foreman). This object made no sound, was surrounded by a faint glwoing aura and left a glowing luminous train which gradually tapered off to nothing. Both Paul and myself stood on the front porch watching the object slwoly slip behind the ridgeline, as if it was coming in to make a nice, gentle landing. Once the object slipped from view, both of us seemed to snap out of our amazment induced shock and proceeded to verify that we had both seen the same thing. I have personally seen 14 UFOs in my life, 4 of which I cannot dismiss as some other phenomena.

We were very near and just to the east of McCrory, AR, we saw the following: We witnessed a triangular shaped object in the western sky above the town over McCrory.  It was about the size of a man&apos;s thumbnail, if your arm was fully extended.  It was on it&apos;s side (?) as we could see all three points of the triangle at the same time.  It was white not silver in color. The strange part of this sighting is that it was moving (in my opinion) slow but it left a streak or trail behind it - as wide as what it was.  I viewed it for about 10 to 15 seconds, my wife for 5 to 10 seconds - the tail extended from one side of our windshield (passenger side) to almost directly in front of the drive.  It then vanished - not just the object, but the trail as well.  There was no trace of anything. The object was traveling to the south; it was a clear sky.

It was pitch black, and I suddenly noticed a white streak of light off to the right at about 60 degrees above the horizon.  I looked like a very bright meteor tail, and I expected it to burn up in the sky as others I have seen do.  What was unusual about it was that it was a very bright white streak, and somewhat broader than others I have seen.  I watched it as it did not burn up, but instead suddently displayed a bright, almost luminous green ball at the exteme end of it.  This was quite amazing.  It then suddenly disappeared.

As we approached the main road, we saw dozens of cars pulled off the main road (Rte 165 - 3 miles north of Jarrettsville) and people scrambling up the embankments to watch what we were also witnessing.  The lights looked like the headlights of a very large jetliner, but as it came closer we realized that they were too low to the ground and too big to be jetliner lights. And as it came closer and went overhead (apxy 20-30 feet above us), it had NO sound, NO shape of any craft joining the lights together.  They travelled in unison, going maybe 10-20 mph.  As they drifted silently above us, several of us reached up like we were trying to touch it, it felt that close.  The really strange thing was that after it went over, the lights were still visible (as headlights would not be going in the opposite direction).  Everyone stood quietly mesmerized until it disappeared over the Eastern horizon. When it finally disappeared everyone just sort of looked at one another and let out a nervous whispered giggle and said &quot;What the hell was THAT!?!&quot;  No one knew.

It made no noise.My friend and I and her two daughters were in the parking lot of her apartment complex in Norman OK.  I was suddenly compelled to look up in the sky, along with my friend Maria and her older daughter, Joanna.  The three of us saw the object, which we all believe we only saw half of it.  It was spherical in shape with extensions surrounding it. It appeared to be coming out of a cloud, but the night was clear.  It appeared to be like a floating shadow.  There was no noise coming from it.  Within a matter of seconds, it disappeared. Joanna, who was nine at the time, described it as a floating dragon and later drew a picture of the floating object.  The only possible explanation is that it was some type of test plane from nearby Tinker AFB in Midwest City, OK.  It was not shaped in any manner like a plane that I am familiar with.  There were no other aircraft in the vicinity when we saw the object.", "The object was a distorted mass of some sort that moved in a northwest direction across the sky,not real fast but not slow either.On Thursday night 08/05/99 around 10:30pm my wife,our son and I had just finished preparing for my wifes rummage sale the next morning and as it was such a nice evening we decided to relax outdoors and stargaze for a while. We had watched a number of airliners fly over we assumed they were all out fo the twin cities. We had watched a couple of satallites move across the sky. We had also witnessed what seemed to be a short meteor shower with some leaving very brilliant orange trails behind them. At around 11:15pm or so my wife and son had decided to go inside. I remained outdoors for a little longer just hoping to see more of the show. As I sat looking up at the sky looking southward as we had been I noticed some movement from my left. When I turned to focus on it what I saw is very hard to descibe. It seemed like a patch of the sky had a wavy transparent distortion, somewhat oval shaped and moving within itself. It made no sound at all. There were&apos;nt any blinking lights as I recall. It was like looking through a magnifying glass about 8 to 10 inches away from your eye. I only saw it for about 15 to 20 seconds as it moved in a northwest direction at around a 60 degree angle up from the horizon. The sky was very clear. The temp. was about 70 degrees. I&apos;m 41 years old, I work as a Dept.Manager for a local retail store. My family and I have always enjoyed looking at the night sky. This is the first time I have ever seen anything like this.

Many other events, one involving screen memory.Ship was dull orange on sides, bottom was brilliant white with a blue beam of light amidships.  I saw the craft on Pamalee Drive hovering just behind Highland Nursing Home.  Craft was long and cylindrical, with a disk in front that was the full diameter, and a forth as high.  I could send you a drawing if you like as it is very difficult to visualize.  The man that was with me recalls nothing of the event, while I remember seeing it for about ten to fifteen minutes.  I was not afraid of this craft, though I knew in my heart it was from another world.  The bottom of the craft was flat, the top a half circle, and the back when it took off was flat with what appeared to be cargo doors.  When the craft took off, it slowly gained altitude and moved forward, much like a helicopter.  After this slow ascent, it moved so fast that it was on the outer fringes of the earths atmosphere in less than a second, spewing out long streaks of white light behind it.  My friend is a recovering alcoholic, and has no memory of the incident.

It was still dark and I noticed a small jet plane fly by very low...extremely low actually.  It appeared to be a small passenger jet plane.  It made noise as it turned and gained altitude towards the south. After that I saw something just above the tree line but very far away that looked like a star with a red tint.  It was a little brighter than the brightest star in the orion constellation which was to the right of it by about 10 degrees from my vantage point.  Then I saw that the light was bobbing and moving left and right in an irregular fashion. It was changing direction and moving very quickly.  I watch it for about 20 seconds from my window as it moved around above the tree line and then decided to run outside to watch...when I got outside it was gone. I went back inside a looked for it for another 30 minutes from the window but it did not reappear.  I just wanted to report it in case there were other sightings.  It was brief but spooky. It was not moving in a smooth fashion as I&apos;ve seen traditional aircraft move....it moved quickly up and down and left and right. From my perspective it appeared to move only an inch or two in relation to the trees....and if it hadn&apos;t been moving, I&apos;d say it was a star.  If it hadn&apos;t appeared so long, I&apos;d say it was a meteorite.  It did not appear to be a satellite because it changed directions.  The light emited from it was not blinking.", "Green Light seen to pass east to west looking south , no sound heard.I had just gone outside to shut my garage door ,when I noticed what appeared to be a green flare in the  western sky.

It was about 10:00p.m. when I decided to put in a cd rather than listen to the radio. I was fooling with the stereo when two triangular crafts just above the treetops caught my attention. You must understand that the view I received didn&apos;t allow for more than a glimpse. The crafts had amber colored lights on every angle of them. And you could barely make out the shape of them because they blended in with the rest of the night sky. Their size was about 100 feet across. Speed must have been about 35 m.p.h. No noise was heard. It&apos;s funny cause when I spotted them I said, &quot;What&apos;s that?!&quot; &quot;Do you see that?!&quot; and my friend said they were just helicopters.

The object&apos;s only sound was a &quot;whoosh&quot; sound that produced a classic doppler effect.At approx 0205 on 07/19/99 I was fuelling my truck at our terminal in Lincoln Neb. I was alone on the fuel island at the time. I was startled by a loud-sudden sound slightly behind and above me (approx 25-30 degrees from straight overhead). I instinctively looked over my right shoulder and realized that I was under the awning of the fuel island and the lights had ruined my night vision. I followed the sound with my eyes hoping to see something as it passed into view on the other side of the awning but I saw nothing.  The only sound from the object was the aural &quot;whoosh&quot; of something cutting through the air, there were no other sounds such as turbine or prop that would be associated with a conventional aircraft.  The total duration of sound from the object was 3-4 seconds and produced a very clear doppler effect as it CPA&apos;d my position, indicating &quot;a very high rate of speed&quot;!!!

It appeared to be a landing light from an aircraft which was much to low to clear the mountains for a landing in San Jose. On my way outside I noticed the time as 12:44 am. The craft passed over at approx. 1-2000 ft. and at a viewing angle of approx. 45 degrees from vertical. It was approx. the length of an airliner and cylinder shaped and rounded at both ends. There were 7 round porthole shaped openings along the side and 5 square areas colored as if subjected to heat. There was a horizontal circular ring that had movement like liquid moving around the ring. There were vertical lines of descending from the rings that came together as an apex to form a cone. The cone in front was a light gray color and the one at the rear looked like liquid gold moving around the ring and upt the vertical lines. When it passed from my view I returned inside my house and took note of the time. It was 12:49am. The next day I took compass bearings and determined its course at approx. 355 degrees magnetic.", "Large sphere and cylinder space junk reentering atmosphere southeasterly of San Francisco probably in Central Valley or Nevada.First of all I have seen an upper atmosphere/space vehicle launch from Vandenberg AFB when I was in San Diego and noticed the perfect cone of the rocket exhaust. Now that was similar to what I saw on this day except they appeared to be reentering. In San Francisco driving south on Highway 101 before Silver Street, I saw in the upper atmosphere at about 11 o&apos;clock and to the southeast two objects. One was circular, probably a sphere, and the other was an elongated rectangle, probably a cylinder, like a rocket body.  I got several glimpses between watching the traffic. I was surprised it was not on the news because it was so obvious. The objects were descending, not much at first but it was easy to tell that the descent was like a parabolic curve because the last I saw them the attitude was almost directly down and they had moved from 11 o&apos;clock in the sky to about 9:30. The objects had cone-like vapor trails. The cylinder was at an oblique angle to the direction of travel and to the cone trail.  Their final direction was SE sort of towards Mt. Hamilton but much further away I think. The entire incident was less than 30 seconds probably about 10 to 15 seconds. By the time I got to the next offramp they were gone. The size of the cylinder and cone-trail was about a little bigger than a full moon, maybe larger as it descended. The sphere&apos;s cone trail was roughly about &frac14; as big as the cylinder&apos;s cone trail. It was hard to see the sphere and cylinder, sort of like a very distant, high altitude jet. Together they occupied a section of sky about 4 to 8 moons across. They traveled pretty much together even though their relation to each may have changed some.  They were not attached, but probably were attached at one time. It looked like a reentering rocket and satellite that would crash somewhere. If needed I may be able to give a good date and line up from the freeway to some hills and the objects.", "Object traveling high speed from an westerly to a southerly direction at a 90 degree angle.  No disruption in speed.Between February and April 1995, as I was leaving for work (CHP Officer) around 2030 hours, I was getting into my truck, which was parking facing in a southerly direction.  As I was entering the door of my vehicle, I glanced up to the south and observed a rapidly moving, star like object, traveling in a westerly direction. I continued to watch the object for 2 to 3 seconds, at which point it abruptly changed directions, without slowing and continued in a southerly direction.  The object appeared to be headed away from earth and was out of sight in another 2 or 3 seconds.", "Appeared at first to be just another meteor burning on entry, but it stopped moving and started a random controlled flashing.Not a Hundred percent on the date but I&apos;m almost sure it was in the early morning hours.  My wife was out and I was up outside waiting for her looking up to see the stars.  I was hoping to see a falling star so that I could make a wish (nothing else to do I guess..) Looking towards the stars I started to not stare any any particular one but adjusted my eyes so that I could look sort of in oblivion and take in as much starlight as I could and there it was..out of the corner of my eye I saw a shooting star and looked in that direction when I saw a flash liske that of an high altitude aircraft.  It was hard to make out exactly where the flash was so while staring in the general direction I again stared not at a perticular place but took in as much strlight as I could thinking I&apos;ll track the aircraft.  No such luck, there was the flash again and in the same position and again the flash, still in the same position, I&apos;m now staring at the exact postion but looking about 3- 5 degress to the right of it because of the natural night vision the eyes have. I saw the flash about two more times and out of the corner of my eye I saw again what I thought was a meteor on re-entry.  I have given this sighting a lot of thought and in the end what I have concluded is that the speed at which the object was travelling given it&apos;s random flashing of light it appeared to me as a falling star or meteor burning up on earth entry while in fact this was not the case. This sighting was a high altitute sighting, quite possibly in the FL80 range or higher...(80,000) I also reported the sighting to the US Air Force Air Station here in Antigua and was surprised to learn that I was the second person to call confirming such a sighting.", "we saw a craft as we were driving down the road.As we drove down the road heading north.  We saw this object towards the east.  It was pretty low.  We could distinctly make out the shap of it.  It was like a disc.  It appeared as if it wasn&apos;t moving.  It was pretty bright as well.

What was strange was the fact that it was clearly visible in the daylight which could rule out any small comets. This would mean that it was of emmense size with equal brightness as the sun out in space, or was in Earth&apos;s atmosphere above the clouds. It couldn&apos;t have been an aircraft as it was too fast and left too short a trail.", "This is not a vehicle but a most unusual event in the sky.   It is the appearance of wide, transluscent line coming out of the western horizon and extending overhead.I&apos;m not reporting a vehicle, but rather an &quot;event&quot; in the sky.  This event occured while driving on I-35 between Kansas City and Emporia Kansas at approximately 11AM.  I had earlier in the morning called attention to chemtrail activity over Kansas City Missouri to my 18 year old daughter who was a passenger in the car with me. The incident I am reporting however is a gray line that appeared to emerge from the distant horizon.  This gray, translucent line appeared to be about two inches wide when measured against my outstretched fist. I had a sense this may have been electrical in nature. The line extended from the horizon to directly overhead.  I opened the sunroof of the car so my daughter could determine how far the line ran above and behind the car. Overhead, however, we saw a high altitude plane leaving a contrail behind it and the plane was precisely following the gray line.  The gray line gradually faded and disappeared completely approximately seven minutes after we first noticed it. The plane continued ahead of us leaving its contrail. I have just recently become aware of chemtrails but in my reading about them thus far I&apos;ve not heard anyone mention the gray line coming up out of the horizon.  Has this previously been reported?  Is there a known significance? Frankly this was one of the strangest things I&apos;ve seen and it left both my daughter and me with a real, unsettling feeling.", "I saw a bright light appear directly above me in the sky.  It was moving slowly and was not a shooting star or the lights on a plane.  It was about 10 times larger than the brightest star in the sky.  It was traveling horizontally and remained in sight about 8 - 10 seconds before it went out.I was on our deck about l0:00 pm leaning back in a lounge chair and looking up at the night sky.  A bright light suddenly apeared directly overhead travelling from the northwest towards the southeast.  It looked just like a bright flash of light that remained in sight much longer than a flash should is the best I can describe it. It was in my sight for about 8 - 10 seconds.  It was moving steadily and not very fast like a shooting star would travel.  It was one large light about the light density and size of 10 times the brightest star in the sky at the time. The distance that it travelled was equal to the distance from my index finger to my thumb held at arms length.  It appeared instantly, moving slowly, and then went out instantly. I live near a small airport and have seen airplanes fly over my house at night so my first thought was that it was a plane. I then realized I had never seen a light on a plane that was that big or that bright, or a light that turned on and then turned off like that.  It was travelling away from the airport and not towards the direction of the airport. I could not hear a plane and can hear the planes that take off and come in to land that pass over my house. We recently had 4th of July fireworks going off around town and it was not like a flare, rocket or fireworks--it did not go up and then down.  It appeared to be high, directly overhead and moved horizontally in a straight line before it disappeared.  It did not disappear from going out of sight into the distance but seemed to just turn off while still directly overhead.", "I was getting ready to go to bed at approximately 11:00 p.m. and noticed a bright white light in the sky surrounded by a fiery colored lights around it.  It was too bright to be a star and that is one reason I continued to watch it. It was still and then began to move to the ground.  It stayed on the ground approximately 5-10 minutes and then moved back up in the sky at the same location it was before.  It slowly starting moving horizontal toward the west until it dissapeared.  I have three other witnesses besides myself.  We live in a very secluded area on a large farm hundreds of acres between all neighbor&apos;s property.

Approx. 5-10 mins later, I looked up and the &quot;base&quot; of the tail (where it began) began to enlarge, brighten and take on a spherical shape as the entire length of trail became brighter (no color-just white).

We observed the North Star, Big Dipper, etc. and we saw a number of airplanes also pass by.  At approximately 10:00 PM, I noticed what I first thought was a small formation of birds flying overhead.  I told my sons to look; my 15-year son had seen them before I said to look.  He happened to be looking at the spot in the sky where they appeared.  My 8-year-old scoured the sky and then saw them in about 2-3 seconds.  It occurred to me that birds do not glow and that they flap their wings. These objects had what appeared to be fixed stubby wings crossing a relatively short body compared with conventional aircraft.  They were flying at about the height one would think high-flying birds might fly (which I guess is why I at first thought they were birds).  There seemed to be no noise surrounding these objects.  They were flying fast (perhaps twice the speed of the jets that we had seen pass overhead), in perfect formation (diagonally?) three across and emitted a dull but penetrating orange/brown/yellow glow.

NM at 10:30 p.m.Thursday night, June 10th.  I was in passenger seat looking at millions of stars.  Noticed two intensely bright stars in the northern sky, about 20-25 degrees above the horizon, and asked my fiancee to pull over so I could look at them.  They were, at that time, parallel to the car.  Watched them for about a minute then got out the binoculars to see if we could see what they were.  All we saw were just intensely blue light with what seemed to be an aura around them, which could have been atmospheric interference.  They were still and looked just like really bright stars but they were just too bright and too big.  Very suddenly, the light on the left took off at an amazingly fast speed to the west, dipped down a bit, then up and just STOPPED in the sky again.  The object on the right just started to &quot;mosey&quot; through the sky toward the east.  We continued to drive west on I-40 trying to get to where it was, to put it parallel to the car again and see what the heck it was.  The road was straight, we were driving like crazy to catch up to &quot;it&quot; when another light just &quot;blinked&quot; on in the sky right in front of us.  (That was a real shocker!)  It started moving slowly in the direction of the light which had moved so quickly to the west, then just went away, perhaps behind a mountain.  We never could catch up to the westbound light.  We watched it for about 30 minutes or so, got to a little town and lost it. The light on the &quot;right&quot; had what seemed to be a blinking light of somekind...no noise but it must have been pretty high.  We had turned the car off and were in the middle of nowhere. The light which &quot;blinked&quot; on in front of us appeared to have a light, as well but I really don&apos;t think either of them was a plane or hellicopter.  I could be wrong.  But the light which darted off to the left was amazing!  We were driving at 75/80 mph for at least half an hour and never did get it parallel to the car again...not even close.  The sudden movement to the west was instantaneous...maybe two seconds to go, which must have been, better than 50 miles. My fiancee is 54, director of an arts organization.

Another flashing craft moving with other lights.My wife and I were at our house in San Felipe Baja on vaccation. We were watching the star filled night sky. We noticed two lights darting in a Zig Zag motion across the sky. Then we noticed another flashing light traveling in a west to east direction as the other lights darted around it. At that time we turned on the radio and heard people from all over the US talking on the Art Bell radio show what we had just seen. We do not have a phone in Baja so we were unable to call the show. I did e.mail Art Bell on our return to the US, he did not respond.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.

One of the witnesses reported that the objects had 4 lights each on the bottom of the craft, in a + formation. Object itself was not seen, but from the light formation, we are assuming the craft is triangular or airplane shaped. After 2-3 minutes of just sitting there, each object took off at tremendous speeds into a different direction(ex. object 1 came from the North, shot into the East, object 2 came from the South, shot into the West). The witness I spoke to mentioned that he couldn&apos;t remember any sound, but wasn&apos;t for sure. I am an independent Ufologist, and this report came to me from a co-worker who saw these objects with their brother. From the description he gave me, I first considered the possibility that these were convential aircraft, maybe refueling or performing some kind of training. However, the objects he described seem to fit the description of an airplane maybe, but after he told me that they became stationary, I&apos;d never heard of any airplane performing such a feet in mid air, at least not 100 + ft. above the ground.

I was still at school in those days, my best mate and I used to find any excuse to get out of a night time and go up behind his place (It was a nature reserve.)  We just sat in a cleariing and smoked a packet of cigaretes, shining our high powered torches all over the place.  The whole idea was just to have a smoke, (as if our parents couldn&apos;t smell it on us when we went home)  any how, this one night, we were smoking, and talking about nothing when we looked up to see what looked like a few satalites moving across the &quot;milky way&quot;.  This was nothing out of the ordinary as it is very clear at night.  All of a sudden, the satalites changed direction and went shooting all over the place at high speed.  Big tough 15 year old boys that we were, we both said something to the effect of &quot;It would be great if it were UFO&apos;s and we got to meet an alien.&quot;  So wee started shining our torches in the direction of these lights in the sky.  It was at this time, we realised the lights were getting larger, and the sound of the night crickets and other sounds were gone.  At the same time, We saw a very bright light come out from the right side above the trees, it took up most of the sky.  The only noise to be heard was a hum .  It was more felt than heard though.  Like a big sub woofer for the Hi Fi systme.  This light went over tthe trees and as it went out of sight over to the left of the clearing the light and sound were gone aswell.  Like big tough men, we turned to each other and said something less than pleasant.  Turned again and ran a good mile in what seemed like only seconds.  As we got tho the house, we saw the dog jumping over the fence to go the way we came.  We called it to stop but it never took direction very well and ignored us completely.  Within a few minutes, we heard the dog yelp in pain, we thought about going to see if it was OK but chickened out.  The next day, th! e dog came home but was sluggish for a couple of days before it came back to its old self.  It had no visable marks or anything and wee can only guess as to why it yelped. I don&apos;t know if anyone else has experienced anything similar, but this is the first time I have told this story to anyone other than Family in almost 15 years, It is as clear today as it was then.

I can see the pentagon from my friend&apos;s balacony.  At approximately 1730 hrs I opened my eyes and looked into the sky.  It was sunny and the sky was clear blue with scattered levels noctilucent clouds.  I could easily see jets passing at 30K feet, and birds flying through the lower scattered clouds.  Visibility was good - excellent. While gazing into the sky, I saw what appeared to be 4 light/shiny colored objects that were enlongated oval in shape...they appeared to be way up there.  They were traveling in north to south direction, as a group, moving slow and smoothly, at speeds that varied with each one. The prevaling wind was pushing clouds in a east-west direction. These objects did not appear to be high altitude or retail. Throughout my life, from time to time, I have observed helium balloons in flight until they disappeared.  These objects did not look like balloons.  One would slowly catch up with the other and another would seem to slow down. My friend also watched the objects and thought they were balloons. Then again, I&apos;m not sure if he believes in UFO like myself.  Over the course of 15 mins, we watched the objects continue to move and finally, disappear. End of report...", "Coming home late from a soccer match, I saw the objects moving from behind a local mountain towards the south end of town. They moved slowly for about a minute, then returned behind the mountain and were not seen again.Objects were thin, and each one was about the size of two helicopters. They moved up and down more quickly than they did from side to side, and one was seen only for about 25 seconds. The other lingered for a minute or two more and emitted a few (2) flashes of light before returning behind the mountain. I did not hear any engine sounds at all, even though I was in the open air (not in a car) and less than 2 miles away.  I could not determine color, except that it seemed a darker shade. I myself am 34 years old, a professional working in the computer/transportation industry, and have not seen anything like this before.  I did not feel threatened at any time.", "At 01:45 am. I was at work and we were outside taking a break when I saw a giant flash of light in the sky it was 50 times bigger then any star in the sky and lasted about 2 or 3 seconds. At around 02:00 am I was looking up in the sky where I saw the flash and an object that at first I thought was a shooting star was flying across the sky at a high rate of speed it took about 5 to 7 seconds to cross the entire sky.We were sitting at a picnic table facing ESE when an incredible huge flash of light appeared 2 of the 3 of us saw it and tried to figure what it could have been. It was bright white and seemed orange/red in the middle it was probably two thirds the size of the moon it lasted about two to three seconds and was gone. About ten to fifteen minutes later I was scaning the sky about where I saw the light when out of the south west an object traveling at an unbeleivable pace crossed the sky heading northeast it took about five to seven seconds to cross the sky I watched it until it disappeared . It was what I thought to be a falling star based on the speed and the color but it didnt burn out like a falling star it just kept going.", "Comet-like object, high in sky, set at &#x5C; angle, nearly vertical, stationary, no aircraft in sight.Object was bright like a vapor trail.  Very high in sky. At this angle (&#x5C;) and about that long in relationship to its width.  Looked like a comet or perhaps something burning up in atmosphere. I didn&apos;t get the feeling that this was an alien spacecraft, but either a natural phemomen, or maybe a man-made object buring up in atmosphere. One never know though.   The light was white (exactly like a vapor trail).", "Saw 2 events. Two Days apart. First. Line of red lights rising from behind mountain range, hover and descend. Second. Greenish glowing ball with thick red-orange tail shoot out of clouds then disappear.On or about June 19, 1999 I was camping in southeast Oregon in the Alvord Dry Lake area which is near the Nevada Idaho border, just north of a little town call Fields. The dry lake is a huge area that is bordered on either side by mountain ranges  We were camped on Pike Creek, about 35 minutes up the dirt and gravel road, which is on the western side of the Lake.  The sun had gone down, the night was relatively clear. Sighting 1:We were sitting facing east toward the opposite end of the lake looking at the mountain range.  We suddenly saw a line of red lights about the length of an index finger held horizontally against the horizon rise from behind the mountain range.  The color of the lights were the same as taillights to a car except that there were many of these lights in a row, seemingly connected.  The lights rose, hovered about an inch or so, relative to us, above the mountain range for several seconds and then sank back below the mountains.  Because it was so far away and all we saw were lights we could not determine the shape of the object.  What we saw was a horizontal line.  The lights had a moving glowing quality.  Perhaps the object could have been round like a saucer ringed with red lights.  Because the distance from us to the other side of the lake was several miles I can only assume that this object must have been huge.  Both my friend and I said at the same time &quot;Did you see that?&quot; So I know I was not imagining it.  A few days later we happened to take a drive to the other side of the mountains, about a two hour drive, and there is absolutely nothing over there.  Just more desert, more wilderness. Sighting 2: Then two nights later, on or about July 21, we were sitting again looking out across the expanse.  The night was cloudy and seemed to threaten rain.  Out of the clouds at our eye level we saw a green/pale green glowing orb about the size of a golf ball held at arm&apos;s length streak from out of the clouds.  The orb had a short thick reddish/orange tail and just as quickly as we had seen it disappeared behind a cloud.  We saw this more to the north of the previous sighting and it seemed to be inside the dry lake area as opposed to the previous sighting which appeared to be on the other side of the mountain range.  This could be a natural phenomenon, some kind of huge static ball maybe although I have never heard of anything like this before.  There was no sound and it disappeared as quickly as it appeared.  But it lasted long enough to leave a lasting impression on my mind.  The object was very clear.  I think what&apos;s important is that the object was not up in the sky like an asteroid but right at eye level just a little bit above the mountain range.  We both saw it and both said simultaneously,&quot;What was that?&quot; Again, because of the distance from where we were to the other side of the dry lake area this object must have been huge.  I can&apos;t even begin to calculate the size of it.", "I was sitting on the couch and glanced out the window, at first I thought it was a plane, but a few minutes later, it was still there, and when I looked at it, I got the weirdest, kinda creepy feeling.I was sitting on the couch, and when I glanced outside, I saw blinking lights up in the sky, I live not too far from an airport, so I thought it was a plane. But I looked up at it a few minutes later, and it was still there, and it stayed there for at least 15 minutes, and I even went outside to look at it. The lights were red, white, and blue. It didn&apos;t move, and I think if I could have seen it in the day it would have been vertical oval shaped. There were four lights I could see, and the ship looked rather small. When I was outside looking at it, I got the creepy feeling that I was being watched, and the feeling lasted after I got inside. When I got inside I looked out the window, and it was gone.", "EXTREMELY bright, red oval near airport.  Suddenly accelerates and STREAKS over horizon.I am fairly certain of the year of the incident (1954), although I am guessing at the month, even though I believe the incident occurred during the hot part of the summer of 1954.  I remember the year, because I was sitting in the passenger seat of our family car, a 1953 Studebaker.  I was six years of age at the time of the sighting. My mother, my older brother (10 yrs.), and I (age 6 yrs.) were attending a movie at the Airway Drive-in Theater, situated on the southwest edge of the St. Louis airport (Lambert Field).  The theater used to be located south of the main east-west runway, directly across the airport from McDonnell Aircraft Corporation, approximately where the Missouri Air National Guard building currently sits today. Suddenly, as the three of us were watching the movie, it came to our attention that some kind of disturbance had begun to brew at the theater.  We didn&apos;t know what was taking place, but I seem to recall we could hear people shouting.  I remember looking around to my right side to look at the concession stand, located toward the center rear part of the parking spaces, but could see nothing that appeared unusual. At about the time I looked back toward the screen, people started walking in front of our car, and they were looking, and perhaps pointing, up to our right.  I looked out the right passenger&apos;s window, and immediately witnessed a generally oval shape, EXTREMELY brightly luminous, red object hovering virtually motionless in the sky.  I vaguely recall that the object may have been casting a faint red light over the theater and surrounding area. The object&apos;s apparent size (from my vantage point) was approximately from 50% to 100% the diameter of the moon, and its long axis appeared to be horizontally oriented.  The object appeared to be moving generally to the north, but almost imperceptibly slowly, perhaps even not at all. It gave the appearance of simply hovering motionless in the sky. Suddenly, the object accelerated to the north, perhaps passing directly over the airport, and disappeared within 2-3 seconds over the horizon to the north!  The object covered approximately 90 degrees of arc, viewed from my vantage point on the ground, in that amount of time, and appeared to fly in a somewhat straight line, perhaps with slight deviation from a perfectly straight-line course. I seem to recall that my father may have viewed the event from the control tower, which prior to June 30, 1956, was located on the north side of the airport. Whenever my family gets together, we always talk about that event.  Our minds seem drawn to it!  My brother, now a physician, remembers it very clearly, as does my mother. That object was BIZARRE!!I am now Director of the National UFO Reporting Center.((NUFORC Note:  Date of the incident is approximate.  I am reasonably certain that the incident occurred during the summer of 1954, but not positive.  If anyone reads this report who may have been present at the incident, I would welcome a communication from the individual.

It first looked like a comet or meteor but then it turned towards the direction of our car and quickly changed appearance to a huge bright blue and white firey ball. As I said coming right towards us. It moved very fast, then it began to look misty at the top of the ball and seemed to streak light in different directions. I could see the light through the trees as it dissapated and then disappeared. Needless to say we were just totally blown away. The girls and I all had the sense that the ball was coming AT us. I felt like it was aware of us. We all described what we saw the same way. Our background is: My husband is a pastor. I am a homemaker. The girls are in highschool and are A students.

The cuboid didn&apos;t halt when it got to the steelwork of the pylon, it passed through it and retained its shape.  We got freaked out at that.  Then it noticed us and then stopped for about five seconds, hovering perfectly still, with no noise. It was watching us.  We felt as though it had registered us and then continued to go on along the grid over the housing estate at a height of about seventy five feet. Remarkably, no one but us saw it that night.

This area on the southern Davidson/northern Williamson county line is rather rural.  My first thought was that two light planes were about to collide.  They were close and very low to the ground.  Suddenly I realized that what I was seeing was two boomerang crafts nested one behind the other only about two hundred feet off the ground.  They were perfectly still.  There was a small pinpoint light on the wing tip of each craft.  I was so astonished I stoppped the car and got out.  There was absolutely no sound and no movement.  The craft were black and metallic and the bottom appeared to have a ridge line.  I could see the sky between the two but they were probably no more than 20 to 25 feet apart.

About 1 min after I lost visual contact with the object to the north, there was a bright star that appeared in the sky about 60 to 70 degrees above the horizon and about 5 degrees north from direct east. It appeared in the constelation south east of Cassiopea.  This Bright Star was 2-3 time brighter than anything in the sky, about the intesity of aircraft landing lights.It was so briliant that I immediately thought that a new supernova had just been seen, but the brightness faded and the star dissapeared after about 1 min.  Because of the coincedence of the events I surrmise that they were connected. My gut feeling is that the bright Flash may have been in response to the very quick satelite Moving from the south to the north.  A Star Wars defence mechanism or simmilar devise. It was the strangest thing I have seen in the sky for a long time, hopefully someone else can verify the existance of this bright flash object.", "Strobing lights moving in irregular pattern @ 40 degrees above horizon 2 came together and then separated  light intensity would changewitnessed a white strobing light moving along horizon. light intensity would change and so would the speed of the object. it moved in an irregular pattern. later two objects with similar lighting arrived over the nothern horizon one from the west and one from the east.  they approached eac other and came close together.  their lights flashing appeared to synchronize for a short time and then they separated. all three objects appeared very far away much further than the planes moving across the sky and did not follow a direct path like a satelite would.  ocassionally it appeared that there was a red light with the white but did not look like airplane navigation lights.", "I spent many hours looking at stars as preparation for navigation with a sailboat using a sextantI was laying on my on my back at about 11:00 in the evening studying stars for navigational purposes. I observed a round disk coming from the Washington DC area with what looked like small wires on the perifery as it rotated. It took a 90 degree left turn and proceeded down the Shenandoah Valley, The total time was about 6 seconds. I inhaled and waited for an explosion due to the speed involved. There never was a sound.

Everyone in the house was sleeping and I was laying out on the pool deck, watching the stars because the sky was perfectly clear.  Then I see this thing come up very low over the trees and became quite stunned.  It was triangular in shape and metalic with a large, crimson globe in the center.  This light was on because I could see it reflecting on the sides of the craft, but it was very dim.  The craft silently flew over me at altitude of no more then a few hundred feet, and then arced around behind some more trees.  It had disappeared. While this had all been going on, I ran into the house to wake everyone up...no one would get up.  So, I came back outside and looked up and it hadn&apos;t disappeared yet.  I guess that convinced me that it was real. Over the years, I have searched the internet for triagle UFOs to see if I could find someone else that had seen it.  It may be interesting to note that I have found a few additional reports from Cleveland, OH (on the other side of the lake from Buffalo) and Pennsylvania (about 100 miles from Derby, NY, where my sighting had been).", "we saw a round bright light in the sky, it had no flashing lights. it did not seem to move very fast.  after a few min we saw the bright light drop two round red things underneath it. after this the object started moving. we lost sight of it.After a movie on easter sunday, my girlfriend and i saw a light on the drive home. this light had no blinking lights which is why it caught my attention. i think the time was between 12 and 1 am.  we pulled over and observed the light for a little bit.  we could tell that it was moving but not very fast.  we were in yucaipa and we figured it could have been over redlands, highland or san bernadino which are pretty big cities in california, so i figured someone else had to have seen it.  the object seemed to stop and just sit there.  after this i seen one red ball drop from this object.  when i saw this i turned to my girl and asked if she just saw that and she said she saw another red ball drop when i turned, so it drop two red balls.  the red balls did not appear directly underneath the light, there was a gap between the object by the time we seen the red balls.  the balls were only visible for only a second or two and then disappeared.  after this happened the object started moving and we lost it because it went below the hill line.  we drove to a higher position to chase it but by time we got to the hill it had disappered.  we couldnt tell what direction it went because we lost it so quick.  i wanted to report this to the newspaper that next day but i figured that they wouldnt take me seriously, just as my friends did.  after i saw a report on the news last night i knew i could report it here and be taken seriously.  i had no video or photos of the incident but i know that what i seen was definitly not a satellite, star, heicopter, or an airplane as i know them.", "I saw two object streeking fron east to west at great speed one was behind the other a good distance and they were very fuzzy looking at them.

It did pulsate rather weakly when in its tennis ball configuration. Have one other unusual sighting but too lengthy to describe now.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "At first I thought the object was a finish to some fireworks. Lights though continued to flash in same spot. After about 35-40 minutes, lights moved toward west and disappeared.Last night (June 29, 1999) I was returning home with my daughter to our house in New Carlisle, IN. After turning onto our street, I saw what looked to be the finish of a white-colored fireworks in the northwestern part of the sky. However, the lights (and there first appeared to be two or three) did not move from that location for quite some time. These light flashed in a vertical fashion, much like the lights on an airplane. After pulling into our driveway, my daughter and I watched those lights for several minutes....as we watched them, there appeared to be another light of a green color which appeared to the left of the flashing set of lights. This green light (which did not flash or pulsate) shone for maybe 10-15 seconds, then seem to disappear. My wife came outside and she saw the flashing lights as well and maybe thought it was a cell telephone tower, since these lights were not moving and they seemed to be at the same height in the sky. Just after both my daughter and wife went into the house, I noticed a red light which appeared on the right isde of the flashing lights. As with the green light, it lasted but a few seconds before fading off. After about 20 minutes or so, the lights (which had been staionary) appeared to very slowly move toward the west. In the last five minutes or so, the lights seemd to pick up speed and very soon had disappeared in almost a straight line westward. The entire sighting lasted about 50 minutes or so. It was difficult to determine a shape. However, like I stated earlier, the white flashing lights were vertical and just on occasion would either the red or green light to the side show. Twice to my recollection the red and green light appeared at the same time and then faded. There were at least two planes in the sky that night, one directly over our house and another moving from west to east at what looked to be a lower point in the sky. All the while I wathed the lights, there also did not appear to be any sound, but maybe its distance away could account for that.", "roundes craft with lights around the outer rim.  No sound came from it, it stood in the sky before us revolving slowly.  We felt we were also being observed during the time it presented itself to us.Heading east one evening from Yuma on our way to Phoenix with our 2 young children, I sat in the back with my baby while my husband was at the wheel with my 2 yr. old daughter in front.  As I looked out the window to the south night sky, the sun had just set and the mountains were gentle shadows against the sky.  As dusk turned deeper into night my attention was drawn to a very bright round light which was brighter than a star, and not as high up.  I called my husbands attention to it, but he said it was probably the planet &quot;Venus&quot;.  I watched for sometime, not able to look away, wondering what it could be.  When I did look away, then back, I didn&apos;t see it, it had gone.  I was more curious now wondering if it was indeed Venus, where had it just gone?  I told my husband it was gone.  He than suggested it was a Helicopter doing Military operations out there in the desert.  In Yuma we were currently stationed at the Air Station there, and operations were performed frequently in the night.  I continued searching the sky for the light.  Suddenly it appeared, only it was abit closer this time.  I excitedly told my husband, &quot;there it is!&quot;  He was now becoming abit curious due to my persistance.  His next explanation after taking a glance from the road in the lights direction, was perhaps it was a flare.  I didn&apos;t take my eyes off the light this time, looking for the tail that a flare would have after being shot up or down, there was none.  Suddenly stunned as a second light pops on directly next to the first light.  Now I yelled at my husband that another light, the same bright color is shining brightly next to the first.  Continuing to drive he also began to lean forward and down, to peer out the window.  He saw the 2 lights, and then suddenly they were gone.  THe best way I can describe the way they became &quot;gone&quot; was they just blinked off.  One minute they&apos;re there, the next they&apos;re gone.  The same way you would flip the light switch turning the light off in a room.  Now my husband was as curious as me, and c! ontinues driving, and looking out the window.  With in moments, the single light appeared again, this time the closest it had been up to this point to our car.  It was approximately the heighth a power line would be to a car on the road.  Upward, slightly, but not directly above us, still to the side of us.  So the single light is on, the second light appears next to it, and then a third light pops on.  At this point as my husband says, &quot;That ain&apos;t no damn helicopter&quot;, fear gripped me as this thing took shape before our eyes.  I realized what we were looking at, and it appeared to be looking at us.  After the third light appeared on, the light was so bright that we could see the shape of a round saucer, but it wasn&apos;t a flat structure.  It had a top shape to it, and under the lights we could see slightly up into the  center of the craft.  There was something there, but it was shadowy and hard to see what it was.  It stood there in the sky slowly revolving, allowing us to observe it, no noise coming from it.  My husband is now all over the road, while trying to drive and look at the same time.  I was more afraind than I&apos;ve ever been in my life.  I felt myself bordering on pure panic, I couldn&apos;t believe my eyes, and yet there it was in front of me.  Unbelievable!!  But there it was.  My husband wanted to pull over, and I was screaming no!  Then, as quickly as it had appeared, the lights popped off again, and we couldn&apos;t see it.  Feeling abit safer only momentarily, but pressed for time I told my husband to pull over so that I could drive.  I had the intention of course not to stop once I was behind the wheel.  But I wasn&apos;t sure what he&apos;d do if the craft appeared again, he might stop which terrified me.  We quickly pulled over to make our exchange.    I jumped out of the car, still panic stricken and jumped into the front seat screaming at him to come on!!  He hesitated looking up into the sky in the direction we had seen the craft in.  He was excited, exhilirated, but scared too, just not as scared as me.  He! &apos;s much more of an adventurer than I.  Finally he got into the car at my insistance, and we took off.  Our conversation was filled with questions.  I remember my husband thinking out loud saying, &quot;I wonder if they can hear us in here (the car) like by the radio or something (which wasn&apos;t on at this time).  Just after he said that the craft appeared again.  We both felt as though it was their way of answering his question.  This time it was farther away again, but still within good eye shot.  This time the lights did somthing different.  Suddenly the 3 lights split off from each other into a triangular shape.  They shot off quick from each other, 1 light becoming 3 seperate lights.  As I&apos;ve later learned this triangular shape  has been reported by others, and In spite of all the sightings that I think are bull shit, when I hear someone talk about the triangular significance I believe they&apos;ve seen something.  Anyway, our trip continued and we could think of or speak of nothing else of course the rest of the way into Phoenix.  The lights continued to reappear to us, but at a greater distance over the desert mountains.  We watched them all the way into Gila Bend, and then saw them no more.  This trip is still vivid in my mind, and there were some peculiar things about the whole thing.  First thing was, after the experience we looked behind us, and ahead of us the highway was completely vacant.  We were the only ones there at that time.  This led us to feel as though we were chosen to be shown to.  I remember distinctly feeling that we were chosen.  We wondered why we&apos;de be chosen, but couldn&apos;t come up with anything.  My husband was full of regret as though he&apos;d missed an opportunity of a life time to be &quot;picked up&quot;, and he talked about how he wished we had pulled over, maybe they&apos;d have picked him up.  I was so terrified by the experience that I couldn&apos;t and still don&apos;t understand his thinking, but I do remember feeling very strongly as he expressed his &quot;missed opportunity&quot; that we would see it again. This imp! ression was so strong at that moment, and it was only there after he&apos;d expressed his remorse at the thought of missing out on what could have been an abduction.  My children were unaffected by the whole thing.  My daughter now 14 has vague memory of the incident, and my son was still a baby at the time remembers nothing.  The night sky took on a whole new meaning to us after that.  And every trip we took from Yuma to Phoenix thereafter we had our camera with us with night film available to photograph anything should it appear again.  There were endless trips after that to visit our family  in Phoenix, but never again did we see what we&apos;de seen that night in &quot;88&quot;.  As all the UFO sightings became more reported, and numerous photo&apos;s and abduction storys surfaced I&apos;d have to say many of them I feel are not legitimate.  There are always people who want to jump on the band wagon.  Personally I think some people that make their abduction stories available are simply full of shit.  They have wild imaginations, and they have discredited those of us who&apos;ve truly had an experience with sightings ect.  I am as skeptical as the next person, and would welcome an explanation for what we saw.  The simple facts are, I know what we saw.  I don&apos;t know why we saw it, but I know something is out there, I don&apos;t believe it, I know it.  I don&apos;t know why certain people are chosen, maybe it&apos;s simply chance that these sightings occur, but I feel somehow that we&apos;re chosen.  The only significant thing that has happened to me since then are some very vivid dreams of large, colorful, UFO&apos;s bigger than ever seen before.  I also had a dream where I was picked up and taken to some terminal like location.  In the dream upon arriving at my destination I was taken into a room that was all red, walls and all.  I stood waiting in this room, and out from a partition came an alien child, I sensed she was female, and somehow we were connected.  I felt no fear as I stood looking at her, and she stood smiling at me.  Very strange dream, very vivid.! I awoke wondering what it meant.  I still look to the sky and wonder when another UFO will appear to me.  OF all the UFO photographs made public, I&apos;d have to say the craft that I saw, looks most like photo&apos;s I&apos;ve seen taken in Gulf Breeze Florida.  Ironically, I now live about 20 min. from Gulf Breeze, but have yet to see any UFO&apos;s.  We never reported our sighting, although I wish we had.  I wonder if there would have been some explanation, or maybe someone else who may have seen the same thing that night.  But my husband being a military member hesitated.  We know that a good deal of the public still doesn&apos;t believe in UFO&apos;s and discredits those of us who&apos;ve seen one.  For now we continue watching and waiting for the proof to be shown to us all.", "A 12&apos; circular light was on the bottom of the craft. It was hovering silently over my farm pond. I was 20&apos; from craft, the engines started up with an intense wind coming from craft--about 100 MPH wind.  Pinned me against my pickup truck, as it shot straight up faster than a rifle bullt and disapeared!My wife and I built an underground house, sucluded in a wooded area. A pond laid right beside it. One night as we arrived home around midnight, I was crossing the pond levee(which was my driveway) Immediatley the pond and hillsides were light up like the middle of the afternoon.  Then I stopped the truck and got out looked above the pond about 10&apos; and witnessed a 12&apos; circular light on the bottom of some sort of craft.  There was no noise heard, I then yelled at them to come on down and they&apos;d be safe. The craft stayed until my pregnant wife with my young son ran for the house. When my wife disapeared around the house, the crafts engine started and almost blew me down.  The wind was at least 100 MPH. It shot straight up until it was out of sight, faster than a rifle bullet! I believe that the craft seemed to be taking up water into it. Shortly after this incident my infant daughter was born and developed an virus that needed medical attention, and the doctor ask my wife if she had been to South America.  Because there was no cases of that type of illness in the U.S. We believe the craft may of had something to do with this illness.  The next day from viewing the craft there was a 12&apos;  diameter circle mashed into the weeds where it must of landed. That was my first and last sighting, it has changed my way of thinking forever. It was definetly something from another planet, with way more technology then we have today.", "One large and 2 small orange disks seen in the western sky.One large orange disk viewed low in the sky at about 11:30 GMT.

You asked if anyone else has seen triangular flying vehicles.  Well, my wife and I both saw one together.  It was September 1994.  We were travelling North on the A1 (a major North-South highway in the UK) a few miles south of our home.  As we passed near to RAF Alconbury, a USAF air base (fully operational at the time) at 23.00, this huge, silent, black triangular craft, with a red/purple light at the front tip and white lights at the other two corners, flew quite low and to our right.  It then seemed to invert and flew back the way it had come.  My wife then said that it appeared to hover.  The craft was silent and pretty big. I&apos;ve seen prop planes like Hercules transports, various fighters, U2s and helicopters take off from that base in daylight and at night and it WAS NOT one of these.  My guess is that it was a secret stealth recon plane, the replacement for the SR71 Blackbird, called Aurora or Firefly.  However, the technology is amazing.  It was low, slow, silent, and hovers.  A while later (a few months), my wife was driving her mother along country lanes near our village and she nearly drove off the road, because she was startled by this huge black triangular craft that rose silently from behind a hill, flew over the car and was gone.  This was in daylight.  I showed them pictures of the stealth fighter and stealth bomber and both said it looked more like the bomber but it was not the same.  The stealth bomber has not been deployed outside the USA, but it is rumoured that these secret triangular craft are deployed in the UK and Germany as well as the USA and crewed by NATO pilots.  I&apos;ll say one thing, it was a magnificent sight and I won&apos;t forget that brief encounter.  I expect that in 20 years or so it will be on the Discovery Channel!  The Blackbird was retired in 1990 but was built in the mid 60&apos;s and was very advanced.  So, I wonder what amazing prototypes are being built now to outperform these triangular craft?", "We watched a round , silver or white object hoovering between Yakima and Ellensburg Wa.

I have been in the aircraft industry for 30 years as an inspector for boeing and as a forward aircontroller in the Air Force and have never seen anything like this. What helped to give shape to this object is that the sky was full of star&apos;s and as this object passed it blocked out the star&apos;s.  I did not hear any noise as one would hear from an aircraft overhead on its approach into Seattle International.", "I saw an object fly extremely close above my head.It was tearshaped, metalic with a haze around it. It left a trail behind it. It all happerened very quickly.", "At dusk I looked up just in time to see a strange green light dip beneath the clouds then take off quickly in another direction. The next day there was a very large black helicopter parked at the small airport next to my home. It took off and flew a long search partern over the whole area for some time, flying back and forth in an obvious search grid.The helicopter was unlike anything I&apos;d ever seen. It was enormous with twin rotars. When its motors started the whole neighborhood came out to watch it,the runway being vivible from our street. It wasn&apos;t untill a few days later that I made the connection with the strange light Id seen the night before. The light dropped down below the clouds then quickly zipped off at an angle back into the clouds at an incredible speed. My theory is that it was being tracked on radar and this was some sort of evasive manuver. That is why the heliocopter was searching for it, they may have thought it crashed and were searching for wreckage", "Object raced across sky, stopped, zig zagged back and then took off out of sight. We seemed frozen, watched stopped, arm hairs stood up.I and my neighborhood friend were only 8 yrs old at the time and still remember this as though it just happened eventhough it was 30 years ago. No other sightings or occurences have happened since. It was a crisp clear calm starry fall night. We went outside taking the trash to the bins at the curb which face east. I lifted the lid with my right arm and started to put the bag in and I was frozen. I was able to move my eyes as I saw my watch on my left arm that I was holding the lid. It was stopped at 7:50 with the second hand also stopped at 50. I noticed the hairs on my arms standing up. I glanced to my side and saw my friend looking straight out and then I looked straight out and saw the object. It was still and bright, it looked like a smaller version of a bright moon. Then it darted diagonally to the north, so fast it really just appeared at it&apos;s new location about 45 degrees to the left from when it was directly in front of us. Then it darted back straight across back to the south and to the right of us about 45 degrees again. Then it shot back diagonally to the north and kept going out of sight, it vanished. We both were able to move again as the bag dropped into the bin, I threw the lid down and we both ran back up the stairs yelling as we went back into the house. We frantically told my parents what happened but we were both brushed off as two kids with overactive imaginations. Years later when I brought this up to my parents again, my father recalled that the TV set went to snow. He got up and changed the channel thinking that just that one station he was watching temporarilly went off the air. He turned the dial and just got snow on all of the channels. He said then they all came back on and he went back into his chair. I believe my friend and I experienced missing time because my Dad had time to get up, change channels and sit back down while it only seemed like seconds to us outside.", "3 lights in line to V formation moving southwest.One light moved erraticaly and split making 180 degree turn3 lights in line to V formation moving southwest.One light moved erraticaly and split making 180 degree turn.

At one point the erratic light seemed to touch the light in center and then it turned 180 degrees moving to the southeast and left the formation.

At 5:12 p.m. the sphere over the banana tree was gone. I sat for a couple minutes looking the sky over, and I found to the east two more. (Both looked the same as the first sphere over the tree.)  I watched these two spheres as they slowly headed west, stopping directly over an obvious incoming and outgoing flight lane. During that time a plane heading southwest for LAX pasted directly under the two spheres. I took two photos of this, but they did not come out.  I watched these two sphere&rsquo;s for about 15-20 minutes, as two more planes (separate times) leaving LAX heading east had also passed under the objects. I snapped another 4 photo&rsquo;s but these also didn&rsquo;t come out.  A low cloud cover came through the area at 5:35p.m. I lost sight of the two spheres, as they passed through the clouds. When the cover burned off 10 minutes later I spotted directly over the moon another sphere heading west.  The moon was in the southeast portion of the sky. I took a picture of that sphere with the moon.  It came out but it only looks like a light spot with a dark bottom.  A few minutes later another sphere heading east passed over the moon. So now I was watching two spheres.  One is moving to the east, and one moving to the west. The second moving to the east was a lot closer. With the naked eye you could see structure to it.  It was obviously nothing conventional.  I had also taken pictures of these two spheres together. I had earlier in the afternoon seen a couple Mylar balloons drift by and when they became the size of the sphere&rsquo;s you could still see the strings on the balloons, so I knew that what I was watching was not any balloon. All the spheres at some time went against the wind.  The balloons did not!  The sphere moving to the west eventually went out of sight.  The sphere moving to the east eventually positioned itself in one spot in the sky, and during that time other&rsquo;s joined it. At one point there may have been as many as five spheres in the sky. It was hard to tell because they seemed to fade in and out. Thes! e spheres were very hard to see with the naked eye.  But once you spotted them you couldn&rsquo;t miss them.

After 2-3 minutes there was a bright flash and then nothing.  We checked the general area of the landing- very rural- the next day, but found no signs of anything.

One of my friends and myself went to grab some more wood for the fire, so we walked about 50 yards or so to a road that runs behind our property.  as we turned toward the west, we noticed a large, spherical shaped object in the distance.  it looked as if it were the sun, very large and reddish-orange in color.  we sat and watched it for about 5-10 minutes then it vanished.  we didn&apos;t think much of it, until about 20-30 minutes later.  Out of the south we saw, some type of lights above the clouds.  it was reddish, moving at a fair rate of speed.  it continued moving north a few miles and seemed to stop about 2 miles from our property were a oil field had been carved out of the woods..  a few moments later,  we heard the loud thumping of helicopters, and soon after the sounds we saw them (they sounded much like hueys, loud dull rotor sounds).  we counted about five helicopters moving just over the tree tops, they went directly over us.  again, they were heading north in the same path as the light we saw.  over the tree tops we could see a few of them circling the oil field and we thought that they may have landed out there.  so my buddy and i proceed down a pipeline right-of-way that went directly to the oil field.  i guess we were about half way there when something caught my eye, i stopped walking.  my friend, slightly behind me, asked why i had stopped, and about that time, i told him to look down at his chest.   on his chest was what seemed to be a laser sight dot for a gun or something.  the same was on my chest.  we ran back the entire way to my house.  running into the house screaming,  my mom asked what had happened and we told her.   to this day i can remember the event ver! y vividly and my mom still remembers seeing us run into the house that night, looking like we had seen a ghost or something.", "flying-wing shape outlined by 12-14 lights.

Silver in the middle with white ends. No observable thickness. Moving very slowly and wobbling from end to end. Total observation time of ten seconds.  Object abruptly disappeared.I was inside my house when my attention was attracted by a loud sound of a group of 3 (military)helicopters passing overhead and proceeding in a northwesterly direction.  Went outside and looked up at helicopters when a strange object was observed at a higher altitude and almost directly overhead.  The object was a modified rectangle with rounded ends, approximately 3 to 4 times longer than wide.  The center third was a silvery metallic color and the two end thirds were white with a sharp edge between the areas.  There were no projections visible and no markings.  A rough estimate of observed length is based on a length of 4 inches at a distance of one arm length.  It appeared to be nearly stationary but wobbled or occilated from end to end.  My impression was that it was very large.  I could not observe any thickness to the object but it was directly overhead. Any sounds would have been obscured by the helicopter engine noise.  It appeared that it was moving slowly and was about to become obscured by a large tree next to our house so I moved to a better viewing position about 10 feet away looking away during this brief period.  When I looked up again the object had disappeared.  A commercial jet was also passing overhead going south at this time.  This object was lower than the jet and in a different part of the sky.

Neighborhood witnesses oval light with large luminous contrail pass over houses 400 yds away at 150 ft!At about 9pm myself and a friend went outside on the lawn to watch the beautiful full moon and stars. At about 9:20 pm, I spotted in my binoculars a fast moving oval shaped gold tinged light moving from northwest to the southeast. Simultaneously, my friend saw another light passing directly overhead heading north. We then saw another one at 9:35 pm passing overhead from south to north. This one drifted slowly overhead in a wavy snake-like pattern at about 20,000 feet. As an airliner approached its path -- as it moved toward the southwest, the light suddenly darted over to it and remained over it for a few seconds then hovered a couple of seconds and returned to its original path. It began zigzagging widely until it disappeared. I saw another light a little before 10:00 pm moving to the southeast. All appeared to be travelling at the same altitude. Then at about 10 pm, my friend said, &quot;Look at that!&quot; and pointed to the south of the house which overlooks the lake. Coming across the sky at about 150 feet up and 400 yards away was an oval shaped brightly lit object with a gold tinge spewing out a luminous contrail (which became approximately 50 feet in width). This object was seen by multiple witnesses -- neighbors were shouting out -- &quot;Would you look at that!&quot; and &quot;That&apos;s not ours!&quot; to the northeast and southwest of us. The object and its illuminated contrail (which looked exactly like the persistent contrails laid in the skies during the day) were distinctly horizontal moving from west to east at about 180 mph for 1.5 miles. The object looked about 20 feet across and flew steadily over the rooftops until it disappeared -- &quot;went out&quot; 30 seconds later over the city. The craft seemed to be fully lit from the inside -- or glowing smooth in appearance-- and the contrail reflected the moon on top but was self-illuminated with a slight gold and orange tinge. It stayed luminous and dissipated 30 seconds after the craft disappeared.We were in total wonderment...So close and not a sound! Was it ours? Why over a town? Why so many? What was in the contrail?

Did not have a watch, but missing time associated with abduction was probably accountable for the experience.", "Not sure if this was natural or unatural....I was comming out to my truck around 10:45...it was close to storming so this made me unsure if this event was lightning or not...but then after hearing some of the recent events I thought I&apos;d let you know...there was a huge flash of light, and the sky seemed to light up as bright as day so I turned to see what had just happened and as I turned I saw up in the eastern sky what looked like about 5 fireballs in a horizontally stacked formation that at the moment I thought they resembled what looked like sperm swimming a short distance across the sky....they were bright white and the color of the sky around them was bluish/purple....the horizontal direction and quanity is what really made me question the lightning theory...not sure if this was natural or not.", "This is a  comment about this report.1)  Olmstead AFB was closed on June 30, 1968, when it became the Harrisburg International Airport. The Pa Air National Guard continued to operate a few planes but not fighters. 2) The airport was not &quot;across the river&quot;, but small planes used the New Cumberland airport, on the York County side of the river.  Some large-scale maps (Rand McNally Road Atlas of US, Canada, Mexico, 1979 Edition) show 1 airport symbol at New Cumberland, location of old airport.  Maybe this report comes from someone not familiar with area, although the mention of Swatara Creek suggests this is not the case. 3) The object had red top and bluish bottom, suggest astronomical object near horizon in conditions of atmospheric refraction. Sun had set, but sky was overcast. 4)  Details remembered, such as exact air temp &quot;about 55&quot;,  yet nine years off in the date, is a puzzle.  Other details suggest fantasy.  Jets seemed to take time to come from &quot;across river&quot;, yet Olstead is at M&apos;town, jets would be airborne and be there already! The Three Mile Island accident occurred in 1979, two years after 1977, not one year later. 5) Size of object &quot;30 &apos;&quot; is simply an assumption, as is the distance.  Jumping from 10 to 11 oclock could have been autokinetic motion of the eyes. Conclusion: the object may have been astronomical.  The event either happened at least nine years earlier or details were imagined or fabricated. The report was made 20 or 30 years after the event.

Had appx 30 meter tail that looked like &quot;sparks&quot;Around 11:00pm, we were driving south bound on I15, between St. George and Cedar City, Utah.  We saw what looked like a firework shoot up into the air, we watched as it continued to climb at great speed.  It then stopped and seemed to be hovering in one place for appx 10 sec. then it shot completly horizontal to the left.  It then stopped and began moving upward again, it hesitated again,then started what looked to be a &apos;nose dive.&apos;  It got so close to the ground we thought it was a plane crashing, then suddenly it shot straight up.(similar to the motion of a yo-yo) Then the tail of light disapeared.  When the tail went out, we could see one flashing blue light, and one flashing red light, and what looked to be 4 flashing yellow lights. It seemed to be airplane lights, but the thing that made us wonder was the speed at which it traveled, verticaly and horizontaly, and the way it would hover or hesitate, there didn&apos;t seem to be a possible way that a personal prop plane or jet could manuver this way, and there was no sound. This happened for about 5 minutes.  There were several people pulled off to the side of the road looking and taking pictures.  We did take 3-4 pictures, but they have not been developed yet. What we saw was an object which seemed to be the size of a small prop plane, with a appx 30 meter tail of what seemed to be sparks.  There was no sound.  It was able to move unlike any flying object that we know of.", "While camping out overnight on the Merritt Island Wildlife Refuge, at around 2:30 a.m. 8-17-99 I witnessed what appeared to be a large light blue glowing object moving across in an easterly direction across the horizon.While camping out overnight on my birthday (8/16/99) on the Merritt Island Wildlife Refuge (which includes property bordering the Kennedy Space Center) at around 2:30 a.m. 8-17-99 I witnessed what appeared to be a large light blue glowing object moving across the horizon in an easterly direction. Earlier in the evening I had witnessed (at around 12:30 a.m.) the launch of a satellite from KSC, then continued fishing (as my campsite bordered the mosquito lagoon and Indian rivers), until about 2:00 a.m. At around 2:30 a.m. I exited my camping tent to toss a few logs onto the fire, hoping that the increased light from the fire would ward off a few raccoons, which had been keeping me awake by their scampering around the campsite. As I had left my flashlight in the tent, I utilized what little campfire light remained to scout out some of the numerous fallen tree limbs surrounding the tent (for firewood). While peering around in this semi-darkness I was startled in that I noted wooded area around me began to lighten and even pronounced shadows appeared behind the trees surrounding me. Looking up through the trees I could see that there was something very bright emerging in the Western Hemisphere, but I couldn&apos;t make it out due to the tree cover above me. I was perplexed by this and while at first thinking &quot;Holy smokes, I&apos;ve never heard of the cape sending up two rockets in one night (as it was that pronounced a light)&quot; quickly reasoned that the light was coming from the direction opposite of the launch facilities. So, I quickly moved through the brush to a point jetting out toward the open lagoon and witnessed the following: What I saw was a steady light blue glowing object moving from the east out toward the ocean. I immediately determined it was a meteorite, as it seemed to leave a slight glowing orange-white contrail behind it. But as I continued to observe it, that initial impression seemed improbably for several reasons. It didn&apos;t move as quickly as one would think a meteor would. It seemed to move at a speed slightly faster than a commercial airliner. As it neared it became nearer the object&apos;s brightness increased significantly - and by - that I mean it was frightfully bright. When it was at it&apos;s nearest, I&apos;d guess 20 - 30 miles off, it produced enough light to have read a book - it literally seemed like daylight. As it passed, I could somewhat discern (especially as it proceeded away) that the intensity of the object varied - from bright, to less so, back to it&apos;s full intensity. It continued out easterly and over the ocean until disappearing over the horizon. I at first stood just staring in shock trying to recall all the details of what I had seen, as I figured that since such an event would be widely reported the following morning, and because I was up and awake and in such a perfect environment for viewing it (being away from the city lights), that my testimony about it might be important. After a few moments (probably 5 minutes) I witnessed two helicopters flying very quickly out from the direction of KSC toward the northeast. I mean they were moving at top speed. I simply thought to myself concerning them - &quot;good luck catching that sh*t!&quot; and wandered over to the opposite side of the campsite to view the KSC launch area and VAB to determine if there were any other noticeable signs of activity there as a result of the event, but couldn&apos;t discern such. I might have heard a slight (difficult to describe) sound during the event, but the surrounding water&apos;s activity may have be partly to blame, so I would offer that possibility as a fact, only that I believe I might have noted a slight sound from the object during the event. I did not report the sighting for two reasons 1). My girlfriend slept through the entire event (in the tent) and believing she&apos;d suspect I was acting like a crackpot, decided I&apos;d best keep it to myself until getting back to town in the morning where the event would be collaborated by others, and 2). because one is not normally permitted to camp out in that area during launch activities and I did not want (and still do not want) my presence there to be made common knowledge. Therefore, I&apos;d request that this report include only that I was camping in the mosquito lagoon area ONLY. After returning to town I noted (and in days to follow) I&apos;ve not run across anyone else who sighted the object (which seems hard to believe - but I suppose I&apos;ve just not run into them). Well, two days ago I related this event to a friend of mine who laughed it off, giving me the same dreaded reaction I had avoided by having told no one else sooner. Then, this morning, he called me and informed me that he had been up late last night and listened to a radio program (yours?) discussing a similar event, around the same time, but in Mexico. He told me your web site listing &quot;ufocenter.com&quot; and recommended I pull it up on the web for any information. And here I am. Don&apos;t know what else to add, other than that you may contact me if desired.

We then went outside to see what he was talking about and we saw a light flying in the sky from south-east to north-east, and then another follwing it. After watching this finally go out of site, my Dad then looked way into space to look at the stars and then noticed 2 more light flying REALLY high up and traveling VERY fast for being how high they were. They were following each other perfectly and were headed in the same direction the other object had gone to. The next day I heard that the spaceship challenger had been conecting with a russian sattelite. We heard that the same exact place in the sky we saw the first two were exaclty were the news had said it was seen that night. We then knew what the first lights were, but what really got us was the other two which were way out in the atmosphere, and it was impossible for the ship and the satelite to get that high and to go that fast.

The weather was warm, clear and sunny with a cloudless sky. The witness was out of school for the summer after completing grade one. The witness was six years old. The witnesses mother had shown him how to use a kitchen chair as a back rest by turning it over and placing it on the front lawn of the house. A pillow was used for comfort. The witness on this day was eager to go outside to sit in the sun and was concerned about missing the sun even though it was before lunch. The witness had to drag the heavy chair outside by himself as the parents did not want to go outside. The witness rushed back in to get a pillow as a cushion for his back. He sat on the grass with the chair as a back rest. The witness was facing west with the house behind him. The witness closed his eyes. An undetermined length of time passed. Something caused the witness to open his eyes and immediately turn his head to the left. The witness observed a very strange object hovering over the space between his parents house and the next door neighbours house. The object was less than fifty feet from the witness. The object had the appearance of two soup bowls placed rim to rim with a dome on top the lower part of the object was rotating from left to right. The object was grey in colour. The object was noiseless. The witness looked at the object for approx. thirty seconds and thinking it was a type of aircraft rushed into the house to alert his father who was and enthusiastic observer of aircraft. The witness kept asking his parents to &quot;come out&quot; &quot;come out&quot;. The parents kept asking what it was. The witness could not describe the object as it was completely unknown to him.

Shortly after the plane passed I observed what looked like a white star higher in the sky.  It was at this time that I also noticed that the star was moving to the north.  I pointed out the object to my co-worker and he stated that it was probably a satellite.  I continued to watch the object until it was blocked out by some high light clouds.  As the clouds passed by I was unable to pick up the moving object again. Having observed stars and a planet that night I noted that the object did not twinkle like the other stars and it did not have flashing lights on it like aircraft would have.

I was looking at it at probably a 20 degree angle so it would have been pretty high above the ground (1000 feet?)

Neither of us have sighted a UFO before. We were returning from our walk, about 5 minutes from our home, when my boyfriend pointed to the south sky and said &quot;look, twins&quot;, jokingly. As I turned to look, I at first assumed they were planes, but as my boyfriend and I continued to look, the two lights stayed in exactly the same spot, parallel to each other and about two inches apart if you were to measure the distance with your fingers.  The objects were about twice the size an brightness of Venus, which at the time was off in the west sky. We were dumbfounded, and even though I kept repeating &quot;They must be planes&quot;, we both clearly saw and stated that they were not acting like planes.  They stayed in exactly the same place, pulsating but not flashing. Then, to our amazement, a third appeared, seemingly out of nowhere, to form a triangle to the other two. The third was not as bright at first, but then grew in brightness to look just like the other two.  They remained in this inverted triangle formation for some time, a few minutes or so.  At this point, a car with 4 young men in it, all aged between about 18 and 22, drove up beside us, also having seen the sight. They said they&apos;d seen it down on the road, and were looking for a clearer view of it.  At the time, we were up on a hill. We all agreed that these did not appear to be planes, and my boyfriend and myself expressed that we were glad not to be the only ones to see it.  The men drove off, and said goodbye pleasantly. Then, the light in the upper left corner of the triangle began to leave.  It moved slowly to the east, decreasing in brightness rather quickly.  Still the other two remained in the same spot. Then the bottom sphere began to follow the first one, heading in the same path.  The last one remained in the same spot for about 5 more minutes, an we watched, not moving.  Then, it too began to head east.  We &quot;followed&quot; it, as our apartment is in that direction.  We thought we might be able to run in the house, grab the binocs, come back out and catch it...but by the time we came out it was gone. My boyfriend and I stayed out there, watching the sky for about another 15 minutes, but saw nothing.  We both agreed that neither of us had ever seen any objects in the sky behave that way in our lives. We&apos;re both familiar with planes, because we see them in the sky all the time, and saw many tonight.  Portland airport is not far from here. But I know in my gut these were not planes.

The way it looked,to me and my girlfriend, was as though it had been shot to that spot in the sky . The light became brighter and than stopped and hovered for about 1 min making no sound and than it shot upwards out of the atmosphere. We watched as it rapidly grew dimmer and disappeared. About 3 minutes later we made it to our tent still watching the sky when the exact same thing happened again, almost at the same spot in the sky.", "Three satellite-looking-lights moving in triangular formation.I have been a meteor watcher since I was a kid, for more than 35 years (I am 42).  In the last few years, it seems that I have seen more satellites than meteors and too often, satellites (i.e. moving points of light in the sky) that just seem to fade in and then fade out.  Probably explainable but still odd.  Lately, it seems that meteors are even more scarce.  That having been said, this is what happened on Sunday night. It was 9:45pm CDT and I had just sat down on my deck which faces south though I was sitting facing SE.  My house sits two miles directly south of Jones/Riverside airport, considered a &quot;small&quot; airport though I believe it gets more takeoffs and landings than Tulsa International, 10 miles to the north.  So I see lots of airplanes.  Again, I had just sat down and looked up over my left shoulder and noticed a &quot;moving point of light&quot; or a MPOL, at my 11 o&apos;clock position or so.  It was like a medium bright star (sky was very clear and somewhat crisp) moving from north to south, but no sooner than I saw it (near the constilation Cygnus) that it began to brighten.  In about 2 seconds it got so bright that it felt like a beam shining directly into my eyes.  For an instant, I thought it was an airplane banking and heading right toward me with its beacon almost blinding me.  But as quickly as it brightened, it started fading and within five seconds or so had disappeared.  I then got my binoculars, feeling that if anything else happened, I would see it up close. (A note:  my binoculars are 10x50 Jason, but have been so abused that I always cover one end and use the left side more like a telescope.  It works, but not sure how that effects the optics.) About 30 minutes later, I saw a MPOL moving from north to south, this time with a strobe.  I saw it naked eye, straight overhead, then with my binocs I saw it had a two second strobe.  I was able to see it for about 10 seconds but I could tell that after each strobe, it was dimmer and dimmer until it just faded out.  This happened twice more in about 15 minutes, with a dim but solid light going N to S and then with another &quot;strober&quot; going W to E.  Seeing four of these MPOL&apos;s in about 30 min. time was really strange to me and my history of viewing the sky. Strange in that they ALL faded away. But about 10:30pm, I saw, again, a medium bright &quot;star&quot; moving slowly from NW to SE, in my 10 or 11 o&apos;clock position, almost going straight down from my perspective.  When I focussed my binocs on this MPOL, I tried to use a couple of stars in my view field to make sure this other one was really moving. Then I noticed that these other two &quot;stars&quot; were also moving.  The three lights,all the same brightness were moving together in the same direction at the same speed. I do not believe that they were physically connected and it wasnt a solid object for I could see stars in between the point star and the two parallel stars that were trailing.  They formed a triangle with legs being about 3 times as long as the distance between the two trailing lights, a thin but long legged triangle shape moving in the direction of the point.  I watched for maybe 5-10 seconds before lowering my binocs to get an overall look at the sky, but I couldn&apos;t see anything odd with my naked eye.  When I raised the binocs again, I could only re-locate the two trailing lights still moving together in the same direction as before.  Although I assume these to be the same two, something seemed different about them, but I am not sure what.  Less than five seconds later, these two lights faded from view, still far from the horizon where I might expect them to fade away. By now my heart was really pumping.  I didn&apos;t know what I would see next.  And I didn&apos;t see anything for over an hour but about 11:45pm, I started seeing meteors.  After my long  meteor drought, even during last weeks shower (I worked graveyard shift so peak night I only got to view during short brks) I saw four meteors in the ESE part of the sky, all in about 10 minutes.  All going more or less to the south. Then at about midnight, I was going to call it a night.  I looked at the patch of sky where the three lights had been (now much further to my west) and saw one last beauty of a meteor, right where they had been. With my binocs, I can barely see, at the same time, the 2nd and 3rd stars in the handle of the Big Dipper.  It was only a little bit easier to get all three moving lights in my field at the same time.  I suppose that would give you an idea of the distance between the point and the two trailing lights.  Again, my binocs are used more like a telescope. I must say again, when I realized what I was seeing, I was on the border of being really scared.  If they had not disappeared so quickly, well, I&apos;m not sure what I would have done. Hope this wasn&apos;t a waste of your time.", "I was on my hammock with my 19 mos. old son -- I was trying to rock him to sleep when I saw a small circular pinpoint -- green in hue -- in the western sky -- traveling north at slightly downward trajectory. It was fast -- it took all of 2-3 seconds, I&apos;ve seen my share of shooting stars  -- this was diffrent -- smooth -- no tail. My son, who is just learning to talk,  even commented &quot;wow&quot;.

They increase and decrease in intensity and will slowly fade out of sight. Sometimes they will reappear at a higher elevation or east or west slightly of there last illuminated position.

I thought maybe a transformer had blown so I went in and woke my father up. we went around to the front of the house and it seemed louder,and when we looked up, there it was just sitting there, a big black triangle right above the trees. I started to shoot at it but Pa said it could be miltary then it took off straight up and out of sight about 5 min later three military helicopters came over our house so low i could see the people inside. evey scince that night we have had helicopters flying around our house real low real late at night.

My friend and I stopped our conversation to look towards the east to see an amazing light illuminating the clouds and the entire perimeter of the sky.  It was so incredible it made me think of the &quot;Second Coming of Christ&quot;!  After a few seconds of the brignt light, an orange/red fireball fell to the horizon line.  I waited for it to hit the earth and to feel the impact but there was nothing.  It was so close it must have hit somewhere.  Of course I immediately thought it must be a meteor but what was unusual was that the &quot;tail&quot; PRECEDED the fireball to the ground instead of following it.  Other campers next to us were commenting on the event:  &quot;did you see that, look at that&quot; etc.  The next morning I talked to them and asked what they saw and they comfirmed what I had seen.  I was very relieved to hear Mr. Davenport on Art Bell&apos;s show Aug. 26, 1999.  I had been trying to find our some information on this event and had been unsuccessful until then.  It was so amazing I knew others must have witnessed this event.  I have never seen anything like it in my life.

It took hard right angle turns.  It was enormous and miles high in the sky.This was witnessed by 5 professional people, none of whom are into UFO&apos;s or New Age things.  We tried to figure every rational and logical explaination for what we saw.  It was very extraordinary. It was a very clear night, not a cloud in the sky.  We were outside on a deck talking.  One person said, &quot;What the *&amp;%# is that?&quot;  When we looked there was a large glowing almost picture in the sky. It was miles and miles and miles up. It looked almost like thin clouds covering the moon, which would explain the glow.  From the thin clouds there was a very thick glowing trail coming straight out.  The trail made sharp right angle turns.  It litterally looked like it was &quot;connecting the stars&quot; of the latle part of the big dipper. The whole thing was massive.  As we watched and tried to figure out what we were looking at, we noticed it was adding on. There was a small light creating the glowing trail.  The new thinner glowing trail was circling around back towards the glowing cloud like cluster we thought had to be covering the moon. It continued to make a large circle, then the light that was creating it vanished.  When it vanished, the entire picture stopped glowing.  It now looked the color of a normal airplane trail when a plane is gone.  We watched as the sharp immage discipated. After about 10-15 minutes it broke up to an enormous circle that resembled a smoke ring.  THE MOON WAS NOT IN THE SPOT OF THE GLOWING CLOUD!!  It was just empty sky.  The moon was a half moon that was hidden by the house of the deck which we were on. (We saw the moon when we left the home.) We all know we saw something incredibly unique and would love for someone to give rational explaination of what it could have been. An acquaintance of ours 20 miles away saw the same thing.

I was throwing something into the trashcan out at the curb, and when I turned around and walked towards the house I looked up at the sky. That is when I saw something that looked like an airplane, but the lights were formatted backwards. Flying west to east, there were three white lights, two in the front, leading it, and one in the back. There was also a steady red light in the center, which was not blinking, but glowing faintly. There was no sound like a normal plane would make, but a low humming sound. There were also no other planes in the area. I watched it until it passed; I did not have any cameras, so I could not get a picture of it. I always look up at night and look for things, but I did not expect to really find anything around here.

We were kids at the time, but my recollections are for the most part vivid.1st Object: Estimated height was about 7 feet at the apex.  The base was probably about 7x7 feet also.  The object appeared solid and metalic.  My younger brother and I insist the object was orange, but his friend believed it to be greenish. 2nd Object: Estimated diameter was about 1 foot.  The sphere was red and appeared luminiscent. The first object appeared above a neighbor&apos;s house while we were standing on the sidewalk.  It hovered above the house and some power lines.  The second object, a red sphere, came out of the object and descended about 10 feet below the first object.  After the descent of the sphere, the pyramid object began to rise and move slowly toward the south-east.  After traveling slowly for several hundred yards, it accelerated very quickly on its south-east path and disappeared.  I can&apos;t recall what happened to the red sphere.

Initially the object appeared to be a brighter than normal star and was noticed to shift colors, thought to be due to atmospheric distortion; however, it was determined to be otherwise.  It was noticed that the object was strobing or changing from red to blue to white in a random order, but was clearly not a star or a planet.  It was observed through binoculars by myself and several other police officers, which verified the color changes, but no definitive shape of the object could be determined, because of the distance.  I made telephone contact with the tower at Jacksonville International Airport (JIA) and a controller visually confirmed the object west of his position (240 to 270 degrees), but informed me that he had no radar returns in that area, indicating that it was not an aircraft. (The airport was about 8 miles north of my location.)  The controller even joked that it could be a &quot;UFO&quot;.  Because the object remain completely motionless at altitude for an extended period, we ruled out a helicopter or fixed-wing aircraft.  The tower also assisted in ruling out a antenna, tower, or balloon.

We were heading west. It was approx. 9:30 pm, and I remember this because I played football and it was during the time of 2 a days. It was after practice. As we were travelling about 30 - 40 mph, I said in a panic voice, &quot;it&apos;s gonna to crash&quot;. Just above the tree line, to the left side of the road,I noticed a bright orange light moving from left to right,in front on us. I remember thinking at the time that the plane was on fire and it would certainly hit us. I slammed on the brakes. We came sliding to a stop in the center of the road, pointed slightly to the left, as I was going to veer under the plane as it went over the car, Cindy and I both noticed the orange glow off the chrome and the hood of the car. I tried to get out, but, the door was locked. I unlocked the door and got out. This is the scary part. I looked up and there was a perfectly round, bright orange, semi opague, 10 - 15 ft diameter, ball. I was so close to it, that if I had a step ladder and a broom, I could have hit it. No sound. I stood in amazement for about 5 to 7 seconds. Then I realized then what I was seeing. I was in awe. The object remained motionless. Then without warning it shot to the north towards lake Erie. It moved so fast I was barely able to follow it. It went out of sight. That was it. I lost time however, about 2 hours, I think.

We had noticed that there wasn&apos;t a cloud in the sky, and the sun had just sat down over the horizon a short time ago. So the sky was very clear, and blue with a beautiful sunset red shadow on the horizon. So we stopped by the side of the freeway, and took a short video of it, and then began driving again, and then my Fiance saw it again, and started videoing the object again, then out of nowhere appeared a brite lite round in shape I would guess just bouncing all around the skyline, and at one point it came pretty close to the other object.

WE ALL RAN AWAY.Imagine the beach at night... How the water seems black. There was a thick fog rolling in and a few of the citys orange lights were barely visable through the fog. My cousin and I were camping at Dillion&apos;s beach with our family. When our parents had gone to sleep my cousin and I snuck out of our camp to meet up with these two girls we had meet eailer that day. I remember they were students of the Sacramento FFA. We meet up with these girls and decide a walk along the beach would be kinda fun. So we followed the trail through these large sand dunes that obscure the view of the beach. When we got out on the beach we began to flurt around and my cousin said he wanted to sit with girl he was talking with. I still wanted to walk the beach and so did the other girl (I don&apos;t know their names - only that the blonde had a good size scar on her left cheek) So we began to walk the beach and we were talking about somthing when she suddenly grabbed my arm and in a husshed tone said &quot;What is that?&quot; Ilooked up to where she was pointing. &quot;I saw something move over there.&quot; I looked and saw nothing. Just fog, ocean and a few specks from the street lights about a mile and a half away. I told her she was seeing things and we continued to walk, but this time she grabbed my arm violently - nearly making me fall over. &quot;LOOK!&quot; I looked up to see a green aura slowly emerge from behind the dunes and it slowly floated towards the shore. It casted a lime green color but unlike an electric lightbulb beam, the light emmiting from this thing was spread out evenly, there seemed that there was no source, no origin to the unearthly green glow. I looked over at the girl and said &quot;Let&apos;s go get my cousin&quot;. She agreed hastily as we ran down the beach to find him. He was were we left him with the other girl and I ran up to him from out of the darkness and in a tone I have never spoken before said &quot;GET UP AND COME WITH ME NOW!&quot; and for some reason he did not even ask why as I lead the other three back up the shore line. All the while I was thi! nking how stupid we would sound once we got there and nothing was to be seen. Much to my suprise the green aura was there! It was hovering silently above the wet part of the sand. All four of us stood in shaock. I remember someone asking what it was but no one answered because the aura began to move. And it was moving towards us! The two girls immediatly turned tail and fled as my cousin grabrd my shoulder and told me to run. I resisted and he let go and began to run as I looked back the aura was moving much faster than a seconed before and it was coming at me... I felt afraid for my life...I have never been afraid like that ever. I stood there just a moment longer to get a good look at it then I too ran away as fast as I could and I never looked back. When we got back the girls went to their camp and my cousin and I sat around the embers of our campfire. We began to talk about what we had seen when a horrible scream filled the night air. It was a girl&apos;s scream and it was coming from the girl&apos;s camp. The girl that my cousin was talking with on the beach begaing to scream out at the top of her lungs &quot;WHAT was IT? WHAT was it? WHAT was it?&quot; Untill the members of her camp came out to calm her down.

In the sky to the north, moving due east to west was an object which glinted in the sun. It was a clear night, just some high clouds. With  7 x 50 binoculars the object clearly  consisted of 3 parts. A leading &quot;round&quot; part with, on either side, as if being dragged by &quot;wires&quot; (which were visible), two similar round objects (almost as if it were an obeject with two parachutes, or a gondola with two balloons). Movement was very steady with no vapor trail. In the binocular the size, compared to just eye vision, was multiplied about 4x. At 19:05 another obeject appered which seemed to be a metallic object glinting in the setting sun. In the binoculars it appeared to be an object such as debris (asteroid or dead satellite) which was burning up on entry. The glinting might have been as it rotated, and was on fire, or had a shiny side which was catching the sun. Closer inspection made it seem that rather than rotating, it was moving from &quot;left to right&quot; and that it had a &quot;headlight&quot;. This object seemed rectangular. No other markings or light could be made out. Moving east to west, no vapor trail. Finally, coincidence or not, I tried calling numbers in the local yellow pages for air traffic control (O&apos;Hare), IL national air guard, and FAA, to find out what I might have seen, and all numbers were wrong, or disconnected.", "From banks of  Turnagain Arm I saw a whitish/blueish strobe type flash.

There were two green lights on one side and a blue light on the other side.  Coming from the back of the cigar was a beam of white light that shown to the ground in a 45 degree angle, what was so unusual about this light was that the beam was the same size all the way down,( it would look like a laser beam, which we did not have at that time) and it was white.  This cigar shaped object, was completely silent.  We rushed into the house and called the tv station, the radio station and the Winston-Salem Journal and Sentinel newspaper offices.  The tv stations said that they had many reports and would air a report on it on the eleven o&apos;clock news and the newspapers said that they would have a complete write-up on it the next morning.  We were informed that commercial pilots had seen the same thing over the Mississippi River. When the eleven o&apos;clock news came on, there was no mention of it, the next day in the newspaper, back in the back of the paper was a little tiny column saying that the Air Force had reports on it and it was the &quot;a piece of a rocket returning to earth&quot; and a few months later, the Air Force Blue Book said that they had made a mistake, that it was the &quot; tail of a comet.&quot;  Up until recently, I have looked towards the skies many a night since that time hoping to see another unidentifiable object, but never have since, I am still hoping to see another though !", "Extremely bright flash lasting about 1 second from a pin-point in space.

It was located at about 20 deg due West from Zenith (straight overhead). With my arm fully outstretched, this came out to be about five fist diameters from straight overhead and moving straight west. My right eye just happened to be centered over this spot in the sky and I was able to see the flash move from this pin-point of light to an adjacent star about five star diameters away to the south. I was facing southwest when this event occured. It may be my imagination, but I thought I heard a slight buzzing at the very moment of the flash. (You know how your mind simulates sound when it sees a sequence of lights? Well this is what I mean when it may be my imagination). This is the third time during the past two months that I witnessed such pin-point flashes coming from the sky. The other two occurred within a minute of each other and was just due east of Zenith at about midnight. I was looking out of my kitchen window at the sky (as I do every night during at the top of the hour during Art Bell&apos;s program) and I saw this flash.

Well the copters returned after awhile but than left again as fast as they had come back .we thought they went to refuel still looking up Isaw it again .this time my daughter saw it and we watched it for what seemed like minutes all the while describing to each other what we were seeing we both agree it was big and dark with no lights like a giant shadow that blocked out the stars as it passed.soon after the copters returned we never saw it again.", "On the above approx. date &amp; time, I was watching an airplane traveling north in the night sky. Suddenly, there was a thin orange streak that went from in front of the plane, straight south, in a second or less. There was no noise other than the plane. The plane immediately cut all lights, and never turned them back on while it was within my hearing ramge. The &quot;streak&quot; was obviously some type of aircraft, but were it not for the streak, I would have never known it was there.I actually live 13 miles due north of McAlester, in a rural area. It was a Sunday night, fully dark, and clear with lots of stars but no moon. I was out gathering wood when I heard an airplane. I looked up and saw the lights of a small prop plane. As I watched it travelling almost directly overhead, heading north, I suddenly saw an orange streak of light that begin immediately in front of the plane, and travelled due south, appearing to fly over the plane. It was gone in a fraction of a second. If I had not been looking at exactly that spot, I would never have seen it. I watched to the south for several minutes to see if any lights or exhaust would appear in the direction the streak had went, but none ever appeared. Strangely, as soon as the streak went over the plane, the plane turned out it&apos;s lights, all of them, and never turned them back on while it was within my hearing range. This is not the first time I have witnessed such a &quot;streak&quot;. The first time was in 1994 just east of McAlester. Again on a dark, starry, no-moon night.", "Returning home from a movie, we witnessed a large craft about 75 yards behind our house, hovering silently approx. 100 ft. high...The craft displayed no definite shape, multicolored lights ran around  the outside edge, therefore, it could have been spherical, ovoid, or saucer shaped. It did not move and no sound was audible. We watched fot about an hour and as I became agitated, Dad sent Mom and me ro bed. The next morning on arising,I ran outside to see it, but it was gone. Dad said he had watched ir for 3 or 4 hours and finally came to bed. Dad was 28 and a Radio repairman, Mom was 24, a factory worker, and I was about 7 ears of age.", "Luminous oval-shaped light seen over Monterey.My daughter and I were driving north on Highway 1 that evening.  We were approximately 8 miles south of Carmel when we spotted what appeared at first to be a short contrail from on aircraft approximately 35 degrees above the horizon, to the north of us.  We could not determine how far this light was, except that from our position it appeared to be above Monterey, or possibly beyond it, over the water.  As we drove on, this light appeared to expand into an oval shape.  It did not appear to move, or moved very slowly (keeping in mind that we were driving towards it).  The oval light began to fade, leaving a concentrated pinpoint of light, which then disappeared altogether. I would appreciate confirmation as to whether anyone else sighted a similar phenomenon that night.  Please email me.((NUFORC Note:  Time corrected to 2210 hrs. by witness 20AU99.))", "OBSERVED TRANSLUCENT TRIANGULAR OBJECT MOVING NORTH TO SOUTH DIRECTLY OVERHEAD, APPROXIMATELY TWO HAND WIDTHS WIDE.I was outside in the back yard of my house looking for possible meteors, at the time looking directly overhead.  A translucent object, apparently triangular in shape and about two hand widths wide, no lights whatsoever, moved through my field of view from north to south.  It was moving so rapidly that it quickly was disappearing over the house, so I ran around to the front yard and could still see it continuing directly south out of sight. I doubt that I would have even seen the object if I had not been looking directly at it when it went by. The whole event lasted only about 15 to 20 seconds.  There was no sound whatsoever connected with its passing, but stars could be seen through the object as if looking through a semi-transparent piece of glass with no clean edges. I observed no other lights or objects (and very few meteors). I am prompted to write this report (so late after the event) by the many similar sightings observed of translucent triangular shaped objects since then, most recently in Wisconsin on July 6th.", "3 Triangular craft, each identical to each other with a different colored light in each corner, circling over Lake Erie, followed by a group of helicopters.I&apos;m not sure how useful this information can be since I&apos;m not certain as to the date on which it took place, but it may be useful to mention that the show Sightings was still a prime time program then, and that a few weeks after this sighting, the show featured and event which took place in Russia involving similar craft. Also, I was quite young at the time (I&apos;m 21 now), and the accuracy of this report may seem questionable because of it, but in order to prevent any distortion of the facts the relevant information of this event was previously logged by me, and this record rather than my memory is the source of this account. It started at my friend&apos;s house, who&apos;s backyard connects to a back street adjacent to some train tracks, beyond which are mostly more train tracks, the Bethlehem Steel Plant, and then Lake Erie, so the view of the area above the lake was relatively unobstructed. I was in his yard with him and his two younger siblings, and just suggested that we go look for UFOs. This would seem more unusual if you didn&apos;t take my age into account, but it was the first time I&apos;d ever made such a suggestion. I had a small pair of binoculars with me, and we began to search the skies. It was around 7 or 8 pm, and the sun was about to go down, so there was still some light. Almost immediately, I spotted something in the sky directly above. It appeared to be a satellite to me, with blinking lights that flashed in a triangular formation. This was evident as the second flash would blink next to the first, and the third would blink behind the other two. This was rather uninteresting to us, so we headed out into his back yard looking Westward over the lake. It was probably 20 minutes when I spotted something moving South. It looked like many of the other planes we had seen going back and forth, but a bit slower, and I watched it since there was nothing else in the sky to watch. After a minute or so, this got boring to me, and I began to search the other areas of the sky. When I looked back to where I would have expected the light to be, I couldn&apos;t find it. Instead, I saw a large (compared to the original light) colorful, seemingly swirling ball of light sitting motionless over the top of the steel plant. I wondered about it, but then decided that it was probably there all along, just some light in the steel plant parking lot that just looks weird. I searched the skies again, and looked back after a minute or so. The ball was gone, but the smaller light was back, moving along it&apos;s original course. As we watched it, for now we were more curious about it, it seemed to be slowing down. When it appeared to have stopped, it soon became obvious that in fact it had turned and was headed in our direction. Through the binoculars, it appeared to be saucer shaped, with a flat bottom, thin edges, and a bulge in the middle. As it drew nearer, it began slowly to turn towards the North. It gradually came almost directly overhead, at which point we could see that it was triangular in shape. In each corner was a round, flat light, each of a different color. What these colors were, I forget, but they were plain bright colors (I&apos;m pretty sure one was red, the others may have been blue, green, or yellow). Also, the craft was being followed by 2 others just like it. They moved extremely slowly, and made no sound. This made it hard to determine it&apos;s size, but I was under the impression that they were approximately as long as a passenger jet. Through the binoculars, the back end of them seemed hazy as if intense heat was being discharged. They continued a smooth turn and headed back towards the lake. A group of helicopters appeared from around the mainland and chased the crafts out over the lake.", "Light was stationary, something about it kept drawing eyes to it as it was very bright.Seemed to move and when looked directly at it, it would be still. Noticed an airplane directly above and focused on plane(had aviation lights). Suddenly LIGHT bolted across the sky directly at the plane.Right before it would have hit plane, the light just sucked up in nothing and vanished. WOULD SURE LIKE TO FIND THIS PILOT!!!Were sitting on porch in quiet north Spokane neighborhood.Time was approx:3:20am.Apr.14 98(approx.) Clear night. Earlier had been out to some clubs. Alcohol was taken, however, this was not an incident caused by same. As i said, we were sitting on front porch talking, listening to music. I smoke, so was outside.Friend was inside changing music. I kept noticing a bright light in the south sky(my vantage was facing east with a 4 ft.porch overhang above me. Clear view to the EAST-SOUTH- AND NORTH. Out of the corner of my eye I kept noticing a bright light to the South, like it was moving.But when I would look directly at it,it seemed to be stationary. It also seemed to get brighter everytime I would notice it.(maybe that was just me?) After a few mins. a light drew my attention from directly overhead. This was obviously a plane as it had the flashing aviation lights. As I was looking up at the plane (probably within about 15 sec.) I was drawn back to the light in the South.Within  2 sec. the light got really bright and darted across the sky directly at the plane.(not sure of size of plane, but it was high up) I was looking directly at the event.My guess is this thing covered about 5 to 10 miles in an instant. (About the length of 1 1/2 Big Dippers). As it approached the plane, instead of hitting it,as it was on a collision course with the plane,it was like it just Sucked up and vanished right before contact.That is the best way I can describe it. My friend just happened to come back outside just as the light started to move across the sky and he saw it,too. I started jumping around saying to him, &apos;&apos;did you frickin see that&apos;&apos;? Probably woke some people up.He saw this too and was quite freaked by it. We talked about it again the next day. Kind of checking ourselves as to, if we really saw what we thought we saw. WE DID!! WOULD SURE LIKE TO FIND THE PILOT OF THIS PLANE. There is no way that the pilot didn&apos;t see this thing coming at him! Can you search some way to maybe find this plane and pilot?", "As My wife and I were delivering Newspapers throughout Rural Bosque County Texas, We observed an unusual set of lights hovering in the sky,they were much too low to be a star and as there was very little movement for a while we decided to stop and look at it.When we got out of the truck We observed this object move up and then down even lower then it origanlally was,there was no sound noise or anything around us..As we went back to delivering our papers we noticed that no matter which direction we turned this object was always right in front of us..This went on for over an hour of driving and delivering,and as we made our way further south,the first object became two sets of lights..As we topped the hill Headed towards Clifton Tx(probably the highest point in Bosque County)we stopped and looked at it again..As we observed the two objects the one northern most shot straight up and disapeared. As we stood there and watched the remaining object it began to seem as if it were getting closer as it soon took on shape, and one set of lights,turned into 2 and then into 3...The lights seemed to be in the form of a triangle and flashed multi colors.. After about 15 minutes of watching we went back to work and as we made our way further south my wife looked out her open window and said it looks like a giant triangle..I immediately stopped and at this point you could see the out line of something between the 3 sets of lights that appeared to be a Huge Triangle..As we watched the lights suddenly got bright enough to light up the area around us,it was light enough that we could see the deer in the area as if they were out in the daylight.At that time I got on the CB radio to ask if any of the local Truck drivers were observing this,but the radio and my truck just went dead!Then just as quickly as it lit up it was dark and my truck started right back up,we got in and went back to work and observed this object go up and down and every now and then it would zip from one side of us to the other and then back again! We observed this till about 6am when as we made our way across the Whitney Dam the object was highly visible and looking more like a triangle,then suddenly it shot up and to the side and was gone!

It dissapeared behind a large cloud after two F-16&apos;s were racing towards it.It was a about 1300 hours and I was coming back from lunch. I was smoking my cigar in the shade of the building and I was by myself. After I noticed a very bright, metallic object just NE of my location.  The sun was high and behind me. The wind was blowing lightly toward the SW.  It was a beautiful day with occasional large fluffy clouds drifting by. As I watched the object, it seemed to be creeping up and away at one time, so I thought that it may be very far away at that point. Even though it appeared to be rather close.  Then it moved towards the towards the East. About 3 minutes after I noticed the object, two employees came out to have a smoke break.  I asked them what they thought. They were both retired from the military.  They said they didn&apos;t know what it was either.  After they finished their cigarettes, they went back inside but I stayed and watched because I had some cigar left anyway. As the object moved East, I tried to guage the speed by a fence at the end of the parking lot.  It took about a minute to go the distance between each of the fence posts (it is a high chain link fence with poles 10&apos; apart). After moving between 5 or 6 fence posts, a large cloud came drifting towards my location. At this point I lost sight of the object.  I waited to see if I could see it after the cloud moved.  I gave up after a few minutes and thought to myself, if it was something important, the local air force base would send a jet to check it out.  As I started to go inside, two jets, I&apos;m guessing F-16&apos;s, came flying by side by side heading in the direction of the object.  They both disappeard behind the cloud and I lost sight of them and the object as well.", "I Saw two fuzzy things what I thought were meterorites traveling east to west.One was behind the other going at extreme speed. The other one came later about 1 1/2min later same speed and direction.My wife and I were outside trying to see some shooting stars and we saw three satellites this night and all of a sudden we saw two fuzzy looking meteorites, we thought, traveling east to west and one following the other. I did not have the binoculars at the time and when we saw the two I brought the glasses outside and waited to see something.  Then out of the same direction came another fuzzy object and this time I focused the binoculars and it turned out to be a circle with a very slight orange glow. I could completely see the disk. It had no lights, not leaving a trail, no noise just going very fast and they were about 75 to 80 degrees from the horizon.  Looks like the last one was trying to catchup with the other two.

When I looked up in the sky exactly above my head I had my eye on bright star and a couple of others in the area one of them moved. I am not sure now that it was a star. The object was not very bright but when it started to move it grew in length and width it was the shape of a capsule like a pill, it got VERY bright and it moved a short distance and then it started to dim and just blinked out. It was moving north from south and it was straight up from where I was standing facing north. When I first saw this I said, &quot;wow&quot; and my co-worker looked up and saw the object disappear. I thought it may have been a shooting star but it didn&apos;t streak and it didn&apos;t look like other shooting stars I have seen before.

I did not see the actual craft, because I was too afraid to go up to the window directly. I viewed the lights from about 10 feet from the window. There were five lights in all, two giant white lights, and three orange ones in a horizontal line below it, in between the white lights. The lights appeared to be about 500-600 feet in the sky, and maybe 1000 feet from where I was. I live in a partially-wooded area and the object was completely unmoving and made no noise at all and was over these woods. My sister also saw the lights but given she was about 11 and me 14 at the time, we got scared as hell and ran downstairs. I wish I would have watched longer, but when I came back upstairs about 20 min. later the lights were gone. The best way I can describe it is as a giant Semi truck in the sky, just sitting there. I have seen maybe tens of thousands of planes at night, living about 15 miles from a major airport and in the line of the landing approach path, and I have never seen anything even remotely like this, ever. No way it was reflection either, because that would not explain the perfectly aligned orange lights that matched the white ones, and the windows were closed and the lights in my room were off. The white lights were very bright, almost like hi-beam headlights. It made no noise and did not move while I watched it. My sister and I are convinced it was not a plane.

It was large, as big as a foot ball field judging by the nearby trees it lit up like daylight. it had windows with a bright bluish/white light inside and had lights all around the bottom. At first I thought someone put up a large &quot;double wide&quot; mobile home there in the couple hours I was inside. Then I realized it was larger than any mobile home and actually would be as large as four of these put end to end. I also noticed a number of antennas and other &quot;garbage&quot; sticking and jutting out from the top and sides. after running back inside my aunt came out and was a bit shaken by this. I was pretty scared too but I was intrigued. It was just that weird. After about watching this for around 10 minutes it began making a very low sound. like a buzzing wire that isnt plugged into the stereo correctly but with more variation in pitch and alot deeper. you could feel this in the pit of your stomach and my aunt felt sick. the craft then began to lift off the ground and turn. it was then that i could see it clearly was a rectangle as it slowly turned it&apos;s narrower side towards us. it turned off some of its lights and began moving steadily upward in an awkward wobbling motion almost like it was too heavy to support it&apos;s own weight. at this point the sound became more intense and my aunt went back inside for fear that it might crash and we weren&apos;t that far away. it managed to lift off vertically and turn itself 90 degrees after reaching about three times the height of the tops of the trees.  then for about a 25-45 seconds it began shaking wildly and began to accelerate like the space shuttle but only with that low humming sound not a rockets roar. after it started shooting upwards it was nearly out of sight within 10 minutes becoming nothing more than a slowly moving star.

It was approximately 9:30 in the evening.  It is important to note that the dining room windows of the house face the Kentucky hills and the Ohio River Bottom lands.  We were finishing up for the night, when my sister (who was emptying a thermos out the dining room window) reported having seen a strange &quot;red&quot; light in the sky.  By the time we got to the window, of course, what she had seen was no longer there.  Our curiosity was arroused enough to go outside in the cool Autumn air. We were standing on the corner of the house (me, my Mother, Sister, and very small niece and nephew) when from the North, over the house which sits on a hill in front of my sister&apos;s house came the first &quot;craft.&quot;  I would like to mention at this point that I am an avid fan of aviation, and very familiar with aircraft (although I do not have a pilot&apos;s license).  The craft was &quot;elliptical&quot; shaped approximately the size of a 747 (today) if a curved lines were drawn from wing tip to wing tip and from nose to tail.  It had a superstructure.  Quite frankly, although this was YEARS before the movie Close Encounters of the Third Kind, I would have to say that it resembled a smaller version of the Mother Ship in the movie that came over Devil&apos;s Tower.  It had a band of very irridescent lights on it&apos;s rim, which seemed to flash in a red-colored sequence.  There were windows, or &quot;portholes&quot; on it&apos;s body, and superstructure.  Except for a very low, almost inaudible hum, it made no noise.  It slowly passed over my sister&apos;s house, went approximately another 200 yards, and hovered over the fields of the river bottoms. We stood in amazement at this event, and while we watched in awe, another craft, identical in description flew over and hovered close to the first at a lower altitude level.  Then, a 3rd, 4th, and finally the 5th craft.  Once the final craft was in position, it seemed as if they were communicating with each other using the sequencial lights, and some very bright lights on the superstructure.  Suddenly each one emitted a very bright white light, and then went totally dark.  The time frame from fly over of first craft to the darkening of the ships was approximately 30-35 minutes. After the crafts went dark, they each did a ultra-high speed vertical climb, as their form could be seen in the clear, moonlit night.  Although my family and I did not report this to officials (and I&apos;m somewhat nervous about reporting this to you, although for all these years I&apos;ve wanted to tell someone other than the VERY close friends that I have told) for fear of being ridiculed.  There were reports in the local newspaper the next day of &quot;Strange Lights Appeared over Ohio Night Sky.&quot; This event to me was proof-positive that there is life out there.  In addition, being a person who does believe in a &quot;supreme being&quot; I find it ridiculous that in this vast-endless universe, on this tiny planet, that we are so &quot;special&quot; as to be the only form of intellegent life.  The event of the late 60&apos;s has also left an embedded desire to see crafts, or have an encounter again.  I find myself looking up to the heavens a lot of times when I&apos;m outside at night.", "A light was moving at extreme speeds in a sharp circle it was changing from blue to white on route 2 east bound.the light was manuvering at extremely high speeds in a circle and changing from blue to white.

Heading northeast and upward it raced completely out of sight.The craft was  oval shaped and silver gleaming, and  was at a very high attitude.  Myself Randy and Jon witnessed this event on August 19, 1999, at 20:00.  The craft came to a complete halt at a high altitude, and remained completely stationery for long enough for us to get out of the vehicle and looked at the object through a pair binoculars.  It then proceeded at a high rate of speed straight up and again came to complete stop.  It then started in a direction towards us overhead and upward gainin in altitude quickly northeast towards Malmstrom Air Force Base in Great Falls, Montana. For a moment there was a small stream of white trailing behind the object.   Within moments it disappeared into thin air.  Even with high power binoculars  the object was gone.   It was broad daylight with a few light clouds, and we were on the northside of town along the Missouri River.", "at about 23:00, i was looking up the sky, up above my head, 90o, i saw a dot light like a star zigzags for about 15 to 20 seconds. the speed is slower than a shooting star, but clearly very fast.

It was the track and intensity of the streak that gave me the impression of an incoming ballistic missile. I actually looked for a place to take cover should there be an explosion.  However, to my relief, there was no follow-up sound or explosion.  Shortly thereafter I arrived home to tune-in to the start of the Art Bell show. Mr Davenport was being interviewed about strange lights over Las Vegas within the &quot;last hour&quot; or less.  I&apos;d say that my sighting was approximately coincident with the time frame expressed by Mr. Davenport in his report. The time coincidence motivated my original e-mail report. I have checked my maps while writing this report.  Las Vegas appears north east, and Phoenix slightly south of east of Redondo Beach. I am an aerospace engineer who has worked for more than 10 years on space programs, including support of space launch vehicles. I have a BSEE and 3 graduate degrees in Engineering, including an MS in Aeronautics &amp; Astronautics.((FOLLOW-UP MESSAGE FROM SAME WITNESS))Message--I looked at the picture of Dec 19.  The white trailing streak rang a bell.I filed a report of an evening event (6/9/99  21:58 from Redondo Beach Cal.) seen from Redondo Beach on my way home to listen to the Art Bell show.  It so happened that you were being interviewed about the same time about strange lights over Las Vegas.  I went back to again read my report on www.ufocenter.com and it describes &quot;An intensely white-phosporous colored streak heading down vertically from the overhead sky..&quot;  The event appeared SE from my observation point while Las Vegas is generally NE.  Thus the streak did not show vertical where the reported event occurred. OK. First, for what it is worth, that white streak trailing that white ball in subject Dec. 19 photo reminds me of what I saw and reported upon that evening.  It might be that what I saw was thicker and traveling vertically.  However, the white trail is of Dec. 19 is what I meant by an &quot;intensely white-phosphorus colored streak&quot; seen against a background of a dark.  Secondly, another point now captures my detection. I consider it of second order but worthy of consideration.  In the Dec. 19 photo, the white streak and ball is approaching a &quot;target&quot; horizontally after a vertical decline.  In other words it does not descend vertically into its apparent target-the volcano. But this too is consistent with the observation and proximate time report out of Las Vegas. I saw the vertical streak SE from Redondo Beach while the action you were reporting upon was over Las Vegas which is NE from Redondo Beach (see my account in the report of 6/9).  So to me this suggests that vertical streak sightings and somewhat distant horizontally observed arial phenomena may still be causally connected. One other unrelated point.  In the past from time to time observers in your reports on the air refer to flying objects as being &quot;motionless&quot;. Remember now, that an earth bound observer &quot;observes&quot; from a rotating reference frame (the earth).  So if an object is witnessed as being motionless, it is to say that v=dR/dt = 0 relative to an observer on a rotating reference frame.  It is also to say, that the object has the same motion as the earth-bound observer, which is probably not zero in an absolute sense.((name deleted)) (Redondo Beach, CA)  ((e-mail address deleted))((NUFORC Note:  Our gratitude to the witness for the excellent report, and for the useful follow-up data about this incident.  PD))", "A bright light about the sized of a dime appeared, high in the NE sky.  It lasted for about 5 seconds, then dropped immediately to about the size of a pea for about 3-5 seconds.  It then dropped to the brightness of a second magnitude star and started moving left to right at the speed of a satellite for about 3-5 seconds, then disappeared.Two of us were sitting in the yard about 10:35 p.m. watching a fireworks display that was being launched by a private party on Lake Washington near Medina.   All of a sudden a large light appeared to have been switched on high the sky in the ENE direction.  It was so bright that it caught our attention out of the corner of our eye. It was yellowish to white, and appeared to be just about the size of a dime.  After watching it stationary in the sky for about 5 seconds, the light immediately diminished to about the size of a pea and appeared white.  There was no movement.  About 5 seconds later the light dropped to about the size of a bright star, still with no movement.  A second after this change in size, the light started moving right to left about the speed of a satellite.  Movement lasted for about another 5 seconds, and then immediately disappeared. The sky was beautiful.  No clouds at all. The object or light was about 65-70 degrees from the horizon.  About the same level as the N. star.  Because of size the initial light appeared relatively close.  After it had dropped to the size of a bright star, it appeared to be at least satellite altitude.", "A very large triangular aray of (3) lights seen in the east and moving rapidly north north-west.A friend an I were watching the sky for the perceids meteor shower. We were just south of Raleigh, NC. There was a good deal of light pollution but the sky was clear. We were facing east and watching high in the east sky. I noticed an orange light in the sky that at first I thought was an aircraft, but it would have had to be extremely high (I could not distinguish the red/green sides and there was no strobe).  There was also no sound. It struck me that the light was moving very fast for such a height. I made a comment about it. My friend looked and was shocked. She saw a very large triangle. When she stated she saw the triangle I shifted my field of view that had been concentrating on the one point I spotted and realized there were 3 greatly separate points in a triangular shape all moving together and at what seemed to be a very great speed if the lights were as distant as they seemed to be. We both watched the triangle move to the north north-west. I tried to see if it obstructed any stars as it moved, but the light pollution was too great and the visible stars too few, I did not see it pass in front of any visible star until I lost sight of it in the light pollution to the North. The total sighting could not have been more than 15 seconds, more likely it was 10 or less. The triangle shape was irregular, certainly not equilateral. To judge it&apos;s size I compared it to Jupiter and Saturn, which were both visible at this time in the east sky. The longest side of the triangle was about 6/10 to 7/10 the distance between Jupiter and Saturn. The next side was about 4/5 the size of the longest side, while the shortest side was perhaps 1/2 the size of the longest side. It did not move with one of the points in the lead, rather it seemed to sweep across the sky with the shortest side of the triangle in the lead. The corner points did seem rigidly fixed, they did not move relative to each other at all during the observation. My friend and I are both unsure if this was one very large object or simply three lights flying in this pattern. She (very much a UFO skeptic) believes it was one object; without having seen it obstruct a star I&apos;m unsure and more inclined to think it was 3 objects. We both agree that it moved across the sky too quickly to be aircraft at the height that aircraft would have had to be at to look like this (several miles). By itself I expect this report to be pretty unspectacular.  I&apos;m submitting it only because I realize that there may have been other sky watchers at or around the time who also saw it and may have been able to make a better observation. I hope that this report can help back up such an observation. I am not e-mailing any additional information at this time, but would be glad to do so if such were requested. I also do not check the request for a contact or collect call boxes. However, if there are other reports that this report can help collaborate, please contact me via e-mail and I will be glad to provide any information requested. And, of course, if you somehow know what we saw, please let me know.", "Around midnight I heard this noise and I looked outside and there were like 5 or 6 blinking lights up in the sky....they were in a row and  then some would dissapear and another would appear. And off to the side there were about 3 red lights. I have no idea what it was. The lights seemed to be moving.....the red ones were slower. I tried to take a picture of it, it probably won&apos;t turn out though.....but we got out the video recorder and recoreded some of it.Around midnight I heard this noise and I looked outside and there were like 5 or 6 blinking lights up in the sky....they were in a row and  then some would dissapear and another would appear.

He said that he heard it coming and it had an additional sound like the whirring of a helicopter along with the jet sound so he waited outside for it to go overhead. I was amazed at what I saw, my first thought was that it had to be experimental. The entire craft could best be described as arrow-shaped and a silver-goldish color. Not a chrome silver but not iron gray either. It was flying fairly low like a plane in a holding pattern would do at a small airport. How high that is in feet I dont know. The jet was flying straight north, the direction helicopters fly over our house all the time and only just a little higher than that. It was the size of a medium sized commercial passenger plane. We watched it fly over for almost a minute before it was lost behind the trees, so it was not going fast. I did not hear the whirring sound my son heard, and we could hear each other talking so it could not have been very loud; no high-whining sound like a jet makes, and it was low enough to be deafening. I pointed things out to my son as it was going over and said, &quot;now quickly go draw a picure of it before you forget what it looks like.&quot;  The front of it was very much shaped like a wide arrow-head, rather than more pointed with what looked like antennas pointing towards the back from the two points. Then there was a very long middle section, disproportionate from the rest. Too thin and too long, and round like a pencil. It didn&apos;t seem to make sense. (We had time to talk about what it could be for while we watched it go overhead.) We didn&apos;t notice any markings or outside antennas on this section. It seemed to be completely sleek. The tail section was much larger than the front section by at least 3:1 and reminded me more of the stealth design in its shape only the edges were far less rounded. On the back I saw 2 round, large, black shapes (my husband said they sounded like thrusters, I though they were landing wheels but bigger) and I saw a little of what looked like cages on top of each side. (My husband said these sounded like intakes.) I remember seeing an antenna sticking up somewhere and fins sticking up on each side. The back section was more familiar and less remarkable than the rest of it. (The rest of it was very remarkable.) In fact the front of it looked so flat that it looked more like it had rudders on each side of a long pencil than anything else. The back was flattened also but not to that degree.  Nothing like a cockpit was seen. I very much think it was some kind of (fighter?) jet and wonder if it was coming from a military base my son says is south of here.  But why would it fly so low straight into the Gary, IN airport traffic and why at such a conspicuous time of day?  We have been looking for something on line for a few days to see if anyone else has seen anything like it.  We even looked at Boeing and Lockheed&apos;s homepages to see if we could get a clue as to it&apos;s design and origin and found nothing. We thought you might have heard something about it and it might explain some other sightings in the area that were less visible.  I am a 38 year old mother of 5 children and my son is 17, working at a bible conference grounds and an avid computer enthusiast. I don&apos;t know if you can let me know anything about this, but we are very curious and would appreciate it it you could fill us in.  Thanks for your time.", "My boyfriend and I were driving down a beachside road, when overhead we saw an oval shaped object appear for about two minutes. Before this occured all of the lights in our car turned off for no reason and then went back on a few second later. A few minutes later a veichle appeared behind us and then all of a sudden it disappeared. There were no roads turning off the road we were on so the vehicle just disappeared. This sighting occured in Prince Edward Island, Canada", "Green shapes flying across west horizon above hills where other people had been saying they had seen stuff around there before.It was about 2 years ago, I belive around June of 1997, I was on my computer and all of a sudden my brother and his friend ran in yelling they had seen UFO&apos;s above the hill. I was really excited right after they told me this becuase I had never seen anything remotly like a UFO, so I ran outside with them to witness it for myself if they had come around. I then asked them, while waiting for something else to happen, what exactly they had seen. My brother told me that they had seen a green light hovering over the hills to the west of my house, and that it had stayed there for quite a few minutes. After watching it they had seen it streek across the sky to the right in a perfect line and had actually left a trail for a few seconds. He also told me that his friend had been driving to my house right before this happened and he had said that his CD players and radia had mysteriously played the CD backwards! Backwards!! Then the radio made noise&apos;s and then turned off. After he told me this it was a few more minutes that I myself had seen the lights in the sky. I was looking somewhere else when my brother yelled to me that he saw it again and pointed to me where the direction it was at. I looked up and there was a bright green light in the sky. I watched it rise above the hill and stay there for a couple minutes, It then streaked across the sky VERY fast and left a line behind it for a few seconds. It went across the horrizon in seconds. I then saw it reappear again near the same area, a little bit higher this time. Then the same thing happened but it streaked towards the ground and then across the horrizon. We then waited for about five minutes more and it had acctually appeard above us and had a sound to it this time. It was really fast and the sound sorta sounded like a crackling sound and a wisk kinda sound. After that I didnt see anything else, but days after I had heard other people saw it and even said they had seen things in that area before.", "Between 8:15 and 9:00 I saw an object that seemed to hover over the Ocuirrh mountains just west of Salt Lake or further out It started at about 250 degrees west at about 20 degrees alt.", "Light came from over our hill and started circulating above us.Around mid May I was walking my girlfriend outside as I do when she leaves at night.  As we exited my front porch in my rural town we saw a beam of light coming over the top of the hill I live on, near the road.  We just assumed it was a car but heard nothing.  The light shifted and rose over the trees.  I did not see where this light was coming from.  We both stared at this beam of light that rose from the tree tops over our heads.  I said to my girlfriend &quot;It looks like someone has a really bright flash light or spot light and is in the trees shining it!!&quot;  As rediculous as it sounds that is exactley what it looked like! I could not figure where this light was coming from.  The light lifted up in the air way above the tree tops and the beam of light shortened towards us and turned in a rotating motion over our heads.  It looked like a bunch of little rays of light rotating over our heads.  I grabbed my girlfriend and said for her to move out from under it.  I ran inside and told my father to come outside and see.  When he got outside it was gone but there was this bright, glow-like cluster of clouds in the sky.  Now I don&apos;t know if what we saw was nature or UFO.

I watched as dark clouds approached from the northwest. While looking at the sky through my sliding glass door, something odd moving in the sky, caught my attention.  I quickly opened the door and ran outside to get a better look.  Moving directly ahead of the storm front and below the clouds was an object that I could not identify.  At first, I thought it was some type of missile.  It didn&apos;t have any wings. The object was silvery white and then it changed to black.  I realized it was actually in a continuous roll, end over end, as it crossed the sky.  On one roll it was very narrow and oblong.  On the next roll, there was the unmistakable shape of a triangle.  The triangle was black and equalateral with the corners slightly rounded.  The object continued to roll very quickly across the sky, and then it was gone from sight. This all happened in a matter of between eight to ten seconds.  The time was approximately 3:45pm.  The directional movement of the object was northwest to southeast.

The object was low on the horizon. As I write this now I can hear several loud aircraft in the background out my window. The object had no distinguishable characteristics other than being a ball of light, if I were to guess at the size of the object, I would say that it was probably the size of a large or medium sized helicopter.

My wife was driving the car, I was sitting in the front seat.  The moon was full and I glanced up to look at it.  I saw two lights, one approaching approximately from the north, one from straight up, moving on a path towards each other.  There were no flashing lights as might be seen on a commercial aircraft. They seemed to be a good distance away.  However, they were moving about as fast as you might see a commercial jet moving overhead.  They looked like white lights, small, punctate.  I thought at first that they might be commercial airliners, but again, there were no flashing lights visible.  Given the apparent distance, they were moving too fast for commercial airliners.  The two dots crossed paths at about the same time that we turned the corner.  I told my wife but she couldn&apos;t look up to see until it was too late.  We went around the block to see if they were still visible.  They were not, but I did see a commercial airliner moving in a northerly direction.  It had flashing lights.", "my mom and i were driving home from work we saw the sky lite up almost like day light a few seconds later we saw this trail like thing fall from the sky and it kinda turned into a ball of firethis has to do with what i saw on aug 15 it was like around 11 at night my mom works in santa fe nm, and i went with her to help her out we finished closing and left around 10 we live in rio rancho nm which is like 45 minutes to an hour from santa fe....we leave my mom&apos;s work and we&apos;re heading home we get into bernillo thats like 15 20 minutes from my house, my mom is driving and we&apos;re on this stretch of a um it&apos;s kinda like a highway or something i dunno you can go fast on it so i dunno whatever well it&apos;s disolate you cant really drive without your brights on it&apos;s dark i mean dark anyway we are just talking up a storm laughing and whatnot,so i light a smoke and i&apos;m sitting indian stlye and playing with my shoe my back is facing the car door and i&apos;m looking out at the sandias(our mountains) marveling over how scary it looks and me and my mom are talking and i was like well i&apos;m happy for ......as i was saying that i see that the sky is lit up and i was thinking cool lightening rock on and my mom is just looking up and she kinda slowed down and we&apos;re both kinda staring at the sky and everything was silent the sky stayed lit up for awhile(perhaps 10 seconds if that) and i looked at my mom and i was going to say something but then i turn my head towards my window for some reason and i see this huge and i mean HUGE trail kinda looked like millons and zillons of sparklers coming down it was long then it just exploded it was brillant, it lit up the sky more i dunno how to explain it it was like first the sky lit up then it went dark then the explosion came and lit up the sky like daylight the explosion(thats the best way i know how to call it an explosion) was like a white yellow orange type colour all rolled into one but the center of it was white and bright almost as if the sun was falling it came down super fast but when it exploded it slowed down after it exploded it was all normal again no trails of like stuff falling down it just stop as if nothing ever happened it was at an angle when it was falling but before it exploded it went straight ummm lemme see if there is anything else  i can shut my eyes and still see it clearly the trail ....well um lemme see if i can explain it just started it wasnt like there was a long trail leading  further up into the sky it kinda just started in the middle then fell into the explosion there were a few people on the road that saw it also there wasn&apos;t any sounds made during this it was all quite and calm it was so amazing to see i am glad i did see it&apos;s kinda scary ! though not knowing for sure what it was,the morning after that had happened i tried watching the news to see if any one could tell me what it was but to no avail everyone i ask they either didnt see it or dont know what i am talking about i tried to describe everything the best way i know how when i say explosion i feel it dosent do justice to what i saw it wasn&apos;t like a saw an aircraft explode it was like when the trail was falling it started in the middle of the sky right,then  it fell for a few seconds then the trail kinda turned into this ball like thing, it was so big as soon as the explosion thing appeared the trail went away i think that is pretty much it thanks for your time", "I was a young child and had very scary nightmares and now I have realized they were the result of an abduction.This isn&apos;t neccessaraly a sighting, but rather an abduction experiance. The only way I can remember my abductions are the dreams (or awake memories) that I am left with. I was about five, and the dreams lasted for 1-2 months. I drempt them in strictly black and white and a disturbing double vision. Besides that, I can remember being in a dim room laying paralyzed on a table. I tried to move my head to see something but was unable to. My eyes were able to move, but not my head. I can&apos;t remember any feeling in my body, so I don&apos;t know if I had clothes on or if I was laying on a metal table. I assume it was metal. I saw two of everything so my vision was very poor. I felt a presence so I continued to un-strain my eyes and lift my head, but I was unable to. I remember a celing probably 6-8 feet above me and a wall about 9 feet to my left. It was plain and didn&apos;t look like sheetrock. I tried so hard to look around but my vision was limited. These dreams lasted over a period of 1-2 months, from what I can remember just about every night. I have read information on characteristics of abductees and the majority are true with me.

Object was flashing multiple colored lights very quickly in a round or octagon shape. Objects path was straight, then turned left and back to right in sky without banking. Its movement in sky was like a spike from heartbeat on EEG readout. 5 adults viewed from spotting scope, and none could explain it&apos;s shape, pattern or lights as something of human technology. Neighbors whom saw are nonbelievers in UFOs or extraterrestial life because of relegious beliefs, but both now believe they saw object with shape and manuevers of nothing of known technology.

It was a clear Friday before Easter Sunday in 1987.  Looking up into the northeast sky, about 5 miles away and perhaps 5000 to 10000 feet above the ground, we noticed approximately a dozen objects slowly moving south.  They had a metallic shimmer in the sunlight and made no noise.  The objects &quot;faded in and out&quot; in unison as they flew across the sky in what appeared to be a square or diamond formation (from our perspective).  We were able to observe this phenomenon for about 10 minutes (our lunch period had ended), durning which this formation of objects moved from the northern sky to the sky just south of us.", "Small disk flyes over school in Apalachin, NYA disk shaped saucer flew over the Apalachin Elementary School very slowly at an extremaly high altitude. I think it may be a secret government program to manufacture flying sausers since Lockheed Martin makes secret things for the government like the Apache heliocopter and integrated GPS for cruise missles has a major plant about 5 miles west of here and very often tests its planes over Apalachin. The disk was mostly white and had some black on the bottom. The disk came out of the west (maybe from Lockheed, which is to the west), and flew extremaly slowly to the northeast. There were no clouds that day in the early spring, so it could not be a cloud. During this sighting, I felt notably warmer and some snow melted. It left no trails and made no sound. I do not think there were any people near", "Stationary object over downtown Portland Oregon, white in color shaped like 3-pointed star or &quot;Y&quot;.At 05:50 on August 17, 1999, I was standing on a sidewalk across the street from the baseball stadium in downtown Portland Oregon, waiting for a bus.  I looked up at a twin-engine Cessna climbing out southward (roughly 1500 feet as it passed overhead) and noticed a small speck apparantly far above it.  At first I thought this was sunlight reflecting off a high-altitude jet.  (While it was quite light enough to read, the sun was not yet actually over the horizon, so it would reflect from a high-altitude object even though we were in shadow.) I watched to see whether this &quot;jet&quot; was going south or north.  (Almost all high altitude air traffic here is to San Francisco or Seattle.) It did neither, but rather stayed in one place.  After a couple of minutes of this, I checked to see if the scattered cirrus clouds were moving. They were drifting slowly westward.  At the surface, we had a breeze moving from north to south.  In either case the object should have drifted (if loose), but did not. I looked carefully to see if I could detect any bobbing or any air patterns that might indicate this was something much smaller and closer, such as a tethered balloon, but another airplane went by climbing out, and passed between me and the object, so I concluded that it was likely higher than the plane.  Also, I saw no bobbing movements or shadows anywhere indicating a tether.  (They might exist, but I did not see any.) After a few minutes, the angle with the sun had changed enough that I did not get a specular reflection, but a diffuse one.  The object appeared to be white, and shaped like a &quot;Y&quot;.  On the other hand, it was extremely small and so I can&apos;t guarantee that I wasn&apos;t seeing glare or artifacts from my eyeglasses. About this time the thing seemed to rotate a little bit, then move a few feet, and then hover again, as though it were under control and &quot;keeping station.&quot;  It repeated this behavior occassionally until I lost sight of it. The object continued to stay in place, with no noticable changes, until my bus came at 06:05, when I lost sight of if.  At this point, other boarding passengers asked what I was looking at, and so I pointed it out.  Two saw it right away, both shrugged.  At about 06:15 I tried to find it again after I got off the bus in Northwest Portland, but was unsuccessful. ====== end of report I have the feeling that this was some kind of recon aircraft, but it&apos;s the frist sighting I&apos;ve had I can&apos;t actually explain away.  I&apos;m a licensed pilot, have a degree in physics, have done professional photojournalism, and now write software.  Even if I&apos;d had a camera, there wasn&apos;t much to take a picture of without a very long lens. The phone number is at home.  If you call, please do so in the evening, when I&apos;m likely to be home.(not that this sighting needs much work ...)", "While enjoying my am coffee and waiting for the sunrise, I was looking toward the southwest, when suddenly near one last remaining star there was a burst of flashes.The star was one of the sparklers, red green blue type in the southwestern sky. The first flash looked like it came right out of the star, then another flash a little further away and again another flash further, total of 5 or 6 flashes, then moved westerly with a few more flashes.  All of the flashes were extremely brilliant.  I watch the sky a lot, have seen something smillier a few years ago, but not as brilliant.", "My friend and me were coming down the mountain into the valley when I spotted it in the clouds just sitting there as clouds went by it.  I could see it through my binoculars, as well as with the naked eye.  The camera was in the trunk, so I told my friend as soon as we get down to the valley..stop so I can get the camera out.  It took us about 25 minutes to get to where we could pull over.  When we did I got some video of it.  And then we were chasing it, but it was overcast and we lost it in some clouds.On Sat. July, 1999, me and a friend went from Colorado Springs to a barbecue in Cuchara, CO.  And from there we were going to Alamosa to stay the night, because I had seen an episode of &quot;Sightings&quot;, and they talked about that area having had alot of sightings and weird things in the sky.  So we went to the barbecue, and left for Alamosa around 7 PM. We were in the mountains on highway 160 east, just heading down to go into the valley.  I was looking with my binoculars off and on seeing planes, high flying birds, when something caught my eye about 7:50 PM. It looked like a plane with no wings or tail, just the body. And it was just sitting there!  Clouds were going by, but it just stayed.  It was white, but reflecting the suns rays.  When a cloud would block the sun from it, it would get darker in color.  The camera I had brought was in the trunk and there was no place to stop.  So I told my friend, as soon as we get into the valley lets stop and see if we can get it on video. So, about 25 minutes later we got to flat land.  By now it had gotten ahead of us by about 50 miles or so.  When we had first saw it, it was almost right above us in the car. We stopped and I took some video of it.  There were no stars in the sky, and it was now 8:20 PM.  It was going, it seemed, east to west.  Because that is the way we were traveling.  Unfortunately, after I first filmed it, and by the time we got to Alamosa it had gone behind some dark clouds.  But that is not all.  The next day, we drove up highway 17 north to Salida, to a place called &quot;E.T.&apos;s Landing&quot;. My brother had told me about it, and he said that the owner, back in 95, had video taped two seperate encouters.  So I thought it would be fun to go have lunch at the resteraunt.  When we got there they were just opening up, and I asked the waitress kiddingly, &quot;have you had any sightings lately?&quot;, and she surprisingly said,&quot;well by the way, the owner said he had got some calls last night and that the &quot;saucer&quot; is flying again, around Alamosa.&quot; What a weekend! I listen to Art Bell alot, and I have heard Peter on the show many times.  I never thought I would be giving an experience in a report.  But I am glad to have a forum such as this to do so.  Thankyou", "Glowing sphere, DEFINATELY not a plane or helicopter.My husband, ((name deleted)), our 3 year old son and I were driving home from being at our in-laws.  We had just come from getting a soda at 7-11 on the corner of Queen and Geary in Albany.  We turned left down Pacific Blvd., the main drag in town.  We were in the middle lane in front of ((business name deleted))Motors when I spotted a large glowing sphere.  I kept staring at it, all most coming to a complete stop in the middle of the road.  I asked my husband if he saw the same thing I did.  He said &quot;Holy ((dleleted))!  What is that?&quot;  I all most hit another car driving beside me.  They saw me staring at the sky and they looked up at it.  They all most went off the road staring at it too.  We took the next immediate left, which is between a B.P. gas station and an Arco gas station.  We got to the stop sign and sat there for about two minutes watching it trying to decide which direction it was going because we wanted to follow it.  It stopped and hovered for about one minute.  Then it approached us.  So we decided to drive forward to get underneath it.  We cut straight across Santiam Hwy. through an apartment complex.  We then turned left again onto Hill St. heading south, never losing sight of the object.  I flashed my highbeams at it at the encouragement of my husband.  My son was in the back seat saying, &quot;Mommy!  Daddy!  Do you see that!&quot;  As we followed it, we saw a plane flying up quickly from the north heading south towards the obeject that was still just hovering above us.  It quickly darted south and when the plane got to where the sphere appeared to be hovering, it vanished.  It was all most as if it shut the light out.  We sat at the stop light on the corner of Hill St. and Queen Ave. looking at each other.  My mouth was hanging open and I finally asked my husband, &quot;Did we just see what I think we saw?&quot;  He smiled and replied &quot;I think we just saw a definate U.F.O.&quot;  There is no other way to describe it because it was unidentified and it was flying.  The sphere was a glowing orange-amber color.  Sort of like warm candle ligh! t.  We were amazed at the speed it appeared to have.  It was very quick.  It was quiet as well.  No noise.  I think about it now and it&apos;s giving me goose bumps.  I felt compelled to follow the thing.  The feeling was so overwhelming.  My husband was the same way.  I just wanted to get closer to it for some reason.", "Black triangular craft vibrates me out of sleep, blocks out sky. Verified next day by independant witness.Heard you want past reports, so here you go. Before I&apos;d ever heard of Art Bell or triangular craft, I had an experience that shook me - literally. I was deep asleep one night when something stirred me. In that dreamy consciousness you get I remember feeling like I was vibrating. I thought I heard a noise and remember thinking, &quot;What is a jumbo jet doing flying over Ocean Shores?&quot; The noise got louder over several minutes until I thought to myself &quot;this thing is going to crash right on the beach.&quot; I sat up, fully awake. The noise was gone and I realized I hadn&apos;t actually heard it audibly, that it was more like a sub-sonic vibration. I ran outside and looked up into the sky and saw a formation of seven red lights overhead. At first I thought it was a very slow moving formation of helicopters. But then I back and got my glasses. When I returned I could see that it was instead a single, triangular shape. I could judge this because the it was a partially overcast night and I could see the orange glow of the town&apos;s streetlights (about half-mile away) everywhere except between the small red lights. I stood stunned as the craft passed overhead slowly, moving from south to north along the coastline. I estimate it was only a couple of hundred feet above and travelling about 10 mph.

Later that afternoon I was in one of the local shops talking to the owner when a friend of her&apos;s came in and said he had seen something exciting. I had never met this man before, or told anyone about my experience, but he went on to describe what he called &quot;the mother ship&quot; exactly as I had seen it. He added that this was not the first time he had seen craft of this type in the North Beach area. When I asked, the man said that his sighting had been in the Copalis Beach area, about 10 miles north of Ocean Shores.((NUFORC Note:  The diagram, embedded in the text, did not survive the transfer from our e-mail program to our database.

The object flew (or floated?) at an apparently inexplicable speed, heading roughly NE. The object seemed to be composed of two parts arranged in unchanging formation.I am a college student at home in the Upper Penninsula for the summer. I am a painter, and drove to the remotely located Crisp Point Lighthouse on Lake Superior to paint a picture of the adandoned lighthouse still standing there. I stood my easel up on the beach and had been painting for roughly 45 minutes when an object on the horizon of Lake Superior caught my eye. Visibility was perfect that day, and the sky at that time was cloudless. A small shape was closely followed by another small shape on the very edge of the sky, slightly above a thin layer of reflecting air atop the water, but I do not remember if I could see the shapes reflecting on the water. The shapes, if I were made to guess, were rectangular, but I am not certain what their shape was so perhaps this is an association of my own with the Great Lakes freighters commonly seen on the horizons of lakes: the cabins atop the hulls of which are angular in form. The object (I will assume it to be one object, for the two shapes moved in connection), however, moved at a rate of impossible speed for any sea-going craft, given its distance from me at the time. I watched it soundlessly cross nearly a third of the 180 degree horizon in about ten seconds, then I looked down for a reason I do not remember, either to look for my camera or pick up a dropped brush. When I looked up, the object&apos;s path had taken it behind the remains of a defunct pier jutting out from Crisp Point which obscures the horizon. I assume it vanished over the horizon behind the pier, for it did not emerge from behind it. The object followed a roughly north easterly course from where I first noticed it to the NNW, travelling consistently at the same rapid speed. The largest visibility possible across water on a clear day is twelve miles, so I assume it to have been at that distance. Though it is possible that two large supersonic jets, perhaps bombers, somehow flying in close formation at an altitude lower than about 500 feet above the water could explain the sighting, the sighting still remains mysterious to me, given how unlikely it is that two such jets would be following this course towards the elevated shoreline hills of Pancake Bay and batchawana Provincial Parks in Ontario (hills visible to the ENE of Crisp Point, and furthermore that the speed of the object seemed greater than any plane I have ever seen at that distance. The object moved far faster than a jumbo jet cruising overhead (which would be cruising at six or seven miles away), and either of its two portions were at least as large as a jumbo jet appears at that lesser distance. I have spent a lot of time on the Great Lakes and never seen anything similar, so I thought I would report it, especially as I expect it would have been visible from the region of Ontario around Pancake Bay, east of Crisp Point and Whitefish Point in Michigan. Perhaps the Canadian Navy is secretly testing a new supersonic freighter that will put American shipping to shame?!", "A red light (not blinking, a saucer-like object, flying toward the fireworks of the 4th of July (infact we thought at first it was a firework), at very high speed, spinning with an angle and covering a very long distance; then changing suddenly direction and finally disappearing.", "Luminous orange craft moving steadily, west to east, before vanishingWe were camping in Snake Creek Valley, which is a backcountry area of Great Basin National Park. The sky was perfectly clear, and the sun had recently set, so I believe it was around 9 pm. Earlier in the day, we&apos;d travelled northward on US93 from the Valley of Fire, to the east of the test site, and on three occasions, we&apos;d seen odd silver disks (one disk on each occasion) which appeared and disappeared (in fact, the sun was shining brightly and it was hard to follow them because they kept disappearing). We&apos;d assumed that they were something out of the test site and in the campsite, we were joking about them when my friend looked up and called my attention to an oval-shaped orange light which  moved silently across the sky from east to west at a steady speed, about twice as fast as a 747 would have appeared to move if it were flying at 35,000 feet; it also appeared to be at least four times larger than a 747 would have appeared at that altitude. The orange light was steady and not brilliant - much duller than a shooting star or a plane. After we watched it for about five seconds, it utterly vanished. It may be significant to note that we were about 17 miles southwest of the tiny town of Baker, but to the west, there were no towns at all before Ely, about 56 miles away.", "Ball of light that remains Stationary, but changes color constantlyI had been talking to my father in law about UFO&apos;s andSightings in the area, and he told me of an object that hovers around the tree line behind his house.

Upon lookin up at the jet, a 747 I think, I saw two black circles on both sides of the plane, looked like they were flying along side it. The jet was white. Then I saw them move around the plane in very fluid motion. I called for my other son who&apos;s 13 to come outside and witness this. The black circles were then back at the sides of the aircraft. Then one went around the nose of the plane, then the other around the black, then back to the sides again. When these circles or spheres were on the side, they were below the wings, looking almost like they were attached to the tip of the wings on the undersides. They continued moving around the plane, then going back to the sides untill the plane was out of view. My son saw a blue marking on the tail of the plane. I didn&apos;t notice much about the plane because I was looking at the black balls. Less than a minute later a very fast small jet followed the flight path of the plane.

They have copies of the report on file.", "On the evening of 6/13/99 my 14 year old son and I were fishing on the dock of my fathers house which is located on Lake-of-the-Hills in Weidman Michigan. In the southern sky I saw what appeared to be a shooting star. I said &quot;look&quot; to my son. He looked and saw what I did. The star-like object then completely reversed course and went back the same way it came at an amazing speed. It then began to make manuevers that could not have been accomplished by any known craft which was man-made. It did circles and sudden starts and stops at sharp but regular angles. This was all done at a speed which was unbelievable. It then sped away a long distance until no longer visible. My son was frightened and went inside. I am now a believer. I tried to explain it to myself but I know what I saw. It was not a spotlight,plane,lightning bug,falling star etc. If the object was man-made then we have learned to defy all laws of physics and have secret aircraft. This object was real,was under control, but performed manuevers normally thought impossible.", "object viewed due North.  Low on horizon.  Hovered and stationary.

It then met up with a much larger, wing-shaped object of several lights. Together, they sped at hyper speed to the east, disappearing.Red lights on small object and white lights on large. It was dark, so no real outline of a hull could be seen. The observers were just a family of 4 traveling home. 2 adults, 2 kids. None of us has ever forgotten what we saw.

IT was verry large. IT moved at a rappid speed right&amp;left. Then dissapered in the center of rotating diamond with sequinse red, yellow ,&amp; green lights. This happend above the Marianna mountain chain in the southern Mojave dessert. The verry next day I was watching SIGHTINGS and seen a report of the same exact UFO that I saw, ECEPT this sighting was in England!At first it stood still in the sky,sorta hovering there. It then shoot to the right &amp; back to the left at rappid speeds, it did this for about ten minutes. In the upper right hand of the sky there was this diamond shape of lights red, yellow, and green going around the diamond in seqeunce (rotating) the orange globe then disapered into the center of the diamond. This seems very short,it took about ten minutes for the whole thing to happen. It left me trembling, &amp; my freind crying.

Was walking home around dusk and saw a bright light come quickly from the west and then stop. No sound. Object was Trianglar on the bottom with a beaker shape on the top. Object was initially very bright but after stopping began to dim an move slowly. At the time the object first appeared, another person driving on the road saw the object and stopped next to me. I ran home and got a pair of binoculars and continued to observe the object for approx 45 minutes until the object simply winked out.This was observed in either the fall of 1974 or 1975. I was in high school at the time and did not yet have my drivers license. It was in the evening around dusk, probably around 17:30. I was walking home in a residential area on a clear evening just after the sun had set. It was still relatively light and the object appeared moving west to east very rapidly and stopped just overhead. The object was initially a bright white ball of light which I had to shield my eyes from. It came in so quickly and was so bright that it seemed to streak in like you would expect a meteor to do. At the same time a car was coming down the street toward me. Upon noticing the same object, the man inside slammed on the breaks and jumped out of the car asking &quot;what the hell is that&quot;. We watched the object for several minutes. It was 200 to 300 feet in the air and made no sound. The obect began moving very slowly and the light eminating from it began to steadily dim. I observed a triangular outline on the bottom and a short beaker like area sitting on top of the triangle. The light eminating from the object was still rather bright so it was difficult to see more. After observing the object for a few minutes I quickly ran home and got a pair of binoculars. The object was out of my site for perhaps 90 seconds while I was in the house. My mother followed me out to our back yard to continue observing the object. The object continued heading east and continued to get dimmer. We watched the object for approx. 30-40 minutes. At this time it was completely dark out and there were many stars. My mother and I then heard jet engines and noticed three lights approaching the object from three different directions. The object, that now appeared about the size of a star, suddenly shot up as the aircraft approached, stopped and then winked out. I did not know the man that stopped on the street to observe the object with me and I never saw him again. My mother was a house wife with a high school education who was very interested in UFO&apos;s but had never seen one before. We did not report it. I am an engineer and have been very interested in the UFO phenomenon since that time. I have seen several things, since then, that I can&apos;t explain. That sighting, however, was the only sighting that was clearly something I could not attribute to something known and I still often wonder just what it was. I don&apos;t beleive this sighting was reported by anyone else at the time.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.  PD))", "While driving on I-55 near Livingston, Il saw bright light in sky, much larger than the starsDriving northbound on I-55 in IL on 07/13/99 at 0415 and saw bright white light in the sky tht was much larger than the other stars.  At first I thougt it was a planet, but it became much larger.  As I continued north, it got larger and seemed to be very high up in the sky.  It appeared to have 8 to 10 smaller white objects flitting around it.  The main object was spherical in shape with the smaller objects also being round.

The object was shiney on the upper section and rather darker on the under side due to being shaded from the sun, however arrayed around both upper and lower sections were dark panels, those panels on the shaded underside were more pronouced then those on the more shiney upper section. The object never moved during this whole duration then suddenly shot in a northerly direction with a speed that was astonishing... being stunned at this tremendous acceleration I yelled at my cousin &quot; ..did you see that !!...&quot;  he said yes it disappeared,I said &quot; no it didnt it shot to the north like a bullet &quot; this object never made a sound, and no shock wave was heard. My cousin wore glasses and I don&apos;t know if contributed to his failure to not see the sudden acceleration of this object .......in later years when I began to look into this phenomena I looked over this area on maps and noted there was a Naval Air Station very near the area of this sighting. I have refrained from reporting this sighting due in part to the unfortunate witnessing of other objects dureing other times in my life, realizing that the chance of seeing one ufo is remote, but to have other sightings years apart is even more remote, how ever I will submite these other reports also so that perhaps others whom might have witnessed the same object during those time frames might have some comfort knowing they were not alone, and I would gladly take a polygraph in all reports that I have submited.......", "I was eleven years of age at the time spending a year with my father. The whole family was home when I was upstairs on the terrace with my telescope over looking the Andean moutains I saw lights in the distance and decided to see if I could track the objects the strange appearance of rotating colors from the diamond shaped objects had me mesmerized. My father and brother said not to bother any urther yet I could not stop looking till they floated over the high horizon of the moutain range. To this day I have wondered if the family had been visited by aliens. The fact that we lived at an isolated area away from the city and neighbors. I have repeatedly asked my family about the incident. They admit to the strange occurence being a weather ballon or discounting the whole event all together.", "Oval/egg shaped object, white translucent color observed appearing to hover/vibrate moving slightly to the West.  Turned away, looked again-object was gone.  Then appeared again moving East at high rate.I was getting into my car when I heard the sound of a low flying airplane. I looked up to see a single engine plane trailing a banner.  This plane was traveling out of the South to the North, and traveled directly over my head.  I looked away from the plane, unlocked by car, and then looked back up to the plane which was now turning West.  I also noticed another plane flying at an altitude higher than the first and traveling out of the Nortwest traveling Southeast, their paths intersecting momentarily.  At this time I noticed the object at an altitude between the two planes, at an approx. 30 degree angle behind the first plane and almost directly below the second.  I looked back toward the first plane which was now traveling directly West to try and read the banner it was trailing.  Thinking when I first noticed the object it was a reflection, I looked back toward it, the second plane having now traveled out of view.  The object was still in the same spot that I first noticed it or very close to it, and it appeared to be hovering but moving slightly to the West.  I looked away again, trying to process what I was seeing, and then again looked up.  The object was gone from the spot I had last seen it.  I gazed the skies to the West and as I was turning my gaze to the East, the object appeared coming out of the West going directly East, moving at a very high rate of speed and out of my view.  This object while traveling at such a rate of speed made no sound and produced no contrails. I know of no conventional aircraft capable of such speed and able to move off its original spot in one direction, then change direction, and then accelerate to the speed at which I saw it traveling, in the time that it took for this object to do so, and in the small area of space/sky I was able to see.

I ran out to confirm the sighting &amp; the absence of any sound. I then quickly returned to the cottage to get my SVHS camcorder in order to videotape the sighting.

It had no features such as wings or tail structures and had a shiny metallic appearance.   It was traveling much slower than the similar object that we observed on May 30, 1999.  It was traveling to the east when we first noticed it, but it then started to make a slow right hand turn.  As it turned, it passed through the angle at which it reflected the suns rays towards us.  For a short time a row of at least 20 individual bright lights appeared on the side.  These lights may have been the reflection of the sun from a row of windows on the side of the craft.  As it turned southward along route 26, it climbed in altitude and then suddenly disappeared at an extreme rate of speed.  No sound or vapor trail was apparent.  The sky was perfectly clear.

I saw them to the west flying in formation like geese fly. They were about 100 ft. above the ground flying at about 10 to25 mph. I was very excited and started yelling for my mother and brothers. 2 of my brothers and mom came outside as we saw them move to the south. They were triangler shaped with rounded edges, grey in color, and seemed to be about 30 ft. or so. They proceeded towards the reservation slowly until they came to a small mountain where the reservation hospital is located. Behind the mountain is the Santa Cruz River which is dry most of the year. This is about 3 mi. from our home. They then stopped and hovered for a bit, then dissapered behind the mountain into I belive the Santa Cruz.

The screen tower is situated so that you have to face west to see the screen.  While watching the second feature, American Pie, I saw a light about as bright a venus had been a few days ago (brighter than any star and brighter than other passing aircraft - Albany Airport and Schenectady Airport are both nearby)  I had seen several aircraft earlier that night on approach to both airports. This object moved faster than any plane I have ever seen.  I first thought I was seeing a shooting star, but then noticed something very odd.  The object came from my left (south) and headed to my right (north).  It was at about the same altitude as the other aircraft had been (1000 ft aprx). The object appeared to be going in a straight line with a slight arc as it crossed from the south to the north. I thought for sure that it was a shooting star because it was moving at incredible speed, but then as it reached the half way point it looked like a slinky would look if you stretched it out.  The light became elongated, the compressed to a sigle dot, stopping for a split second, then speeding off again elongating itself once more. I don&apos;t know how else to describe what I saw.  I have seen UFO story&apos;s on TV and in some of the footage I have seen exactly what this object did.  I have seen shooting stars and red glowing meteroites and I am sure this was not a meteor or shooting star. The fact that this object went from a single dot to an elongatted shape back to a single dot to an elongated shape again was incredible to see. I had been hearing that Saratoga County had an increase in UFO sightings, but until now I did not take any of it seriously.

I was traveling south torwards Salem N.H. along a dark, although fairly well populated road when I noticed how pretty the sky was that night. Suddenly I noticed an odd light in the sky. At first I just thought it was a plane from a nearby airport. The light however,  appeared to be about the size of 6 or 7 airplanes and I could not make out any shape except for the hazy green light. I slowed down, turned my lights off and drove to the side of the road to get a better look. As I pulled of, the object shot off towards what appeared to be away from earth. The car behind me also stopped and a man and a women, about the age of thirty came out and asked me if I had too, just seen what they had. They had actually been traveling on a different road and had seen the light and decided to follow it.

Ilistened to the radio, but no one reported it, surprisingly. My friend said she saw the same event twice in the sameplace in quick succession, I only caughtthe last event. The streak came from nowhere and an object appeared, also green and then faded, (not reducing in size apparently) distance could have been in orbit or very high up. I have previously (in the last few months at different times, again travelling on HW680) twice seen bright blue balls of light descending at night towards Moffet Field direction-don&apos;t know if that is something they were doing (Nasa Aimes is there too) I have often seen shooting starts (meteors) but nothing even remotely like this.

I noticed a green (bright light color)streak, but instead of the streak disappearing into nothing it became more intese and bigger resulting in some kind of object. The object was green for 2-3 seconds and totally vanished. My friend said she saw exactly the same thing, only it had repeated twice. I only saw it the once. I have seen glowing blue balls before descending quickly in the Moffett Field/Nasa Aimes direction. his happened several months ago, I did not report it then. I am now very convinced that soemthing is going on. Note the object got bigger after a trail, not the reverse which would suggest a meteor perhaps.

I could make out two rows of lights on the bottom of the wings (eight lights each row) white light almost recessed into the wings.  The object made very little noise it was not engine noise neither was their any vapor tail.  Across the road (Rte 7) was the north end of Moody AFB, and F4 (D) Phantom jets were making their approach to the flight line, this object headed directly towards those landing F4&apos;s.

Not pointed on the ends but rounded.", "Lenticular object hovering over bayI saw an object last Saturday 1999 June 26, out over the bay, between the San Mateo bridge and San Francisco. The object was flattened football (lenticular) shaped and white with a slight amount of shadowing underneath it. It was hovering at an angle of  about 15 degrees from the horizontal (ie: horizon) but there were no lights visible. I don&apos;t know the height exactly, except that it was low enough so that the object from my vantage point looked to be lower than the tops of the buildings in the San Francisco skyline. The sighting took place in the early afternoon, approx. 12:30pm to 1:00pm. The day was mainly sunny but with some smog &quot;fuzzing-out&quot; San Francisco city from my vantage point, but with the buildings / skyline still visible. At first I though it was a dirigible / blimp but it was symmetrical and had no lights / signage on it. Moreover, as I continued to watch it all the way across the bridge, it did not move from its position. At about the half-way point across the bridge, as I observed the object, it did a rather amazing fade-out and became completely invisible. This was not due to cloud shade or the object changing its orientation since the geometry of the object remained exactly as before while doing the fade-out. Immediately after it disappeared, I looked in the sky around the area it had been and at that moment I noticed a commercial airliner flying overhead into the area that the object had just been. As soon as the airliner had traveled a bit out of the area where the object had been, the object did the exact opposite from before and did a fade-in and was exactly as it had been before. The fade-out / fade-in took about the same amount of time, of about 2 to 3 seconds I&apos;d estimate.", "10:30 pm.  stepped  out  side for  a  break  from  work,  saw two orange lights  in the night sky. first thought  was  they  were just aircraft, howevery there were no strobe lights,  they  were heading east to west. followed by two  others after the first two disappeared into the west.  there were  aircraft on  approch to  s.l.c   international airport at  the timethe objects  were  a hazy  orange  color  and disk  shape,  size  was about one fourth the moon,  there were alot of  aircraft flying  at the time also,   hight  was  about the same as the aircraft flying in the area at  the time or appeared", "It was saucer shaped, a dome with a ring around it which rotated, windows in the dome, white like bright light, flying low.I was extemely busy during the time the Hail Bob comet was visible. I didn&apos;t watch tv, listen the radio, or talk to anyone about anything except law and polotics. It had been visible for about a week or two when a friend had called me one evening. He asked what I thought about the awsome Hail Bob comet. I asked what he was referring to so he insisted that I walk outdoors and look. First, I went in the back of my apartment and looked into the feild. I told my friend that I couldn&apos;t see anything which looked like what he had discribed. Then, he said to go look on the other side of the building. I saw the Hail Bob and wondered How I could overlook it for so many days while I was coming and going from my home. I went back into my apartment and decided to step out my back door again and take one last look at the stars before shuting the door. When I looked up I saw a white saucer shaped object with a dome which had windows, and the ring around it was rotating. It was lit up like an extremely bright flourecent light. It was flying low in the feild and went up into the clouds. It blended right in with them. It moved swift as it went up and then forward. It was coming away from the direction of the Hail Bob comet. As this was happening, I asked my friend if he saw what I was seeing. He said yes, and we discussed it. It looked smaller to him because he was talking to me from Porter. After this event, I told my neighbor about seeing a U.F.O. and before I could discribe it she interupted. She said that she saw these all of the time from her apartment and they were white and lit up. It was a blinding light which made it look as though there was an aura around it. I was amazed because I hadn&apos;t seen one before and she lived in the same complex as I do. I hadn&apos;t discribed it to her and yet her discription matched mine.

The light was very bright, more than that of the moon through the clouds.  My first thought is that is was an airplane with landing lights passing through the clouds, but it was a crisp light-blue color... and there was no sounds since it seemed very near, maybe 200 feet away.

The &quot;meeting&quot; was a religious gathering, may have been more than 12.

Died while returning to Missouri from a trip toNorth Carolina, 13 October, 1860, near Irving College, Tenn.He was a farmer in Webster County, MO, as well as a circuit riding preacher; butthe purpose of this trip to NC was to visit his wife&apos;s relatives (and possiblyhis own?).  He was age 45 when this letter was written.  He made the trip onhorseback, accompanied by a fellow Missourian &amp; circuit rider, Roby Goss.((NUFORC Note:  Please note that the letter dates from 1860, NOT 1960, as our computer indicates.  A photocopy was sent to us by the grandson, and reads exactly as indicated below. We believe that the incident is much more characteristic of a meteoritic event, than it is of a UFO sighting.  It is relatively rare that witnesses report sonic booms associated with UFO sightings.  It is interesting that the witnesses felt the heat from the object&apos;s incandescence, even though the source, apparently, was tens of miles from their location.   The fact that they heard two sonic booms suggests that the object may have exploded prior to reaching the earth, as many meteors do.Our thanks to the person to forwarded the information to NUFORC, and well as to his great grandfather, who so thoughtfully preserved the event for future generations.

I have not received anyintelligence from home, only one letter as yet that I received about 15 daysback. I am very anxious to hear from you all at this time. The friends are wellas far as I know.  There is some cases of sickness in this country now.  Such asflus [flu] and fever. As to the health here I don&apos;t consider it any better thanMissouri.  My health has not been very good since I have been here although Ihave not been confined but a few days.  I feel thankful to the great head of thechurch that it is as well with me as what it is.I have just passed through a very interesting meeting on Lufty which commencedon last Friday and closed on last night with a general stir.  There was only 2or 3 conversions during the meeting.  The whole neighborhood pretty much belongsto the church and they seem to get along in harmony.  I have enjoyed my selftolerable well with the brethren here.There is a meeting commences tomorrow at Shoal Creek which I expect to attendand from there to Savanna and then to Locus Oldfields  [don&apos;t know if this is aplace or a name]  which commences on Friday before the third Lords day inAugust, then I expect to start for home as soon as possible.  My mind is on homeand on my family all the time and my prayers is for the welfare of you all.  Ihope the Lord will permit us all to meet again and enjoy each others company andaccording to my feelings now.  I don&apos;t think I shall ever take as long a trip asthis from my family while I am permitted to live.  I hope you will all rememberthat we are only probationers here and prepare for another mode of existencewhich is eternal.  As for riches in this life it is vanity.  I have tried thethings of this world in different ways and have proved them to be vanity andvexation of spirit.  By the grace of God I am determined to serve the Lord whileI live; and now my children, companion &amp; friends, if I never see you in thislife, take my advice:  if you have set your hearts on any known sin, forsake itimmediately and seek forgiveness with a firm resolution to serve the Lord whileyou live, and the Lord will answer your petitions in mercy.I could write many things on the subject of religion but I hope these fewremarks will suffice at present and that you will bear them in mind and makethat necessary preparation that if we should never meet in this life that by thegrace of God we may all meet in heaven where parting is no more.Last evening about 11 o&apos;clock there was a curious circumstance took place as Iwas returning from evening meeting.

It was low.The bottom was in the tree tops. It seemed to glow from within. There was a black sort of platform in the sky at the bottom. It was the size of a round water tower&apos;s bowl. It seemed to glide in a very controlled maner as if on a magnetic field. It did not float nor look like a ballon. It was moving rather slow maybe 35 mph. It descended into the trees and went out of sight and seemed to be landing back in the trees about a half a mile away.I was driving to work at about 06:50 when I suddenly realized there was a florescent orange sphere low in the sky just ahead to the right. It seemed to glow from within. It made no sound. It was the size of a round water tower&apos;s bowl. At the bottom of the sphere was what looked like a black sort of platform. (Shape wise it looked like a basketball sitting ontop of a cassette box) Except the sphere was perfectly round and had sort of a mesmerizing presence to it,an aura . It sat directly on top of the rectangular shaped black object at the bottom, no straps or anything visible holding it down or attaching it. The black part was obscured by the tree tops. I was trying to make it out, although it was hard to see the black part, it seemed to have some part of it folded up under it at the bottom like legs or something. As I was traveling about 50 mph heading west it was moving north west out over the trees and slightly slower about 35mph. I was gaining on it. When I came to a stop light the car behind me pulled up along side me to turn right. The driver gave me a look like, you see that? And nodded towards it, just before he made his turn. The light turned green and then I was trying to get as close as I could trying to see it better. I kept saying &quot;what is that&quot;. It continued out over the trees and it seemed to glide as if it were being controlled some how and like it was riding on a magnetic field. It did not float like a ballon or appear to be a balloon. The road I was on began to bare to the left and south. As it did I was looking back over my right shoulder as I watched it go down into the trees about a half a mile away until I could no longer see it.

When we saw it we all were astonished, then after the quick glance we realized it was an aircraft, it had a light on each side of the craft.  It looked to me like the star ship enterprise from star trek.  It was facing us in the sky headed our way, about 1 mile away in the sky (est.)  When the jets got real close to this craft, it disapeared out of thin air and the jets kept flying.  There were no clouds and the craft never made a noise, we listend later to every plane that was even in a further distance and we could here them, but never that craft.  The jets were loud at the time, but we don&apos;t how long that thing was there before we saw it.

I saw a white/grey sort of metalic color (but did not shine)large triangle object quickly floating across the sky from south to north.  It had no lights, but was clearly visible.  I don&apos;t believe it was more than half a mile from the ground. It made no sound and I don&apos;t think I was more than a quarter of mile from it.  I observed it for about 4-5 seconds until it was obscured by my neighbor&apos;s house.

The moon was somewhere between 3/4 and NEW.  This is not unusual because we have quite allot of air traffic in our area.  I watched as this object approached my home from a south western area to the north east.  It flew directly over my home.  I am not allowed to smoke in the house so all of this ocurred while I was out back smoking.  I always try to listen to the engine of the aircraft that fly over at night, because I try to determine if it was comercial, military, private,  etc...  All I can see in the night sky is lights anyway.  What was strange about this object at first was the way it seemed so smooth as it flew accross the sky.  I then noticed that it was a group or cluster of smaller lights that seemed to be attached somewhere together (almost by a string) in the center.  The lights seemed to move away from the center and back towards the center in no specific order or fashion.  Almost as if they were blowing around in the wind.  The second thing I noticed that I wasn&apos;t hearing any noise or sound comming from the object.  Since trying to hear for the sound, of the engines, of the aircraft that fly over or around our home is kinda of a &quot;thing to do while smoking&quot;, I tried as hard as I could to hear some kind of noise from this aircraft.  When I realized that what I was seeing and NOT hearing was not something normal, I kinda went into a fixation on this craft as it dissapeared over the roof of my home.  It really FREAKED ME OUT!!  The entire event lasted about 15 to maybe 20 seconds.  After I realized how strange this thing was I just stood there and tried to take all of it in.  The lights were red and white.  Not bright white but more of an off white.  These were not the lights o any airplane either.  These lights changed the entire shape of the object as they moved all around.  Not a hurky jerky motion but a very fluid like random order.  I don&apos;t know what this was, but !

It approximate location at this time was over the Ohio River on the same trajectory. It disappeared again but I dont know if it blinked out or moved away rapidly as my attention was diverted for a few seconds to oncoming traffic and a line of trees obscured my vision.

I then observed a blinking red light traveling across the sky from west to east. I assumed it was a plane but soon realized that it was moving much too fast. The object only blinked two or three times (perhaps once per second) and was gone.  I could clearly make out the speed and trajectory as extremely fast and straight line.  I would guess the elevation to be 5-10K and there was no sound at all. I had apro 90 deg view of sky with trees on both horizons.  The entire sighting lasted maybe two or three seconds.  It was particularly interesting given the two objects in the sky at the same time.  My wife ask me if could have been a satelite and I only had to point to the one going over and compare.

Watched it with binoculars from Hwy 82.On May 18th, 1999. midafternoon, my husband and I were driving west on Hwy 82 about 5 or 6 miles northwest of Tombstone AZ when my husband spotted something strange in the sky to the south of us.  We pulled off the road and watched it through binoculars for approx. 20 minutes.  It is difficult to say how far away it was from us but we could see it quite clearly with the binoculars.  It was approx. 1500 above the ground and it was hovering (horizontally).  It moved rotationally but not laterally. It was egg shaped and white, shiny, almost translucent.  It had no seams and no openings of any kind (no doors or windows). There were four sleek &quot;fins&quot; at one end, which could be legs if the egg were sitting on the ground.  We tried to rationalize what it could be and consequently did not take a picture.  (I did make a sketch of it but unfortunately threw it out after arriving home.)  As we drove away the &quot;egg&quot; rose slowly and moved south. We forgot about this experience until last week when I took my Grandson to a book store and he picked up a book on UFOs.  Pictured in this book was almost the exact &quot;object&quot; we observed.  It had been spotted in New Mexico in 1964 and the four &quot;fins&quot; (legs?) were straighter and jointed. The &quot;egg&quot; also had seams. It looked like an oldfashioned version of what we saw. I thought this was too much of a coincidence and decided that we should report it.

We slowly approached the old Cherry St. bridge and I yelled,&quot;STOP!&quot; We stopped directly in the center of the bridge. Though it was a busy route, no other car was witness to this. I stuck my head out the window, looked directly up, and saw a flat, triangular form against the night sky. A triangle with one point missing. The craft was small, maybe 50ft across and absolutely silent. A red, green and blue light were diagonally across the underside. When I finally confirmed what I was looking at, I was terrified. I told my mother to hit the gas and we watched it behind us as we sped away. I was 14 at the time and though its been 15 years, this one is etched in my mind forever.", "My friend and I were driving home and we saw a light in the sky. At first I thought it was a plane or helicopter but noticed no same signature like blinking red lights that planes and helicopters use. So we watched it for a bit(not taking my eyes off the road for any long periods of time) and then it disappeared through a cloud bank. Then after we went over the Sepulvida Pass we saw it in the San Fernando Valley. Then again after a few minutes of observation the craft took off straight in the air (the weather was clear over the pass).My friend and I were returning home from dinner near Los Angeles International Airport and were driving on the San Diego Freeway ( the 405) when I noticed this strange light in the sky moving north my guess is near the Pacific Ocean.  It struck me as strange because planes and helicopters have a blinking red light and this object did not. So as we were driving north on the 405 we were watching the object disappear in a cloud bank(low clouds moved in as is usual June weather here) and then we just didn&apos;t think of it. We continued to drive and after we got over the Sepulvida Pass(a hill that seperates the San Fernando Valley from West Los Angeles) we saw the object again. (still continuing north in the San Fernando Valley) the as we went from the San Diego Freeway north to the Ventura Freeway east the object just took straight off in the sky. Needless to say my friend and I were pretty freaked seeing this and I wanted to report it to you as soon as I had a chance.

It passed in front of (underneath) a high white cloud and was clearly bright and visible even with the white cloud as background.  It passed into the cloud and was not visible for less than a minute, then came out of the cloud and continued.  About 7 minutes after I first started watching the light, it stopped in the sky, and stayed in the same spot for about 2 minutes.  While I was looking at it, it suddenly vanished - suddenly it just wasn&apos;t there any more.  I looked all over the area of the sky but couldn&apos;t see a trace of it.  Then I looked around to see if anyone else had seen it, but no one else was at the bus stop with me.At 4:30 p.m. on Thursday, 6/24/99 I was waiting for my bus at what is known as &quot;7 Corners&quot; on Washington Ave. in Minneapolis.  I was sitting on the bus stop bench on the south side of the street, facing north.  My bus wasn&apos;t due for about 15 minutes and I didn&apos;t have anything to read so I was just relaxing and looking around.  It was early rush hour and traffic was pretty heavy.  The sky was bright and blue with a few scattered high fluffy white clouds.  I was sitting in the shade and wearing sunglasses, so I was looking around very comfortably.  I was looking north (towards the Holiday Inn at 1500 Washington Ave.), and at 4:35 p.m. I was enjoying the lovely sky and watching a couple of high clouds when I noticed a light moving very slowly from west to east across the north sky.  It was very high up and I immediately thought &quot;oh, a satellite&quot; like I&apos;ve seen on clear nights away from the city.  It looked very much like a satellite, but a little bigger, like a small star - as bright, white, and clear as a star on a clear night.  Then I realized it was broad daylight, and I wondered if it&apos;s possible to see a satellite (so bright and clear!) in the daylight.  I watched it carefully, curious to make out what it was - but it was too far away - just a light like a moving star.  As I watched it I looked at with and without my sunglasses, and it was clearly visible both ways.  I&apos;d been watching it cross the sky slowly from west to east for about 2 or 3 minutes when it came to a cloud.  I expected to lose sight of it, but was surprised to be able to clearly see it with the cloud in the background.  Even though it was a white light on a white cloud, it was bright enough to see clearly.  Then it passed into the middle of the cloud and I lost sight of it for about 45 seconds.  It came out of the cloud again and I continued to watch it move slowly east.  Two or 3 minutes later it stopped.  I wondered if it was changing direction and kept watching closely, but it just stayed still for at least 2 minutes.  While it was ! just sitting there in the sky, a bus passed in front of me, blocking it from view.  I expected to lose sight of it, but after the bus passed by I could see the light clearly, still sitting in the same spot.  About 1 minute later it vanished.  I was looking at it, and then it was just not there anymore.  I looked all over to see where it had gone, but I couldn&apos;t see a trace of it. I looked around to see if anybody else had seen it, but there was no one else at the bus stop. My bus came and as I rode, I kept watching the north sky for a couple more minutes but couldn&apos;t see it anywhere.

My wife and I love to sit in our hot tub and watch the aircraft, shooting stars and satellites go by.  One night in early July we were watching some aircraft along the airway (providence to NY which runs northeast to southwest, slightly south of us)with all their lights on and strobes flashing.  We both noticed a light of normal brightness and size east of us (somewhere over Rhode Island)traveling across this path to the southeast.  This white light didn&apos;t have any nav or strobe lights around it.  It was traveling horizontally just above the horizon to our right and away from us in a slight climb when it became very bright for a couple of seconds and disappeared.  It was traveling about the same speed as the other aircraft 250mph+/- and way too slow to be a shooting star.  Definitely not fireworks either.  I know aircraft and this was not conventional behavior.  The brightness was like that of a typical white taillight and then a landing light being turned on and pointed exactly at you - very bright.  I&apos;m sure that is not what it was - no aircraft could turn around that fast point at us and still travel along its path backwards.  And when I say it disappeared, I mean nothing left of it.  Also, no sound.  We could hear the other aircraft that night.", "for about 30 seconds it brighted up to like Jupiter or Venus,it was moving towards the East, between 30-45 degrees angle,s.e. of CygnusI was stepping outside for some fresh air, I did look for Vega,Lyra,which was overhead,5 seconds later I was looking toward the East,about paripheral of my eye, was a object moving very very slowly (at great distance),just above the palm trees, I&apos;ve seen sallites move like in the evening just 30mins.,but that one very unusual!", "Three (3) large dimly lit fuzzy lights in an &quot;L&quot; shape formation at very high altitude.  Viewed during the Perseid meteor shower.While my 10 year old daughter and I were watching the Perseid Meteor Shower on the morning of August 12th, at 0330 hrs, she noticed 3 lights crossing the sky to the north of our location.  I did not see the lights at first, but as they crossed the center line of our view, I saw them.  They were very dimly lit and in a formation of the letter &quot;L&quot; (one light at each point). To describe the visibility and brightness of the light, picture in your mind a flood light seen in the distance on a foggy night.  They were only visible if I squinted. The sky was clear and the stars were brightly visible.  I could not see navigation lights or contrails.  They were fuzzy lights heading in an NW direction at a constant speed.  My daughter became scared and ask if the lights were flying saucers.  I told her they were planes.  I had no answer to give.

With field glasses a roundish shape could be made out for the front of the crafts.  It was hard to say how high they were but the sparce local clound cover was reported to be at 3,000 feet at the time and the object were well below that. These object passed over, one at a time a speed similar to a low fling light aircraft over a period of about 30 min. Two other things were noted durring this period. 1) the normaly busy air trafic in our skys was noexistant. 2) The object stopped going over at about the same time the full moon came up.

There are plenty of airports nearby and even a Naval Weapons testing facility, Point Mugu N.S., so we see a lot of airborne objects here, but I tell you that I&apos;ve never seen anything like this.

It turns out my friend saw it as well. We just had dinner a couple of hours ago (thursday night) and it turns out that he was still outside after I dropped him off, and he saw it too! We had commented on it, and noted how we had neither seen anything like it before. After listening to Peter on the Art Bell&apos;s show tonight, I had to take the time to contact you, and report that what had to be the same object described on the show, was visable from here on the head waters of the missouri river, between Butte and Bozeman, in south central Montana sunday night, by two more witnesses.

It became larger and flared,then back to former size. Disappeared behind clouds. then reduced to former size.My husband and I are clinical psychologists.  We were sitting on our second-floor deck watching the lightening from distant storms in the east.  We noticed that the sky was clear for the first time in a couple of weeks to the west and were looking at the stars. As we were looking at the big dipper, we noticed a star-like light which moved very fast across the night sky. We realized there were no flashing lights as a plane or helicopter would have. It was traveling northwest to southeast. As it approached our location just before it went directly overhead, it flared and appeared larger with almost a luminescent light purple or blue aura around it. It almost looked like a starburst (light eminating from it in beams) when it brightened,and within the light I could see a darker shape. It then diminished to former size as it continued toward the southeast. We grabbed our binoculars and watched it as it streaked across the sky. It was not reflecting light, it had its own bright, white light. It didn&apos;t have a tail. It was definitely brighter than the stars it passed and seemed to be quite high. We followed it until it went behind clouds and disappeared.  After it disappeared from view, we noticed a plane flying from the northeast to the southwest.

A brilliant flash of light knocked us both to the ground, and we looked up,  covered our eyes because of the light, and saw to rotating silver  craft. They changed shape rapidly to what looked like a giant black triangle. The first craft emitted a beam that lifted a 40 foot cactus out of the ground and fix the sand so the earth looked untouched. We then heard a deafening roar which we both assumed was the craft communicating with each other, they then both exploded into a brilliant display of colored light, and in the same way they came they were gone.

It was very large and as I remember wasn&apos;t loud at all. It was probably about 30 feet off the ground.(if that)Very close and very large. I got my husband to slow down and to look while he was driving and he couldn&apos;t tell what it was. It was lit up with lights. I don&apos;t remember exactly where the lights were but it seems to me they were around the middle of the craft. It seems to me they were just white lights, not colored ones. It was like a dome in shape. I could see a top and a bottom to it. Metallic I would think. It hovered there for about 10 - 20 seconds and then all of a sudden it just lifted up and sat there for a second and then in a flash it was gone... so fast I couldn&apos;t even see where it went other than in the direction it started leaving in. It was like there was just a streak of light where it&apos;d left from.I knew it wasn&apos;t a helicopter or anything else like that. It wasn&apos;t shaped anything like a helicopter.

There were red, blue and white lights blinking around the middle in a sequence that, at that time, I had never seen before (I have since seen laser Christmas lights that resemble them).  There was a very bright white light imminating from the center of the bottom that lit the ground beneath it.  I think there may have also been a small light on top but I&apos;m not certain.  I also don&apos;t recall the color of the object. We watched it for several minutes and eventually decided to leave.  We continued up the road and I happened to look toward the lake to our left and saw it again.  It was literally ricocheting around the lake.  This craft absolutely defied explanation.  It darted toward the bank at an unimaginable speed and then changed direction and headed toward the other bank.  This area was extremely hilly and, to this day, I know of nothing that could negotiate those kinds of turns at that rate of speed. It made a triangle shaped pass across the lake and then rose at an angle to a height of about 50 yards and then just shot off. I never told very many people about this incident but I&apos;ve always wondered exactly what it was that we saw.", "AT WORK, CALLED TO ROOF. 5th.

A lady had called into a radio station that we were listening to which was 98.5 KTK fm, and she said that there was a ufo spotted in Gainesville, Florida.

He lives in Fargo, ND, and I live in Minneapolis. My car was stalled at my wifes grandmothers house in Wadena, MN. My friend was on his way back home from my house, so I caught a ride with him to go pick the car up. As we were driving in the area of the Camp Ripley military base, we both started to feel very strange, almost like static electricity in the air. then, as we rounded a bend we saw two very bright amber lights appear directly in front of us, aprox. 500-1000 feet off the ground, I would say. One was slightly higher than the other, and both remained in the same spot for about 25 or so miles, until we saw them finally fall very slowly behind the tree line. Also along with the lights were bright blueish/green flashes, that appered somewhat like lightning, but were eminating from the ground, just to the east of Hwy. 10. Many other very strange, but somewhat hard to explain things also occured from that time on that night, but I don&apos;t know if they are related or not.", "SOMETIME BETWEEN 11:15-11:30 SUNDAY NIGHT I OBSERVED A HUGE OBJECT IN THE SOUTHERN SKY WHICH WAS BLUE AT FIRST &amp; RAPIDLY TURNED TO ORANGE FLAMES.

Small white light in same location shone beam.  When Beam turned off the light source changed colors several times, then silently flew away at extreme high speed straight and climbing.The time of my first sighting was during the pre -Christmas season of 1959.  At that time my husband had completed some college in the electrical engineering program.  He is now a forty year computer professional.  I was a high- school grad at that time but now have a  B.A. in psychology.  I was pregnant with my first child. My husband and I were driving from Highland Park, CA to Hollywood, he was behind the wheel and I sat beside him.  We were at the intersection of Eagle Rock Blvd. and Verdugo Road.   Because the traffic was very heavy we had to sit through several signal changes. While waiting at that intersection, my attention was drawn to an enormous intensely white aerial light.  The view occupied a minimum of four inches of the top left quadrant of the driver&rsquo;s side windshield.  (That put it south-west of our location.)  My first thought was that it must be a nearby helicopter operating some sort of huge search-light.  But I quickly realized that it was too large and too stationary to be a helicopter (it did not even waver).  After watching it for a couple of minutes, I asked my husband what it was, but he didn&rsquo;t know. I kept watching it as we approached and finally crossed the busy intersection.  Then we drove a short distance up the hill on Fletcher Drive below Forest Lawn Cemetery before we pulled to the curb and parked.  Being parked on the hillside put us much closer to the altitude of the object which was about a quarter of a mile to the south-west (at most) and probably no more than fifty feet higher than us. My husband got out of the car to have an unobstructed view.  I declined, wanting to stay out of the cold night air.  As I recall, we communicated about what we were watching through the open driver&rsquo;s window.  The light was completely motionless and silent. We saw no apparent structure above or around the light (that doesn&rsquo;t mean that there was no structure, only that we could not see the structure).  It appeared to be an enormous two-dimensional intensely bright white disk- shaped light source.  (It was more intense than advertising search-lights.)  Below it was a clearly defined, sharp edged, three-dimensional field of illumination.  Within that field of light which encompassed the rooftops of some old buildings, everything was as clear as if it were daylight.  My impression was that the buildings were turn of the century hotel or business structures.  My memory for the details of the experience is growing hazy, but I don&rsquo;t believe the light reached all the way to the ground. Based roughly on the assumed sizes of the rooftops and their geometric relationship to the disk I estimated the size of the disc to be about", "2 bright light &quot;events&quot; happening about 10 min. apart.Was observing the night sky (cloudless, moonless) from my balconey when I observed a star like object which, all of a sudden, gained great brilliance and was surrounded by an illuminated &quot;haze&quot;(similar to the consistency of a haze you would see surrounding the moon).  The brilliance peaked then wained, however the object moved, slowly, in a hook pattern (like the letter &quot;J&quot; starting at the top of the letter) until it vanished.  The area it moved in could be described as a 3inch by 3 inch square area of sky at arms length.  At first I thought it was a supernova explosion, but ruled it out due to the haze (plasma?)and apparent movement.  The star-like object in the center of the haze maintained it&acute;s shape as a &quot;star&quot; or point of light without warping or disappating. It steadily lost its lumonisity until it disappeared (along with the haze, which mimiced the brilliance accordingly). The event lasted about 5-6 seconds.  Maybe it was a meteorite entering the atmosphere at such an angle as to be &quot;head on&quot; if you catch my drift. Or a satellite activating a booster rocket?  Well about 10 minutes later the same event happened again...about 12 inches at arms length to the right of the previous event.  Charecteristics almost identical only this time the patern of movement was of a reversed &quot;J&quot;. This was no flare, no sound was emmitted.  Since only I witnessed the event (my wife heard me yell &quot;wow!&quot;) a report such as this would only be of use if others reported activity in this part of Bavaria.  A correlation maybe, at best, but worth reporting.  By the way, there was heavy observable satellite activity around this time.  I am 32 years old, married, an ex-US Army air traffic controller with over 5 years of active duty (Fort Rucker, AL and Grafenwehr Germany).", "Observed at altitude of approximately 300 feet based on ceiling (5000) and aircraft approaching local airport (White Plains Airport).  Object was estimated at at least 1000 feet.  Three white lights at each apex, a blue/white (vgery bright) strobe amidship and a red strobe (also bright) at trailing edge.  Size was based on approximate altitude of 3000 feet.  Traveling (estimated) at 50 mph or less, no noise whatsoever.  Object was leading with flat edge, not an apex.  Color was dull aluminum and appeared to be contiguously lit as if it had a light f it&apos;s own.  No other lights were in view.  Direction (corrected from original report) was North by North East.  Reported to Michael Lindemann and Jeff Rense and posted to Jeff&apos;s site as well as Michael&apos;s CNI News.  Also sent rough drawing to Michael, FYI.I heard a dull rumbling sound during most of the day, and was listening to the beginning of the Jeff Rense Show.  I was interested in hearing the guest that evening (I believe it was John Velez).  I never made it.  I heard a dull rumbling sound again, went out to my terrace and at first saw nothing.  In a moment, I saw (with no sound at all) what appeared to be a huge object described above.  I was shaking with excitement, as I had never seen anything this large.  I knew the ceiling was low because of the cloud cover, I knew the size was huge, not only by virtue of the obvious appearance of great size, but that aircraft were making landing approach to White Plains airport and appeared miniscule by comparison.  Also, they were flying well under this UFO. I went inside to get a pair of binocs, one of which was hanging from my 4 inch reflector.  The binocs are 20X.  I saw the object at greater amplification, but no further detail. I called out to my wife to come out and see this, (onto my terrace) but she did not hear me.  She was in the shower.  I reported my sighting to a chuckling tower person at White Plains, FAA on Long Island and to MUFON.  I never filled out a report to MUFON, as I was not at all impressed with the caliber of individual who was sent out to interview me.  This also, I recently reported to MUFON.  I have since dropped my membership.  But that&apos;s another story. To my knowledge, no others in my condo complex were out that evening, although if no one heard me screaming to my wife to come out, I&apos;ll eat my hat.", "I saw a brilliant flash in the southern sky going from East to West.ON THE MORNING OF SEPT. 17 TH.

I looked to my left (150 deg.) and saw three circular spots in a triangular pattern ,about 30 deg. above the horizon. At first I thought they were searchlights, then I realized that they were moving in unison. The three objects were circular in shape, and the bottoms were evenly illuminated in a brown-orange light, with no distinguishing features or markings. There were no navigation position lights or anti-collision strobes,red or white. There was no noise from these objects. From my perspective they appeared to be a little smaller than the size of a dime. During the pass one of the objects position changed in reference to the lead one.

I was frightened. I didnt know where I would wind up if I continued on at such a fast speed.

I thought I might have slept on something that made an imprint on my skin. I have a button on my nightsown sleeve so I looked at it but it was completely round and larger than the mark I had which was a perfect oval shape. I pressed the button into my skin just to see what kind of a mark that made but it wasnt anything  like the red-outlined oval on my wrist.

Then following the first group of 3 was another group of 3 lights in a V formation following the previous lights at the same speed and in the same position in the sky.

He said that we should keep watching so we did.  The orange lights were nothing like I have ever seen before.  It kind of looked like a lava the way it glowed.  That is the only way I can explain the color. As we were watching, the object disappeared.  WE decided to drive along after that.  About one minute later it appeared agin and was moving south at a very slow speed.  We gave chase to it and followed down towards Walnut creek.  We saw it hovering above another corn field. We stopped my truck and rolled the windows down to sewe if We could hear it.  There was no noise except for the regular coutry noises you hear.  Anyway, the thing stared moving and disappearing and reappearing.  We chased it from Walnut Creek to Hook &amp; Bullet, Out by Williamsfield all the way back over to Oak Run.  It was like it was playing Cat and Mouse with us.  We lost the object when we got to Oak Run.  We decided to stop at the main beach and talk about what we saw. Then over the lake, the object started coming towards us at a very high rate of speed.  it stopped across the lake from us and hovered. We jumped in the truck and chased to the outskirts of Victoria where it just vanished and we didn&apos;t see it aagain.  It was around 11 PM so we went back to Galva.  I was very scared that night and so was my friend.  We only told  a couple of people that we are close friends with because we didn&apos;t want people to think we were crazy. Myself and some other friends have witnessed evets like this many times since then.  I would be happy to talk to them over the phone or through another report.", "Large round bright green light moving quickly across the sky.I was sitting at the kitchen table facing a sliding glass door.

I saw a large bright, green light in the sky, moving from the east to the west.It was like the size of a full distant moon. It moved fast and low in the sky. We have tall trees all around us on the horizon. It angled downward and acroos the sky ,and as I jumped up and ran to the door and opened it, the light dropped behind the hillside. There was no tail, no noise, except the neighbor dog barking. No one else saw the light as they were not facing the windows. We all looked and listened for a few moments. I have never seen anything like this.", "Traveling across the entire horizon in less than 2 minutes, 7-8 comet-like objects blazed across the sky. One of the objects trailed off behind, while the other 6-7 continued beyond the horizon toward the east. They appeared to be a cluster of comets, that travled at exactly the same rate of speed. Their sizes varied (sm-lg) but all of them had &quot;tails&quot; behind them. They did not fall, like a meteor,or falling star, they instead were &quot;traveling&quot; apparently powered by some source. In other words, they did not loose speed as they traveled, but continued in their astonishing fast and silent flight.

Being a politician, he frequently hosted political functions at our home on the weekends. This particular night, I had fallen asleep on the backyard patio during the party my parents were hosting. After the party attendants had left (approx. 23:30 hrs.), my father had awakened me and was bringing me into the house when we both heard a very loud explosion or bang. Both myself and my father were standing in the front door of our home looking straight down our street at the power transmission lines that were in the woods at the end of the street. We stood there watching the disk shaped object hovering for approx. 20 minutes over the power transmission lines before the object suddenly took off at an extremely high rate of speed.

There was a deep humming sound.  It looked like two craft passed over me, but I only saw one lower itself down in a clearing.  When I reached the clearing (5 minutes later) an opening in the side of the craft was evident and something could be seen moving inside the opening.  As I tried to get closer, the opening closed and the craft suddenly lifted off and sped away.  I could follow it&apos;s path and then I saw the second craft join it and then they both headed to the east at a fast pace about like watching a jet go by.  There were no burn marks at the landing site and the next day I could not find any markings in the clearing.

My mom has also witnessed this event. I know this not a ufo report but I wanted to send a report anyway in hopes of finding what it could mean. Thanks, ((deleted)) from Birmingham (09/10/99)The full description is as follows: ................................ Black chopper (w/ 2 landing bars) Long tail Grey markings on both sides (2) occupants wearing what appeared to be military or government clothing (could not tell). Craft circled (3) times before speeding off to the west coming from the south. The chopper had to have been traveling at least 30 miles an hour flying overhead. We live near alot of trees and woods. The time approximately it took to circle was about (15) seconds at the most. They left, and about (2:20pm) they came back, this time they flew past our trailer and we grabbed our 35 millimeter camera and started to take a series of photos without them knowing and then they left. I didn&apos;t get to take any photos of it but I&apos;ll try next time!!! Mr. Davenport I wish not not to give my name for the safety of my family.

He saw what looked like a huge ufo explode into strings of multi-colored lights ranging from white to red to blue and purple ect... What I want to do is send you a map of the area in wich we live so that you will know where to pinpoint the locations of these events individually. I believe that the event of (July 3, 1999) and the black helicopters are are connected.

I travelled approximatly 10 blocks before no longer being able to see it as I passed it. As it was now behind me I continued on to work.

Although I can&apos;t swear to the exact date now, I think I was about eight or nine years old at the time.  Therefore it must&apos;ve been the late summer or early fall of 1964 or 1965.  I remember that my family and I had been sitting on the patio in our backyard and watching shooting stars because the skies were so clear.  Around eight o&apos;clock in the evening everyone else went back inside to watch a television program.  I stayed outside to see a few more of the meteorites. At this point I should describe the physical location of our house and its surroundings at that time.  Our house was at that time approximately two miles north of the city limits of St. Marys, WV (it is now within the city&apos;s expanded limits) on Route 2 in a rather narrow section of the Ohio River valley.  From the perspective of our backyard patio, the Ohio River and the ridge of hills on the Ohio side of the river are on the left.  Almost immediately to the right is the ridge of hills on the West Virginia side.  And at that time the backyard faced a large cow pasture.  The barbed wire fence enclosing that pasture marked the boundary of our backyard and was perhaps 15-20 feet from the back of our house.  The owner of the pasture lived in a small white farmhouse a couple of hundred yards away to the north (up-river).  Beyond that, the only other structure visible was the smokestack of what was then the state home for mentally retarded children (the Colin-Anderson Center).  It was perhaps a half mile beyond the pasture.  The pasture itself had a small pond for the cattle to drink from with a large old tree just to the left of it (from our patio&apos;s point of view).  The pond was about 80 yards from the edge of the fence and our yard. Again, as I was waiting for more shooting stars, I was startled by a flash of light that lit up the pasture for an instant like the flash from a camera.  I saw what seemed to be a large, white object shoot across the valley from above the ridge on my right and downward (in a slight arc)until it disappeared from sight behind the ridge of hills on the Ohio side of the valley.  I remember that the object didn&apos;t shoot across the valley at a uniform speed or motion.  Rather, it seemed to lurch by in a somewhat jerky motion.  I thought there would be a sound of big crash but there was no sound.  I remember that I was a little scared and excited too.  Just as I was thinking of running into the house and telling everyone what I had just seen, I was frozen into my chair by what happened next.  Suddenly, from above the ridge on the Ohio side of the river, a white disc shaped thing popped up and zipped (in an erratic, lurching movement) across the river and came to an unsteady stop (it didn&apos;t completely stop moving but seemed to keep inching forward slightly in little jerky movements as if it were a boat trying to maintain its position in a slight current) right in front of my eyes just above the top of the large tree beside the farm pond.  I think I was so frightened that I couldn&apos;t move.  It just floated there in the air, inching forward in little jerks, until it was above the pond.  There was no sound whatsoever.  The object appeared to be white or silvery but it didn&apos;t illuminate the ground.  Also, as it slowed, it&apos;s brightness dimmed to a hazy gray color.  I think I may have ran towards it for some reason but I can&apos;t remember now.  At any rate, after what seemed only a few seconds, I recall seeing the object zip away to the north (up the valley)in an instant.  Again, its motion was lurching and rather zig-zaggy as it climbed away into the sky.  I remember it looked rather like a fat, white star as it became smaller and smaller. Also, I was left with the impression that it looked rather liquid and formless (like a white globule of some sort)as it zigged into the stars and appeared to disappear among them.  After I came back to my senses, I remember that I became very excited and dashed back into the house and told everyone that I&apos;d seen a big white thing zipping around outside.  Nobody bothered to come outside.  My mother still remembers my bursting into the house all excited about something way back then. The most troubling thing, however, is my recollection of an inexplicable feeling of dread and forboding should I ever talk about it.  That feeling lasted for several years.  I suppose that this event is too attenuated in time to be of much interest to anyone.  Nevertheless, I think I&apos;ll feel better by letting someone know what I saw (as incredible as it sounds).", "i was outside at work and saw in the east, a very bright light. in an otherwise starless sky.stationary at first. but then extreemly slowly it began to move in a south westerly direction.first of all, i am a 36 year old male,that has lived in the fargo area most of my life. exept for ten years that i spent in the air force. i am now employed at a travel plaza in maintenance. i am very level headed and know that what i saw was not an airplane or helicopter. it started this morning at 5:50. i was outside and looking to the east, halfway up from the horizon i saw a very bright light. at that time it was not moving. then after watching it for about ten minutes it started to move very slowly to the south west. it was getting closer to where i was and i noticed a red light that moved across the front of the light from right to left. the timeing of this light seemed very consistant so each time the red light would move across the object, i would look at my watch. on every minute  i would see the red  light. then as it got closer, still appearing as a very bright light, i would see, just a few seconds after the moving red light, a small red blink of light on the right side of the object. then, a few seconds after that, there would be a red blink of light on the left side. they all stayed consistant in there timing.as it got closer it apeared to be higher, and a little bit further south. at about 6:15 it made a slightly faster move in the direction that it was going.that move lasted only about four seconds, then slowed to its original pace. at 6:25 i had to go inside to do some work, the light was stil there at that time. then at 6:40 i went back outside and the object, or light. had moved considerably to the southeast. looking smaller and not as bright. by 7:15 it was gone. at arms length the object was the size of a large pea.                      this is acctualy the third time ive seen an object like this over fargo. the last time. was very much the same as this one, except for the fact that the object sped away at a very fast rate. it also reflected the sunlight very brightly. that time was also witnessed by another person that was with me.the first time lasted only a few seconds. that one! blinked out and was gone.", "oblongular type object in western sky.  appeared to be heading south, then stopped for a long period of time and sped off northwestardlyI sent this information via e-mail to Mr. Davenport the night of the event, but I will write again exactly what I wrote to him.

Two observers. Very fast moving lights. Changes in direction and velocity.At 20:00 hours, Observer1 notices a bright object from his back porch that is almost directly overhead.  Observer1 is sure of the time because he could hear a popular television program starting inside.  He was facing towards the south and the object was aproximately 80 degrees above the horizon, almost directly above his position.  The object catches his attention because of its brightness and that it seems to be moving around.  The object is not confused with normal air traffic, which was present at that time, planets or a satellite because of its intensity.  Observer1 calls his friend out to witness the object.  Observer2, who was a sniper in the Army, easily sees the object and three other objects in near proximity to it.  Observer1 goes inside to get his binoculars: West German, Steiner, Commander Pilot S, 7X50mm with a built in compass. With binoculars, Observer1 is able to see the other 3 objects noticed by observer2.  Observer1 is not able to make out some substance and colors to main object.  Main object begins to move rapidly to the south after loitering around with 3 smaller lights.  Observer1 tracks main object to the south while observer2 follows 3 smaller or less intense lights.  Observer1 watches the main, brightest object disappear beyond the horizon at a heading of 136 degrees in a time span estimated to be 5-8 seconds.  Observer2 sees other 3 objects depart straight up or &quot;radially&quot; from the Earth.  Observer1 not able to reaquire the 3 smaller lights and observer2 is able to see the 3 smaller lights longer than observer1.  Note: terms &quot;smaller&quot; and &quot;larger&quot; deal with the intesity of the lights and not necessarily to their true size.  The terms were used by the observer1 to report the event to this investigator.

The jets looked very small to our eyes and ones that looked larger and closer left condensation trails behind them. We all left and went bak to work and would periodically look to se if it was still there. In a two hour period the object seemed to get more dull. We think it was due to the sun moving toward the west. In that time the object moved a total of 2-3 inches the the north, maybe due to the rotation of the earth.

The 4th &amp; 5th came from the same direction as the first. There was a full moon that evening and clear visibility. In comparision to planes which we could see flying off to the east, the speed of these craft was 4X the speed of the planes. No more than one object was visible at the same time. It took each object 5 seconds to cross our line of vision. All objects left in the same north/east direction. I have contacted the local newspaper and found that a man called to report orange objects int he sky that Saturday, however the newspaper did not take a report or get a name/number. A woman called a local television station and reported seeing one round object at 3:30am on Sunday the 26th, again a name/number was not obtained.I went on a &quot;well listened to&quot; local radio station and discussed my sighting and asked to have others who also saw this call, there were no calls. I have also reported this to NIDS.", "Bright oval-shaped light, approx. 30 degrees above horizon in N.E. portion of sky. Moved slowly from left to right. Observed for approx. 5min.On Sept.13,1999 Iwas on my way to work. At aprox. 04:30 I observed a very bright light over the water(where the Merrimac River meets the Atlantic Ocean)in the N.E. section of the sky. The sky was clear(no cloud cover)and the stars were visible. This light was approx. 3 times as bright as the stars and approx. 30 degrees above the horizon(it appeared much lower in the sky than the stars).It moved very slowly (from left to right).I observed it through my binoculars part of the time.The light appeared more rounded on the left side and slightly jagged on the right.Unfortunately I could only observe it for a few minutes .IT was still in view when I left.It didn&apos;t appear to be a planet (Ihave observed Jupiter &amp; Venus in the past).I&apos;m really not sure what it was.I hope this info has been helpful.", "((NUFORC Note:  The MiG-29 is not capable of achieving Mach 3.8.

It was approximately 30 degrees above the horizon in the Southeast.  It was very luminous and when inspected w/ binoculars, it proved to have vertical lines that seemed to shimmer like sheer curtains when blowing in the breeze, or like the way you see fumes coming off of asphalt on a very hot day.  My boyfriend who was there and saw it too, has seen Aroura Borealis in Northern Canada several times and that was the only thing that he could liken it to.  The patch itself didn&apos;t move in the horizon, it remained stationary for at least an hour- an hour and 1/2.  At times there were NO clouds near and we could see stars all around it and immediately next to it so it wasn&apos;t any upper atmospheric moisture that was illuminated by a ground light source, as I said, we were in the middle of the national forest.  It didn&apos;t seem to have any particular color, other than illumination. At first we thought, at a glance, that it might be some anomoly of clouds illuminated by a new moon, but the moon NEVER appeared in the horizon, and there were NO clouds in that vicinity.  In unusal circumstances there have been times that the Aroura Borealis has been sighted in this hemisphere, that is what drew us to the conclusion that we seeing it also.  Perhps it was a NASA experiment, or, MAYBE, just maybe, life from another planet???", "My husband and I saw an object hovering in the sky north of our home at 4:15 a.m. E.S.T. September 18,1997, Thursday. It looked like a slit in the sky to me. To him it looked like a red, round, stationary, glowing light low in the sky not making any sound. It kept changing colors of red, green and white, with what appeared to me to be a beam of white light shooting straight off the bottom of the rounded-elliptical top that kept flashing and changing colors. Two other objects were seen very near, or on the ground. I was looking west when I saw them take flight separately and start moving slowly to the east. They passed within 50-100 feet of the observers. Later that a.m. two more objects were seen near our home. One was a white, round light remaining stationary at treetop level as I was looking south. The other one appeared as two white, round headlights flying from the east to the west, then south. They simply blinked out right before reaching the location of the other object hovering in the southern sky at treetop level.Here is what we saw on September 18, 1997, Thursday at about 4:15 a.m. E.S.T. from the upstairs bedroom of our home. My husband and I saw an object hovering in the sky about one mile north of where we live. It was low in sky and he says it looked like a red, round light that was not flashing and it remained stationary in the sky.It was not making any sound. It did not look like any aircraft he had ever seen in his life. It appeared to be close by and was very bright and glowing. He kept waiting for it to move, but it did not. Then he left to go downstairs to the bathroom and afterwards went back to bed. He looked before he went back to bed and it was still there. He claimed he went to sleep immediately and could not stay awake at all. He left for work at 6 a.m. and looked to the north to see if it was still there and it was not. What I saw was a rounded-elliptical object, flashing red, green and white lights that looked like a slit in the sky.It was low and in the north with no sound from it. The object appeared to have a beam of white light streaming from the bottom of it when I first saw it at 4:15 a.m. from downstairs outside our front door. I am the one who saw the two red, oval objects close to or on the ground that passed near our home within 50-100 feet of where we were. They were at or below treetop level after taking flight from or near the ground. By the time I awakened him, they already had taken flight and I was watching the first one that took off go silently by the edge of our house. The other one had re-stationed itself as a white, round light behind a tree across the alley about 100 feet away. The first one passed by at treetop about 50 feet away from us. I never did see the one across the alley fly away, it just was not there anymore by the time I went downstairs to photograph on video camera the one in the north that we both saw that was still there. Here is what I saw happen after I had seen the bright object in the north flashing and beaming a white light off the bottom of it. I went back inside to an upstairs bedroom to get a pair of binoculars to have a closer look. While there, I looked out of the window to my right to see if it was still there and it was. At that time, I also saw two more objects south of it on or near the ground. I was looking toward the west. They both were red and oval-shaped. They each rose off the ground in an odd pattern of flight. The first one rose straight up to treetop level and stopped, hovered, then moved to my left and stopped again. Then it moved back to the right and stopped again, before moving in a straight line east, toward me. The other one rose off of the ground in a diagonal movement to the left, about half as high as treetop. It moved in a straight line to the east toward me, too. The first one changed shape and color as it approached within 50 feet of where I was. It veered to the south a bit and passed out of my line of sight after it passed by the top of the treetop in the yard next to ours.It was obsured from view by the edge of our house as it continued to pass to the east from the west. They both moved very slowly...maybe 5 miles per hour. I awakened my husband (he worked on an aircraft carrier on airplanes and had a Top Secret clearance that would have been extended to Krypto clearance had he chosen to work aboard nuclear-powered submarines, but he declined, while he served in the Navy for six years. He presently works as a Machine Job Setter. He has been employed by the same company for the past twenty years). He said that it did not look like any aircraft he had ever seen while in the Navy or otherwise. He saw the one hovering in the north while I watched the one pass silently out of sight past the edge of our house. I am a housewife and mother of two children. I recently finished a Medical Transcription course. It was such a brilliant white in the center that I could hardly look at it directly. It did not cast any shadows on the treetop or the ground, which seemed strange to me, too. As it passed by the yard next door it appeared to be round in shape and white in the center with a reddish-orange outer edge. We did not see any solid structure on any of them. The second one that left the ground flew across the alley and stopped behind a tree. It had changed shape and color to a round, white light. I kept watching to see where it went, but did not see it fly anywhere. It just was not there anymore. There was a well-lit moon in the sky, no wind and it was not cloudy. When I went outside to videotape the one in the north, I could not get it to appear in my viewfinder. I went outside to start taping it about 5 minutes after reporting it and having first seen it from our front door. I could clearly see it still hovering there and it appeared very bright in the sky from just outside of our back door where I was trying to tape it from. After approximately fifteen minutes of trying to get it on tape, the battery decharged. I decided to go inside and recharge the battery. After putting it on the charger I went back out to see if it was still there. It was not. I looked around other parts of the sky for anything else unusual and saw a round, white light at treetop in the southern sky. I went back in to wait for the battery to charge up. When I got inside, it was already charged. I put it on the camera and went back out to tape the other light in the south. I was taping it when I saw an object flying from the east to the west approaching towards me. It had two bright, white, round headlights on it and then began to fly south toward the other one I was already taping. I moved my camera to tape it and it blinked out. I looked to see if it was a solid object flying without any lights and saw nothing of it anymore. I refocused my camera on the one I was taping before this one appeared and then went inside. I am not sure what time it was, I think maybe 6 a.m. because my husband had already left for work. I was very tired and went to bed. When I got up a few hours later, I played back the tape of the recently videotaped object in the south at treetop. It was not on the tape. It was very upsetting to me after all that I had seen happen that morning. I went back out the next morning to see if the one in the southern sky was in the same place as the morning before, it was not there at all. I thought maybe it was a planet or a star in the southern horizon and should be there the next day as well, if so. I am still uncertain why nothing appeared on the tape of it or what the ones were o! n the gr ound or in the sky for that matter. It especially bothers me that I can not account for what happened to cause the battery to seemingly charge up in a matter of minutes and why the one I was taping did not appear on the film. Not to mention having seen the odd pattern of flight that the two on the ground made when getting airborne. I cannot compare or identify them with anything I have seen before, neither can my husband whom I told about the other ones and what they appeared to look like and do. To add more mystery to the matter, our computer crashed several times prior in the week to seeing all of this on Thursday morning the 18th of September, 1997.", "We saw 3 illuminated objects in a 3 point formation cross the night sky.I have watched the nite sky for many years in WA. state ( sputnik as a kid with my dad ) now I watch with my son (10 yrs old)On warm nites we try to see 6 satelites in orbit before going inside.It usually takes around an hour.This is the THIRD nite we have sighted these objects!! They move slowly from WNW to SSE .They move in a 3 point triangular formation with a leader up front and 2 following about 2 finger width apart with my arm out-stretched.They do not seem to hold perfect formation at times deviating slightly from position.They just look like moving stars untill they enter the southern sky where they fade and then disapear.Just look up around 10:30 to see them.", "More or less triangular shaped object. Moving east to west, turned wo move west to east. Slow moving. Appeared small, but it was hard to tell.I was returning from a tour of one of the buildings I patroll as a security guard. I was walking across the parking lot, west to east. Something in the sky caught the light from the city below. It was more or less triangular, with a very slight taper to a point in the rear. There were no lights on the object, and it made no sound. It was apparently traveling east to west and was in the process of making a u-turn to go west to east. I watched it as far as I could see it as it was only a darker patch in a dark sky. I lost sight of it somewhere over Lambert International Airport, wich lies east of the place where I work.", "I observed a large boomerang shaped object and a smaller object that I am sure was associated the the first. The event was at right about sunset on 9-21-99.On Tuesday evening 9-21-99,at about 6:45 PM, I was walking through the Country Club apartment complex on the South side of Indianapolis near S. Madison Ave. and E. Troy Ave.. I was facing West just at sunset when I observed what I at first thought was a hawk flying in the West / Southwestern sky. As it moved, it soon became apparent that it was actually a large chevron shape. The object pivoted on its left wing and leveled off It then either shot off faster than my eyes could follow it or it became invisible. I would estimate the size of the craft at between 100 to 150 feet across at about a mile distance; at an altitude of approximately 2,000 - 3,000 feet. It appeared to be a solid dark grey or black color. Just as soon as the craft disappeared from my sight, a second object shot just below the point where I had seen the first. It moved so quickly that all I could perceive was a solid black streak. It reminded me of what a hockey puck might look like after being hit as seen at the level of the ice. I couldn&apos;t detect any sound or unusual lighting.", "Fireball flew from west to east by south-east.  Split into three peices and disapeared over the horizon.The object appeared to the west while we were star searching.  It traveled east by south-east.  It was a fireball which broke into three peices about mid sky.  It went over the horizon to the East and seemed to distinguish but was still smoking when it went out of view.", "Wife saw it first looking north, altitude approx. 1000-2500 feet, then lost it in marine cover. Hovered, slight climb, hover, slight climb. Lights flash about every three minutes. Color grey to black, black to grey.My name is ((name deleted)), age 47.  First sighting.  Retired.  My wife noticed object out of bedroom window looking north over mountains.  She told me to come quick and see it.  We both observed it for approximately 15 minutes.  I saw it as a disk, color light grey, than dark grey, then black. It kept changing color.  Altitude was approx. 1500- to 2500 feet. Kept hovering.  Saw flash of light from it on two occasions. Very sudden bright flash like a flash bulb going off. We were able to go outside and view it as it gained altitude.  My wife got a picture of it. It&apos;s distance from us was hard to determine.  Could have been one to three miles away.  I reported it to our local police department and they in turn gave me your hotline number; where I obtained this website address.  We have tried to understand what if anything could it be.  We are convinced that is truly was a UFO sighting.  You can contact me at 805-((number deleted)).  Sincerely.

After going to a 1hour photo lab, we saw it again in Teaneck, NJ over a park very low. Cellular didn&apos;t work and car didn&apos;t work. Object then lifted on a tilt and traveled Westerly out of sight.The object was very white with many lights around the bottom. The size was @100ft in diameter.", "5 upright disks traveling south, low altitude, medium speed, with light beams directly between each disk, which appeared to be in align with one another (front to back), and illuminated from the rear and sides.At 5:05am I noticed a &quot;bead&quot; of lights to my west, so I looked. They appeared to be moving so I got out of my car to get a better look, thinking they were water on a power line. There were at least 5 very distinct upright disks or spheres, the first being a pulsating green, and the other 4 behind it bright white (and all exactly the same size). The disks were spaced evenly apart and each had an INTENSE beam of light shining from one to the next. It had been raining so we knew the object(s) were under 2000&apos; (clouds did not interrupt the light), and the object was traveling (apparently) the speed of a cessna aircraft, but was obiously much higher. The size of each disk was about 1/4 moon, or the size of your thumbnail at arms length, but MUCH brighter. I followed the object visually for over 20 seconds from my direct west, until it disapeared over my southern horizon (about where Disney World is). I&apos;ve worked midnight shifts for over 3 years, the last 2 sitting exactly where I was; in my car facing south, and I have seen planets, meteors, low and high flying planes and jets, bugs, you name it...this was NONE of those things. By the way...it did not make ANY sound at all, OR leave a visible com-trail. My estimate is that if it was a single object would have HAD to be (at the apparent height; just under 2000 feet), at least a quarter of a mile long. Please take note that the &quot;leading&quot; disk was green and pulsing, there were NO &quot;trails&quot; of any kind, and there were VERY clearly visible light &quot;beams&quot; (equal in size to each disk/sphere), between each of the 5. Also note that we are in close proximity to Orlando International Airport, and this &quot;thing&quot; did not follow any usual approach pattern, or even go toward that airport. If it had, they would&apos;ve needed to significantly lengthen the runways.", "A flaming cylindrical object crossed the entire sky, north to south, in about 3 min.3 of us were in the street in our neighborhood on a dark cloudless nite in Aug of 1970 (?) when we noticed a bright, red-orange-yellow flaming object crossing the sky. I first noticed it at about 40-60 degrees above the northern horizon progressing towards the south, straight overhead. There was no audible sound. It appeared to be a cylinder, but only flames were visible against the black background of the night sky. Pieces seemed to be falling behind burning up as if they were peeling off the sides of the cylinder. It&apos;s speed could be compared to a jetliner crossing the sky at 30,000 ft, but it gave me the impression of being much higher, as the flames seemed to be peeling off in slow-motion (indicating a very large object at high altitude), so we had time to consider following it in the car, as it appeared to be headed for an impact in San Gabriel mountains just south of town. There was no impact flash as it disappeared behind the mountains. It travelled in a straight line the entire time.", "approx.6 objects flying in formation. manevering in relationship to eachother breaking formation acelarateing then rejoining formationi live aboard a boat in richerson bay. free from any city lights.i first saw the objects as agreenish glow moveing from west north west towards east i quickly aquired my binoculars and observed that there where points of light flying in formation the lights gave off streaming  energy aft of the lights.at one point when the objects were at my 12 oclock position one object broke formation acelarated ahead then rejoined formation. i am an experenced sailor. and was raised in a flying famaly father pilot mother pilot brother same. there is a signature ot vessels . manuvering in a formation that is absolutley reconizable.i have witnessed rocket re entry be fore . metor , fire ball ect. these objects were on a course maintaining specfic altitude and  speed.ie. flying !", "Bright red light.The object appeared in the northeast sky and slowly moved north. It was approximately the size of the planet Venus (a bit larger perhaps) The light was bright red, if I were to best describe the color, I would say it was a candy apple red.(very bright) The object remained very bright for most of the 15 minutes we viewed it. But it did flicker several times for a very brief period. One of the times it flickered myself and another witness noticed the lights in our backyard dimmed as if the power was about to go out. At the same time, my brother who was in the house, stated the television and cable box had shut off. The object finally disappeared from our view by flickering one last time and slowly faded into the night sky.", "Pure pulsating light, moved strangely in the sky, best described is like the minute hand on a clock, you can&apos;t see it move but you know it has?I and a friend were setting in my car outside of his house early in the morning (I am terribly unsure of the date (1998-1999). We are usually talking really in-depthly about life or philosophy and I was on a rant, when independently from each other we begin watching a light in the sky (keep in mind I was continuing to talk thinking nothing of the light at first). The next part is were it gets weird because I have heard no one ever describe the movement or actually the speed of the movement of a U.F.O in such a way: There are plenty of trees and power lines that acted as reference points and we were not shifting our positions or even our heads (certainly not to the degree the object moved)... As I continued to talk (on my rant, we still had not made it known to each other we were both watching it), this pure white light that was pulsating slowly seemed to move up (up like into the upper atmosphere, not North), and it moved back down, what is strange is the following: The way it moved was kind of odd because it was a keen to watching the minute hand of a clock (you can not really see it moving but you know it has by it&apos;s relation to other things on the clock face). It moved in a weird pulsating slow way up and down as I said extremely slowly. I used a utility line that was right in front of my windshield as a reference point, and the light would move above and below the line by some distance (the power line as I said is a reference to knowing the thing moved not a reference as to how big or how far away it was, because the power line was extremely closer to us than the light was). By this time my rant had ceased as I was watching this light move up and down in nonsensical ways. I asked my friend if he was watching the light (his head had been pointing in the general same direction mine had been) and he said yes. So now both of us had watch independently the light move in this weird way. We got out of the car and stood at the front to see it better and it continued briefly doing what it had been doing, before it began to pulsate, I guess you could say at a slower modulation (meaning it wasn&apos;t just blinking on and off for longer duration&apos;s of time but rather it pulsated at a slower rate almost like a heart beat slows down but more smoothly and of course visually). When the pulsating change to the slower rate, it seemed to be losing it&apos;s consistency and actually seemed like you could look through it if you were close enough. It would come back a little strong then go back to being weak but never as strong as it originally was. It did this until it pulsated slowly into nothingness (meaning it looked kind a like how a candle does when the wax builds up so much that the flame is just barley flickering slowly and then goes out very gently). I thought it was all over when the next thing I knew, an airplane, flying extremely fast and low (keep in mind, we live reasonably close to an airport and there are always planes in the sky, passenger jumbos and smaller personal planes, as well as helicopters. So although I can not be for certain because all I could see were its lights and speed (and hear its roar!) but my guess is it was a military plane. The lights on the plane were brilliant blue and red on each wing (a blue light on one wing and a red on the other) and they alternated VERY FAST (faster than I had ever seen lights blink on a plane before), it was almost like a strobe effect. The plane made a beeline for where the light had been at, in an almost perfectly straight line. The plane came out of the West/Northwest sky where Fort Cambell army base is about a county or two to our West (the object was in the North/Northeast sky). I can not state enough how fast the lights strobed from wing to wing, back and forth (I do not know if that is a sign of a military airplane or not, but it&amp;#8217;s the only plane I have ever bore witness to whose lights strobed that fast). I and my fiend do not do drugs, we had not been drinking, and although we have expressed interest in U.F.O. and &quot;Art Bell&quot; related topics, the last thing we thought we would ever be witnesses to was an actual U.F.O. If you e-mail people back about their requests, I was wondering if there had been any other sightings in our area similar to this. My brother supposedly has seen a similar object but did not pay as much attention to it as me and my friend had.", "Swimming is surf.Two boys saw first.Yelled and pointed:&quot;WHAT IS THAT!!!&quot; I saw it.Close over bank.Bright silver.Up FAST!Angle.Tracked! Changed direction.Went up Coast.North(?)!Watched out of sight!The boys,(ages 8 yrs/10 yrs),were swimming in the Surf with me at Kalaloch Beach, off Hwy. 101. Wa Olympic Penninsula. They both started screaming and yelling and pointing, behind us , up at the sky, yelling, &quot;WHAT IS IT!!!???WHAT IS THAT?!&quot;. I got up,turned around and saw something BRIGHT SILVER ,gleaming it seems in the sun. No wings. Seemed at an angle. Deep in height. A wave knocked me down. When I looked again it was going up at a steep angle, high rate of speed. Looked white in co lor against a perfect clear blue sky, and was saucer/disked shape. It was travelling so so fast and went far up quickly, becoming very small and, high. I was knocked down three or four more times by the water, each time getting up, and finding it and tracking it until we could barely see it at all. Way up in the atmosphere, it appeared to suddenly change direction, heading more vertical, and away from us up the coast. We screamed and yelled at family on the beach , but with the surf pounding and the distance they could not hear us, and didn&apos;t see what we were pointing at.  I have never seen anything like it.  I wished I would have been looking earlier, or have saw it exactly when the boys did. I saw it just after.  I was camping, at Kalaloch Campground , which I have done many years. The boys were my sister in laws nephews, whom I took to play in the Ocean waves.  I am a 48 yrs young, woman, mother,and grandmother. I have an Assc. of Arts degree in Education.  I am a regular person.  I grew up out on the Penninsula, and have no reason to make this up.  It seemed to be that as soon as we started pointing and yelling, the object (flying), left.  I don&apos;t know that to be true either way, as I don&apos;t know how long it was there before we saw it. As I said,  I saw now wings, was smooth, larger, and silver...then when it turned and went up, at that angle it was white , and disc/ saucer shaped. I have never seen anything travel that fast and get so small and so high, that quick.  I can probably get the exact date, or close, figured out, if I sit down with a calander. Oh,  we heard nothing... .", "((NUFORC Note:  Report is not inconsistent with a twinkling star, but that is only a guess.

Immediately, we both spotted four objects in the sky. The &quot;head&quot; of the objects were glowing, unsure of the color but I remember bluish/green and my girlfriend recalls at least one turning a reddish color. The objects seemed to be at a low altitude, but I&apos;m not sure because I can&apos;t confirm how large the objects were. (MUCH bigger than a star....maybe 1/8 to 1/10 the size of a full moon? I couldn&apos;t hear any sound, but the objects moved very slowly. They were midway across the sky when we first observed them, and they remained visible for about 20 seconds before passing out of our line of sight.  The first three objects were close together, almost in a formation, while the fourth was slightly behind and off center. They left a short smoky trail behind them, easily visible in the dark night sky. We&apos;ve both seen many meteors, and this didn&apos;t conform with anything we&apos;ve seen befor! e. Our first reaction was, &quot;What is that?&quot; The slow speed seemed to rule out a meteor or &quot;shooting star&quot; as did the strange color and the misty trail behind them.

I was a bit tired so I thought to go back to bed but I turned around to watch more. When I looked out the front window, I saw a gold disc by the neighbors garage. There was a sack on top of it (brown) and a tube or rope coming out of it then it started to &quot;pump up&quot; or inflate then I started getting scared. The lights started to spin and it looked like a head coming out of it. There were more gold discs coming.  Just as I started to look away I saw cars coming.  There were 4 or 5 black sedans coming exactly 3 feet apart doing about 90 mph (this is also a semi-dead end street which sees like no traffic except residents) I thought they were coming to tell the martians to cut it out (doesn&apos;t know about MIBs) Then I went to bed.

Lights did not look like aircraft through binoculars. Had horizontal line of white lights, distinguishable through binoculars, and red lights above and below white row of lights, that seemed to throb brighter and dimmer, not blinking totally on and off. Watched the light in relation to other aircraft moving by. And, by the way, there seemed to be much more air traffic in that direction than usual. The night sky was very clear.  No clouds seen.  The object was barely distinguishable with out the assistance of binoculars for me, but my wife who is farsighted, could see without binoculars. I would say that it could have been a large plane going away from us, except that the event took about 6 to 7 minutes. The object moved from about 30 degrees up from the horizon down to the tree level and out of sight, which would be about 10 degrees above the horizon. The object, if moving away from us, would have been going east to west. However, over the 6 to 7 minutes, the object didn&apos;t move far, and it didn&apos;t appear to grow smaller as it would have had it been moving away. Also, I did not notice in colored lights on what would be the wing tips if looking at an aircraft from behind. One more thing about the object. we had been looking straight up and out toward the west for 5 to 10 minutes prior to it&apos;s &quot;arrival&quot;. It was suddenly &quot;there&quot;, and we had not seen it what so ever before our first visual sighting of it. Both my wife and I had been &quot;scanning&quot; the sky as we do almost nightly over the last two months. The other air traffic over our area, while looking west from the front of our house, was very heavy in the western sky.  One aircraft went over us from West to East, fairly low.  It also didn&apos;t appear to resemble what we typically see when regular airline passenger jets go over. It was also fairly quiet. Could have been military, but I can not verify that. Tonight has not been the first night we have seen &quot;unusual events&quot; in the sky.  In august, (I know it was a Sunday evening, and I believe it was 8/13/99) during the &quot;meteor storm&quot;, we happened to see the very, VERY bright light in the west sky. It lasted long enough that my wife saw it first and said &quot;look at that&quot; - I saw the tail end of it, and it seemed to last for a good second or two. There was NO TAIL. It came, &quot;out of nowhere, without a tail like other falling stars&quot;, according to my wife. I have never seen a falling star like that before. We have also seen a very dimly lit light going quickly across the sky, from NW to SE, directly overhead. About the size of a star. Round, no blinking lights. Looked like a headlight in fog, or a flashlight shining through a sheet of white paper. Small, even with binoculars. Since I didn&apos;t write down the dates and times or report those incidents, I won&apos;t submit seperate reports for those incidents. However, I wanted to include this information, as my wife and I feel like many things are happening that don&apos;t quite fit the norm, and it is the reason why I took the time to write about the event we saw tonight so that it can be recorded... just in case... and so I can remember the date and time (I lose track of time more and more)...

Calif.)Mr. S.C. was proceeding to pull out of a driveway into traffic on Del Rosa Ave. in Highland (east of San Bernardino) when he looked to the north and saw what he first thought to be a giant black bird hovering over the San Bernardino Mountains in the vicinity of Lake Arrowhead.  He quickly discerned that it wasn&apos;t a bird and grabbed his 7X binoculars he keeps in his vehicle for a closer look.  He described the object as black, cylindrical with &quot;seagull-like&quot; wings.  Size estimated to be 3-inches long at arms length.  Duration of sighting approx. 3-4 minutes from the time he first noticed it until he watched it shrink down to pin point size while still viewing it through binoculars.

It was about 12 to 15 inches in diameter, perfectly round, not out of line anywhere and about 10 to 15 feet wide and all the grass in the middle was squished down flat, like a heavy wieght had been on it. My dog went crazy when he came over to see what I was looking at. Jumping back and forth at it and yipping high, shrill ,barks over and over. So I tied him on the other side of the house. The burnt grass was still in form. I thot someone was playing a joke on me. So I questioned my nieghbor on the hill across the road, to see if she had heard or seen anything. She said no. But, you could see the burnt circle perfectly from her porch. And it was perfect. I showed the circle to my brother, my cousin and acouple of friends, and my husband at the time. My husband and brother both knew of the incident the day before because I told them all about it at supper the night before, so we were all trying to put two and two together. As summer progressed  the burnt area turned brown. Then these mushrooms, and only mushrooms started growing in the circle. They grew fast,and extremly large, until they just burst open. Then they disentigrated and toward the end of summer the grass started growing back. It grew darker, thicker, faster, and taller than the rest of the grass in the yard. That winter it snowed, and that circle of grass still grew tall through the snow. You could see that circle for a few years after a! lso, but has finally faded away.same as above", "High Performance A/C at full military powerPlease try and find if any of the other foreign national a/c such as the FGR F-4&apos;s were involved in the intercept attempt of that evening.

At 20:49 on 9/21/99,  an object caught my attention out of the corner of my eye as I was facing south.  To my left, this cylinder/tubular shaped thing appeared to have some substance to it.  It had some depth.  I could not identify the color, but the spiral material was darker than the actual cylinder. The item did not appear to be hollow.  It appeared to have some kind of material spiraling around it, not in motion around the object, but being in complete contact with the cylinder.  At first, it appeared to be hovering but it was slowly moving west.  It was approximately 1500 feet high (max).  I watched the cylinder travel  west for about 5 seconds. At this point, I lost focus on the item for about 3 seconds.  It was like it had just disappeared.  From this point, I believe it was the same object, a transparent, boomerang shaped object located about the same distance up, maybe 500 feet higher, began to travel south.  The boomerang shaped object appeared to have more of a rounded top while the bottom appeared to be more flat.  Maybe 2000 feet high.  The moon was south/southwest of the object and I could see the reflection of the moon on parts of the object.  However, I could not make out a definite outline of the object.  I could see it, I could make out its shape but I could not describe what color it was.  I could see right through the object.  When it passed stars, I could see the stars through the object but they were a little diffused like seeing them thru a tinted window.  Then, the definition of the curves in the object were a little more obvious as I watched the stars kind of curve a bit when they would pass the edges of the object.  The object was pointed south, but it was traveling at an angle where I could tell that it was boomerang shaped. As the object traveled more towards the moon, I blocked the light of the moon out with my hand and continued to track the object.  It continued to travel south but I lost it about an inch and a ! half (fr om where I was standing, it was an inch and a half from arms length) before it would have passed in front of the moon.  Total time of watching the object travel south was about 20 seconds.  I ran downstairs and grabbed the binoculars and yelled at my mother in law to come verify what I had just seen.

It was travelling easterly and was like a large yellow ball of flame with a bright blue centre and had a yellow streak of light behind it.  It was simply awsome and I have never seen anything like it. No sound was emitted. I have seen falling stars before, but nothing like this. This thing was comparatively huge and had a much lower trajectory.The object was visible for about 5 seconds, heading in an easterly direction. I just happend to mention it to a work college the next day, and amazingly he saw the same object but at a totally different location about 20 miles away.  He claimed he also saw its shape after it had burned out its flame and its light grey color. This is the most bizzare observation of a UFO type object I have ever seen.

After the two on the right moved close to one another they stayed that way until we could not see them any longer.  We started to travel and their are many corn fields obstructing our view some of the time.  I did not see the two move they just seemed all of a sudden to be one ontop of the other.

I got a telescope out (the usual home telescope) and managed to get a look at it close up - as did 8 friends of mine. We all agreed we could not idetnify the light.

On that night I saw 5 similar objects travel south to north within a span of about 20 minutes between 2100 and 2120. On 9-6-99, I observed at the same time as on 9-5-99 and only saw 1 south to north object and 2 shooting stars. On 9-7-99, I thought that if they were all satellites, they may be transiting slightly earlier each night. That is why on the 7th, I started to scan at 2000. The objects appear as satellites both in light consistency and straightline paths. I am curious that if they are indeed satellites, why are so many in the same orbital direction and so closely spaced? On 9-8-99, our sky was cloud obscured and I was unable to make any observatios. On 9-9-99, I observed from 2000 to 2130 and only saw 2 south to north objects and 1 west to east object.

The object was approximatley 1.5 meters in diameter and PERFECTLY spherical. It was metallic in colour, roughly the colour of iron, which was constant throughout the sphere. It did&apos;nt seem to have any markings or openings. We both were familliar with weather ballons and other air filled objects, and it definately wasn&apos;t an air filled object, it definatley had a SOLID SHELL. It would be best described as a ball bearing 1 meter wide. It remained there for what seemed 10 minutes and didn&apos;t move a CENTIMETER. At that point we BOTH ran downstairs and out the front door, this must have taken a MAXIMUM of 6 - 7 SECONDS, when we opened the front door it had dissapeared. We had a clear view of the sky in all directions, approximatley 30 degrees from the horizon and above, but there was nothing to be seen.

Very strange.", "My husband and I, while traveling on our honeymoon, observed something strange following our ship just before midnight.My new husband &amp; I were on our honeymoon aboard the Carnival cruise ship Destiny- at sea between Cozumel and Jamaica. At approx. 11 PM after dinner we decided to walk the deck and get some fresh air. Both my husband and I are non-drinkers are sound responsible people. I suggested we go as far to the prow of the ship as allowed as the night was clear and the sea was very calm and beautiful. The upper-level deck is as far as passengers are allowed and is immediately adjacent to the game room for teen passengers. We walked to the rail and just enjoyed the nights breeze. Far off in the distance, lightning flashed and I remember even mentioning to my husband that we may get a storm during the night, but he shouldn&apos;t worry as this was his first cruise. Before long, we both noticed what appeared to be a ship sailing directly toward us and at a slight angle. Being a scuba diver, I have been at sea many times prior to this and I just thought it was a freight ship passing us in the distance. However, this proved to be very different than any thing I had ever seen. This object moved toward us with a speed not of any ship I had ever seen. Within a matter of moments, it was right aside of our cruise ship. At this time a young man, perhaps around 15 yrs old also came to the rail and asked us if we knew what we were looking at. The object hovered just outside the lights of the ship, but through the clear night a definite triagular shape could be made out. It had 3 lights which were respectively green, amber and white. My husband and I carefully considered what we were seeing. How could any ship have overtaken us so quickly? Why would any ship plot a collision course with a cruise liner. And the most damning evidence. This object made no wake and hovered next to a MOVING ship for 10 minutes or more as we all watched. A Conventional ship would have had to come right at us, made a sharp turn in close proximity to our ship and then have thrown their engines into hard reverse in order to stay exactly along side us for the! 10 minu tes or so. Our conclusion, this was not a seafaring vessel, but rather something suspended in the air. The object casually lingered right next to our ship for at least 10 minutes and long enough for several other young men to come out to watch. The kids were afraid and kept asking my husband and I if we were safe. Shortly thereafter the craft began to move slowly down the length of our vessel. My husband in tow, we walked the entire length of our ship and watched the craft glide out past the stern and out to sea. The strange lightning I had observed just before we sighted it seemed to follow it as it went. We watched as it maintained a course off into the distance from where we had just come, the lightning only seen in the vicinity of the craft. Just a word as a follow up to this. Both my  husband and I are not crank cases. We are normal middle aged adults and most skeptical about these kind of phenomenon, UNTIL now. No ship could have done what this thing did or would have even wanted to get so close to a large moving cruise ship. I also noticed that the same shape craft was reported over Monterray Mexico only 2 days after we saw this. The sighting in Monterray involved police, air traffic controller and tv stations.

We ran outside and watched one F15 making a near vertical departure in an easterly direction followed closely by a second.

This object was completely silent, massive and solid in its structure, as the star fields behind it became blocked as it moved along in a slow controlled trajectory. It was 2-3 times the size of a C-5 and it emitted an uncanny &apos;flame&apos;, which was iridescent blue in color, stretched out aprox. 200&apos;, and had a sparkly transparency to it. Flame was a term used by him for lack of a better explanation, however he was adamant that this was highly unusual in it appearance, and how it trailed behind the object.

The fireball, I thought it was a meteor at fisrt untill it turned. I&apos;m not sure of its shape for it was too far and fast to get a real good look at it.  The weather was clear with some clouds moving in from the west. I stopped on the side of the road and looked at the sky.  I could see some lens shaped clouds. I wasn&apos;t able to see too many stars due to the clouds.  Yet, I was able to see the brightness of that fireball just a few minuets ago.

At approximately 9:45, I overheard two employees talking about, &quot;the strangest thing I have ever seen.&quot; They related the story to me. Looking due west, towards the eugene airport, they saw a white light travelling in the sky, &quot;at the pace of a usual airliner,&quot; traveling from northwest to southeast. While it was the same speed of usuall aircraft,it just looked like a fuzzy light object. It continued to travel south, then developed a red streak behind it (did not mention if it was fire or anything) traveled for a few seconds, then burst into a large fireball. (I asked him if he was exagerating, and he said no, &quot;A real fireball.) THen the white object took off at an incredible rate, Southeast, then dissapeared. We talked about it around 9:45 to 9:50.

Front of object had several dim lights, craft very large, moving slowly over pastureIn the late summer of 1980, a friend and I were sitting on the trunk of my car  at approx. 11:30 p.m. My home was located in Brenham, Tx-right off of the highway, ( sorry, can&apos;t remember which highway) and was surrounded by cow pasture. We were just looking at the stars..and suddenly we saw a strange craft moving slowly through the night sky, directly above us. We thought at first that the object was a blimp-soon it was quite obvious that this was no blimp, plane,etc..The object was very, very long..at the very least one football field in length.The front of the object was chevron/triangle shaped, with dim lights all along the rim of the front. Object was very slow and seemed to be flying at low altitude. The oddest thing was the complete absence of sound-any object that low, that large would have to make sound of some sort, but this thing was totally silent-almost like a vaccum- everything was incredibly silent. We watched this for approx. 15-20 min, in total shock, not really believing what we were seeing. We never reported it, never mentioned it to anyone-as we were young, ( 20) and knew that we would never be believed. To this day, I believe we saw an alian craft--I am now in my 40&apos;s and have never again seen anything that large be able to fly..and especially be totally soundless", "Two bright Spherical shapes chasing each other at high speedI was flying into Minneapolis Saint Paul airport and we had started our descent. I was looking out of the left side of the aircraft when I noticed two bright spherical shapes chasing each other at high speed in a circle and then a figure of eight just below cloud level. They seemed to take turns in chasing each other. I thought at first it was a reflection from the plane but as the plane was flying I was having to look back to see them as the plane was flying away from them. They were much too fast and turning too quickly to be any kind of aircraft.", "extremely bright reflective sphere changed into eccentric cigar chapeAt about 17:00 I exited the Wal*Mart store here in Fairfield and I noticed about 15 people in the parking lot staring at something in the sky toward the south. Once I walked to a position from which I could see, I looked up and witnessed what seemed to look like an extremely bright and reflective (clear sky) crystal ball hanging in the sky. It appeared to be about 5 miles to the south and about a mile in attitude. It&apos;s size was about 1/4 the size of a full moon. It stayed perfectly still for about 20 minutes, during which time the other observers became bored and left. I stayed. The object slowly began elongating and growing in size on the elongated end, somewhat like a condensed baseball bat (without the knob on the end). The object lost it&apos;s highly reflective appearance and seemed to be silvery metallic. It slowly began moving away in a southwest direction and up. It kept moving away in that direction, quite slowly, until it was too small to see. I would (probably highly inaccurately) estimate its largest size at up to 500&apos; from end to end, 50&apos; across on the spherical end, and 100&apos; across and the elongated end.", "Observation of commercial aircraft approaching Sea-tac airport(SW to N dir.),inbound 2110pm, appearance of sattelite? crossing in a NW direction shining bright beacon of light as it passed aircraft.

I looked up and saw four white lights spaced in the shape of a diamond. The size was about the size of a laptop computer held at arms length. There was a dark superstructure filling in the area between the lights as contrasted against the cloud cover behind it.  It hovered for a few minutes then shot off to the north, N. Phoenix, then shot back to the south, then back to the origin- al position, and then shot straight up through the clouds, dissappearing. There was no noise from it.  There was no build up of speed as most of our conventional aircraft would exhibit. It appeared to move at a constant, very rapid velocity. And did not appear to slow down. It just came to an immediate stop.  The local radio station (93.5Mz??) was asking for people, who saw it, to call in.  People from N. Phoenix did see it and called it in.  I was expecting to see it in the local paper but there was nothing at all, which is quite supprising since so many people saw it and it was talked about on a local radio station.  I am not a local. Was in town on business.", "Out cutting hedges and saw object in skyThis is a resubmission.  I have tried to establish the approximate date. I was outside my home, cutting hedges on the East side of my home and took a break.  I was looking at the sky admiring the light clouds and blue sky.  There were 2 cloud levels.  One up high, maybe 12-15,000 feet.  A lower one, that was approximately 8,000 feeet.  I know it was fairly high, as the lower clouds were wispy, not stacked cumulo Nimbus clouds.  I also live 2 miles from Willard Airport, outside Champaign, IL so I am used to watching planes fly overhead as they use the transponder here at the airport. I had on sunglasses due to the brigth sun, and my eyes are sensitive to it.  I was looking East and suddenly observed a round object appear out of nowhere.  The object was circular in shape. I observed the object appear to make a lazy left turn.   The object appeared to be a dirty copper in color and was huge.   I state the object appeared to make a left turn as I observed the underside of the craft.  It appeared to swing up.  The underside tilted up towards me at an approximate 30 degree angle.  I could definitely see almost the whole underside of the craft, and see it&apos;s circular shape.  The object then slid back flat, and disappeared !!   I couldn&apos;t believe it. Thinking about it, I could not see the craft until it tilted.  This has bothered me.   Why couldn&apos;t I see it until it tilted, and then after it returned it disappeared again.  It was large enough, and close enough that I should have seen something !!! Using basic geometry I figured out it&apos;s basic size.   A cloud level at 8,000, even less, and an approximate angle of 45 degrees in the sky one can reach some conclusions.   I figure the object was approximately 2 1/2 miles from me.   I live in a small town, and estimate the size of this craft to be approximately 100 feet in diameter, based on comparing barns from approximately 2 1/2 miles away.   Smaller then a full moon. Would be approximately the size of  full moon and add a half moon to it.  Larger than a half dollar held at arms length. I declined to report this for fear of what our gov&apos;t is doing.  I work in law enforcement and don&apos;t need to be labeled crazy.   I have dated a young woman who has a family member in  the military.  He told her to stay away from Internet sites that delt with UFO&apos;s, as they are all monitored by the gov&apos;t.  When pressed for mor info, he refused to answer more.

About 45 degrees off horizon. Not fast enough for a meteor and too fast for a plane. Went to the ground.After picking up 2 tons of hay at a farm south of Mica mountain we started home. It must have been between 8 nd 8:30pm. While driving down farm roads (no street lights or house light) we spotted a bright light in the sky. It was at about 45 degrees off the horizon. I don&apos;t know the directions as the roads turn around the mountain. It appeared to be a bright white light with fuzzy edges, as though light was escaping around it. It moved too slow to me a metor and too fast to be a plane. My friend said do you see that light and I said Yes, He said it&apos;s probably a meteor and I said no it&apos;s moving too slow. By the end of our conversation the object decended from the sky behind some tall pine trees (I could see the shadow) and to the ground or a valley below. I could not see where it ended up. There was no explosion and no sound. I looked in the newspaper and watched tv to see if there was a plane crash and there was none.", "Pulsating bright green lights seen NorthWest of Bothell area. Number of lights would change from 1 to sometimes 4 or 5.At approx. 10pm on 9-9-99 my neighbor asked me to come outside to see what she and her husband were watching.  At first there was nothing there. Then, 2 or 3 bright (almost florescent) green lights would pulsate in the sky.  They never appeared to move from the spot where they were,  however the number of lights would change.  Sometimes there would be only 1 and sometimes 3, 4 or 5.  Then the lights would disapear altogether for a few seconds (15-20) and re-appear again. The neighbors had been watching this for about 10 min. before calling me outside.  About 5 min. after that another neighbor came home and also witnessed the lights in the sky.  This was a total of 4 people observing the lights.  At 2 instances, there &quot;appeared&quot; to be a &quot;beam&quot; from the light to the ground (or vice-versa).  The lights were quite high in the sky eventhough they were quite large.  At times they appeared to be behind a portion of cloud as the view was hazey and dull, and then other times appeared bright and clear, as if it were in front of the cloud.  There was absolutely no sound.  The night was quiet and any sound would have been heard.  We get quite a few commercial aircraft in the area, so am familiar with their lights and sound.  Also get &quot;copters&quot; from Whidbey Island Base and are familiar with their sound.  We are wondering if anyone else happened to see what we saw that night?  Any suggestions as to what it was?

The light was so intense, it hurt my eyes to look at it. After 30 seconds it suddenly reduced its brightness immediately to that equal to Jupiter and slowly started to fade as it moved slowly from the Northwest to the Southeast. The very strange thing was that it was so bright that when it changed intensity, a residue or pale glow of light surrounded the oject while it moved and then faded out of sight.", "Triangluar object moved very slowly over the trees appr. 100 yards from me without a sound, stopped, tipped up and lowered itself into the treeline.I went out to the Spring Bayou landing to look at the stars to kill some time, and as I was laying there, my neck hairs began to raise. I sat up, and a dog came running wild eyed from behind me with his hackles up, and I saw a craft that was triangular slowly flying over the trees across the bayou. It made no sound and the trees did not move or make any noise, either. The craft was about 60 feet long and was kind of dented in on the bottom like an upside tea cup plate. As it drifted over the treeline, it came to an abrupt stop, tipped upwars and began to lower itself into the trees. I know of no known aircraft or helocopter that can do this withoutmoving the leaves and branches on the trees around it.

The object was round, and was going in circles changing colors from red to blue. About 1/2 hour later a second object appeared and was triangular in shape.As the couple was getting ready for work they spotted an object in the morning sky. It was going in circles, back and forth. It was also changing colors from red to blue to yellow. About a half-hour later, the man reported seeing a second object right over the city of Menomonie. It would glow bright yellow and then die down and get dim. During the dim period the man could see the outline of a triangle. The Pepin County Police Department reported that they thought the lights were the reflections from the plants being low in the sky. After getting input from Pepin County, the Dunn County Police Department agreed with this assessment. The couple who reported this incident claims that in no way could this sighting have been plants.

My route was going east on Hwy 25/70. I glanced down at my clock and it said exactly 10:30pm (est) when an older model four door car passed me on the left.  Right after he passed me, my attention was drawn to a bright planet in the upper right hand side of my vision.  I also noticed a larger orangish light about three inches to the lower left of the planet.  I wasn&apos;t sure if it was moving at first, but as I slowed down to get a better look, it sped up. It was moving to the left at the same speed as an airplane would.  I pulled over to make sure it was blinking like an airplane, but it wasn&apos;t. Before pulling over, I passed three separate parked cars, that had pulled over,  each about 1/10 of a mile apart.  Out of each of the cars there were some witnesses looking and pointing towards the object. I pulled over into a gravel lot and rolled down my window.  As I began watching it again, two lights broke away, in opposite directions.  One was red, the other was blue. The object was about the size of a dime, then shot off in opposite directions.

I do not know the time to the exact minute, but the program I was watching on TV was about half way into the 1st half-hour segment when I went outside to see what our dog was barking for. It was then that I saw the event. Measurement by protractor revealed the event to have been centered about 25-30 degrees above the western horizon in azimuth, and compass measurement revealed its heading to be 320 to 325 degrees magnetic. The total event lasted no more than 4 seconds. Because of the position of some tree branches, I was able to make these measurements to plus or minus 2.5  degrees of accuracy.

I was looking between two very tall cedar trees at the stars when I observed a glowing, greenish object moving steadily from approximately the Southeastern horizon to the Northwestern horizon.  I may very well have my directions a bit off center but I immediately thought that it was not a comet or meteorite because it was moving perfectly horizontally and not in a downward manner like an object entering the atmosphere.  It was definately not a private or commercial jet landing at Paine field and the object did not appear to be a missile because at an arms length of distance between thumb and forefinger, it measured at about8-10 millimeters in circumference.  I couldn&apos;t tell you how fast it was moving but it would be similar to watching a vehicle at maybe 20-25 miles an hour pass by you.  It was completely silent and a discernable glowing, greenish tail followed it.  I then went inside looking for the hotline number but couldn&apos;t find it so I decided to wait until I came to work tonight.  Then, at approximately 22:33 on the same night, I heard the most awful noise RESONATE from the forrested area behind our building.  It sounded like a cross between a coyote and a cow.  I&apos;m not trying to speculate at any animal mutilations, but I began to freak out at that moment and brought my cats inside.  These howl-like noises continued for about six minutes at an interval of about a sound every thirty seconds, becoming more frequent towards the end.  Nothing else happened after that and the two incidents may or may not be related but on a side note, I work on the waterfront in downtown Seattle and have observed some interesting things floating about in the sky.  I listen to Art Bell on occasions when I can and I know that there are numerous sightings these days, so I hope this is useful information to you.

The object continued to travel east over the high desert towards the direction of Las Vegas.  He decided to try and follow it in his car to see if he could get a closer look but lost the object after about 10-15 minutes.  He said the object just disappeared.  *(We are fairly certain that this is the same object reported by the other witness in Highland a few minutes earlier who had sighted it from the south side of the SB Mountains)*NUFORC Note:  Thank you, Cinde.))", "Over a period of 1.5 hours last night, we watched a total of 8 separate star-type lights in the northeast and southwest areas of our sky.  Each &quot;light&quot; was an object that seemed to strobe-first white, then red, then a green light.  They appeared in the sky one by one and had moved only fractionally during the hour and a half, in a north to south direction, perpendicular to the stars and satellites in the night sky.At midnight, my husband and I went out onto our deck as we do most nights. Our deck overlooks the city of Beckley and on out to the Raleigh County Airport at Grandview. In the northeastern sky, just above the trees, we noticed one &quot;star&quot; appeared to be blinking. My husband went back inside for the binoculars and amazingly, the &quot;star&quot; was a revolving light- first white, then green, then red, and was unmoving. We watched for about 30 minutes before noticing a smaller, but identical light farther to the east, again unmoving.  We began scanning the sky and found 3 more between lights A and B, as well as 2 lights to our southwest, that were blinking only the green and white light.   After about 1 and a half hours, the lights were obviously moving SLOWLY  perpendicular to the stars&apos; movement in the sky, and another red, green and white light appeared behind the original light.  There were no sounds and the airplanes that flew in the night appeared oblivious to the lights, as if ! the lights were above the planes, but still in our atmosphere. A little after 1:30 am, my husband and I were suffering from eye strain and a long day.  When we left the deck, the objects were still in the sky.

Similar event.))", "saw object flash and disappear on first night and on the next morning 3 objects appeared to come together in a triangle formation.On August 9th, Me and two of my friends went on a camping trip to the Upper Penninsula of Michigan.  We originally were planning on going to Porcupine Mountain State Park to check out the eclipse, but due to the length of the trip we decided to cut it short and stop in Munising which is located in the upper middle portion of the UP.  We found a good isolated spot in the Hiawatha National Forest to set camp.  The sight was right next to a small lake called Hovey Lake.  On the second night at about 10:30 I went to the lake to see if I could spot any falling meteorites(there was supposed to be meteor showers visible for two weeks during that period).  When I looked into the sky I noticed a flash in the sky so I waited to see if it would do it again.  Sure enough it happened again, but this time I managed to spot its location and called my two friends over.  Of what I observed the flash was coming from this object that would glow very brightly and then fade out.  The object was moving from Northeast to Southwest, but did not maintain a straight path( it reminded me of a tadpole swimming in water).  It looked like a star but every time it would speed up it would start to glow bright orange and expand immensly(like when metal becomes so hot it glows), and would change direction randomly.  This continued &apos;till about 11:00 PM, then it disappeared out of sight.  The next morning at about 4:30 we all woke up and went to a spot that we picked out earlier to see the eclipse.  (Little did we know that from our position on the globe it wasn&apos;t even possible to see the eclipse).  We picked a beach in town along the shore of Lake Superior so we could get a good view of the Sun as it rose over the horizon.  While the three of us were lying there on the beach I noticed the strange object from earlier that night was back in sight and up to its same tricks.  It continued to fly high over Lake Superior when it started to go berzerk!  The object started to zig-zag and do crazy loops as if the pilot didn&apos;t know how to fly the! damn th ing!  This continued for about 5-10 minutes before two more similiar objects came from the same northwesterly direction and continued until they both stopped and formed a triangle with the other one over Lake Superior. The triangle formation that they formed was huge given how high they were. They must have been about 50-60,000 ft. high.  They stayed in that triangle formation for about 30 minutes; it was almost like they were waiting for something cosmic to happen.  Eventually as the Sun rose and the clouds got thicker the three UFO&apos;s begain to fade away.  I was with my friend and his girlfriend, we both are currently enrolled at Central Michigan University and before this event I always considered him a Pessimist or skeptic when it comes to UFO&apos;s.  He changed his tune real quick after this occurance.  Wether it was visitors from space or secret government projects, we couldn&apos;t explain it. WE JUST KNOW WHAT WE SAW.", "Rural mountain area. Tree covered hill. 1860&apos; MSL. I awoke to see a bright white light approx 1,500&apos; so east of my camper. The circular object resembled a satellite dish antenna. It was illuminated and, illuminating. It was rising very slowly.The above description was seen through 10x50 binoculars. The object was rising slowly and, shortly after focusing on it, began to descend. It began to rise again, then descended below the tree tops. The object never rose more than what I believed to be more than half way above the trees. I was able to see three full panels and,one  partial panel on either side of the three full ones. The trees obscured the lower half. On the second descent into the trees, the light disappeared. In the morning light, I went to where I believed the source of the light was located. There was no road or, trail suitable for positioning that object in the trees by using ground equipment, in my opinion The panels I speak of were white and, appeared to be illuminating.They also appeared to be illuminated.Try to imagine a TV satellite dish approx. 15 to 20 ft in dia. projecting half way above tall tree tops bathed in white light. My interest is in knowing if anyone has seen anything similar.", "We spotted a craft moving VERY slowly and in complete silence approximately 200ft above us shining lights all about as if searching.My friend and I were removing deer from my fathers farm that were destroying crops on that summer night. The area is very rural all of the surrounding land was owned by International paper company (logging). We spotted the craft above us as we slowly drove down the road with our lights off it was moving on a flight path that followed the road  it seemed. It was approximately 200 feet off of the ground moving VERY slowly and silently. It had two light beams that were shining in all directions in a sweeping motion. One light source on each side of the front or cockpit area of the craft. The beams swiveled and moved much like a chameleons eyes do in their sockets. The lights were searching the ground at times and out into the air around the craft at times. The craft banked very slowly toward the north (it was traveling east) tilting at an extreme angle while continuing to search with the lights. It went out of view for a few moments then returned to the same area.On the second period of observation the craft gained altitude steadily then shot off towards the southwest without a sound.The whole scene lasted around 18 minutes, with a total of 10 minutes of actually observing the craft. Some type of military craft on training from seymour johnson or camp lejune ? Or extra terrestrial ?", "Moving northwest to southeast, silently moving triangle shape. Blocked stars from view as if it were a triangular shadow moving across the sky.  There was a grayish blue haze along the leading edge of the object.Standing outside my home, facing northwest, I was looking toward the west when I noted motion in the sky.  As we live near an airport, I looked for any lighting or markings.  All I could see was a shadow moving NW to SE and as it cleared the stars, I could make out it&apos;s triangular shape. I also noted that there was a slight bluish gray outline of the leading edge, quite possibly from the city lights. I noted no engine noise, nor could I see any other remarkable traits of the object.  It moved in a straight line towards town.  I then ran to the SSW side of my home to see if I could get a better view of the object from the glow of the city lights.  I could no longer see the object.

Suspected meteor however it&apos;s trajectory was North to south.At 7:02 am I was traveling on my way home on S Loop 289 heading east when I suddenly saw a bright light approximately the intensity of Landing lights on an aircraft. The light was at a 30 degree inclination, traveling North to south very quickly, covering a distance of 5 inches on my windshield in 1 second. It left no contrail, no exhaust trail or any heat variances visible against the sky which was beginning to light up due to the rising sun (not visible yet). The western sky was still a very dark blue/black. The object left a light trail, such as seen on meteors entering the atmosphere and disappeared as suddenly as it appeared which is why I suspect it is a meteor. However it was very bright for your usual meteors and left no trail in the sky whatsoever. Again there was a north south heading as well.", "I saw what I intially thought to be a helium baloon rise up in a gradual fashion and hover at about 3-5000ft,it appeared to change shape at least 2 times and eventually presented what appeared to be light on  wing shaped projectionsI was sitting out side watching mu kids play.  I was sitting on my deck which faces north.  I was watching the air traffic pattern for planes taking off at Kansas City International Airport.  My 4 yr old was in my lap and we had just been discussing birds.  He pointed at a black object which appeared to be floating upward from my left(wsw). It ascended like a baloon which is what I first thought it to be.  However I noticed what appeared to be several shape changes,including yhe final form which looked like an egg with short stubby wings. It rose to roughly 3-5000ft and appeared to hover.  I expected &quot;the balloon &quot; to either be blown further away by upper atmosphere winds or to eventually rise high enough to not be seen by the naked eye.  Upper level clouds came in and eventually obscured my vision.  I did not have my Binoculars much to my disappointment.  I estimate that the thing travelled a minimum of about 3 miles to the north,based on the guess that it was a balloon.  However balloons don&apos;t maintain position against upper air currents.  It may have been larger, so my estimation of distance would obviously be off.  Aircraft taking off from KCI were taking off southbound.  At least 3 took off and went east. They did not pass close enough for me to compare in size.", "An extremely large,bluish white fireball fell from the sky at an 75 to 80 degree angle.

I viewed the object for 2 to seconds and it was so bright and large that I could see the white hot fire on this object. It was even bright enough to light up a very long trail of smoke that it was emmiting as it fell. After about 2 to 3 seconds, the object disappeared without a trace and I could no longer see the smoke trail that it left. If you are looking at the head of a pushpin held at arms length, that was the approx. size of the object.

A minute before, I had just seen a normal meteorite in that direction of the sky so now we were both looking to the east hoping to see another one.  Suddenly a triangular formation of about 10 reddish, glowing lights appeared or &quot;came on&quot; and flew completely silently overhead from south to north.  They were in such perfect formation that it seemed to be a single craft except for the fact that at one moment several of the lights split quickly apart from the formation then just as quickly reformed and held perfect formation for the remainder of the sighting.  Another odd thing was that I could see through or in-between the lights but there appeared to be a shimmering quality to this space between the lights, like looking through water. Each individual light seemed to be diamond in shape and had a light quality similar to a glowing coal.  Not knowing what I was looking at, it was hard to judge the altitude of the object but if I had to guess, I would say it was at least twice as large as a 747 and about 3000 ft altitude.

It was seemingly stationary. I saw it for about 30 seconds, but briefly had to keep watching the roadway as well.  Remarkably noticeable, solid-appearing, sharply-outlined and apparently reflecting the sun&apos;s rays. The almost flourescent (day-glo) orange, oblong &quot;appendage&quot; underneath on its left side (or north side) was tight to the body of the object--not loose, or hanging.  I noticed no contrail, movement of any kind, nor saw the apparently reflective, metallic shine change or shift.

It was a clear night and where I was in in the flight path for airplanes from Little Rock to Memphis. I am an avid airplane fan and I have observed many jets but this object was moving way to fast for a plane and had no visible navigation lights. It was emmiting an orange glow from the back which made the contrail more visible. I couldn&apos;t determine a shape from the angle I was from it but I could make out a large form. I thought it might be a fighter aircraft with it&apos;s afterburners on but it was to large to be that high up and still be seen. The contrail was also very wide.

At first, it looked a bit bigger than the largest star in the sky.  As it traveled, it got somewhat larger.  Trailing behind it was a smaller bright white light which looked like a star at first, but it was travelling at the exact same speed and exatly the same length behind the red ball of light throughout our sighting.

The moon was out and almost full. Above these two were a circle of approximately 10-12 smaller lights creating a semi-circle above and then appox 4-5 more to the north creating a &quot;tail.&quot;  There was a lot of interactive light activity going back and forth between all of the lights, creating what appeared to be lines of light.  There was also unusual movement of some of the lights (up, down, left, right) which confirmed to me that these were not airplanes, satellites or the Russian Muir Station which was in the night sky.  I went in the house to find binoculars and when I came out, the two main lights dropped behind the mountains at amazing speed and simultaneously.  The remaining lights also dropped behind the mts.  Then a massive group of lights rose up above the mts in a horizontal oval shape.  At this point, my daughter who&apos;s 6 and my husband came home from their evening walk.  I pointed out the cluster of lights and they witnessed the remainder of what I describe.  The cluster of lights looked like a galaxy, but very organized.  Occasionally a light would blink or twinkle.  The mass of lights then proceeded to move to the south in a collective, organized manner.  They moved faster than the rotation of the earth.  They then stopped.  They dropped below the mountains and we could barely see the glow of the lights on the horizon.  Then two bright lights moved above the horizon and stayed for a bit.  Then dropped back below the horizon.  The collective group then all rose above the horizon and created a side portrait of a jet airplane (tail, body and cockpit).  The mass of lights stayed there for a few minutes then dropped below the horizon.  They then fazed in and out, up and down from the horizon until they finally disappeared completely below the horizon.  The evening was mostly clear with a few scattered clouds.

We were truly amazed as they 2 objects displayed some kind of unstable motion while hovering. They were clearly not balloons or airplanes. They disappeared into a cloud 15 minutes later. The really weird part is that what appeared to be a military style small jet, with 2 engines on the body between wings and tail appeared and circled the area 2 times and then in the reverse direction. My wife also witnessed the jet and it appeared that they either were observing or trying to locate the 2 objects that we saw.", "Traveling W to pick up son from school.  Saw extraordinarily bright orb slowly traveling N in straight line. Size was about diameter of pencil eraser.  Sky mostly clear w/few small clouds.  Object disappeared behind tiny cloud just big enough to cover object.  Object never reappeared.Was traveling due West at 3:25 PM to pick up child from school.  Saw extraordinarily bright orb traveling slowly due North in straight line.  This is the second time I&apos;ve seen this phenomenom (the first time was with my son and husband, also during daylite hours).  Like the first time I saw it, I strained to see if I could determine a form or origin of the object.  Have not seen as bright of object in daytime sky like this.  Was defininately not a plane or helicopter.  Thought maybe could be a reflection of some type but the reflection would not have disappeared behind a cloud.  The first time this object was observed, my whole family watched.  It was there one moment and gone the next.  Wasn&apos;t like we saw it fly off rapidly -- it just disappeared.  Today, the object went behind a cloud and just never reappeared.  Almost had a wreck on two-lane country road trying to relocate the object.", "Bright FireballLooking out in the south by southwest direction, we saw a very bright fireball falling towards the horizon.  It was light blue and left a glowing trail which lasted for about 3 minutes.  We were between I-43 and Alverno on county CE", "Unable to sleep, looking out window, became aware of something coming over top of building, lit from beneath, almost luminescent. Slowly passed over,making no sound what-so-ever even though it appeared to be very low, then sped up and streaked away. Called husband in time for him to see only the disappearing lights...he saw red and white, though I only saw white as it was over us,as it left.My husband was ((title deleted)) of the ((enterprise name deleted)) Savannah and we lived on the top floor of the hotel with windows facing to the north giving long unbroken views across the marsh to South Carolina. It was about 5:30 in the morning and still fully dark.  I had an extremely painful toe which was keeping me awake. I&apos;d just gotten up to doctor it and returned to bed, lying on my side facing the window with foot hanging off bed to let medication dry. In this position I suddenly became aware of the fact that something was beginning to pass over the hotel from south to north.  At first I saw just the lip, then more and more of it, almost floating slowly northward. It was round and lit from beneath or within with white lights, not uniform in brightness, but some spots brighter than others and I recall thinking it looked like a tentacle-less jelly fish...why?  I guess because it was sort of translucent appearing. That&apos;s the best way I can describe it.  It didn&apos;t make a sound though was no more than a couple hundred yards over the hotel. I jumped out of bed, speechless and staring in awe.  When I found my voice called my husband and the urgency in my voice bolted him upright so he was beside me instantly at the window.  However in that brief period, the slow, leisurely speed it had had vanished and it absolutely streaked away so that in the space of just a couple of seconds, it was between 3 and 5 miles off.  Thus, my husband only was able to see it disappearing in the distance and it was far enough then that he saw only red and white lights disappearing, but could not make out the shape.  (I&apos;d seen only white). It was such an unbelievable sight and I am so thankful he saw it as well, otherwise I&apos;d be doubting myself. Made one call, very sheepishly to Savannah police who had had no other reports.  Made another call to a local tv station to see if they had had any. They wondered if I&apos;d mind appearing on camera as a human interest story but in no way would I ever have considered it. It&apos;s almost an embarrassment because most people don&apos;t believe in UFO&apos;s.  Aside from these 2 phone calls, I&apos;ve told only my 2 children and my two brothers.  This just isn&apos;t something you can talk about to friends or casual acquaintances without them worrying about your stability!!

I looked around and saw in the north east a hovering triangle object.  It&apos;s had bright lights coming from it. They would get bright and dimmer.  During this time 8-12 Jets flew in the approximate area of the object.  The object would move in circular and figure eight moves, while bobbing in the sky. It eventually moved farther away in the sky untill it was just one light in the sky.The object was close enough when I first saw it to see some detail.  It had a triagle shape. Lights came from the three angles of it&apos;s triangle shape.  The light it omitted was white like a star, however at the angles of the object the light was a golden yellow color.  The object kept moving away from me in a north east direction in the sky.  While hovering away it would move in circles and figure eight motions.  While moving in these motions it would bob up and down quickly.  A couple of jets were flying around it.  Later many more jets flew over the area in the sky.  The came from the east and west.  The first few jets banked around the object.  The rest flew straight accross the sky. From the east and west.  The last jet flew high above the object.  The jets lasted about half a hour.  Then they left.  You could hear them and see their lights flashing on and off.  When the object and the jets were in the sky together they seemed to dance all around the sky. We rarely hear or see more than one jet at night.  To see that many in a half hour was bizzare.  I also saw little dots moving fast around the sky of the object. During this hour I saw two shooting stars or what I believed to be shooting stars.  One went across the whole eastern sky, while the other one went across the western sky.

We have a video tape with a duration of more than one hour.  It was shot with a Sony 8mm CCD-Trv 46 with Night Shot on. This was shot hand held and although there is a lot of footage, much is out of focus or in process of zooming. The video is one uninterrupted take with the cameraman trying to follow the movement and the camera trying to auto focus. At times the objct appears to be a sphere that is transmitting various colors of light and is more organic in nature than metallic.  Other times it appears to have a triangular shape, but it is difficult to say because it is transmitting so much light. At times the light eminating from the object was so bright that it illiminated the mountain top. At a point in time approximately 45 minutes into the take the viewers saw a dark smaller object rise from the mountain top and enter the bottom of the glowing sphere.  Upon entering the sphere seemed brightened intensely.", "During lightning storm and early morning hours (still dark)an object with lights stayed motionless in the same area.At around 5:00 AM in the morning myself and a neighbor were outside talking of the unusual electrical storm and noticed an object which at first we thought was an airplane but noticed that it was not moving. We could not see the shape of the object for two reasons. 1)it was still dark outside, 2)it had lights which was bright enough to mask any shape. At first glance it appeared to be an airplane as far as the front lights were same as you see from an aircraft at night. We noticed the object was not moving and made no sound as a helicoper may have made so we came to the conclusion that this object was not an airplane nor a helicoper. It stayed in one place with the airplane like headlights and no other lights visible. The object appeared to be roundish although a definite shape was not apparent and we could not see any extensions, such as wings etc. After about 30 minutes or so we had to leave for work and was unable to continue our observations.

After the observation described above I have no explanation as to what it could have been but I do know that what we saw was clearly a craft and not a conventional airplane of any type I have seen in my lifetime. Also it was close enough that it was obviously not a star and did not move like one of our satellites would.Thanks!

Even though it was so bright, it didn&apos;t hurt my eyes to look at it.At about midnight on Saturday, 6/21/97, I was turning from Route 120 south onto O&apos;Plaine Road.  It was a nice, warm summer night with just a few wispy clouds and the full moon in the eastern sky.  I was looking southwest and I saw a bright white light bouncing above the treetops. I turned south onto O&apos;Plaine Road and as I drove I could just barely see the light through the trees. I turned west onto Route 137 to go to Old St. Mary&apos;s Road.  When I turned south onto Old St. Mary&apos;s Road I could clearly see that the UFO was a disc shaped object glowing with a very bright, white light.  It was the brightest and softest light I have ever seen.  Even thought it was so bright, it didn&apos;t hurt my eyes to look at it.  The light illumi- nated the trees all around it. The disc was hovering over a house on the west side of Old St. Mary&apos;s Road about a half mile south of Route 137.  When I was about a quarter mile from the disc it moved to hover over the center of the road directly ahead of me for a few seconds.  But, it didn&apos;t make a straight line to the road.  The disc made a ninety degree angle to the south and then to the center of the road.  Then it made another 90 degree angle and hovered over the left side of the road.  After a few seconds it made another 90 degree angle and returned to it&apos;s position over the house. By this time I was driving very slowly past the house and I looked up through my windshield at the disc.  I could now see that there was a vapor or haze emanating from the outermost edges of the disc.  I also noticed that there was no sound coming from the disc but I could hear nature sounds and the sound of my car.  I passed the house and drove around a curve.  At this point I couldn&apos;t see the disc or the light anymore.  I had some important things to do at home the next day or I would have stopped and looked at the disc more.  All in all, it was a very exciting and thriling sighting.", "It Looked Like A star and then I seen three lights that formed a triangle and i told my brother, and cousion and they seen it to ,we stoped and looked at it.

I verified that I checked out a movie on that day recently. I thought the flash was a helicopter doing a search, which was odd in itself.I had checked out the movie &quot;You&apos;ve Got Mail&quot; on August 15 and started to watch it around 10-10:30 PM. I was well into a fourth or half of the movie (around 10-11 PM), when I saw a bright flash through my 2 skylights in my home.The skylights are facing West. I thought it was a helicopter flying around at night doing a search. The bright flash startled me that I jumped from my couch. As I looked through the clear skylights, I could see the clouds very well-defined in the sky. I then realized that it couldn&apos;t have been a helicopter because it does not that the capability to illuminate the sky and I didn&apos;t hear the loud,annoying noise of a helicopter. After looking through the skylights at the clouds, I ran into my bedroom and tried to wake my husband to tell him what I&apos;ve seen. He was too sleepy to get up and check. I looked out and the night was calm and quiet. I live in a quiet, bedroom community south of Albuquerque, NM (approx. 15 minutes South of Albuquerque). I&apos;m reporting this now because a week ago, the local AM news station on the radio (770 KKOB) was running &quot;The Best of Art Bell&quot; at midnight, when I heard about the 3 second illumination of the night sky. At first, I didn&apos;t think anything of it and was just interested. Then they mentioned that this illumination happened around mid-August. August 17 is my annivesary and I remember I checked out &quot;You&apos;ve Got Mail&quot; a few days prior. For some reason, the date of August 18th stuck in my head as being the", "A vehicle of some sort appeared to be over the Snohomish/Arlington area that pulsed between a red and white light. There were also one or two other aircraft in the event.While driving North on highway 9 in Snohomish we spotted a light in the night sky somwhere I believe to be over Arlington or the Sound (hard to tell at night). The light pulsed between red and white in a cycle of about twice every second (two red and two white every second). The light also appeared to be centralized, as in it was deffinately not on a wing-tip, or fin. This was also the only light on the object. There was also at leaste one other vehicle in the vicinity, and possibly two. The primary object maintained a rather steady corse, changing direction about once every minute. The secondary vehicle(s) appeared to be following or chasing the primary object, but not maintaining as steady of a corse. The other vehicles had no lights on them except for what appeared to be an engine flame (white). I belive that the aircraft in pursuite were military because one of the engines appeared to fire an afterburner twice during the time that we could maintain visual contact with the objects. All objects appeared to be Northbound and about 10,000 to 20,000 feet up, although this is just a guess.", "Stationary orange ball of light just above horizon:  Southeast Medina County, Ohio. Aprx 4:30am EDT.  Stargazing several miles west of Wadsworth, OH.I&apos;ve read and heard about sightings for years, and now, a first for me, I can&apos;t say it was an &apos;IFO&apos;, so that leaves this as a &apos;UFO&apos; for me. I was stargazing with my friend, early Wednesday morning, Sep 1st.

At first, I thought it might be an airplane or helicopter &apos;headlight&apos;. But orange?  Quickly, I grabbed and aimed the telescope at the object, which appeared not to be moving. Looking into the eyepiece revealed 2 orange balls of light, one slightly larger than the other. Then all of a sudden, while I&apos;m looking at these lights through the telescope, they &apos;turn off&apos;!  It&apos;s gone.  There&apos;s nothing there.

It was something that I will never forget. I literally saw all the neighbors pointing in the sky saying,&quot;what the hell is that.&quot; My father had seen it on 3 seperate occasions but he does not like to talk about it.

At first I thought it was venus, then as I focused in on it I realized that it was much larger than venus, and much closer. As I focused on it, it quickly, faster than an airplane could, turned to the southeast, and as it did so, it&apos;s size became like a pin point.

While traveling down the highway she said &quot;wow the moon is bright tonight&quot; As they got closer the light she soon relized it was not the moon and thought maybe it was a chopper.  Soon they got close enough to relize that it was not a chopper but some kind of triangular craft with 3 lights on each corner and a red light in the center.  This craft was no more than 100-300 feet off the ground and she said the lights were moving all over the ground as if searching for something.  This craft was just above them and to the left over a field.  They could see it clearly above them because he had T-Tops of his vehicle.  She was screaming to drive faster because she knew it was nothing she had ever seen before.  It had no sound and she side it was huge like size of a football field.  When she got home she told knowone until the next day.  She thought about calling the police but did not.  She grew up in a strict Baptist home and these such things just dont happen.  Until that moment...  I have always believed her becuase she is my cousin #1 and she had no reason to lie about it..  I checked on materials on the subject and found that many people thought the moon was bright on first observations of a UFO.  She also spoke to my uncle who was a pilot with a major airline.  He really had nothing to say about it..but a few weeks later unsolved mysteries ran a show about german police officers that tracted a craft across there city.  They had it documented on tape there conversations between all officers.  The craft they showed on the TV show is exactly what she said she had seen.", "We just saw a Bright Ball flying below the clouds...if it was an airplane we would hear it...(we are pilots)...it had a High Airspeed higher than a Fighter Jet...We just don&apos;t know what it was..We where standing at the Road...and we started watching a thunter storm in Turkey.

Then standing outside the back of my work I saw this oval type ball of different colored light floating in the air. You could see it pulsating. I stood there and watched it for at least 10 minutes, and then it faded away to the size and brightness of a faint star, and it seemed to glide away slowly. I waited there for 5 minuites and saw the same exact pattern in the same exact place occur at least 9 times after that. Then it just stopped and I haven&apos;t seen anything since.", "Multiple encounters over approximately 50 mile radius.Begining in the spring of 1994 I was made aware of three specific areas in Iron County Michigan that were intense UFO encounter sites. The first encounter was at Glidden Lake several miles south of Crystal falls.  While sitting in a truck by the lake at approximately 21:00, a green triangular object lifted over the tree line on the oposite side of the lake.  I would approximate this object to be 30-35 feet in length, and 15 feet at the widest point in the rear.  The object had a very luminecent property, but was not like any other light that I could identify. By the time the object was approximately 200 feet in the air, a second object was seen coming from the horizon.  This second object was of a very similar shape and size, but was red in color.  The first object began to race towards my general direction and in less than a second had gained several hundred feet in altitude and was now positioned over myself and the other person viewing the event.  I got out of the truck to watch the object.  The second object, the red one, was now pursuing the first.  There seemed to be a buzzing sound coming from the second object and the radio in the truck became very distorted sounding.  two flashes of light came from the front of the red object, and the green object then exploded.  The explosion was close enough where it should have been heard, but it made no sound.  Also, when it did explode, it did not look so much like fire works or a gas explosion as it simply became many small fragments of light then disappeared.  The red object then shot directly upward and faded into the night sky. My companion seemed to be unamazed by the events.  She then explained that this type of thing had been happening for approximately 3 months already.  I had been unaware of this due to the fact that I had been out of the country for 10 months. Several other minor sitings at this location were seen over the next few months.  Then, in late July of 1994, while at a local ski hill in Crystal falls at approximately 18:00, a friend whom I will reffer to as &quot;Jim&quot; accompanied me to watching the sunset.  While we talked and waited for the next few hours, we saw approximately 9 of these same triangular shaped objects.  They grouped themselves into several airial formations, and seemed to repeat an airial acrobatics routine.  Jim and I watched them as they came and went over the horizon for approximately 4 hours.  After dark the objects returned one by one.  Each one forming a point in a series of three triangles.  The triangles then merged to form a shape like this: * * * * * * * *   * There they stayed for approximately 10 minutes.  They then formed a straigh line and travelled at a very high speed to the south and disappeared over the horizon. Several months went by before there was another sighting.  It was approximately the end of September.  This time it was in a feild almost directly underneath where the objects had come from when Jim and I had seen the sighting at the ski hill.  Myself and several friends were approximately 50 to 75 feet away from a row of trees that seperated two feilds.  On the opposite side of these trees, a slight hum was heard.  Then, as the hum quieted, the outline of a large triangular object could be seen.  The lower side of the object began to glow green and it lifted off the ground.  The object then left the area at a high rate of speed again leaving in a southerly direction. A few minor sightings were seen at both locations over the next 6 months, but nothing extraordinary as far as movement or paterns.  As the end of March drew close, the flight paterns of pyramids and now circles became very common. Approximately one year after the first sighting, yet another event happened that took my by surprise.  While out driving just north of town, I saw a green glow over the trees.  I immediately recognized the glow to be one of these objects.  I began to try and follow it by driving down old side roads and loging trails.  I could not seem to catch up to the object, and soon gave up.  When I decided to turn around and go back to the main road, I noticed the glow directly behind me.  I drove a bit faster, and it continued to follow me.  I came to an old gravel pit that was approximately 1/2 mile off the main road.  I parked on one side of the pit and the object came to a halt on the opposite side.  It then moved directly upwards, and I then noticed that there were 4 more craft hovering several hundred feet over the gravel pit.  When the object joined the others, they formed a &quot;V&quot; and left the area heading once again south. I had no more encounters over the next 9-10 months.  Then, in the winter of 1995/96, I visited a gravel pit just outside of Iron Mountain Michigan, which is to the south of Crystal Falls.  The pit is approximately the same size and shape as the one where I had my last encounter.  Within minutes of arriving at the pit, I was witness to yet another sky duel of one red and one green craft.  The same radio distortions happened, but this time the flashes came from the green craft.  The red craft began glowing several different colors.  One of the back corners of it changed from yellow to orange and back to yellow several times before it spiraled upward in a very awkward motion.  The green craft then vanished.  It didn&apos;t seem to have gone anywhere, but simply shut off it&apos;s light and disappeared into the darkness of the sky. I have since moved to the Detroit area of Michigan, and have since had no encounters with the craft. The craft never frightened me, but always excited me and made me feel like a little child seeing something spectacular for the first time.", "My friends and i witnessed 1 triangle shaped craft and two bright smaller shaped craft darting across our feild of view in our yard near a major expressway.My friends and i were just hanging around our yard at around 10:30p.m., i happened to mention to what i saw two nights before this incident. Since they knew i liked science-fiction, they immediately thought i was pulling their leg. My younger friend (of the two) was very reluctant to believe, but i stressed very strongly at what i saw was real. At that time we all started looking toward the northern sky, about 5 minutes later my younger friend saw what he believed to a low flying helecopter. Since we lived about 4 blocks away from the nearest hospital, we just thought a lifecare helecopter was getting ready to land. We watched the lights for about 10 mins. but it never got close to here the turbine engines or the hum or rumble of a approaching aircraft. That`s when we all agreed that we were witnessing a ufo, because this object never got close to determine what it was. What we saw was a bright light moving slowly at first then getting faster as it went in a southernly direction. We were pretty excited at what saw that at that time i turned to my left facing west to see the same object i reported before. I quickly told the others to look in my direction to see what i was seeing. This shape(triangle with lights) was coming very fast from the western sky. Quickly, my younger friend darted inside the house.My other friend and i cotinued our observation of the two or more lights and the triangle one for about an hour. This happened near a major highway that we lived near.

I was with the 552nd Air Police Squadron and on the evening of 7/4/1968, I was guarding the Falmouth Gate-one of the three perimeter gates.  That evening was uneventful until ~2100 hours.I received an urgent phone call from my Sergeant, who ordered me to close the Falmouth Gate, adding that we had been placed on Full Base Alert! After approximately 1 hour, he called back to say that the Alert was over and to re-opened the Gate.  Later,the SGT came out and informed me that there had been an actual UFO hovering over our underground missile site; that our F-4 jets had scrambled and were on an intercept course. The intruder then initiated a 360`maneuver, accelerated at an unimaginable speed and was gone.((END))", "Sitting on couch watching TV and saw out my window a large &apos;falling star&apos; entering from the west and falling earthward.", "A friend and I witnessed a pulsating, intensely bright, fireball near I-25 between Colorado Springs and Castle Rock. The fireball broke apart into &quot;three, flaming-orange chunks&quot; northeast of our position on I-25.A friend and I were returning from Denver to Colorado Springs after attending the Colorado Avalanche vs. Ottawa Senators game. We were driving on I-25, headed South. The night was relatively clear and brisk. The temperature was about 20 deg F and there was fairly extensive snow cover along the interstate. I also believe the moon was prominent on this night because it was unusually light outside for the hour. My friend and I were talking and listening to the radio when, all of a sudden, all hell broke loose. The ENTIRE sky, from the Front Range to the eastern horizon, erupted with a pulsating, incredibly bright, white light.  Due to the steep angle at which the object approached us, its speed, and it&apos;s approximately S-SW to N-NE flight path (which roughly paralleled our path on I-25), we were unable to observe it directly. In other words, the roof of our vehicle was in the way of our view. However, as the object travelled NE and neared the ground, it came into view out the drivers side window. We then observed the object break apart into 3, flaming-orange chunks to our NE just beyond a series of bluffs (about 5 miles away I would guess), at which point it disappeared. We heard no sound during this event, probably because of engine/road noise and because the car stereo was on. I hate to say this, but my absolute, first thought when I saw the pulsing light was that we were being abducted or attacked by a UFO. My second thought was that there was no way it was lightening (too cold, wrong time of year, clear skies, no storms around, etc, etc.). My third thought was &quot;someone get this damned roof out of my way so I can see what the hell is going on!&quot;. And then, I finally realized that it must have been a meteorite which broke apart into at least 3 large pieces. Needless to say, this event was all my friend and I talked about the rest of the way back to Colorado Springs. Once we got to town, we started hearing radio reports regarding what we had witnessed. Apparently, it was a meteorite, complete with sonic bo! om heard all along the Front Range. Regardless of what it was, I will never forget that night and feel privileged to have witnessed (indeed, survived) it from such close proximity.", "peter on fri. sept 10 at exactly 9:50pm while outside looking to the south i observed what appeared to be a formation of spot lights running clock-wise/counter clock-wise with each other after carefully watching these objects i realized that there was no pattern they were following,i also realized that these were not spotlights lighting up the clouds from below but that they were illuminating the clouds from above . these objects were playing a game of tag chasing each other stopping reversing directions hovering moving to the center allowing the others to race in circles before returning to the group at times while this was happening 1 or more of the objects would take off at extremly high rates of speed in any direction n/e/s/w/ and then return to the formation seconds later. there was quite alot of airplane traffic in the area at the time i saw 4planes flying directly at them and i observed them for over 15min and they were still there when i left for work at 22:10  any other reports from toronto tonight  i`ve never seen anything like this and i`ve watched the skies for years. thank-you for your time  mr.davenport god bless art bell and hope i helped out in one way or another .peace.contact me ((personal data deleted))", "orange fireball w/short tailsighted at 18:55,when driving in traffic,pulled off road and took video of sighting lasting 5min 40secs of object going from from east to west, bright orange in color, steady speed and direction with a short split-tail.(did not leave any trail at all).", "Very very large triangular object outlined with lights appearing from the west, stopping briefly, then disappearing in the east at a very high rate of speed.At 7:30pm (dusk) my two children aged 5 and 10 were playing in the back yard.

No sound was heard. Shortly after the craft disappeared past the eastern tree line, both boys described a very bright red light beam apparently coming up from the ground in the north, then falling back down to the ground. From the vantage point that they took me to, I did see a jet passing overhead, and asked them if that was what they saw. They both immediately insisted that that was too small, and spread their arms apart wide to show me how big the object that they saw had been. I asked both boys, who have never made up stories before, to come inside and draw pictures of what they saw. I sent both boys to separate bedrooms to make a picture and them bring them to me separately. Both boy&apos;s drew the same picture without collaborating.

I was sitting in my office at my residence, using the Internet, and listening to my police scanners.  The Christian County Sheriff&apos;s office dispatcher started having problems communicating with all of their patrol cars in the field.  (freq. 155.565 transmit and receive) I could hear a humming sound that was effecting the radio and I could hear the humming in my office.  I thought that we had just had a power surge that effected the town of Ozark, MO, and that is what I was hearing.  About five minutes had past and I was still hearing the humming and the dispatcher was getting frantic.  She called Radiophone Engineering, Inc. ( the people who handle radio problems ).  I was very interested about the humming so I finally walked outside my residence.  Looking to the west, I saw nothing, the sky was mostly clear but a bit overcast. As I walked down my front porch, I noticed a silver-gray disk object directly above my residence towards the southeast.  It was approx. 100 yards long and 15 feet high, it was tilted at about 25 degrees towards the earth.  I live next to the power transformers for my subdivision, and the disk just hovered approx. 250 feet above me and the power lines for at least twenty minutes.  The humming sound continued constantly.  The disk had a blue, then white, then red light coming from the bottom moving in a perfect circle.  The sheriff&apos;s dispatcher was still having problems with her radio transmissions as I continued to hear on my police scanner.  It then moved directly from the southeast to northwest of my location, along the Finley river that runs through the town and disappeared strait upward.

One block ahead, hovering over an old schoolhouse was bright lights - Red and white circling and pulsating green light on the bottom. Van would not restart. Then gradually five more crafts joined the first and they took off into clear sky in V formation. Then just vanished. Van started as soon as they took off.At 1 a.m. as my boyfriend and I were travelling home from the Falls. We were at Chateau Gai Winery and the Ford Econoline Van stalled. I immediately noticed some bright lights about 300 feet in front of us and at first commented &quot;What is a helicopter doing out here at this time of night?&quot; As I focussed more closely (my boyfriend was frantically trying to restart the van that has never stalled prior) I realized that it was disc shaped - some kind of bubble on top with white and red lights swirling around the middle. On the bottom was a pulsing green light. I was in awe and wanted to go closer. The petrified boyfriend wouldn&apos;t allow me to get out of the vehicle (held my arm tight). A moment later another object joined the first, then another, and another until there were five crafts in all hovering above this old school house. They seemed to steady themselves and then propelled into the sky in a V-formation. My boyfriend again tried to start the van - in hopes of following. It ignited immediately. But within seconds of this the crafts just vanished from sight. It was a cloudless sky - clear, crisp night with lots of stars visible.

She alerted her husband to the object and he dismissed it as an airplane.  As she watched it, it started to fade in and out.  She hollered to Mr. S. to pull over because she was convinced at that point that it was not an airplane because of its behavior and the fact that the object was perfectly round.  She saw the object disappear completely while over the mountains and searched for it in the sky through the car windows.  She then looked straight up and saw the object directly over their vehicle.  At that time Mr. S. Saw it also and they both described it as a round, very bright white light that hurt their eyes when they looked at it.  The object suddenly turned bright orange and again faded out.  They said it moved too fast to be any kind of an airplane, helicopter or anything they&apos;ve ever seen before.  Mrs. S. said the sighting left her feeling very disturbed and she felt as if some sort of communication may have taken place between herself and the object while it was overhead.

As we were passing the school heading down Crumpton South, I noticed what appeared to be a planet sized orange/red object in the sky.  It was at about 40 degrees above the horizon (facing south/southwest). At first I thought it was mars or mercury, but it seemed to big to be a planet (appeared a little bigger than I have seen Venus). I kept walking while watching the object.  It appeared to become slightly bigger, so I stopped before I reached a group of trees that would block my view so I could see if it was moving like an airplane with its lights on.  It wasn&apos;t, so I started walking again and thinking about what it could be.  When I got past the trees to where I could see it again, it had changed from an orange/red glow to a single white light(much smaller), like you would see on a plane.  It blinked once, maybe twice, then moved in a quickly accelerating motion at approx 20 degrees up and to my left, out into the atmosphere. At it&apos;s fastest rate, it looked just a little slower than a shooting star.  I was looking south/slightly southwest the entire time.

We also viewed the moon to make sure our telescope was working correctly and it was.  If this is Venus, why does it have this peculiar black circle in front of it?

I was lying on my back, enjoying the view of the stars, and noticed an object passing directly overhead on a steady west to east trajectory. It was the most unusual thing I had ever seen, and I quickly pointed it out to my friend.  It appeared to be flying fairly low (maybe under 8,000 feet), possibly triangular in shape with be 3 to 5 light underneath/inside it.  This description is not meant to be vague; it&apos;s just that the object appeared to have an unusual but regular &apos;movement&apos;, that actually seemed to change it&apos;s shape, but in a consistent pattern.  The constant shape changing affected how many lights we could see on the underside or inside of the object.  Despite it&apos;s constant fluctuating movement, it&apos;s course seemed to be straight and steady.  It was moving faster than a balloon, dirigible or helicopter, but was not particularly fast.  It disappeared from sight sooner than it should have (probably 40 degrees above the eastern horizon).  We think it was only one object, and we heard no sound from it (but there was relatively loud music from the stage).  I got the sense that it may have only been &apos;obviously&apos; visible to someone directly under it; primarily because it&apos;s lights were similar in size and color to the stars beyond.  Because we were directly under it, we were able to see the motions (shape fluctuations) when portions of it moved underneath (or changed shape) and obscured/revealed it&apos;s lights.  Because of this, we don&apos;t really think that it&apos;s disappearance was the result of it changing speed or direction; we think that once it was a certain distance from us, we would not be able to notice the movement/shape changing on it&apos;s underside; thus it&apos;s lights were difficult to discern against the backdrop of the stars in the night sky.  We agreed that it was NOT a plane, weather or other balloon, helicopter or animal.

This suddenly totally disappeared.The sighting occurred at about 6:25 AM, when it was just starting to get light. I had just gotten off at work at 6:00 AM near downtown Seattle where I work the graveyard shift and was driving home to my apartment in West Seattle. I had decided to drive the scenic route around Alki Beach and drive instead of the normal direct route since there was no traffic and that it was such a nice early morning. On the way I briefly stopped in several places to look at the sights. The eastern sky was pretty with the early morning skies and Venus shining brightly to the East. Later stopped near the Alki Beach proper and looked out and saw a brightly shining planet / star which I thought it was at first, shining out over the sound. It was from Alki Beach proper generally in a Northwest direction over the Puget Sound Waters. You could see the Olympic Mountains to the left of the object. The object was low in the sky NOT high up like directly overhead. The object appeared like a very bright planet or star or maybe a plane that was a long distance away. It remained stationary for maybe about 1 to 2 minutes while I observed it. Then I looked away only momentarily to observe two people walking with their pets nearby. Then I looked back to where this object had been and it had totally and completely disappeared without any trace of having been there. I then spent the next 5 minutes or so looking all over the sky anywhere out over the sound to see if I could see anything that had been this light and there was nothing to be seen. I concluded this could NOT have been a plane since if it was and it had turned there were usually several lights on a plane and if it had turned, you would have been able to see several of the other lights. Also at this time it was early morning and just getting light but there were still stars out and visible which was alot more faint by far then this object had been.", "Two circular shaped objects came from the north, northwest and flew at a 45 degree angle to eachother.

The object passed directly over my head.This ball was green, almost flourescent, and was white to silver in the center. It was silent.  Not a sound. The thing that surprised me is that it flew across air traffic. I thought it was going to hit something. I work second shift as a help desk analyst in Langhorne, PA, which is between three airports, Philadelphia, North Philadelphia and Mercer Airport in Trenton. Air traffic was a little heavier than usual that night because the weather was clear. There were a lot of light planes in the air. I was on break and standing outside the building with another analyst. I said, &quot;Whoa, did you see that?&quot;  She didn&apos;t see it.  She was looking at the ground, and by time I finished my question, and she looked up, it was gone. This object seemed to come from the northeast (from the Trenton area) toward Philadelphia, south-southeast. It was somewhere between 9-10 PM. I don&apos;t remember looking at my watch but it was dark out. Two weeks later, while listening to the Art Bell show, a man called in who happened to mention that he observed the same object, at the same time, on the same date, in Philadelphia. By the way, none of the criteria below apply to what I saw, unless you consider the glow to be an aura or haze. I have reported this to Linda Moulton Howe.  I would like to know if anyone else saw this object.", "I observed an object rising slowly up from about 2000 ft. until it disappeared into the low clouds.  It was star shaped and rotating.I was looking out my bedroom window (facing North) because I heard many sirens in the neighborhood.  At that time I observed an object in the sky which at first looked like it might be a plane.  However this object was rotating while at the same time moving slowly up and to the south east.  I saw lights flashing on and off intermittently.  I also photographed it (although by the time I got my camera loaded it was pretty far away).  I thought it might be a balloon because of the way it was rising but the way it was rotating vertically and the lights on it were not consistent with a balloon.  It was black on the underside and possibly yellow on the top.  It really looked like a plane the way it looks when it is free falling from the sky but it was going up and the vertical rotation (rolling motion) was slow.  I want to know what this strange object was and if it was reported by any other people in the SB area.  I will email you the photos when I get them developed if you are interested. Thank you.", "bright light that did not move at all. 1 bright light turned to 3 distinguishable lights. dissappeared suddenlyDriving from work in downtown Redmond, WA at 12:25 am. Saw a bright light with a slight glow in the sky. Direction was SSE from my vantage point. I cannot judge the distance to the light. Thought initially it may have been a meteorite re-entering atmosphere. However, it did not move at all and there was no trail. As I drove, the light appeared to stay in same exact place. Thought could be small aircraft or helicopter, but there were no visible nav marker lights. LIght did not seem to be consistent with helicopter search lites. Light was yellow-orange. As I continued to drive home up a hill overlooking the valley, the light seemed to continue in the same spot. While hanging there, the one bright light rotated or otherwise seemed to become 3 distinguishable lights of the same color. Trying not to crash, I decided to turn around so I could drive back a few hundred yards to a spot where I could see the light(s) clearly. I pulled off onto a side street and turned around. When I! started back down the hill the light(s) were gone. As I drove around (including getting on the 520 highway), I noticed an inordinate amount of police cars(8)driving around rather quickly.

When we walked outside to see why the car had stopped, we observed that the occupants of the station wagon (4 adults) were looking up to the sky.  When we turned our attention to the sky, we observed 5-6 bright white circular objects flying in a formation in the night sky from North to South.  These objects, which travelled at a slow pace, made no noise and left no trails while they flew overhead.  These objects flew at about a distance of 1000 to 1500 feet above the ground.  As I remember, the objcts flew in a triangular formation but did not stay in this formation.  The objects criss-crossed each other, changing positions in the formation, in a way that I would not think to be possible from any type of aircraft that I know of.  We all stood there and watched these objects until they disappeared over the tree filled-horizon toward Route 17 and SUNY Binghamton.  My mother called the State Police and they commented that they had several calls about these objects but the police did not know what they were.

For about the last year he has been talking about the &apos;people up there&apos; (while pointing upwards). At one time he was crying and saying he wanted his own body back that the people up there had taken. This continued for several days untill he said he got his body back. He has told my wife and I about the people sticking him in the back with needles and of rides in space ships. Of course this could be just a very good imagination except for something odd that has been happening lately. One morning about 4:00am he comes into our bedroom, climbs on the bed, opens the blinds at the head of our bed and starts waving and saying bye. I work night shift but this woke my wife up. He has also woke my wife up a couple times lately to talk about space ships or to ask her if the space ship is coming to get him. Always at 4:00am. One day while playing with my son my wife asked him! what he wanted to be when he grows up. He is very intelligent and knows what different people in different professions do, to an extent. He said he wasn&apos;t sure. She asked if he would like to be an astronaught and he informed her that he didn&apos;t need to do that because he already has a ship and that the &apos;people&apos; are showing him how to fly it. We found this incredibly nerve wrecking because not long before we found out my wife was pregnant with him I had a very strange experience. Basically, I had a dream I was part of a 2 man crew piloting a &apos;UFO&apos;. There were several things that were extremely wierd about this dream that made me wonder if it was really a dream. I told several people about it and of course they laughed about it. It was quite a good laugh for them until about 2 weeks later when the local news reported that there where a number of UFO sighting and abduction reports in the area I was living in during the past 3 weeks. I don&apos;t get laughed at much anymore about it! . The experience/dream I had was not of being abducted but of being a functioning member of a &apos;alien&apos; crew like my son has been reporting to us. He doesn&apos;t give specific details of the ship or landing &apos;base/planet&apos;like I remember. I just find this strange. If you know of a professional researcher who would like to know more about this please forward my e-mail address to him/her/them.

The sun had just set, but the sky was clear and still too bright to see any stars yet. As I drove on southbound I-55 through the short stretch of Arkansas before Memphis, a bright pinpoint of light caught my attention in my peripheral vision. It was in the West Southwest sky, at roughly 2 o&apos;clock on a clockface, as I faced South. It was bright white, looked at first like a plane with the sun glinting off it. I then assumed it was a very bright star. I continued to watch the object, and noticed it did not move. There was no contrail. Suddenly, the object began to fade and lose brightness, and appeared to almost &quot;implode&quot; upon itself, until it disappeared completely. It was like watching a star burn out.  Fascinated, I continued to watch that space in the sky. Sure enough, about 2 minutes later, the bright object faded back &quot;ON&quot;, until it was at its former brightness.  It didn&apos;t stay bright as long as the previous time, but again, faded out slowly til it was not visible any more.  I tried to notice if any other southbound drivers or truckers had seen the strange light.  I only wish I had had a cb at that moment; I could have asked the truckers to look up, or ask them if they had also seen it.", "varying speed pulsating light, very bright to very dimLooking due east, we spotted a slow to moderate pulsating light,(there was no consistant timing to the pulsing, it varied in length). It was surrounded by a hazy halo of light that never changed in intensity. It was a very clear night. None of the other stars surrounding it changed in intensity or had halos. The light varied from very bright-as bright as a full moon, to so dim as to disappear, the object was similar in size at its brightest as Jupiter would be in the night sky.

I kept one eye on it (the other on the road, as I was driving on the highway at 60mph), and I was able to distinguish 5-7 distinct large red lights (of various relative sizes) all moving together at about the same constant velocity (speed and direction).  Following and centered behind the leading and largest red light was a long, broad, dense shower of reddish &quot;sparks&quot; or &quot;sparklers&quot;--very dramatic and beautiful!  I quickly pulled off an exit to watch it as it moved overhead to the East; but lost sight of it behind a steep hill (or mountain) directly in front of the object.

I looked up and from about eleven o&apos;clock above me I was surprised by a half a dozen objects coming toward me.  My first thought was that it was a huge meteor but there were multiple objects, they appeared to be traveling much more slowly than any meteor and they appeared to be in formation.  I then thought &quot;is this what a U F O sighting looks like?&quot; As the group of objects passed slowly, almost &quot;drifting&quot; past my windshield higher than my aircraft, I could see flames coming from each object and a comet-like tail behind each object.  My next thought was that it might be a huge aircraft breaking up, some objects were long like a wing or odd shapes. However, it was not descending, but rather was moving straight and slowly across the sky almost appearing to be level.  It had the appearance of flaming, huge objects, in formation, or in a group.  There was one large object following the group somewhat behind the others.  I thought it might be space debri but they all appeared too large and too many. The group moved slowly from front left to right over at least a minute to a minute and a half time.  I had time to turn down all the radio and instrument lights in my cockpit, watched the objects and turned right to attempt to follow them.  I followed them at 200 knots. They continued south-southeast bound, toward southern California. I have never seen anything like this in over thirty years of my flying career.

They appeared to be in a tight triangular formation separted by about a half of a finger lenghth.  They remained in my view for approx 30 seconds or so.  What is the most amazing thing about this sighting is that when I went to work the following day I told my friend about this sighting and he told me that both him and his wife observed the exact same thing two years ago while camping on the Naches river in Washington state.  However, he also told me that they were traveling from the southwest to the northeast, exactly 180 degrees the opposite direction.", "3 Satelite-like triangular formation.We were all sitting on the beach looking at the stars, talking about many things. We were spoting shooting stars. Identifiying satelites. Sudenly, we notice a hudge fireball about 25 degres above the horizon. It was so low we though it might have been fireworks... but then it broke in 4 pices and streked down (it must have hit the ground what ever it was) It was so fast... and traveled such a long distance in the sky. So all of our attention went towards the sky. Shortly after we all noticed what looked like 3 satelites-like in a perfect triangular position. I couldn&apos;t tell wether it was a triangular craft with three lights at each extremities or three individual things going along at the same speed in the same direction. It didn&apos;t make any noise. It traveled in the exact same direction as the fireball(what ever it was). I didn&apos;t personaly see the three stars disapeared but my friends said !Ho where did it go?!?! It kind of all of the sudden disapeared.", "a ball of light shot over my head.I was on Strikland blvd. on my way to work at 23:55.  I was making my final turn into the parking lot and I saw a small green ball of light heading south west for only a fraction of a second. It was about the size of a bb, haloed with yellow with a pointed yellow orange tail. the tail was longer than the ball. I work overnights at a 7-11, and foodeservice during the day.", "I watched a streak of light move in a southerly direction heading downward eventually disappearing behind the Olympic Mountains.I live on the bluff above the North Everett waterfront.  This evening I had a clear view of the south end of Whidbey Island and the Olympic Mountains behind.  I was watching the sky from my window and saw a streak of light that appeared to be moving very slowly at an angle of 25-35 degrees in a southerly direction.  I looked at it through my 8X binoculars, when I first saw the streak and it was near the middle of the field of view with the lower edge of the field on the water/Whidbey Island edge. (I don&apos;t know if that is helpful - it&apos;s a way to locate raptors for birdwatchers.) I was able to watch the streak through my spotting scope which has a zoom lens 20X to 50X, and it looked like dense orange burning gasses getting less dense toward the end, but not fading very much.  I could see no object associated with this streak of light, just the look of roiling, burning gasses.  It did not leave a trail as it moved, but moved as one entity.  As the streak was moving toward then behind the mountains, it passed an adjacent mountain peak, possibly Mt. Olympus.  The streak was about 2/3 the size of the silouetted slope of that mountain peak, so it must have been very large.  Mt. Olympus is about 70-80 miles away as the crow flies from Everett.  I am not sure about the length of time of the observation, but I had time to get my binoculars across the room, watch through my binoculars for a short while, go across the room, get my spotting scope set up, find the streak in my scope, which took a little while because I could no longer see it with my naked eye and had to check again with my binoculars to get a location, and watched the streak until it went behind the mountains.  I work for Snohomish County Surface Water Management as a watershed steward for the Snohomish River basin.  I have never seen anything like this before.  One more thing, it probably moving westerly as well since at first I could see it without optics, then it must have gotten farther away since I could only find it again by using my binoculars.", "Glowing object blue and whiteHi, I am a Vietnam Vet. (Seals)  and what I am about to tell you DID happen. I was sitting on my back porch last July just enjoying a &apos;beverage&apos; when suddenly there was a bright light in the woods. I thought it was some kids building a camp fire, but camp fires do not move. It slowly drifted above the ground, and into the trees. I watched in terror and wonderment as the object silently moved around. But I have a hearing impariment, so I am not sure if it was making a sound!  I did not know what to do. I had heard of this kinda stuff happening to people but I figured it was all Bull****. Well now, I am not sure what it was but it was not like anything I have ever seen. I watched this thing for about 3 to 4 minutes.  I was concerned that it would come near my house, and I was gonna bust a cap in it if that happened. But it just floated on up into the sky and disappeared. I am not sure if any of my neighbors saw this, and I am not asking! But geez, what a night.. I could not sleep without a gun for weeks.

I saw a bright light that was not seeming to move. Its size was comparible to the moon. I went to get the Binoculars, but when I got back it was gone.The light was 4 or 5 times brighter than the lights from all the other airplanes in view. It didn&apos;t seem close, but very large. The light was a bright White color. That&apos;s all I was able to see. I personally think it was probably a plane flying even with my eyes, but the extreamly bright light makes me wonder.", "Three glowing triangular objects moved from east to west at a high rate of speed, silently and in perfect formation.The two of us, a lawyer and a software engineer, observed three glowing triangles zoom across the sky (east to west) from one horizon to the other.  The objects moved quickly.  My best guess is that they took 15 seconds to move across the sky. During this time, they moved in a straight line, leaving no trails, and stayed in perfect formation.  The objects were colored, as best I can recall, light yellow.  They moved silently.  After they had disappeared, I checked the time on my computer (it&apos;s synced up with GMT) and it was 2:51 am pacific daylight time.  We discussed the incident afterwards and both agreed that we had never seen anything like it.", "2 objects above Santa cruz Mnts.Aug. 25th Wednesday evening at 9:30pm I noticed two bright orange lights on a ridge across a valley while standing in my back yard, I Immediately called my husband to come take a look, at first I thought maybe they were fire trucks on the ridge, but as I looked through the my binoculars I realized that they were not Fire trucks, but were actually about 15 degrees above the ridge moving in the a South West direction. I couldn&apos;t make out a definite shape, only they were round and and glowed like a flame, they never flickered and I couldn&apos;t see any lights other than this orange glow. I followed them through my binoculars as they moved slowly above the ridge for about 5 minutes, then they both seem to stop moving for about 30 second, then one of them moved down and behind the other side of the ridge and I could no longer see it, the second one stayed still, just hovering there above the ridge for about 30 seconds, as I watched it, it just turn off ? Like turning off a light. It didn&apos;t move up or down like the other one had, it just dissapeared right in front of my eyes ?

We thought at first maybe a bird had hit a power line and was electrictuted.  My husband looked in his rear view mirrow and said he saw a streak then saw alot of smoke.. So we turned the truck around and headed back by this time there was a pretty good size fire.  We looked all around and saw there were no power poles involed or any dead birds around.. Another car pulled up and ask what happened. I breifly told them what we heard and saw. They said they saw something up high and then all of a sudden if fell and they then saw the smoke also.. but he said it didnt look like an object just something in the air.. the sun would of been directly in front of him so maybe this interfiered with what he saw.. this was also about the time of the ending of the metor shower in aug.. I was wonder if it could of been a metor.. My husband walked over to the fire chief and tried to explain to him was we heard and saw but the fire chief just blew him off like he was a kook or something... I dont ever think I will forget that sound or the strange color light I saw... It is still hard to explain.

I underwnt fighter pilot med-exams and have confirmed excellent eye-vision. I`m also very familiar with all types of aircraft, helicopter, other airborne crafts and satellites, their in-flight behavior and day/night identification. I`m also familiar with stars and other astronomical objects that may be observed with naked-eye or binoculars on night-sky. I wrote complete data of every one of series of events right after they happend. Location:  (on the balcony of my house) Hotedrsica, Slovenia Air temperature: little above zero &deg;C Clouds: 0/8 (clear) No sighted air traffic (towards E and SE commercial flights can be observed about 7&deg; over horizon coming into Ljubljana/Brnik airport area) First 1/5 of moon over western horizon (hidden behind house), Hale-Bopp comet behind the nearby hill. Light pollution of sky zero (rural area). Car traffic in vicinity: zero Wind: none Observer in dark area, no lights in field of vision. Event: I was lying on a deck chair looking straight up, covering approx. 80&deg; left and right, 30&deg; down and 70&deg; up from vertical line (legs facing west). After observing stars through binoculars for a while, I decided to proceede naked-eyed. After a while an object appeared from behind the top of the roof of house wherer I was. Size of objcet was approx. 20&deg; times 6&deg;, movement vector 120&deg;, no sound, 15&deg; per second. I tracked it over 90&deg; of sky for 6 seconds. Object was composed of numerous lights (approx. 30 of them), at visual magnitude of +6. Flight path of object went through Coma Berenices and Leo. Object was transparent (stars behind it were visible). As said, object came in from the direction of my legs, proceeded through zenith after what I stood up, turned around and watched it egress behind the roof of neighboring house. After this event (after 10 minutes) I observed 4 satellites in 2 minutes time. Picture at: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www((URL deleted))&quot;&gt;My Page&lt;/a&gt; Duration:  Approx. 6 seconds Appearance: Object transparent, composed of many lights, generally simetrical left/right with slight annomalies (light positions), arrow-headed with very small leading-edge sweep angle. Besides lights (star-sized) no other visible parts. Nor the object neither the lights left no smoke/fire trails. During movement the shape of object remains unchanged (position of lights), heading and speed also. Light color: white, (none of them is blinking, all the same intensity) No sound during the observation. In fact, no ambient sounds at all, 15 mins before till an hour later. Angular size of object:  approx. 20&deg; x 6&deg; Angular velocity: approx. 15&deg;/sec. Conclusions: Due to slow movement, no sound, transparent appearance, formed of approx. 30 star-sized lights of equal intensity in roughy wedge formation (bird-like formation) simmetrically positioned in general, I assume I saw a very large formation of smaller crafts (indefinable shape) flying at very high altitudes or even in orbit. (It is out of the question that the event could be one craft at very low altitude) Later comments:  I read in a paper that there was a scramble alert in USAFB Aviano, Italy (which is located at 300&deg; 80nm from sighting location) on the 11th of March 1997 due to a wave of UFO sightings over the base.

The object followed us all the way back to his house.At about 2 am on Sunday morning, July 23, 1997 my friend and I were driving home from Atco Multiplex Theatres in Atco, NJ..  We were about 1 and 1/2 miles from his house when we saw a what seemed to be a strobe light directly over his car on Fairview Rd. in Medford, NJ.  Curious, we wanted to get a better view of the lights, if there was anything to see.  We pulled into a stone parking lot at a nearby baseball field that would allow an unobstructed view of the sky.  Upon stopping and getting out of his vehicle we turned around to see if anything remained in the sky.  At that point we observed an object hovering (it make no noise whatsoever) over the treeline across the road.  After about 10-20 seconds, the object threw on all of its lights and carme across the road toward us.  We jumped into his car, got back to the road, and took off. The object proceeded to follow us down the road at high speed.  It remained at a stable altitude just above the treeline on the right side ! of the road.  After following us for about 1/2 of a mile, it changed direction and cruised directly over his car.  We got a great view!  It was a dark, triangle-shaped object with several lights on the bottom of it.  We then had to make a left turn to get back to his house.  Upon arriving there (about 1/4 mile from where it passed over his car), it was hovering directly over his house.  We jumped out of the car and raced inside.  We scurried into the basement where I called my folks to tell them what had happened.  At that time, for reasons unknown, his car alarm went off.  We had put his car in the garage upon arriving there, so naturally we were frightened.  He turned it off by remote from his kitchen, and we did not investigate.  We locked the doors and retreated to the basement where we drew pictures of the object and talked about it.  The next day his Mom called the police and no one else had reported any objects like what we had seen.  I am doing so now because I rece! ntly discovered the UFO Reporting Center. I would be happy to describe the events in detail to anyone who would listen.", "while camping a we paid little attention to a very high flying object with no flashing lights or motor sound, flew above us, pulled 90 degree turn and flew down over the horizon. it was the perfect sharp turn that caught our attentionA friend and I were camping on an island called Galiano Island at the end of august of 98. It was after dark and we were getting ready to sleep. I saw what I thought was a plane and paid little notice to it as it flew above us. When it was a more or less directly over us it had changed direction by about a full 90 degrees. That was what surprised us. The object had three lights in the dark sky it looked triangular, and the lights were not flashing, just white lights. It was very high up. As far as the sound it made, a very low humm. There were no other planes in the sky. Both my friend and I were convinced that is was not a sea plane. It moved from directly above us to the horizon, a distance of about 25 km in less than a minute if that is a significant detail. I have no reason to lie, and in fact, since the sighting have been avidly seeking information to confirm my skeptisism as to weather this is a ligit sighting or a common aircraft. thank you.", "Blue/white fanning light, which closed to a point and gradually faded to ground levelSeen during an unforcast lightening storm, which subsequently stopped after light was seen", "Sparkling Streaks- First impression was that it was space debris entering- What was unusual was that there seemed to be a formation of threeOn or about sept 1,1999,I saw three non mechanical sparkling streaks on the eastern about 20 degrees from the surface traveling from north to south.

On this particular evening, my brother and I had just exited a thick patch of trees after a long day of deer hunting. It was nearly dark,the first stars were out and we had about a mile walk back to our truck. Being aware of anomalies in the area, we were always on the lookout for ANYTHING out of the &quot;ordinary&quot;. Well, upon looking to the eastern sky , we both saw 3 &quot;stars&quot; that seemed to be brighter than the rest. These lights were stationary at this point and seemed to be regular stars out in space. I remember saying to my brother that maybe they were planets and we would check it out at home.We then continued on our hike to the truck and went home- nothing unusual.This is where it starts getting strange. One week later almost to the minute,my brother and I emerged from the same patch of trees after hunting all day.As we again surveyed our surroundings, we again noticed the 3 stars from the week previous in the exact same place they had been then.Only this time they were a different color(orange) and seemed to be moving slightly in conjunction with each other. Really interested now,we watched as the formation of lights gradually picked up speed coming in roughly our direction (west).We then realized that we were in a bad situation and started for the truck at a fast walk. Keeping an eye on the object, we observed it change direction to a more northerly heading and fly toward a low cloud formation, into which it flew. By this point we could tell that this was no ordinary aircraft(as a student pilot with 10 yrs in ! aviation ,I&apos;m familiar with nearly all known a/c).The object was close enough for us to see a structured triangular fuselage dark in color. It made absolutely no sound. Upon the object entering the cloud, there was a flash of light similar to lightning but flourescent green in color. This was immediately followed by the object emerging from the cloud in roughly a 10 degree bank. As the object made it&apos;s way clear of the cloud, we observed the &quot;cloud&quot; literally change shape until it appeared like a tornado but horizontal to the earth not vertical, with the &quot;foot&quot; of the funnel pointing toward the object. At this point we broke into a sprint for the truck. As we ran, the object literally DRAGGED this &quot;tornado&quot; to the west. We could see that the whole eastern horizon was black now.Just as we reached the truck we were hit by huge gusts of wind  and debris from the east and visibilty was around 2 feet. Concerned now, we piled into the truck to find that this reliable vehicle was completely dead( it was just like in the movies). With the nearest help miles away, we readied our rifles( made us feel better) and waited. Total elapsed time so far approx. 6 min.The dust storm and confusion lasted for about 10 min then the wind stopped and the dust settled. As visibility improved and things became quiet again, we could see...We could see objects- lots of them. Besides the original triangle a/c which was now making a 40-50nm circular flight pattern, we could see discs trailing the triangle, all moving independently.(We were by now using our 10x50 Zeiss binocs) and could see that the discs were definitley metallic in nature. The most impressive object however was a gigantic cylinder that descended from nowhere then hovered approx 500ft agl around  a 1000 yds distant, over a field. Peter, I swear to you on my Father&apos;s grave that along each side of this thing were &quot;windows&quot; in which it seemed like there was movement! It was around 2 football fields in length, approx. 700-1000 ft in diameter,  and bright silver in color.The &quot;front! end&quot; gl owed blue, intensifying the farther one got from the center and the &quot;rear end&quot; glowed red in the same manner.What drew your eye though was the yellow and orange strobe exactly centered on the &quot;bottom&quot;.We watched this object in pure horror for about an hour until it ascended straight up and out of sight .It did not disappear in a split second but rose rapidly taking less than a minute to completely vanish.Well, back to the other objects, which were by now in the company of several F-15&apos;s.It was VERY EASY to differentiate between the jets and the other objects. The F-15&quot;s flew around for about a half hr.then headed NW in a tight formation and the triangle followed close behind, all disappearing over some hills to the NW-we never saw them again.The discs continued to maneuver throughout the area.We had pretty much resigned ourselves to our fate by this point and now felt the worst was over.It all became rather entertaining by midnight.We spent a cold night in the truck, falling asleep eventually watching these discs and their erratic flight. In the morning, our parents showed up to look for us and we gave them the whole story. They believed us but advised us to say nothing. I just cant live with this secret any longer and felt it may be important as I believe I was a witness to some kind of WX manipulation Technology. I moved away soon after and hav&apos;nt been back. I understand from friends that &quot;things&quot; are still happening there.", "16 Sept 99     5:11 P.M. After hearing Ron (sic) Davenport this afternoon, on the local radio station in Nevada City, CA (KVMR-FM), I decided to give my account of the sighting on 01 Sept 99.  Being fairly isolated up on this mountain, I had been wondering if anyone else saw what I saw that evening in the northern sky.  Here&apos;s the account, word for word, that I wrote the morning of 03 Sept 99 in my journal.  Having heard the show, I now think my timing is off for the duration of the event.....having believed it was a group of meteorites when I wrote the following, and couldn&apos;t imagine such an event taking longer than 12-14 seconds to traverse that expanse of the horizon.  It&apos;s easy to lose an accurate sense of time at moments like this. Written on Friday morning, 03 Sept 99 &quot;It was one of two things.  I convinced myself they were probably man-made, but now I suspect otherwise.  Around 9:30 p.m., after the Drew Carey Show, I went out to ((deleted)) for a change.  Looking up in the NNW sky, just below the Big Dipper, marched a gang of light trails headed eastward.  I couldn&apos;t believe what I was seeing at first.....one of those wonderful all-too-rare gapes.  (I think it may have something to do with the surprise of finding myself at the right place - at the right time.  Sad, that.) The motion was steady, but  slower than most, if not all, meteorites I&apos;ve seen before....and so many all together at once.  At least eight, four in the front group, were visible during the last couple of seconds, which I viewed with the  binocs.  I wanted to dash for them sooner, but stood transfixed, unwilling to take my eyes off something so amazing for the first 8-10 seconds.  As they seemed to head toward Reno, I took a chance, got the binocs, and watched them &apos;flame-out&apos; one by one.  It&apos;s through the binocs that I counted the eight.....there could have been a couple more in the progression, earlier. The duration caused me to suspect military craft of some sort, that didn&apos;t want to be seen as they approached Reno, so perhaps they cut their engines one by one and flew in a slightly disarrayed order to throw off any observers, and glided back to some secret place in the Nevada desert.  But if they were aircraft, they moved fast, albeit subsonic, and the lit-up trails of gas are something I&apos;ve never seen before at night.  Could the smoke particles that have been lingering for over a week cause that? Went out again the next night (02Sept99), and noticed another meteorite lower to the horizon, redder, a little faster and only a few seconds in duration.....but definitely a meteorite.  So I&apos;ve changed my mind....from a conspiricy of craft, to a cluster of rocks....maybe billions of years old, coming into land. So incredibly better than a movie.&quot; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ A couple of notes in retrospect......using the Osborne Firefinder (using true N), I later approximated the portion of the horizon from when I first noticed the objects, to the time of &apos;flame out&apos;, to go from ~330&deg; to ~80&deg; from my position, or about a 110&deg; span.  A very rough guess, but they seemed to be approximately 7&deg; vertical from the mountaintop when due N. The mention of smoke above refers to the large fires that had been raging on the Plumas N.F. for the prior week.  I thought perhaps some of the particles might have scattered higher into the atmosphere and caused the light trails, but evidently not if others saw the trails prior to the objects reaching the Sierras.  I believe the trails were rather greenish in color, though I&apos;m not sure I trust my hindsight on that. I now believe the duration of the sighting was probably closer to 30 seconds, but still don&apos;t quite understand what I was looking at.  Were all those objects with light trails, F-15&apos;s with afterburners on, as was mentioned in the radio show?  Were there really at least eight of them?  In any case, it still gives me goosebumps when I recall the amazement of the moment.  Now if I can only figure out how to be in the right-place-at-the-right-time more often.......&hellip;", "I was driving in a new subdivision when I saw an object flying slowly in the sky.

It was flying very slowly and was almost hovering over a wooded area where workers ,who were at lunch , have been building a new road into this secluded subdivision. I turned my car off and stepped out of my car for a better look and to see if it might be an airplane.  The object made no sound. Nor did it leave a contrail.

My daughter and I were watching this and originally thought it was a large bird. When it stopped and hovered in the same spot for several minutes I ran and got my glasses for a better look. What I saw appeared to be a black non reflective object shaped like 4 cubes connected to form a tri-pod rotating on an x/y and z axis. At approximately 19:15 hrs it seperated into two (2) smaller black objects of apparently equal size and or mass. Neither of the smaller objects appeared to have a definitive shape and moved fairly fluidly in what I can only describe as elliptical orbits around eachother and appearing to come into contact with eachother every few orbits. At approximately 19:20 hrs the objects rejoined in the original shape and started to ascend straight up very slowly. The sighting continued until 19:32 hrs when it passed out of my visibilty range. At approximately 19:21 hrs I tried to phone you via information in Seattle, and they repeatedly told me they had no listing for either the National UFO Reporting Center or anything under UFO at all.

I followed it because it was such a bright object.  While I watched, the fireball grew bigger, then faded to a long flat object with what looked like wings projecting from the top and bottom, like it was a very long tube like airplane on its side.  As I was watching it move from west to east, I spotted what looked like a smaller large object move in the same direction, parallel with the large object, but lower in the sky, making it seem to be a great distance away.  The first large object seemed to grow larger in size as it moved seemingly farther away.  the second object continued to track the first.  As I was standing in the middle of the street, there were trees in the area and I lost the object behind trees that were too numerous for me to track on.  By the time I got to an area where I could see more sky, all objects were gone.  This was no more than about 1/2 block and took place over about 30 seconds I believe.  I was entranced, unable to believe what I saw, I almost pooh-poohed it but continued to watch and could not believe what I saw.  I finally realized that it could not be a meteor as it was moving too slow for that.  I am an elementary teacher in the coos bay school system and have been interested in these type of sightings for many years, but this is the first one I have  personally seen.  I was amazed and absolutely thrilled to have seen something out of the ordinary.  I sent an e-mail to KVAL-tv that night and never got a reply but did hear something on the 11:00 news that stated that it was a russian space object.  I forgot about it until I heard a broadcast on KWRO-am radio at approximately 10:15 on September 16th.", "observed a very long craft with a cheveron front. Front of object had several dim lights, craft very large, moving slowly over pastureIn the late summer of 1980, a friend and I were sitting on the trunk of my car  at approx. 11:30 p.m. My home was located in Brenham, Tx-right off of the highway, ( sorry, can&apos;t remember which highway) and was surrounded by cow pasture. We were just looking at the stars..and suddenly we saw a strange craft moving slowly through the night sky, directly above us. We thought at first that the object was a blimp-soon it was quite obvious that this was no blimp, plane,etc..The object was very, very long..at the very least one football field in length.The front of the object was chevron/triangle shaped, with dim lights all along the rim of the front. Object was very slow and seemed to be flying at low altitude. The oddest thing was the complete absence of sound-any object that low, that large would have to make sound of some sort, but this thing was totally silent-almost like a vaccum- everything was incredibly silent. We watched this for approx. 15-20 min, in total shock, not really believing what we were seeing. We never reported it, never mentioned it to anyone-as we were young, ( 20) and knew that we would never be believed. To this day, I believe we saw an alian craft--I am now in my 40&apos;s and have never again seen anything that large be able to fly..and especially be totally soundless", "orange light moving across sky and stops and exlpodes into a fireball and disappearsMy husband and I were in our bedroom having a conversation.  While I was speaking to my husband, I noticed outside our window which would be north, I noticed an orange light moving across the sky.

What caught my husbands attention was when the orange light exploded into the fireball, the fireball lite our room and my husband looked outside and also saw the fireball and it disappear.  About 5 minutes after, we heard jets flying accross the sky.

Staring at it((name deleted))and ((name deleted)) and ((name deleted)) ou said &quot;It&apos;s a Laser beam&quot; After following his directions, it was a Bluish/Green beam going from North to SouthEast. It was curious because it did not angle Down or up from the earth.  We concluded it must have been transversing the sky in space. We called every organization we could think of and no one else reported anything and they tried to suggest that it was from Disney land?? It was not from there, it was in space cutting across our atmosphere.  It was there at about 8:35pm or 9:35pm four about an hour. After awhile above us there were 4 or 5 giant orange flashes, no sound. Our conclusion after some more investigation; The space shuttle just happened to be in orbit at these times and the above occurred for about 3 day&apos;s after our initial sighting.  The flashes however were only seen by us that first night. This happened almost 10 years ago and we are reasonably sure that it was some test by the government in our space shuttle program. I heard you on Artbell and decided to get this off my chest since you sounded sincere in trying to collect data on sightings of various events. It was a laser beam tested 10 years ago. No doubt in our minds. What it shot at? What were the large orange flashes? Somebody knows but not us.  Thanks for letting me post this in your database.

The craft made absolutely no noise.During the week of August 30, 1999, my friend Laura and I were visiting Matthews, NC, a suburb ten miles south east of Charlotte NC. (We&rsquo;re from Spartanburg, SC, approximately 60 miles south. I (36 year old white male) have worked in law enforcement for fifteen years and Laura (30 year old while female) has been a school teacher for eight years.) On Tuesday August 31, we attended an outdoor concert in a park located approximately three miles east of Matthews. As the concert ended, around 2330 hours, Laura and I headed toward the parking lot with approximately thirty other people. We were between the park and parking lot, in a wooded walkway area, when all the lights &ndash; in the park, wooded area, and parking lot &ndash; went out. Everyone stopped in their place to let our eyes adjust to the darkness and someone said something about a power failure. I then noticed something &ndash; like a shadow &ndash; over my shoulder. (The sky was clear with a quarter moon. The moon, however, was not high in the sky yet.) I turned and looked directly up. Floating above us, approximately 150 feet up, was a huge, black craft. The two front sides of the craft were triangular, but the back side was wing shaped. The craft was at least 100 yards wide (wing tip to wing tip) and 50 to 60 yards long (front to back). (All of these measurements are based upon the height of the trees and light poles we saw the craft pass over). I said loudly enough to make sure everyone heard me, &quot;Look up.&rdquo; As everyone looked up, there was a group gasp. This craft FLOATED above us (from east to west) and out over the parking lot. The craft made absolutely NO sound. There were no lights on or around the craft &ndash; it was completely black. A man standing in front of us had a video camera. He attempted to video the craft but his battery had died. I grabbed Laura&rsquo;s hand and moved quickly into the parking lot to get a better look and the others followed us. The craft traveled over the lot and then turned north, away from Matthews and Charlotte. As the craft moved away, all ! the ligh ts in the lot came back on and we could no longer see the craft. (The craft was visible for approximately 15 minutes). I grabbed Laura&rsquo;s hand again and pulled her toward the car. She did not want to moved and I then realized she was crying. She asked where we were going and I said I wanted to follow the craft. I finally got her into the car. As I looked back to the other people, I saw that most of them seemed to be very upset. Some, including men, were also crying. I attempted to follow the craft in the car, but not being familiar with the area, quickly became lost. We never saw the craft again. I found my way back to the parking lot. Now there were 70 to 80 people in the lot. (Some of the others had been elsewhere in the park when the craft went over and had followed it&rsquo;s direction to the lot.) Everyone seemed calm again. The man with the video camera now found it working again. Another man called two radio stations and reported what had happened. The radio people listened politely but didn&rsquo;t seem too concerned. The man then called a local television station. When the television person heard what the call was about, she hung up. A group of us stayed around and talked for a while and then went our own ways. I asked Laura if the craft had scared her enough to make her cry. She stated she wasn&rsquo;t scared but felt very emotional. She also couldn&rsquo;t understand why I wanted to chase the &ldquo;thing.&rdquo; This was the first time either Laura or I had seen any sort of strange craft. She was never interested in UFOs before but I always have been. The next morning we checked the news &ndash; television, radio, and newspapers &ndash; but there was no mention whatsoever of this event.", "small silver object, low flying in very strait line emitting what looked to be a thick bright billowy contrail the shape and length of a comet tai ended at a point and abruptly, no dispersion of smoke.In car returning home the last 2 blocks, up in the sky what looked to be at the altitude of a small plane, but I could not make out the object only twice in its flight did I glimpse, the color silver.  What was so odd was the tail of what seemed to be a contrail from the object immediately from the back end that was much thicker than the object itself and extended about 15 lengths of the object into a point, as though it were the tail of a comet.  The contrail was thick and solid, but billowy looking and was very illuminated or bright, but it did appear like smoke that was coming from the object.  It did not trail off in a long dispersed fashion, like it does from high flying aircraft that leave contrails across the sky.  This stuff coming out of this thing was very contained in its appearance.  The object traveled very slow almost 4 min in my vision while I parked the car in the drive went in the house, grabbed the phone came back outside and called my husband at work and proceeded to describe what I was seeing to him.  It traveled as though I were seeing it from the side view but as it moved farther away it was not exactly perpendicular to me.  The path was more like southwest to northeast.

Moving GIF scetch included.I`m a graduate at faculty of mechanical engineering. I underwnt fighter pilot med-exams and have confirmed excellent eye-vision. I`m also very familiar with all types of aircraft, helicopter, other airborne crafts and satellites, their in-flight behavior and day/night identification. I`m also familiar with stars and other astronomical objects that may be observed with naked-eye or binoculars on night-sky. I wrote complete data of every one of series of events right after they happend. Location:  (on the balcony of my house) Ilirska Bistrica, Slovenia Air temperature: +4&deg;C Clouds: 0/8 (clear) No sighted air traffic (3 nm west of Il.Bist. there is a VOR/DME/NDB beacon) No moon. Hale-Bopp comet behind the horizon for almost an hour. Light pollution of sky minimal. Car traffic in vicinity: 2/min Observer in dark area, no lights in field of vision. Event: After the event that occured the day before, I observed southern skies approx. half an hour, naked eyed. I just wanted to go inside when a dark object flew over the town of Ilirska Bistrica, paralel to the valley in which the town is located (ie vector 150&deg; ). I observed object at elevation of 20&deg;, angular size 3.5&deg;. Picture at: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.((website deleted)) Presumed craft shape: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.((website deleted))&gt; Duration:  Approx. 1.5 second Appearance:  Object flew in the direction of 150&deg;, straight. I started to observe it when it appeared from behind the roof of our house and stopped when it disappeared in light-polluted air low over the horizon. The observed flight path was 20&deg; angular size. The main part of the object was dark, you could not tell what shape it was, you just noticed that your view at the background stars was blocked by something moving and black. At the end of this black mass, there were 4 white lights (I`d say they were about at visual magnitude 4 or 5), at equal distances in a line. Between every two strong lights there was a weak light, not the half way in between, but a little up and right. Those weaker lights were also at equal distances and in a line, that was paralel to the line of the strong lights. From the direction of motion, paralel movement of all lights in that direction and the perspective changes, I can tell by feeling that the object was close and low over the town. I`d put its route over the local factory. And by the movement through the air, you could just tell that the two lines of lights are perpendicular to flight path. After it passed by, I heard a one second long weak buzzing noise. Like the sound of tyres rolling but buzzing and much more quiet than car tyres. The sound pitch was lowering as the object egressed, like the doppler effect. Angular size of object:  approx. 3.5&deg; Angular velocity: approx. 7&deg;/sec. My conclusions:  The four strong lights were at equal distances and always in the line, at their fixed positions. No smoke trails behind. If they were parts of a meteor broken by Earth`s tidal forces, they would go apart, they`d be much more close together, their light intensity would change and they would leave smoke trails (I`ve seen a few meteor break-ups, and I know how they look like). The weaker lights were also at equal distances and formed in a line that was paralel to the line of the stronger lights, but they were located a little to the right and up from the strong ones. I don`t know about the size of the object. If I assume it was about 20m wide, then the 3.5&deg; angular width would give it the distance of 320m. That would go together with that feeling of mine plus the sound did not come to me immediately, but with approx. one second delay. So, that would put the object over the factory 300 meters away at about 150 meters above ground level. Assumptions. Later comments:  I read in a paper that there was a scramble alert in USAFB Aviano, Italy (which is located at 300&deg; 80nm from sighting location) on the 11th of March 1997 due to a wave of UFO sightings over the base. I don`t know if the news is valid, but I seek explanation of this and my further two sightings in it. Added in November 1997.", "Pilots at local airport watched unidentified craft for several minutes.At dusk this evening several pilots, myself included watched a mysterious craft.  I had just landed about 10 minutes before the sighting.  The air was relatively calm with a building of some very large dark clouds to the Northwest. I had just rolled my plane into the hanger when we heard other pilots talking about what they were seeing.  I immediatly went out and observed a craft that appeared to be dark or black in color.  It was first thought to be an ultra-light but appeared to be too large.  Darkness was rapidly closing in and no pilot without any lighting would continue to fly.  We kept listening for engine noise, but there was not so much as a whisper.  We watched it approach bearing about 080 degrees, at less than 3/4 of a mile it turned to about 360 degrees.  Our concensis was that it was about 1500 AGL, and moving at about 35-40 Kts.  As it banked North it was under the clouds but mostly obscured by a dark background.  Eventually it came back into clear sky, but had gained altitude, at least another 1000 feet or more. At this point with the darkness and distance we lost sight of it. I got a chance to see it with binoculars, it appeared to be chevron shaped.  In discussing the incident with the other pilots, we thought that the dimensions of this thing would have a cord of about 6-10 feet and a span of appx. 30-35 feet. Sorry, no one had a camera, and given the darkness would have been difficult.((NUFORC Note:  Date was corrected to 09/11/99, pursuant to correction by witness.))", "saw two bright objects aprox one eigth size of moon,in the southwest of the sky.there was a red beam joining the two objects.", "I witnessed a C130 military aircraft flying over. The plane had one large light flying along side the fusilage of the plane and one smaller light behind it. the sun hadnt quite gone down yet. So I could see the siloet of the plane. Both lights were a orange color. I probly would not have noticed. But, Being a student of aviation. I know that the training flight path for the Jacksonville airbase is to the west of Conway and runs from south to north. This plane was headed due east.", "The craft was flying at approx. 200 feet with no lights on.  It had no sound at all and we were able to see it clearly.  It appeared to be grey on the bottom and could of been black on the top.  It appeared to have come from a NW direction heading SE.  We watched it for perhaps 10 seconds and then it disappeared.", "A total of three crafts were seen, one of them branching off the other.First my nephew and I saw a bright moving light. Later, another smaller light branched off of it. After that, a bright light flashed over our house and sped across the sky quickly. They were not flashing.", "On the night of the Sept.01,1999 I observed within the space of 10 minutes 2 meteorites followed by a burst of light seen in the sky (clear sky). I was looking up in a WNW direction. I heard other reports of strange lights seen by others, not only on the Art Bell show but a radio station in Delaware on the East coast was taking reports on the air when I tuned in at 5:30 am.I was star gazing with my husband on Wednesday evening Sept 01 1999. We went outside at about 9:20pm with our night vision scope and binoculars-it was a clear night. I was facing WNW and observed with the unaided eye (except for my eyeglasses) a couple of shooting stars.  I thought it was strange to be seeing them, because the next meteor shower that I know of won&apos;t be untill Nov.17th. Then at around 9:30pm from the same direction, I then saw what I described to my husband as &apos;a white light that looked like it exploded&apos;.  It was a quick burst of light and then it was gone...like a pinpoint of light that burst out and got bigger.  It did not light up the whole sky, just a small diameter about the size of my pinky. I thought it was strange, but it could have just been a meteorite that entered in at about a 45 degree angle and exploded--untill I tuned into Art Bell&apos;s show and heard about all these people calling in about the lights they were seeing at about 9:30 coming in from the west. I couldn&apos;t believe it! I wondered if this was just a coincidence, because no one was reporting anything happening on the east coast...Not yet. Since Art Bell goes off the air at 5am in my area, I decided to tune in via the internet and picked call letters WGMD which is in Delaware. Art was supposed to be on that station till 6, but for some reason he wasn&apos;t. But when the host returned after commercials it was someone else&apos;s voice saying that people are calling in to ask if anyone else was seeing strange lights in the sky. I continued to listen for about a half hour as they were airing phone calls from the ones who observed them in the Delaware area. Obviously something country-wide or even bi-coastal was happening that night into the morning...not just on the west coast.", "I watched a black sphere slowly moving in a SW direction.I saw a black sphere slowly moving in a WSW direction. It was very black and the sun seemed to reflect off the front every now and then. There was no noise. I observed this from the airport fire station were I am stationed. It was going in a direction that the usual aircraft flight pattern comes from. It looked to be about a quarter mile away when first noticed at 340 degrees. In about 1 minutes time it seemed to be at 270 degrees and about 1 mile away. I had to leave then when a fire run came in. The next day I compared what I had saw to a black huey helicopter. The sphere was very black unlike the huey and might have been up to 10 feet in diameter as it was smaller than the helicopter at a comparable distance.", "90-degree turn by a meteorSaturday night, September 11, about 10:00 PM. Duncan Lake, about 15 miles south of Grand Rapids, MI. I was attending a party that we put on annually for the OR personnel of Butterworth Hospital/Spectrum Health Downtown. I had not partaken of any of the alcoholic beverages available that evening since I had been involved in the setup and firing of a rather extensive fireworks show for the party. Duncan Lake is on the southern approach flight path to the Kent County International Airport. Several of us were standing around in an open field discussing the fireworks. A northbound jet flew over on its way to the airport and I glanced up to look at it. As the jet passed, I noticed a typical meteor streak that flew from the north to the south. As it faded, I saw an additional streak that originated from the exact point where the first streak ended and flew perpendicular (from my perspective) to the path of the first streak, heading generall y west. The impression that I got was that the original object changed direction, executing a 90-degree turn without slowing down. This occurred within seconds of the jet passing by, but my feeling was that the jet had nothing to do with the incident other than drawing my attention to the sky. We had seen many meteors that evening, but this one was remarkable enough to cause me to ask my companions if they had noticed it. Unfortunately they had not. Logic tells me that this was probably a coincidental sighting of two separate meteors travelling on perpendicular paths. But I thought you might want to add it to your database", "What I thought was a satellite passing overhead burst into a flash of purple light. (See full description.)My wife and I were the only folks camping at the remote French Creek campground (a U.S. National Forest Service campground) the night of July 3, 1999. Around 9:45 p.m. I was sitting in a camping chair stargazing (my wife was sitting near me but was staring into the firepit at the remnants of our campfire) when I caught site of what I believed to be a satellite. It was a pinpoint of light,(about the brightness of a medium star), that in my estimation was travelling across the sky at a &quot;normal&quot; satellite rate. Just as the object approached in my 12 o&apos;clock position it exploded in a burst of purple light. This &quot;explosion&quot; lasted for 3-5 seconds. There was thin, whispy cirrus cloud apparently between the object and the ground. However, I find it highly unlikely that high altitude ice crystals could magnify a somewhat dim object manifold times. After the quick duration of the flash the object instantly resumed its previous light intensity and continued its traverse across the night sky (heading NNW, app. 320-340 degrees). I lost site of the object in a minute or so later owing to the mountainous landscape. My wife did not see the flash. I yelped just as the flash occured but she did not look up in time to see any of it. Further, she was not able to spot the object as it continued on its course.", "seen like airplane lights under partly cloudy conditions over Elko, but vanishhing in the clear portion of the night time sky.while going to restroom in the end of the hallway at my current residence I saw what I thought where airplane lights next thing I new the lights just stopped and went out", "Dark night, craft &quot;sliding&quot; erraticly from NW to SE, bright white lights spaced around in circle with millions of &quot;sparklers&quot; inbetween white lights, large white light in the middle.

Told friend a few weeks later and she and her husband saw it later but it was bright orange and not moving about five miles from out home.My husband is a college graduate and both the other observers are college graduates.", "Round bright light flying low at moderate speed over Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico. No sound or blinking lights.A round bright light was photographed flying over Cabo Rojo,Puerto Rico. There were no blinking lights or any sound heard.There was no electricity in the area thanks to Hurricane George, who assaulted us just one month before this object was spoted. A few months earlier I spoted this same object coming down from the sky and I thought that it was going to crash. I braced myself for impact but nothing happened.It was no shooting star or satellite because I know the difference.", "A few repeated, multi-coloured streaks of light in an apparently south-easterly directionAround midnight PST (Thursday), my friend and I had decided to go searching for some of our other buds who were supposed to meet up w/ us. We decided to check a favourite meeting spot. It is a cliff that overlooks the Strait of Georgia between Vancouver Island and the mainland. The area is isolated and high up from city lights so visiblility of the night sky is fairly good. As soon as our eyes became adjusted after exiting the car to look for our friends, my attention was diverted to the sky where I glimpsed a red streak of light travel south-easterly extremely rapidly. The streak of light was very long in covering a distance approximately a quarter of the night sky. The streak of light was not large in length. After the streak had dissapeared, subsequent differently coloured streaks were observed travelling in a similar direction but originating in a position west of the original streak. We thought that our eyes were decieving us until I heard the reports on Art Bell&apos;s ra! dio program. Brilliant show! The streaks and the radio program!", "Saucer shaped object in daytime nearly landed next to me.  When my mother ran out to me, it flew away.I was a small boy when this event happened to me.  This took place in late summer around 6:30 p.m.  It was in the evening and still light outside.  This was at my grandparents farm.  They were away on a trip and my mother and I went out to water plants and feed the dogs for them.  My mother was inside watering the plants.  I was outside by myself when all of a sudden I looked up and saw this silver object come  over the house and out to the back between the house and barn.  I think it was going to land.  It was a silver object with a dome in the center and round windows all around it.  It made no sound except a humming sound.  It began a slow decent around 25 feet from me.  All of a sudden my mother comes running out of the house towards me.  At this time the craft was maybe 15 or 20 feet from the ground.  As my mother neared me it began to go up very slowly to around maybe 150 feet, them zipped very quickly to the east.  My mother thought there intentions was to pick me up.  After this happened I had an encounter with a &quot;man in black.&quot;  Through the next several years me, my mother, brother and aunt had several sightings in the same area.  We seem to think maybe they somehow know us.  Is this possible?  Do you want me to Email you about my &quot;men in black&quot; experience?  Also about our other sightings?

It usually goes off at night once about every 4 to 6 months but never this loud and long(1 minute). I&apos;ve never ran outside before because I&apos;m a sleepy head, but this time I lied there awhile listening and thought something was hovering over my condo because the field was so strong. Then I ran out side and saw nothing, but my field of view is small due to other buildings. By the time I got back inside my meter was quite.

None of the lights blinked.  Then on the wing&apos;s tips there was a light, and these would change color.  The object was moving very slowly, with a low rumbling sound.  It stopped over our house.  When it stopped you could see that the object was a blueish-gray in color.  It blended in with the sky...but the stars were so bright here tonight.  So, when it passed over us...you could not see the stars.  That&apos;s how we saw the color of the object.  The size of the object was the size of a football field.

No Noise, no trailing lights nothing but this bright star that vanished. I don&apos;t want to be contacted.I think you&apos;re all are a bunch of nuts. Or at least I thought so. I will keep an eye on the website in the hope that someone else saw this thing or can explain to me what it was.", "Fast, noiseless, highly reflective object seenEarlier this afternoon, I was standing on the deck of my house (east side) when I happened to look up and see a bright, shining (looked like polished aluminum) seemingly spherical object moving from east to west across the sky.  The duration of the sighting was limited because the object was near the sun, making it necessary for me to use the eave of the house as a sun-block--which, in turn, meant that the object dropped beneath the roof of the house within perhaps 15-20 seconds.  By the time I could run to the other side of the house, I could no longer see it. In regards to the object itself, a number of things struck me as strange.  First, its shape: Unlike the many airliners that traverse the sky overhead, at altitude, during the course of any given day, this object had no wings that I could discern.  Second, and also quite unlike an airliner, the object made no sound whatsoever.  Third, it appeared to be moving at a rate well above that of an airliner. This is speculation on my part, but I would estimate--given what I would take to be the rough altitude of the object (20-30,000 ft.), and given its angular speed--that the object, whatever it was, was moving well in excess of the speed of sound.  This would seem to point to a military aircraft of some type...but, again, the object made no noise at all, and it is my experience that all jet-propelled aircraft, almost regardless of their altitude, make noise audible to people on the ground. As for myself: I am 23 years old, and a graduate of Harvard University.  I&apos;m currently at home, visiting my parents on their farm 2 miles east of the small town of Morrowville, KS.  I am a licensed pilot with an instrument rating.  My hearing is excellent, and my vision is 20/20 with glasses (which I was wearing at the time of the sighting).  Btw, the sky was clear during the sighting.", "I thought it was a starout on my deck looking at the stars, suddenly one started moving at a steady pace from south to north, no blinking lights, followed it until out of sight remained looking like a star,no colors.no twinkle. then it just disappeared,I thought maybe it was a sattalite,but not sure.We are in a flight path from PDX in Portland so am aware what airplanes look like. this was too high for an airplane, it remained as high as the stars look from the ground.I saw none of the characteristics you have listed. would it be possible to e-mail me at ((address deleted)) @aol.com. this is very puzzling to me. thank you, ((name deleted))", "My wife called me to the living room to see an ornange pulsating light. I watched it for a bit and it shot straight up, almost out of sight. I could still see the orange pulsating light, so I continued to watch it. It came back down and hovered. Then 4 lights came on and then a whole ring of lights revealing the shape of the object. Then, continuing to pulsate, like a nuclear reacter, the whole thing lit up bright orange. The dome top seemed translucent. The object we saw, was approx. 1/2 mile away and was incredibly huge. It hovered for a bit an slowly went below the treeline. I called the sheriffs dept., who in turn called Ft. Polk to see if any military exercises were going on. Ft. Polk had no comment. Shortly after I witnessed two planes flying a grid pattern. Numerous flashes of light were seen on the ground for airial photography. Also two helecopters on silent mode were searching the area for something. I waited till 1 am to see if it ever came back up. It didnt. It would easily have contained my house inside it.

We were just aproaching a small town called Hollymount with about 5 miles more until we would arrive home. I was having a conversation with my mother when I saw her staring at the sky. Suddenly something also caught my attention. It was like the headlights of an oncoming car,but it wasn&apos;t a car. It was an object to the right of the moon,slightly larger than the north star and brighter. It was round and looked like a small sphere. First we thought it was the north star but it began to move.  It was very shakey and unstable looking. Then I saw another object approaching it ,a plane. The sphere had being hovering in one place but as the plane got nearer the sphere began to move again. It moved from side to side quickly. It began to rise to the left. At this stage the plane was very near. Suddenly the object shot straight upwards to the right until we lost sight of it. The plane continued to follow the object but in a straight line until we also lost sight of that.

I tryed to tell my self that maybe a cloud or dust had blown between us and it to cause the color change, but the stars behind it did not change color. We had been looking at it for about ten min. when it change back to white, that is when we notice that a jet plaine apaired to be approching it. When the jet got close the object turned orange again and a beam of light from the object,[like a spotlight], lit-up the jet. The jet turned very fast and looked like it was circling around.

It appeared to be similar to a &quot;shooting star&quot; with a bright, white head and an orange firey tale.  It traveled across the sky in a straight direction until it was out of sight.This evening while barbequeing in the backyard, I was on my 2nd story deck facing westward when I looked up and noticed an orange tail behind an object traveling at a fairly high rate of speed.(faster than a commercial jet) I stood there for a few seconds watching this thing heading towards the sunset. It reminded me of a high-flying jet with a vapor trail, except this trail stayed the same length as it traveled. The &apos;head&apos; of the object looked like a very bright whitish color, kind of flashy while it was close, then only the bright orange tail was visible as it moved further away. It seemed to be turning gently more westward as it moved further away.  I would say it took maybe 4-6 minutes before it was completely out of sight, which I am guessing over the Olympic Mountains. My brother saw it through his binoculars and his best guess was that of a piece of space junk re-entering the atmosphere at a very shallow pitch. Or a metoer. He said he thought there might be a &apos;chaser&apos; plane, too. He said it was hard to tell because the trees were in the way.  He is an engineer at Boeing in Everett and has some pretty good knowledge about aerodynamics.  I finally got my wits and grabbed my 35mm camera!  Took 2 photos at the 90mm telephoto setting.  It was pretty far off in the distance when I took the pictures.  I will get the film developed this week and scan them for you if they turn out!   Wow!  How exciting to see it.

It fanned out from a zero point at ground level and spread out with distance. The light did not diffuse or dim over distance. For the short time we saw it,(about two seconds)it seemed to stretch to infinity in the night sky. One other detail is that the angle changed and tilted upward slightly as we observed it. It was without doubt, the most brilliant light I&apos;ve ever seen. I could also tell that this beam was a flat projection.

After a few tens of seconds I detected a movement of a very faint object above Coma Berenices, too faint to lock a naked eye on. Convinced it`s a satellite (because of its initial south-north polar movement) I checked it through binoculars (from now on observing through binoculars). In this second (from detection till the start of observation) the luminosity of object increased greatly. It grew in size from a dot to a dash-shaped object oriented perpendicular to its flight path. I know that angle of attack of a craft in orbit is of no importance, so in the next second I thought &quot;it`s a sattelite flying sideways&quot;. But then the dash started to rotate around my line-of-sight changing its direction fast towards east. Instead of travelling through UMa towards Cas (initial flight path would send it through zenith), I followed it through Bootes, Hercules to Cepheus (it lowered to the eastern horizon and then away towards north). Object was changing its bearing around 60&deg; to left and right of its general way (right-left-right turn duration approx. 3 seconds). After it passed through Hercules, size and brightness of object started decreasing, and in the vicinity of Cepheus disappeared quickly. Picture at: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Starship/6070/Stores/09-03-1997_0005_HRS.gif&quot;&gt;My Page&lt;/a&gt; Duration:  Approx. 1 minute Appearance:  Object was all-light, no visible hard parts, light could not be separated into series of lights. Light color: pale yellow (yellow-white), hat shaped with ratio width:depth = 5:1 Brightness (comparing to other stars): zero or less magnitude. Object was rotating and turning (R-L-R turn time approx 3 sec), flying perpendicular to its flight path. It did not have left-red and right-green lights, no blinking lights. At the end of observation brightness and size of object rapidly fell to zero. Even after 1 minute no sound could be heard from that direction (normally aircraft over eastern horizon are audible in night-time). Angular size of object (no binoculars):  approx. 0.1&deg; Angular velocity: not known. My conclusions:  Object behaved like no to me known aircraft. Due to hat-shaped object (with narrower end of &quot;hat&quot; trailing, hat oriented perpendicular to FP) of pale yellow color, I conclude the light was propulsion. Besides &quot;propulsion&quot; nothing could be seen. Due to knot known size of object and not very accurate angular size, distance to object and its velocity could not be determined. Later comments:  I read in a paper that there was a scramble alert in USAFB Aviano, Italy (which is located at 300&deg; 80nm from sighting location) on the 11th of March 1997 due to a wave of UFO sightings over the base. I don`t know if the news is valid, but I seek explanation of this and my further two sightings in it. Added in November 1997.", "Like a Meteor but it was larger, slower, brighter and more colorful.I was driving and heading toward the south and I thought at first that I was looking at a meteor coming down with a 30 to 45 degree angle towards the west.

I thought that it was about to hit the ground.", "A red light about the size and shape of a star moving at about the speed of a shooting star but with no tail.

There were other objects in the sky during the night which could be easily identified as airplanes by their blinking lights and their landing lights are only visable when they approach my vision and not when moving away from my vision. These lights were brighter than landing lights and moving away from me about 45 degrees from the horizon. There were no sounds like when aircraft fly over and lower than when I see satilites. The objects left no trail and disappered when they went behind cloud cover and reappeared on the other side. My computer was on inside the house but did not seem to be affected by the object.

HE LOOKED UP TO SEE WHAT I WAS SCREAMING ABOUT AND GOT A FULL VIEW.  THE TWO SPHERES FIRST TRAVELED SLOWLY TOGETHER, THEN PICKED UP SOME SPEED, CHANGING PLACES WITH EACH OTHER.

One person asked if they were seeing a satellite.  I said it looked just like a satellite, one point of light, travelling in a smooth arc across the sky, from the east to the west.  We saw it directly overhead looking to the north, so it was moving to the left.  All of a sudden, the object became very bright, and seemed to increase in size, to about the size and white color of Venus (or whichever planet is now visible to the east)and it continued to travel smoothly to the west.  The object dimmed and the size seemed to shrink to &quot;satellite&quot; size, then became very bright again.  Then the object appeared to change course slightly, then faded in brightness and size, very dimmly until it disappeared, roughly at the same zenith.  It seemed odd in that I had never seem a satellite change brightness, or fade from sight.  I can usually track satellites until it is obstructed by trees, or mountains, etc.  I don&apos;t think the apparent change in course was caused by the object passing near other stars as the eye looses track for a moment.  This time, the object seemed to change direction when it was not passing other stars.  Just after it faded, I looked back to the east and noticed another satellite, at about the same zenith, but it was travelling west to east.  I had not seen this satellite as I was looking at the one going to the west.  I would have thought I would have seen the two &quot;cross paths&quot;.  This satellite seemed normal, size, speed, color, brightness, direction etc. as other satellites I have seen before.  The night sky was very clear, no clouds, no wind, about 50 degrees.  We could clearly see the &quot;Milky Way&quot;.  We were just far enough from Portland that you could only make out a glow on the horizon to the north.   It was travelling at &quot;satellite speed&quot; and there were no streaks, sparks, or trails like I have seen with &quot;shooting stars&quot;, plus it was travelling much slower. I am a male, 34 years old, that works for a State Agency in an Engineering field.  I have a B.S. deg! ree. I w as with two women, both who have Masters degrees.  The forth person was a male child, age 6.  He was the one who first saw the object, and he became very frightened.  He was afraid it was going to land!  We had to try and convince him that it was a satellite, but we all wondered about it.((NUFORC Note:  If the facts contained in the report are correct, the object probably was not a satellite.  Technical reasons seem to militate against its being a manmade object in orbit.))", "Observed through binoculars a bright light moving from north to south at a high rate of speed.I was laying in my hammock looking at the sky when I noticed several bright objects.  I retreived binoculars to observe what I believed to be helium balloon clusters that had been released.  While verifying that they were indeed balloons I noticed a fast moving light pass behind the balloons. I tracked the light with binoculars until I lost sight of it behind some tall trees. The light was 1/8 inch in diameter at arms length as seen through 8 X 23 power binoculars and appeared fuzzy, rather than a single spot of light.  Light tranversed 1/3 of the horizon in approximately 5 seconds in a north to south direction.

I expected the meteor to disintigrate, as most do after they fall to the earth, but as it approached zenith, the object began to have a  glowing white trail after it, so I assumed it was a fighter jet, but the object made no sound like a jet and made no jet trail. A little past zenith, in the eastern part of the sky the object began to slow down and without any indication, the object split into four separate parts, a bright, large portion that continued on the original path of northwest to southeast, and three smaller pieces that went northeast, northwest and southeast. The smaller pieces from the object were just like the original, except they were smaller and they were yellow instead of gold. Almost immediately after ejecting the ! three smaller objects, the large one vanished, then the other three objects vanished a half second later. The object, which became three seperate, but similar objects was visible in the sky for about a minute, and after it was over I finished drinking my coke and went inside my home.  I thought nothing else about this event until two days later on September 3 when my father mentioned an object had been seen on Wednesday and had been talked about on Art Bell&apos;s program, something I&apos;d not heard that night.

We agreed that it looked much like a shooting star.Wednesday, September 1, 1999 at approximately 9:30 p.m., my husband and I were traveling eastbound on hwy. 37 in Marin County, Ca.  The location was approximately 1.5 miles from the Black Point/Atherton exit.  We saw in the sky directly above our car what looked like three long, thick, fingers of light traveling at a very slow speed, they looked very much like super high beam headlights shining through a thick fog, (there was no fog that night).  We continued to watch this light show while we looked for a place to pull over on the highway.  As the lights crossed directly over hwy. 37, we saw what looked like a small missile, or shooting star, shot off the side into an easternly direction.  The lights looked as if they had come from a north/west direction, and they were crossing over hwy. 37 in a south/east direction.  At the time of observation, my mouth filled with the taste of having bit down on aluminum foil on a tooth filling.  I had the sensation of metal emitting from an upper back crown in my mouth.  This taste stayed with me for approx. 10 minutes after the viewing.  The next morning I woke up with the insides of my lips feeling sunburned. When we arrived home (which is 1 mile north off of hwy. 37) our 12 year old daughter told us that she had been sound asleep and was woken by the popping sounds of the vertebra in her neck, her mouth was filled with a &quot;bad taste, like a burning taste&quot;.  At this point she looked up through her bed side window and saw bars of bright light going over our house.  She remembers that her bed side clock read 9:30.  The three of us felt exhausted the next day.  We all sensed that what we saw was some kind of pre-empt of something much larger to come.

There were two levels of clouds. The lower clouds were wispy, about 8,000 feet I&apos;m told.   I took a break and looked East.   I was looking at approximately a 45 degree angle thinking how nice the day was and observed a dirty copper colored round disc appear.  The disc appeared to be travelling Southbound. I observed the disc appear to bank to it&apos;s left as I could see the bottom of the disc, and it&apos;s shape - round.  The best I can describe is hang an object from a string. Push it away, and as it swings back you&apos;ll see the bottom for about that long in time.   This object was huge.  It then disappeared as fast as it appeared.  I never saw it until it started to bank, and it disappeared after banking.   It was unbelievable at the time. It was above the lower cloud level. Using basic geometry, if the clouds are about 8,000 feet and I&apos;m looking at an approximate 45 degree angle then A squared plus B squared equals c squared.   ( right triangle )  My best guess is it was 2 1/2 miles away.  I have travelled to the country and gotten about 2 1/2 miles from barns to estimate the size of this object.

It was turning low over the trees about 300 feet away to the east (near the Mormon Temple) and the closest thing I could attribute it to was a miniaturized Stealth Fighter.  It couldn&apos;t have been more than 20 feet long, and it seemed incredibly thin ... no more than a few feet in depth.  I directed the driver&apos;s attention to it, and he caught a small glimpse of it as well.  It was headed towards Lake Sammamish, keeping low to the trees and I lost site of it after 10 seconds or so.  Not sure what I saw, but it was no bird and no aircraft I have ever seen.

The object was lit really softly..it was very hard to see until it was right overhead..it sounded like wind rustling through the leaves. It moved from due north to south..and was approx.300-500 ft above ground...or it was way bigger than I thought..I was about the width of a quarter held at arms length.At 2315 a formation of three military helicopters came from due south moving north approximating this objects attitude..these were really low to the ground..about 200 ft altitude", "20;00 hrs 25 degrees above horizon to the NE two objects a few degrees apart looked like stars, then suddenly began to move North and dissappeared at high speed, could not be jets or helicopters due to acceleration from stationary!", "Stationary lights seen surrounded by circular cloud that shrank in diameter to nothing.I was taking the trash out at a dark end of the house and happened to notice a bright white light (like a landing light on an aircraft) about 5-10&deg; over the southern horizon and I&apos;d estimate it to have been 6 or 7 miles away over the Santa Cruz Mountains. I&apos;d heard that a couple of planets were in alignment and were very bright appearing so I stopped and studied it thinking that it might&apos;ve been those planets. It was a perfectly clear night sky, no clouds but this light had a perfectly round cloud around it. I&apos;d estimate it was 3 times the diameter of the Moon. the light was close enough to nearby trees, chimneys, ets that I could tell it was stationary. In the course of 2 or 3 minutes the cloud reduced in size and visibility as did the bright light in the center of it until it vanished. It was very even how it got smaller and dimmer and staying absolutely round. No drifty breaking up like a cloud would do. I went inside and told my wife about it then got my binoculars and! several minutes later went back out to look around and saw the same exact thing all over again from the same direction except it was maybe twice a s far away and it was quite a bit smaller and dimmer by the time I saw it and it was very close to the horizon of the Mountains (but behind them) and I couldn&apos;t really get any more detail with the binoculars. I should mention that this part of the sky is a flight path for incoming aircraft I assume for SFO International. I&apos;ve been around long enough to know that incoming aircraft with landing lights on move and get bigger, not smaller as they approach and don&apos;t have accompanying clouds. I was an aircrewman in the Navy and have some experience in looking for aircraft in the skies. I described this to a TWA pilot friend of mine and he didn&apos;t have a clue what I&apos;d seen. That&apos;s about it.", "A self luminous eliptical object was seen to be descending towards the horizon.I would like to state for the record that I was not the person who witnessed the UFO, however it was brought to my attention by people who knew about my interest in such matters. The object was sighted very close to the setting sun, initially it was thought to be an aircraft off in the distance, as it wqas thought that it was reflecting the sunlight off the surface of the craft.  On later discussion we decided that this could not be the case because the sun was behind it and therefore could not be reflecting off it. The object which was oval in shape was seen to decend to below ground level, we were on top of a hill overlooking China Lake, and we later determined that it must have been many miles in the distance as the object was so small.  It didn&apos;t move at speed or stop and start it&apos;s descent, it just gradually descended to below the hight we were observing from. There were potentially 100+ obserevers, however many of these were in medatation at the time.  And I myself who is normally engaged in the persuit of scanning the skies for things which are out of place, had my head burried in a book.  I do remember however, that there was very little cloud cover over the sky and the day had been very hot (over 100 degrees).((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting may be approximate.

I noticed it because of how fast it appeared to be moving.   I stopped to see what it was.  In a matter of seconds the object stopped and hovered in front of me, I was excited and scared, and went to turn my car around and get the ..... out of there.

It resembled an airplane, but was not moving up, down, or side to side.  The lights were changing from red, blue, green, and possibly white or yellow.  The object was unlike any other thing that was in the night sky.  I looked at it through binoculars and it was still a speck in the sky, but the colors were very clear using the binoculars.  I am a police officer and work night shift and I have never seen anything like this before and I really am not a UFO believer, but this was something that I can not explain.  Also, I observed what appeared to be a similar object on the same date at 0545 hours, just before I got off of my shift, in Pigeon Forge, TN in the south eastern sky and several other Officers saw it as well.  My Sergeant said that it was a planet and that the atmosphere was making it change colors, but I have never seen a planet do that.", "While waiting outside of building to clock in we saw a large glowing object with a red tail of fire slowly travel from the west to the southeast horizon. It never fell.While me and some co-workers were waiting in front of the building that we clock in for work, one of the women of our group exclaimed,&quot; Hey! That looks like something is on fire in the sky. At first we laughed until we looked up toward the north of us and saw what looked to be a large object glowing flying through the sky with a steady red tail of flame. It appeared to be traveling from the west and slowly turning toward the southeast. At that time of the morning there were no planes in the air and very little lights around the campus. There was no doubt that it was not a lighting illusion or an airplane. This kept a steady distance from the ground all the while we witnessed it. I ran further into the parking lot to keep it in sight until it was covered from sight by trees. I have no doubt in my mind that it was still at the same altitude even as it disappeared over the horizon. If it had been a plane in that much trouble we would have seen it go down way before it went out of our sight.", "A disc shaped object glowing a dull red fading to magenta moving at extreeme velocity moving from north-northeast to the southwest over Mount Vernon.Sorry Peter, I didn&apos;t see this form before e mailing you. The object made no sound, had no lights, no haze or beams, no trail like a piece of space debris (or another Russian booster!) and was only visible through 45 degrees of arc because of backscatter from ground light.

And I saw floating towards me was 3 orbs.I was facing S,SW. And I thought they where baloons at first but they were floating E.-against the slight breeze and as I was watching them they formed a triangle.For a few seconds.Then 1 orb left the other 2-it went lower and the others stayed about the same height. I was still watching them through the telephoto lens(70-210mm) as they continued to move East.When I noticed that one was flashing and it looked red.It was paired with the other orb that stayed higher.As it got closer I could see it spinning and it was a cube.It had flat sides that were catching sunlight and making the flashes.And it was spinning on its diagonial-or point. I could`t tell if either orbs were spinning or not.And I kept watching them -the cube&amp;orb seemed to be heading slowly away from me going S. The closer orb kept heading slowly E and it came up again in height but still lower than the other two. And then I hear a prop-plane coming towards me and between me and the &quot;objects&quot;. The plane was heading Westward and when it got about to the end of my backyard it turned around and seemed to want a closer look at the orbs/objects!!The plane never did come W again. I lost where it went because I was watching the orbs/objects until they faded out of sight- towards the South. I have some 35mm photos and negitives if you want them.

The object took approximately 10 to 15 seconds to make the transit. The object was in sharp focus, not fuzzy at all. The moon was also in focus at the time. It appeared as if out of nowhere on the eastern edge of the moon, travelled across the moon&apos;s face from east to west, then disappeared into the black sky at the moon&apos;s western edge. I looked to see if it was visible with the naked eye after it had passed the moon, but it was not. I do not recall exactly which eyepiece I was using at the time, but I am sure the magnification was somewhere in the 30x to 60x range.

I heard an airplane above so I looked up.  When I looked up, I saw the airplane, but I also saw the object.  The object was stationary.  The airplane moved underneath the object, but you could tell that the object was very much higher than the airplane (the plane was at least at 15,000 feet), possibly by many thousands of feet.  After the airplane passed, I kept looking at the object, trying to figure out what it was.  It looked like one of those rectangular parachutes, that sort of shape.  It was brown in color.  It made no movements at all and no noise that I could tell.  I told my wife to look up and I had to point it out to her because it was so high up that it was very small and I had to have her look off the point of my finger to see it.  She did see it and she could not make out anything more that what I saw.  We watched it for about 5 minutes or so and it never moved.  I told my wife that it must be a geostationary sattelite in orbit and we went on with our business.", "Yellow illuminated cylinder in eastern Saskatchewan -- 8/1973In August of 1973 I was traveling with a group of people on a missions trip in eastern Saskatchewan.  We were traveling west toward Regina, probably on Canada 1.  (Reason for vagueness noted below.) It was at night -- very dark.  I saw an illuminated cylindrical-shaped object -- the illumination was yellow in color.  There was a red light -- like a cherry -- but I forget if it was on top or on the bottom.  There seemed to be some rotation. The object was north of the highway and paralleled us for several minutes.  It was at a distance.  I forget how it disappeared.  There is no recollection of any missing time or any thing like that. I was in high school at the time.  I did not think I was seeing a UFO at the time.  It was August 1973, and I thought I was seeing Skylab.  (I couldn&apos;t explain why Skylab would seem to be paralleling our course, but I thought it might be an effect of the northern atmosphere.)  I no longer think this is the case -- I now doubt such details on Skylab would not be visible from the ground -- and I am certain I was not seeing northern lights.  I suppose it could have been an airport control tower at some distance, but only someone living in the area could tell me that. My recollection is a bit hazy on some details because I was in high school at the time and made not attempt to record any details because, as I mentioned, I did not think it significant at the time.  There were several of us traveling together in a van -- I know a few of us in the back discussed it while it was present in the sky, but I don&apos;t know how many people actually saw it.  I have since reconsidered my point of view and since the sighting was so vivid think it is worthing noting in your historical database.  For no reason other than curiosity would be interested in knowing if anyone else had a similar observation at that time and place; however, given how long ago this sighting was I doubt if I can supply any additional information.", "Watching the full moon with binoculars(6/28/99 9:30 cst) I witnessed two objects cross left to right,steady speed,appeared close to the moon,no lights,dark against the light of full moon. They traveled about five minutes apart.This is a discription of the events I witnessed on 6/28/99 from the pages of my day planner. I saw something strange. We was looking at the full moon at about 9:30pm cst with my binoculars when an object flew in the light of the moon from left to right. The event lasted a few seconds. It looked dark, no lights, elongated, steady speed, it appeared to be close to he moon. The moon was full and clear(you can easily see craters etc.) My wife was with me at the time though we only have one pair of binoculars. I was so surprised that I continued to watch the moon and about five minutes later I saw a similiar object move from left to right across the bottom quarter of the moon. It looked longer or closer then the first sighting. It was similiar to the first, no lights, black against the moon, Steady speed. I thought I saw a sparkle the second time as it left the light of the moon and into the darkness.

Object flew down from behind us in a desent entering our field of view. We wached it fly very low and slowly all the way across Gardner Lake. When it reached the other side it stopped and hovered for a few minutes next it desended to the groung and landed. We could still see the light from it shinning through the Pine trees at night. After sitting on the groung for a few minutes it next began to rise back up to its original altitude and hovered for a few more minutes. Next it began to move towards the SE. Its rate of acceleration seemed to increase very rapidly, so much so after a few ( may be 10 sec ) it was traveling like a bulet. It disapeared going off in the SE.", "Heard at least 2 low flying jets.I was at my desk at home at approximately 9:30PM on the night of Sept 1,1999.

I live in the &quot;West Slope&quot; (on maps) district of (East) Beaverton Oregon new city limits, but I still have a Portland mailing addess.  They sounded like they were headed in a southerly direction. When things are that low you can tell.  I know the sound of commerical jets high in the sky, since the home is on the North-South flight path.

All of a sudden, we both saw a cylinder - shaped object about 50 feet off of the ground and about 300 yards away.  It was transparent , bit inside of the see-thru object were lights flashing-green, red blue, yellow, and white lights. We both saw this object as soon as we walked outside.  While we were stunned staring at it, my dog started barking at it and running thru the field toward it. As soon as my dog got near it, it stated moving away at incredible speeds, so fast that it took about five seconds for it to fly out of sight.

They were not airplanes.  They had no flashing lights.  They were a white, cloudy color--round/oval in shape, with long comet-like tails. They were close to each other and moving in perfect unison.  We observed their movement for approximately 7 seconds, before they &quot;disappeared into thin air!&quot;I am an amateur astronomer who has stargazed in the past from this location (the back deck of my best friends house in Marin Country).  She lives on a hill with a fabulous view all the way to the East Bay.  We went out to the deck around 9:15 p.m. after I commented on &quot;what a beautiful and clear night it was!&quot; My friend turned out the patio lights and indoor lights near the deck so we could better observe the stars. It took about 15 minutes before my eyes adjusted to the darkness.  I was standing,  facing  east when something caught my eye up in the sky to the northeast.  I saw what looked like 3 moving clouds--I stared very closely and quickly observed that these WERE NOT CLOUDS.  They were moving objects that I could not identify or had ever seen before in my life.  I turned to my friend and asked her &quot;do you see what I see over there?&quot;  She looked where I pointed in the sky and immediately replied &quot;YES YES--I see them too!&quot;  We could NOT believe our eyes!  Thank God we were together when we observed these objects! We watched in silence until they disappeared from view.  Then we took turns describing to each other what we had just seen, and found that our sightings had been identical.  We both saw 3 white, cloudy, round/oval shaped objects with long, comet-type tails.  We both remarked at their &quot;exact synchronized movement&quot; travleling in the same direction. My friend and I are &quot;best friends&quot;  and we both are psychic people, especially with each other.  We thought it was incredible that this was our first ever UFO sighting, andthat we had been together when we witnessed it!   We continued to scan the sky for several minutes but did not see them again.  I did see airplanes in the area both before and after the sighting.  I&apos;m certain that the time was around 9:30 p.m. because when we went indoors to check the time, it was 9:35 p.m. On my drive home to Sonoma, I listened to Art Bell&apos;s &quot;Coast to Coast&quot; Radio show.  By coincidence (or synchronicity?), he had Peter Davenport on the air! They had received several calls from people on the west coast reporting mysterious sightings.  One caller was from Novato, CA -- which is just a few minutes/miles from where my friend lives!  I called the show and was surprised that I got on the air--where I gave Art a summary of my sighting! I would like to emphasize that I stargaze almost every night--from different locations.  I know a star from a planet from a meteor, comet, etc.  I am also very familiar with the flight paths of aircraft in these locations.  THIS WAS NO AIRPLANE!  THERE WERE NO FLASHING LIGHTS!

At the time, I was looking to the west at the Big Dipper when I noticed what appeared to be a satellite out of the corner of my eye, moving to the south.  The altitude was right for a satellite.  As I was about to dismiss the object as a satellite, I noticed another object trailing the first at the exact same speed, and in the same path.  The distance between the two objects had to be incredible.  As I watched these objects for a minute or so, the second object accelerated.

I could still see the lights as we entered Gila Bend&apos;s business district. The lights always remained stationary.  Smaller lights seemed to split off from the right edge of the rightmost light, do a very quick arc and return.  The light from the small ones lit up the background clouds. No sound was heard.  We tried to take a photo but it didn&apos;t turn out. This was the same night as the famous &quot;Phoenix Lights&quot; were seen.((NUFORC NOTE:  Location of these lights may be important to understanding the nature of the events that took place later in the eventing, e.g. after 2100 hrs..  This is the only report NUFORC has seen to date, which indicates an earlier time.  We believe that they had nothing to do with the object(s) seen over Henderson, NV; Paulden, AZ; Prescott, AZ; Dewey, AZ; Cordes Junction, AZ; Phoenix, AZ; Casa Grande, AZ; Tucson, AZ; and Kingman, AZ. ))", "saw red light over lake. dived into two one changed color revoled around each other. merged togeter shot stight up.As I was riding my bicyle to work I saw a bright red light hovering over lake Minona this light was bright egnough to reflect of the water.

Larger and brighter than Venus.  Trailed toward Earth much like a meteor.  I did not witness a change in course or speed but it did change from a brilliant green to a glowing red ember just before fading away.  No noises are associated with the siting.  My line of site was obscured by tree branches at first but it traveled Northward into a clear opening.  It appeared to cross the path of an airliner in the vicinity but the airplane seemed much farther away.  The fireball seemed to be 2-3 miles West of my position.  It was much slower, larger, brighter and more colorful than any shooting star I have ever seen.", "my son and I were fishing in a canoe and we noticed a light in the sky that was traveling in spurts of distance.  It was not a steady line of travel and it circled around.My son acted like a plane that was dragging a banner.  After a short time of its circling over head, two other lights with a red glow began following it.  Where ever the large light went the other two crafts followed behing it.  Then all of a sudden the two crafts just seemed to join the large craft and became just one.  Also about a month ago, while sitting on my porch, I witnessed to large white balls of light, that just seemed to explode and then would show up on my left and explode again.

I ran out just in time to watch it move out of view.My husband said, as it was sitting still it was much larger. By the time i got out there (30 secs) it of course got smaller as it got further away. The shape was disk-like. The color, white (silver?).

Observed fireball with other cars stopped by side of highway for approx. 20 minutes.I was driving eastbound on Interstate 90 going towards the ID&#x5C;WA State line and I noticed 3 cars parked on the side of the highway. Then I glanced up at the east sky and I saw what appeared to be a fireball. My first thought was that it could have been an airplane on fire. It was approx. 200 feet above the ground. After driving closer to it I noticed it was spinning at a high rate of speed in a very tight circle. I am color blind so I could not observe what color it was.  It appeared to be hovering at this time. For the last 2 or 3 minutes it appeared to be in motion going away from us toward Spokane WA. Then entire event lasted approx. 20 minutes until it was completely out of sight. The light level was dusk almost dark. I am a student at North Idaho College.", "As I left my house, I noticed to the northeast a fireball descending to the horizon behind the mountains surrounding our valley. I originally told Peter 5 secs duration, but it was more like 1-2 secs.the object was a large flaming (white) fireball with a tail and the flames seemed to be flickering even at a distance. Object descended and disappeared from view rapidly at an approximate 45 degree angle to the horizon, although since it was moving directly away from me, it was difficult to assess the angle of descent. I was surprised at the intensity of the light, since it was so close to the earth. I am a 64 year old male - former musician, and language scholar. I am returning to college for the first time in 20 years. I have seen one UFO in my life in 1954 while I was at Harvard. There was no question about that one.", "While listening to Peter Davenport on Art Bell&apos;s Show 9-7-99 about the UFO reports out of Oregon, I decided to go outside during the break to go outside and take a look for UFO&apos;s. After about 2 minutes of observation I spotted a 3 light formation directly overhead moving slowly from N.W. to S.E. Estimated altitude was minimum 40,000ft. to orbit altitude. The formation was  that of a triangle if you connected them together but not a perfect triangle (all three sides would be different lengths) I do not believe this was one object but 3 separate objects since stars could be seen between them. Each object was not larger than a star or satelite. Each one of the lights were moving in sync with each other as if connected. After about 5minutes of travel across the sky (observed through binoculars) each light separately went out with the last light to go out being the brightest. I am a Private pilot (glider rating) and have 100&apos;s of UFO sighting&apos;s (90%) daytime -one as close as 50 feet!", "5 objects n/ne of observation point, minimum movement, appeared to be hovering in circular pattern.  Could not estimate distance.Was sitting on porch having coffee with a friend when I noticed an odd color in the sky to the n/ne of us.  It appeared stationery, not moving as an aircraft would.  Aircraft was also in the sky &amp; you could tell they were moving.  I got my binoculars to observe it and saw there were 5 objects, 1 with very bright lights &amp; 4 with the same pattern of lights but dimmer.  Lights were rotating (like the road signs that go from one side to the other) clockwise but the brightest one was barely moving in a counter-clockwise pattern.  The lights on all objects were red, green, yellow and white..in order on an outer band.  The lights appeared synchonized.  Lighting was same on all of them.  The largest object was circular with a slightly domed top that looked like an open super structure on a building.  We watched these objects for approx 45 minutes &amp; then, suddenly, they disappeared.  Later that evening other people in the community called &amp; asked if we had seen this. I am a 35 yr old professional long distance truck driver.  My friend is a 38 yr old housewife, her husband also came out to see it.  He is a 44 yr old computer specialist.  Others who called to say they had seen it was the wife and daughter of a local pastor.", "Red star-like object in the northeast sky.The object appeared in the northeastern sky it was a bright red light. It was approximately the size of the planet Venus. It was very bright for minutes at a time and then dim itself to a point where it was no longer visable and just as fast as it dimmed it would brighten. I would describe it as a flickering. At the time of one the flickers, myself and another witness observed the the lights in our backyard dim in sequence with the flickering light in the sky. At the same time my brother who was inside the house told us his T.V. and cable box had shut off. The object moved very slowly towards the north. It moved so slow we hadn&apos;t realized it had moved until we all were looking at the object at a different point in the sky. The object finally disappeared from our site after about 15 minutes. It began to dim again and slowly faded from view.", "Observed fireball with small tail in slow swirling motion, then observed a series of orange lights in a perfect V formation.Saturday night Sept.4 around 9:20 pm or so, driving north on rt. 35 coming from Eaton, OH heading to I-70 west to continue on to Indianapolis visiting family.  My family and I were just coming around the curve were rt35 conects with I70w and I saw an unusual light off to my left (sw). It appeared to be a plane at first but only one yellow/white light and no other colored blinking lights.  I noticed my wife in the passenger seat looking at it also.  About the time I was rounding the entrance ramp omto I70w, I noticed it had formed a short tail of fire or sparks.  From the direction of the tail (angled upward and to the right) it looked to be falling like a meteor, but much, much slower.  My wife and I were comenting and speculating to each other about what we were seeing, this all while I was merging into busy intersate traffic.  I continued to watch and look for a good spot to pull over at the same time.  As I continued to observe the object it did not appear to be falling! but instead the short tail slowly changed position around the ball of light, making it look like it was now spinning very slowly. The trees along the roadside made it hard to see and we lost sight of it several times, but I finally pulled over and grabbed my video camera.  As I rolled my window down and started filming, the tail was gone and it just appeared as a ball of light again.  Frustrated because I was having trouble focusing on the object, I pulled the camera down and my wife and I observed the object nearing the tree line which seemed to be several miles away.  Just before it reached the tree line the ball disappeared and a large triangle formation of orange lights appeared pointing torward the southwest.  We only saw this formation for a few seconds then it dropped beyond our view.  Setting there as the trucks rushed by discussing what we just saw, I recall seeing a second triangle fromation in front of the first pointing at the first, almost forming an x.  My wi! fe states she saw a line of lights coming from the front of the V.  Re gardless, the V formation was made up of nine lights, four on each side of the center one.  All lights appeared to be the same intensity.  We pulled of at the next exit and scanned the skys for an hour with no other sightings, other than what appeared to be a military plane circling the area.", "I was in the school parking lot when I looked up to a hill across the street and saw a orange glow.I was in the school parking lot when I looked up to the hill across the street and saw a orange ball.

At the stop light we observed, in the northwest sky a very bright white light that was rectangular in shape, heading in a westerly direction.  It was observed between one power line and it approximately filled that space. The lenght was approximately three to four times the width.  It did not appear to be moving but instead the rotation of the earth covered it with a small dark cloud for about 8 to 10 seconds, and then as the earth continued to move it went behind the mountain.  The sky had dark small clouds and the sun was not shinning.  Where there were no clouds the sky was a dull bluish gray.  The front of the object appeared to be flat and as we looked towards the end of the object the bright white grew fainter and the end looked some what like a thinning tail.  It&apos;s trajectory appeared to be flat and parelell with the earth.  The overall size of the object was about one third of a full moon.

I start work one evening and go home the next morning and dates run together. I was by the location of occurrance this morning and found i was in error. I apologize for any problems I may have caused. It WAS the same morning as the sighting of objects in Tampa.

I looked up towards the Western sky (10 o&apos;clock above horizon) and observed 3 objects moving North to South. Distance out from my location was approx 5 miles West of me. I was at 14050 Boggs Dr. Miami, Fl Approx 144 street and SW 112 Ave. The 3 objects had a blueish-green color and at times had a yellow fire like tail. They were no in straight line center object was a little lower than front or rear object. I am familiar with aircraft landig patterns in area and these were not in that pattern. If I were to guess at their speed it would be 200 mph. Like a plane coming in for a landing type speed. Objects dissappered for approx 5-10 sec. Possibly going behind a cloud. We were having some lightning storms down here. Then they reappeared in the same level continuing South-SW in direction. The objects had a &quot;cone&quot; effect like photos a a missle shot where missle causes a white cone to precede it. As said at times objects had a fire like tail. I told my wife when I got home as as ususal comment of being tired was brought up. On the news that evening local TV station (WSVN ch7, FOX affiliate) had a short blip on the sighting in Tampa,Fl. They also had a video clip. There video clip showed the center object higher than the front or rear object. I do not know if you can get copy of the clip Mr Rick Sanchez was the news achorman giving the report.They said officials said it was the booster rockets from a Russian space ship.  I do listen to Art Bell. I heard of the supposed booster entry from last week. I heard the interview with the Dr/Pastor from Tampa, Fl.  This is to let you know it was also seen here in Miami, Fl. Dr/Pastor said his time was prior to 0500,  i think he said 0445 while getting newspaper. I observed objects at approx 0503 hr. These did not appear to be a meteor. I can not give a shape description beacuse of the distance away. News report said going for a Gulf of Mexico splash down. It is along way from where i saw objects to Gulf of Mexico. It is! 90 mile s to Naples where Gulf is. I am about 260 miles South of Tampa,Fl   I like alot of people hesitate to report these because of the fall out of reports. But enough is enough.

The object slowed down and finally went level and light quickly dimmed, and object appeared to landWe, my girlfriend and I, were sitting on my car at the Texas Ranger ballpark about 3a.m..  We both had summer jobs at the park and were saying goodnight after seeing a late movie.  The object looked like a cigar (saucer from a side view) and in July in Dallas there is a haze.  The light which was a bright green lit up the sky (in the general proximty, as it entered the area (trajectory-planet re-entry) perhaps even steeper than 45 degrees. I knew it was not a metorite, because I have been real close, &lt;.5mi when I was a youngster, and had just finished 2/4hr. courses on astronomy.  Furthermore, as it neared the ground, it de-acclerated tremendously.  Gravity forbids (my understanding of physics) meteors from doing this. The green &apos;haze&apos; quickly dimmed as the object slowed and leveled and shortly thereafter, continued its angle of decent, as it slowed it became faint and finally disappeared all together.  The proximty of the sighting was somewhat close to DFW airport, it was moving to fast and appeared and disappeared to quickly to be an aircraft. We chased, but really had no idea as to the actual distance of the object. I told my father about the sighting and he told me he had heard of several sighting the general area of DFW airport in that general time frame. The green light looking like a craft slowing down at high speed, and the light was a shield or barrier to protect the craft. One last detail we were looking west towards Dallas, but the Ballpark was along I-30 and well south of the airport. I did not know of anyway of reporting the incident before now, and unlikely the information will be of any use, but the story is very accurate.", "Greenish blue fireball which appeared to be quite large in size.

I get up very early to go to work. Just a few days ago as I was leaving my trailer, I noticed a strange light coming from the field across the road. I thought it was a big truck, or something but I soon realized it was not. It was a strange object that just glowed and moved around the edge of the woods. Now I have never seen anything like this before, and I had always hoped that I would, but dang if I didn&apos;t nearly go in my pants when that thing started moving toward my trailer. It hovered over head for about 3 minutes, changing colors every few seconds. I can tell you it made no sound, but I could feel the heat coming off that thing. I just stood there, scared to death! Suddenly there was no light, and it looked to be metallic and about 35 feet across. I am not sure what color, because It was so bright before my eyes could not adjust. It shot straight up in the sky and disappeared. I nearly passed out. I could not even go into work that day. All I could do was sit on the couch and shotgun budweisers till I passed out. I still get scared when I think of what happened. I am really scared it might come back. I have had the runs ever since I saw it. Do you suppose I was abducted? I need some help! I had to tell somebody, but I have been too scared. I have not been sleeping, or eating, or living since that morning. I am sure with time, I will adjust. Thanks for listening.

As it was white in color, it looked like the shape of one of space shuttles, but without the nose or tail fins. There were no markings. It definitely too big to be a plane up that high. We watched it for a few seconds move south to north, then it disappeared behind a cloud.  I watched for it for several minutes, but I couldn&apos;t find it again. Living in rural NH I have seen at least two other UFO&apos;s - the first was on Nov. 1, 1989. A bright light caught my attention, then, separately, a huge triangle shaped object hung low in the air making no sound. We have also seen series of white lights forming a large V fly over the area a few years ago. We have also woken to bright lights shining in our 2nd floor bedroom windows from above late at night - with no sound associated with aircraft.

At first looked like a shooting star but was slower and then changed direction.  Appeared in yard (about 3 acre lot) just IN FRONT of the tree line then dropped into the valley and she lost sight of it.  He impression was that it landed on the neighbor&apos;s lot.

The object then moved vertically and disappeared.On the 27th of August 1999, my brother and I were traveling westbound on I70. My brother first noticed a light in the western sky. He turned and asked me what it was. He had been observing this light for approximately 30 seconds before I saw the same light. We both then observed this light from approximately 1950 to 2000 hrs. During this time the object or light remained suspended. It looked to be 10,000 to 15,000 feet in the air. We noticed that the object seem to have a black line that ran vertical through 3/4 of the length of the object. The object had a distinctive steady yellowish orange light. At approximately 2000 hrs. it then begin to move slowly in a vertical direction. It took approximately 3 to 5 seconds before it disappeared completely.

I looked out of the dock door between the trailer and the top of the door. I saw something I did not recognize.  I told my co-worker to &quot;look at that.&quot;  He asked me what I was looking at.  We both moved one door south and looked out.  Traveling from north to south was an object that I only could describe as a glass cigar tube with smoke in it and three equally spaced blue lights.  It was not foggy that night.  The moon was clearly visible.  We watched this for approx. 20-30 seconds.  There was no sound at all.

It was a brighter white than the whitest clouds.I was driving (I believe toward Seattle, but I am not sure which direction I was driving), and I saw a perfectly square object between two clouds. I moved my head in all directions, thinking it might be a reflection in my windshield. It remained as white and square as it first appeared.  I was so shocked that I failed to note the time, direction or even the date of the event. In seconds, it disappeared behind one of the clouds. It almost looked as if the could moved in front of the object. The object was on the same level as my eyes, so I knew it was nothing close to the ground or the mountains.

The sky was crystal clear, and my view was not impeded by trees or any other obstructions. I was gazing at the nighttime sky when what can best be describe as a fireball suddenly appeared. It was a very brilliant orange color, with a long tapered segmented tail. It was not crossing the sky like a meteor, but was heading straight down.

There were very bright lights around the bottom and a large bright light at the top. The object was moving very slowly across my vantage point.I could see the object on the top of the trees, it had to be about 2 to 3 miles away from me. The lights were as bright as the shopping center lights. A row of lights were at the bottom and one or maybe more than one at the top.

It appeared to be rising over Ruby Hill Park directly behind me. I say rising because I was descending the hill and it appeared to &quot;peek&quot; up over the crest of the hill directly behind me in line with the street as I continued away from it.  It could not have been a car, however, as it continued to appear to rise above the level of the street even at the top of the hill, though that thought initially crossed my mind.  I had never noticed such a light at that location behind me, but thought perhaps I had just been inattentive previously not to notice. As I continued, two more appeared to rise above the hill flanking the first one so they appeared to be in a triangular formation behind the first one from my vantage point.  Since they had the brightness of a street lamp, I thought that was what they were.  However, the street lamps at distances much nearer faded from view due to their lack of strength and the edges that direct the light downward as I drove away from them.  I also thought they could be lights on top of tall buildings that were there and I had never noticed, or were being built, but the direction I was viewing has no such construction taking place, nor does it have any tall buildings. I pulled into a filling station to get gas, then thought I would try to look for them again later that evening, as I had plans to go out with some friends.  However, I was in the back seat and did not think to look for them the rest of that night.  The next night, though, I looked for them and they were not there!  Additionally, the part of the city I could normally see was occluded while those lights were there.  This would lead me to believe that the 3 lights were not just separate lights, but were actually part of one large craft.  But I really have no idea what they or it was.  I have just not seen it since. A few more facts:  the rising action stopped and the object(s) seemed to be stationary once I saw all three.  The rising action could have even been an illusion because the land begins to rise a mile or so west of Ruby Hill.  I might note, however, that I was only about a quarter of a mile beyond the hill when I started to notice the first one.  They were not following me, nor were they moving in any direction like a plane or jet.  The light quality seemed to be gas lights of some sort, but much brighter proportionately.  The object(s) were probably a distance of 4 to 10 miles, depending on how big they really were.  I don&apos;t know why I was so casual about the whole thing, but I just felt it was an interesting phenomenon.  I had had three previous sightings which were much more interesting.  One of them was chronicled here about a year ago.", "Scared to death at a city park.  Overlooking Belfast HarborMe and a friend were sitting at the city park when we heard something like a sonic boom, then a splash,then another boom.  My friend told me to stand behind him and look over the water.  When I did I saw a triangler shape swaying in the sky.  My friend told me to look at him and when I did I saw a white dot on his head.  I followed it to the triagle.  We got up and headed out of the park. We walked about 5 feet and stopped to look behind us.  It was gone.  Then there was a bright light above our head and we looked up.  The next think we know we had walked about 2oo feet and didn&apos;t know it.

In fact, I&apos;m not sure of the exact date except that it was either in 1969 or 1970, late in the evening (it was also reported in The Washington Post the next day as an experimental aircraft).  What prompted me to report this is the recent Sarasota, FL incident, where a man reported seeing a huge blimp-like craft near Myakka.  He described it hovering above him.  I began to think about what I had seen and decided to say something.... I was driving west on Rt. 50 toward Fairfax.  My friend and I both spotted this thing &quot;hovering&quot; over Rt. 50, with lights that seem to revolve around the center of it.  We slowed down to look at it.  It looked like a blimp, but wasn&apos;t.  It made no noise.  Unfortunately, we didn&apos;t stick around to observe it better.  But, I am sure this was no experimental craft.  I have never forgotten this incident and I have never seen anything like it since.  I spend a lot of time in Sarasota and from now on, I am going to spend a lot of time outdoors in the wee hours of the morning.  If you should know anything about this incident, I would love to hear about it.  Thank you for listening. ((e-mail address deleted))((NUFORC Note:  Date in either 1969 or 1970 is unknown.  PD))", "Original sighting was that of a Pyramid of lights, however, the shape of those lights changed in what I believe to be the rotating of a ship on all axies.The lights first appeared over the Oregon coast and were moving very slowly.  Upon further notice ( about 15 minutes of staring) I noticed that the lights appeared to not be moving at all.  Which made me look further int them.  I know that this was not a helicopter- the lights were too high and way to bright.  Also there was no tell tale sound of a helicopter engine.  I also know that this was not a plane, because when it did move, it was going in all directions very quickly and then would stop.  This went on for about an hour until I realized that the position of the lights were different than before.  The original, pentagram shape of lights had been changed into a pyramid shape, as if one of the lights had disappeared.  suddenly, it came back but on the other side of the pyramid, as if the object was rotating.  It would do this as it was climbing or moving, but when the object stood still, there was no rotation of the lights.  At that point, I thought that it may have been a satelite, however, the lights were brighter than any of the stars that were visible- including the north star.  Sounds strange huh?", "Cigar shaped craft glided over the treetops behind my home.My father, daughter and I were sitting in our sunporch.  My back was facing the row of windows overlooking our back yard and approximately 50 yards of woods separating us from the next street over.  My 2 year old daughter was playing on the couch next to me, facing the windows, when she gasped and looked up out the windows.  I turned around quickly, my father a few feet away looked up.  We saw what at first looked like the bright lights from a bottle rockets, traveling horizontally in the woods.  But then we realized the lights were not dying out.  From what we could tell as it glided over the treetops, it was in my estimation at least 60 feet long and narrow.  Cigar shaped, traveling about 20-25 feet in the air at about 20 mph.  When we first saw it, my father recalled the meteor shower expected in 2 days, but as it went by, we realized it was too close to the ground, and definitely not fading.  It also traveled in a steady straight line with respect to the horizon.  The lights themselves were almost like white light.  Some seemed stationary on the object while others streaked by with the continuous movement of the object, sort of like a trail along side.  It was like a long skinny bus moving through the sky.  It made no sound, but about 10 minutes later, the phone module on the wall emitted radio (police-type) sounds, with the phone on the hook.  My mother said that that happens every once in a while and thought it was unrelated.  I have always believed in the possibility, but I have never seen anything like that.  It was so surreal.  The eerie part is, if my daughter hadn&apos;t looked up at that moment, we never would have known.  My skeptic father came right out and said he was creeped out. I will check with the state and local police and watch the newspaper to see if anyone else saw it.  I would like to take a walk in the woods there tomorrow and see if anything was disturbed.", "Viewed a single craft, followed in approx 1 minute by three more.

The flight direction was S.W., assumed craft came from Dulce NM, a N.E. Direction.  Duration of the sightings was approx 60 seconds for the first singular craft, and 120 seconds for the following three craft, which appeared 1 minute after the first craft. The sky was clear, star filled night, with blinking commercial airplane lights flying in a S.S.W. Direction immediately preceeding the sighting period. All four craft had same lighted features - resembling enlongated rectangular florescent (orange/red) outlined (appeared like flying florescent tubes)(bright,like those used in store windows).  We were close enough, the light blocked actually seeing the craft itself.  Estimate distance to be less than 1/4 to 1/8 mile. The first single craft, came in at relative slow speed (but much faster than a helocopter, then shot off at very high speed.  The following three craft also accelerated at approximately the same place, but each took their turn, with a few seconds inbetween these individual accelerations.  The craft were silent. The three craft flew in a line formation, but at different intervals of space inbetween when they arrived. Our visual position was below the horizon, as we were in a shallow canyon approx 3/4 mile wide, 100/200 ft deep.  I would estimate the distance from the craft at approx 1/2 mile (based on USAF flight line military experience).

It moved very slowly across the sky, making a quiet puffing noise. This is the description of what thousands of people on the Gazelle Peninsula of East New Britain saw in the sky over the weekend. The people of the remote Bainingo ranges, cut off from television and anything else that is modern, possibly had the best description. They say a craft, which had huge lumps on the sides with light flickering around it. Some Bainingos said the object was lit up all around like a red-hot stone in an oven pit. But what they saw was exactly what others on the Gazelle Peninsula witnessed on the same night, Thursday, November 4. The people who saw the flying craft concluded that they were witnessing a spacecraft from another planet. On other parts of the province, similar sightings were made, although their descriptions were slightly different. Over on Duke of York Islands those living on the island closest to New Ireland Province reported seeing a huge craft hovering just meters above the seas off St George Channel, and traveling at a very slow speed. They claimed they saw other smaller crafts with bright lights circulating the bigger craft in a playful manner. They claimed they watched the craft until it disappeared over the high mountains in New Ireland. At Rangulit village, in the Baining area, on the same night, naturalized citizen John Berenti of Namatanai in New Ireland, and his family were sitting on the verandahs of their home when, all of a sudden, a huge craft appeared just above the top of the mango trees. &quot;It was so big, about 200 meters (660 feet) to 300 meters (990 feet) long, and 50 meters (165 feet) wide. &quot;It was moving very, very slowly across the sky and was lit up like a shooting star and it had two very bright lights at the tail. &quot;We honestly did not know what it was, but it certainly wasn&rsquo;t an aircraft,&quot; Mr. Berenti said. &quot;It was traveling too slow, far too slow. &quot;It did not make any loud sound, just a quite puffing sound as it glided gracefully over the tree tops,&quot; he said. Mr. Berenti said his entire family saw the craft. He said the people who lived there, who saw the craft, lit handheld fires and chased after the craft, wanting to see where it would go. Mr. Berenti said he had never seen anything like it and he was troubled by it. &quot;It cannot be associated with anything on this planet.&quot; He considered that the bright glow around the craft was its magnetic field, keeping the force of gravity away.&quot; About 50 kilometers (30 miles) across the sea from Lassul Baining, Police Officer Raymond Theodore was sitting under his house along Vuvu Beach, North Coast of Rabaul, around 8:30 p.m. when he noticed what looked to be a huge craft traveling just meters above the seas. &quot;First I thought it was a ship but then we saw it travel over Waton Island.&quot; &quot;It had very bright lights at the back as it moved along, but it made no sound,&quot; he said. Others who saw the craft gave similar accounts.

After sitting still for a minute or so, the main object got lighter as a small red object seperated and slowly moved to the east of the main object. Shortly after, another small red object moved off to the west, again making the main object lighter.  The remaining part of the main object then moved off to the west.  The final three objects looked the same, each having 2 points of red light.  They moved slowly out of site.

My eye was caught by something visible through the sliding glass door which is east facing.  I quickly turned my head to see what it was.  (The sliding door is located at a 90 degree angle from one&apos;s line of sight while looking at the TV.) What I saw (briefly, but very clearly) was a  luminous green ball, about the size of an aspirin held at arms length, slowly descending in an east, northeast line.  It disappeared while still visible above the tree line.  That is, the light &quot;went out&quot; or &quot;turned off.&quot;  The length of time from the point where I turned and first observed the object in its descent, to the point of its disappearance was approximately three seconds. I might mention that the object was virtually the same beautiful, luminous emerald green as another object I witnessed in a much longer and more dramatic context almost forty years ago in Albuquerque, NM.  These are the only two occasions when I have seen such an object, but the striking color of the first sighting has always remained vivid in memory.  The recently (but briefly) seen object had the same coloration.", "((NUFORC Note:  We were unable to confirm this report via a return e-message.

Just as we were about to leave the building, the power went off in the entire area of what is called the Heights. When we walked out side the door we immediatly sighted 8/10 large dull red glowing lightes at about a 45 degree angle from the eastern horizon and they appeared to be quite low in altitude over the parking lot of said resteraunt.  These large red lights appeared to have an aura about them possibly because of blowing dust.  The lights were stationary and not moving.  My wife and I observed these lights for about five seconds and she rushed back into the building to bring out more witnesses.  Within the time she returned into the building and came back out with 2 other witnesses, the lights started to dim in unison like the dimmer switch on a houshold room light and totally disappeared from sight.  There was no Physical or definite outline of any type of structure or airframe.  There were no clouds in the sky and stars could be clearly seen where the lights had been but in no correlation to any star groups or constellations.  The lights were the size of ones thumbnail.

When the sheriff&apos;s officer responded to the call, he stayed and watched the object for approximately 10-15 minutes.  During this time he stated that he had never seen anything like this before.  He was so intrigued that he left to try and find the location of this object. The witness reported the first object to be 1/4 of the way up the horizon. The object was reported in the SE sky. The weather conditions of the evening were clear with no fog in the area.  The witness also reported that he has seen planets many times before and stated that this was unlike anything he had seen either.  The gentleman watched the object for nearly 40 minutes, until it seemed to just vanish. During this time it would change color form red to yellow to green at a very quick rate.  He also reported that the object would shoot up into the air and fall back down at rapid speeds.  The object also hovered over his farm area for several minutes at a time.

The witness watched the second object &quot;hover&quot; over his farm are for nearly 10 minutes. This second object was yellow and triangle shaped. This object also just seemed to vanish. Neither object made any sound that could be heard by any of the witnesses. There was also no smell associated with the objects.

Witness was in his home on Fort Mountain on 16Oct99 at about 10:30PM.  The weather was fair, calm, about 65 degrees, CAVU.  His home overlooks the valley between Fort Mountain and Grassy Mountain to the north at about 2600 feet elevation.  The witness observed a glowing orange sphere hovering over the valley to the northwest about 1 mile distant.  The sphere seemed to be floating slowly to the east (left to right) and was estimated to be about the size of a basketball held at arm&apos;s length.  The sphere then contracted to about the size of a baseball AAL, then returned to basketball size AAL.  It then vansihed after about 5 seconds.  The witness indicated that it appeared to be solid, and the glow was about moon bright. The witness was found to hold an Art degree from a major college in New York, is in good health and with good vision for distance. Further that the witness is a well respected member of the Fort Mountain community, whose neighbors vouch for his reliability. A check for other witnesses proved negative and conversations with local law enforcement and other authorities proved likewise. This occurrence is consistent with other events observed and reported on Fort Mountain in the last two years.  MUFONGA and ISUR personnel have also observed unusual events in this area in 1998, and several past investigations have been conducted.  This other information will be added to the NUFORC data base at a future date. Note on terrain:  This area is part of the Georgia Blue Ridge Mountain chain (western end), and is very rugged country for Georgia, elevations ranging from about 2000 to 3000+.  The remote Cohutta Wilderness area is immediatetly adjacent Fort Mountain to the north and northeast. Fort Mountain has an unusual &apos;rock wall&apos; formation running around it&apos;s military crest.  This unusual structure is 3 to 4 feet high in places, constructed of more or less smooth stones (piled) with highly unusual pit like rock nests within the wall at intervals. Personnel from the university system in Georgia have studied this formation and several bizarre &apos;legends&apos; have been associated with the wall. Past events reported to MUFONGA and ISUR in this mountain area include a V shaped craft flying at treetop level, a domed disc emitting strange ray like beams from a portal on the fuselage, and orbs and spheres similar to the 16Oct99 report. A detailed report of the 16Oct99 event is being compiled for MUFON HQ and for the ISUR database.", "IT WAS IN THE EVENING,WHEN THE CRAFT CAME ACROSS THE SKY MOVING FROM LEFT TO RIGHT BEFORE GOING STRIGHT  AND THEN IT WAS GONE.

The object flew from from the southwest to the northeast and moved at a fairly nornal speed. The object flew below the clouds for approx 5 seconds, when two aircraft came out of the clouds and took up a position about 1 mile behind the light. They flew along for about 3 seconds when what appeared to be a missle came off the wing of one of the aircraft and came toward the light.

The lights where traveling from the west to the east at a slow rate of speed(it resembled a blimp landing). The lights looked like they were 1/4 to 1/2 a mile away about 30 degrees up 500 to 700 feet above ground. There was a bright light on the east side with what looked liked a long series of bright and dim lights the length of it aprx. 100 to 150 feet long. The trail lights wasn&apos;t like a trail from a comet it had distinct shape and it was not hazey like a comet trail. It was rectangular in shape long and thin band(resembled a banner on a computer). The back of the object was slightly higher than the front aprx. 30 degree angle from west to east. As the light&apos;s drifted into the tree line the lights changed to a reddish orange color than went behind the tree line. After I top the hill the lights were gone. I watched the light&apos;s for about 20 seconds.

I have had quite a few sightings well over 50, and of more than 5 types of craft. I saw my first while living in a heavily populated rural area, I lived in an apt. and spent a lot of time watching the skies at night (I smoked ciggs and have kids, ergo me go outside). Have you ever been fooled by your mind or senses? Like your in the dark and bump up against a rope but your mind and senses tell you it&apos;s a snake? Well that is basically what happened my first time. I was just about to go in, taking the last drag of my smoke I look up into the night sky, only to see six lights. Two were up front and the other four were behind these and to the side. My mind automatically jumps to the conclusion that it is a low flying passenger airliner, only that it is unusually low keeps my attention for the moment... it is moving very slow... and then I notice it has no tail... there is no noise... those aren&apos;t wings.. they&apos;re round...   This is when my earlier conclusion is blown away and I am able to clearly see three seperate disk shaped vehicles, they had a brassy looking metalic body with three round nubs at the extrimity of each disk with a much larger nub in the middle of the objects. I took this all in as I yelled for someone to come see this, then noticed I was the only person about, not even traffic was going by (I felt what I suppose some of the natives of SouthAmerica felt when first seeing planes, awe, happy, oh yeah and shock). They then performed (the only word that fits) a manuevor where the two in back cross over and under the first and take the lead making an X. At the same time they had started rotating so it made a wild effect while performing the move. They traveled on slowly for another moment and then accelerated at a mind blowing speed away, they glowed orange to yellow as they did this, which left a blurred lazy S in the sky, just for a moment but it was pretty kwel. Since then I have had very few close encounters with as much impact as that first, yet I have had one or two that are as interesting and that have left their impression, like seeing 3 triangular crafts that were very large with other objects flying about them (seen with wife and friend). Currently I am back to seeing at least one every two weeks or so, it falls off sometimes and other times it seems amazing that it isn&apos;t talked about all over the city.", "saw black sphere floating in yard 5 ft away.no light no sound.told everyone i knew.saw it on the news 2 days later filmed in orange county.living in my moms garage .I was up late with my girlfriend.

My son was pointing out the constellations to me as he likes to do.  We had just located Casseopia and the Pleades when right at that moment, from the West, we saw a marvelous shooting star with a long tail.  We both thought it must have made it to the earth intact.

It was 3 satellites forming a perfect isosceles triangle and traveling in formation at exactly the same speed.

After it flashed about 3 more times, I called my mom and she came out and then my teenage son and his friend.  We started timing it and it flashed every 10 to 13 seconds only.  I could see it in my binoculars only when it flashed.  It was SSE in line with Jupiter.  It would move up and back and sideways but you could only see it when it flashed.  Then there was a streak of light and we all screamed and it was gone.  There was no sound.I had gone outside and was sitting on my back steps before Iwent to bed and was looking at the sky.  A plane was going over pretty high up and I was watching it, when a single flash occured out in front of the plane.  I thought the plane had shot something out of it.  The plane went on and I was still looking where I saw the flash and it flashed again.  So I sat there and watched it.  It was just a bright flash, not as bright as Jupiter though.  But it looked like that.  I yelled for mom and she came out and it continued this slow flash but moving around.  It would be more north then it would flash the next time over to the East and then South but it always stayed in a pretty small area.  I called for my son who is 15 and his friend and we stood out back and watched it.  Planes continued to go over but this just stayed there.  I ran inside got the phone and called my uncle in KY to see if he could see it. I was trying to explain to him where to look but with it only flashing about every 13 seconds it was hard to tell him where.  Then there was a brighter flash headed east with a long trail behind it like a shooting star and then the flasher was gone.  We all screamed when whatever it was flew across the sky because it was so bright.  My mom saw a red streak come out of it headed due east when it was just the two of us out there but I did not see that.  My mom is 58 years old and psychologically stable.  My son is 15 and attends an academic prepatory high school.  His friend is also 15 and goes to a local high school.  He was scared.  I am 41 years old.  I used to work with a local Mufon group here in Nashville but have not been in contact with them for about 5 years.  I have always wanted to see a UFO because I believe they are out there but this tonight was the most unusual thing I have ever seen.  I told my son&apos;s friend it was probably something of ours (from the USA) so he would not be so scared.  Maybe it was a satellite, if they can stop and move in 4 different directions and then take off and lea! ve a whi te trail.  I very much doubt it though.  My uncle reported he had observed the same type thing 2 or 3 nights ago (in Paducah, KY) and watched it for awhile and went to bed.  It was in the south.  He said it was a slow flash like what we saw.  I asked him who I should call and he said no one, just enjoy it and go on to bed.  But I had to tell you all.  I have written one other time to tell about a gold light that I saw one night headed north that disappeared but that could have been too many different things.  This tonight was unlike anything I have ever seen.  Thank you for letting me tell you about it.", "3 lights &quot;disguised&quot; as a plane3 objects that I, at first, assumed was a small plane but it made no noise, sped across a clear and cold night. The 3 objects then contracted their formation until they nearly touched. They then took off, 2 along the horizon {1 north,1 south} while the 3rd{formation leader}went up.I kept them in my field of vision for 2-3 seconds until all I could do was track the leader.3-4 seconds of that and then it lost me. They were white lights that seemed to mimic airplane lights, until I noticed them. I know it sounds funny, but I believe they knew I was watching, so they abandoned their charade, in a flamboyant and blatant display of their technology. Then again, if they were so intelligent,why would they neglect the sonic aspect of their disguise? I would&apos;ve stopped watching before all the good stuff happened if I&apos;d heard anything. It was a clear and silent night.", "Bright greenish light heading north-eastI was heading out my grandma front door when I glanced to the east and caught a glance of a bright green ball.

I am a retired Air Force Officer and I live to the East of Tucson International Airport and Davis Monthan Air Force Base and see countless aircraft crossing my property, but I have never seen a totally dark object, or have I seen any object pass that quickly.

Almost as if it was scoping out an area.It was about 2:15- 2:30  am on Wednesday morning I was driving west on Webster ave in the Bucktown area. While waiting at the stoplight at Damen ave, I was looking ahead and noticed something in the sky that was hovering and very brightly lit up. I thought that it seemed a little strange that it was not moving at all. When the light turned green I moved ahead crossing over Damen ave and all the time looking up and to the left to try to figure out what it was. When I got directly by it (and this thing was not that high up at all) I became so excited that I stopped in the middle of the street and got out of my car because I thought that if it were a helicopter there must be some noise happening. But when i got out of the car, I looked directly at it and there was absolutely no noise at all! I was so excited that I tried desperatly to get a good look at it but it was so dark that all I could see were at least three lights, two yellowish white and one bluish white. It started to move to the east and i followed it with my eyes until it started to slowly move to the north and then behind the church going nw. I jumped in the car determined to follow it but as it moved off I lost view of it. The thing that was weird was there was no noise, the way that it hovered and moved and the fact that it was pretty low in the sky totally freaked me out. I just know something was strange about this and i felt very much like this object was kind of scoping out the area. I called the hotline for the first time to report this because this is the only time I have ever seen anything like this and felt that it was important enough to report it.", "Saw five fireball objects flying at a low altitude and steady speed crossing from west toward the northeast.I was outside with a police officer and we happened to be looking at the sky over Sterling Heights, a large suburb of Detroit.  At approximately 1900 hours, we witnessed five medium-sized orange fireballs with long tails that sparkled at the ends.  There was a quiet burning sound associated with them, but they were definately not jets or any other type of airplane.  They were all moving at the same speed at an even pace, all equidistant, flying from the west to the northeast.  As they were going toward the northeast, they winked out like a dimmer-switch being turned all the way down.

Suddenly seemed to stop, go vertical at faster speed, up and then down, did a series of erratic movements of varying distances and speeds, with no seeming logic.

It looked almost like a firework with a glowing ball and a trailing stream that flickered like a flaming tail.Since there was no noise that I could hear, I assumed that this was a large meteor. Shortly after I saw the green fireball moving west to east, I saw 4 more familiar looking meteors, which were very quick streaks of white light which diminished quickly, and they all moving from north to south. The green fireball, moved much slower, in a different direction, and was the same brightness all the while I observed it. I lost sight of it when it was obscured by my neighbor&apos;s house. I thought this object was unusual enough to report since I have never seen anything like it. Other than the above, I really couldn&apos;t give you any more info. I am A regular Art Bell listener so I was aware of your reporting center.", "Soundless cigar shaped object(s) transited South to North. Weather- clear, unlimited visibility, near 70 degrees F.My wife and I were having dinner on the patio, when something bright in the sky caught my eye. The object was bright (possibly from sun reflection) and produced one brilliant (sun?) flash as it approached 90 degrees overhead. The object appeared a little wider than my thumb at arms lemgth. I thought it resembled two 737 fuselages my wife describes it as two silver frankfurters. We live 15 miles S. and 14 miles E. of the closest commercial airport(OKC), and 15 miles S. and 5 miles east of Tinker AFB.  We see many aircraft on approach to these two airports as well as light aircraft at low altitudes and are familiar with these. This object was about the size of a commercial airliner on approach to OKC. However it had no wings or tail fins, and it didn&apos;t taper towards the tail like an airliner does. It was shaped like a short cigar. There was no vapor trail and no sound.  We live in a quiet place and there was absolutely no sound. My wife saw me look up and she saw it without me having to call her attention to it. We both sat dumbfounded as it sped along overhead. Afterwards, we agreed that it was the most unusual thing we had ever seen! I cannot estimate well the speed or distance, but were I to guess, I would say if the object were the size of a 737 fuselage, it would have been 2 miles high and half a mile East of us. It was moving about twice the speed of an airliner on approach to OKC. The course was directly from the South to the North (airliners on approach are usually East to West). As it was about to go out of sight into the trees, I ran and fetched a pair of 10X50 binoculars. I caught sight of it again through the branches, and it appeared to be two metallic cylinders with a space between them about half as wide as they were thick.", "Observed three stationary/almost stationary UFO&apos;s emitting variety of colors in clear skiesI was driving from Seattle to Kent on I-5 last night with my wife and 18 month old. It was 10:50 PM last night, cold and very clear night when I was about a mile from my exit Kent Des Moines Rd off I-5(not far from SeaTac airport), I noticed three sets of lights - two of them together and one a little further away - which were stationary and looked like street lights. I discarded the possibility that they were plane lights because the lights were stationary.I pointed it out to my wife, and as we got closer we realized they were neither street lights nor plane lights, well at least not man made. When I took the exit and was waiting at the signal light, I could clearly see one of the two objects that were together right above me. The object was moving very slowly ESE to WNW almost stationary above me and was not making any noise. It was like a disc, and I could see different colors - white, yellow, green/blue, same goes with my wife she had  a better look than me because my eyes were on the road. She was kinda worried at the signal light and wanted me to drive away quickly, I guess she didn&apos;t want to be kidnapped by them. So I didn&apos;t go back to get another look and we couldn&apos;t notice the objects as I headed east after taking the exit and descended down Kent west hill on Kent Des Moines Rd. But we both were pretty sure it was nothing man made, because those objects were pretty stationary and were floating in the sky like a leaf.", "Object was fairly still, however would make unusually sharp moves on occasions.At about 0130 26 October 1999, I noticed an unusually bright object in the sky. Located approximately. 20deg up from the horizon, E-N-E. It was (seemed) to change colors and was very high. A few minutes later I noticed a fast streak of light that flew quickly in front of it. That could have just been a meteor going by, but this other object that is in the sky even now, I can not identify. Could it be a satellite? I hope so. Or else we have some very curious people or a curious life form out there. There are no telephone numbers for reporting this kind of incident and the local police (non-emerg.) were only interested, &quot;if the object lands.&quot;((NUFORC Note:  Please see other reports from Texas for this date and approximate time.

The Strawberry Mountains(9038 ft.) were in front of us. It was just past sunset and the sky was still blue and we could see what appeared to be a jet with a short vapor trail, about 5 - 10 degrees above and to the southwest of the mountain.  We exclaimed about the jet, but decided it was not a jet as it looked more like a comet with large amounts of vapor coming off in a fan shape from what appeared to be the front of it.  We pulled over and remarked again about WHAT IS THAT!  Then got our binoculars out from behind the seat but before we could get the lens caps off...it disappeared!  The time was 7:08 (was this connected to the missle launch from California?)((NUFORC Note:  The time is the same as the launch of a Minuteman II from Vandenberg AFB, but that missile flew to the west.

It disappeared behind a gathering of trees to my right.I had left the local library at 8:00 p.m. and was traveling home along a rural road. I was heading south when I saw a blu-green ball of light with a long yellow-orange tail come from the sky and fall behind some trees to my right. I am not a good judge of distance, but it was close enough for me to see that it was not a star. It did remind me of the light from a large roman candle, however, this light came from the sky, and not the ground When I returned home, I mentioned this incident to my husband who shrugged it off as a meteor, however, the fact that it was blue made no sense to me. That evening I got chills down my spine when I heard Peter Davenport come on the Art Bell show and share that this ball of light was seen from Florida to North Carolina. I am a 33 year old stay-at-home mom who has never seen any resemblance of a UFO ever!

I believe the ufo incident occurs within the first half.  Behind the main object of the scene (either shuttle or MIR),  there is time to see stars, and perhaps a planet or other satellite arcing gently from left of screen to right.  Suddenly, there appears a narrow football shaped bright light which travels 1/2 across the screen considerably faster than the other objects, and maybe 20 times larger than the stars.   Solid white bright light,  perhaps a little fuzzy from speed of movement.  Object is only on screen a max of 15 secs.

It was lighter in color toward the top and I could make out blochy looking designs around the top area of its shape. The orange glow of it was rather faint. There were a number of poeple around us looking at it in wonder trying to figure out what it was also. Then after a bit it disappeared over the mountains toward the north.Then sighting actually took place more toward the outskirts of the city and no telling how many actually saw it besides the small crowd around us.
