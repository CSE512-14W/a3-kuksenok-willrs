["Good evening,  My wife and kids were driving home from town, pulling up the last stretch of road to our driveway. We live behind and beyond Lake Kathlyn, at the end of (deleted by HBCC UFO). Approx. 7:15 PM, my wife and son , suddenly said &quot;WHAT is that? In the sky heading north was , relatively speaking ,a huge orange ball with a very short tail , at the time I didn&apos;t think it was going that fast, but from high in the sky to disappearing behind the  horizon was probably less than two minutes, we had actually pulled right, down another street to keep it in sight between the trees , but it was quickly out of sight. It literally looked like a rocket on takeoff, was there a launch?, was it a meteor? Did anyone else see anything? Feel free to call if needed. I will have a look around and call the folks who made the report. Thank you to the witnesses for this report.

Then it just dissaperd I searched the whole sky, nothing it was gone. In total my sighting lasted about 1 minute.

Very decernable green but not a harsh green, traveling horizontally in a straight line to the west and followed by a much smaller craft that was a harsh white light. I thought the white lit craft might be a jet in pursuit. The green disc, or ball, was pulling away fron the white craft at about three times the speed of the white craft. They remained in sight for approx 12 seconds. I would estimate they were 3 to 5 miles from my location. Objects were too far away to hear any sound.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

As we were passing the naval yard a brightly glowing ball of light came down and almost hit our car. I pulled off the road. We were terrified. The light was like magneseum burning it was so bright. After a minute or so it shot up into the sky so fast we could hardly track it with our eyes. My mother suggested that we leave and notify the authorities. While driving the craft was following us at a high altitude. The first house we stopped at would not let us use the phone. We stopped again and made our call. The people that talked to me said what we saw was a weather balloon. I told him ((word deleted--equivalent of &quot;No!&quot;), I know what I saw and it was not a weather balloon. To this day I remember it like it happened yesterday.((NUFORC Note:  The date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  He indicates a precise date for the event.

I was 13 or 14 years old, visiting mineapolis from california for the summer.  the year was 1976 - 78,  can pinpoint the year by talking to relatives if needed.  the month was July or August and the day was a tuesday. my favorite show baa baa black sheep was on tv at the time.  we reported it to the police dept. they laughed?

It was appx. 1am and I was returning my girlfriend home after a date.  I had just exited the 101 freeway at Wendy Dr. and noticed a group of cars stopped in the middle of the street, as I too came to a stop I looked up and could not believe what I saw.  To this day it is still the largest non natural thing I have ever seen.  It was sort of a triangular shape ( not with equal sides ) and it had a cigar shapped pod at 2 of the chopped off corners.   It was a greenish blue color with the pods being a darker blue or purple.  And it was huge, there is a mountain raned between this town and the pacific ocean ( only 7 miles as the crow flies ) and this thing dwarfed the mountains.  This group of people watched the craft for about 10 minutes it just hovered there in the sky.  I stepped back to my car to turn it off and when I turned around it was gone.  Everyone just got in there cars and left.  My girlfriend was very shaken.  I droped her off and began to think, not to far from where I was there was a very large open area used for cattel grazing.  Just for the hell of it I drove out there to see if I could see any thing else. I rember arriving at this area, now this couldn&apos;t of been later than 1:30 at this point.  The next thing I remember I an turned around driving away from this area and it&apos;s after 3:00 am.  I remember thinking that took longer than it should have. I guess I had one of the now popular missing time experances. The next day I checked the local newspapers and there was no mention of what we had seen.  Just as a note all this took place with in 15 to 20 miles of Point Magu.  This is the Pacific Missle test range where they devloped the walleye, sparrow and tomahawk missles along with who knows what else.  The craft was almost over the base. it was litteraly over a mile in size.  This is the really strange part, if you get a copy of Wham-o giant comics from 1967 on the back inside cover are a few stories of ufo encounters, one of them is about the same craft.  Also there is a artists drawing of the craft.((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  One of two seemingly credible reports from the same source.

About 2-3 minutes apart in length.  I at first looked up to see if there was an airplane in the sky - but the noise went away much too quicky to be an airplane.  I was outside smoking a cigarette and my five year old son had followed me.  He kept asking me what that sound was and his interpretation was that it was a volcano with hot lava :-)  We heard it 7 or 8 times - and I finally decided to go in the house after not seeing anything.  It sounded like something hovering and then speeding away real fast.  There was cloud cover but I didn&apos;t see any lights or anything.  I have seen things on past occasions but just chalked it up basically to being crazy.  I wish I would have taped these noises however.", "Large triangular object flying fairly low over Route 1 in wakefield Rhode Island on Halloween.  4 large white lights.Approximately 10 pm, we were driving on Route 1 South in Wakefield.  We noticed a large object with 4 large white circle lights kind of hovering over the air.  The two of us both saw it at the same time and approximately 5 seconds after we spotted it, the 4 white lights went off and one of the lights turned green.  Then all lights disappeared and the 4 white lights came on again.  Although it looked like a rectangle from the side, when it started moving at a very fast rate, we saw it actually looke dlike a triangle.  It started to go over some trees then just completely disappeared.", "object sits stationary for 5 minutes and then accelerates out of sight in 5 seconds.I was 13 at the time. My sister and I were looking out the 2nd story window and saw an orange ball about half the size of a full moon. It was sitting still. We watched it for approx. 5 minutes when all of a sudden it accelerated at a high rate of speed and was out of sight in about 5 seconds.

It was a tiny pin-prick of light, but it started blinking on and off, slowly at first, and then faster on-off-on-off and then it looked like it kept going higher and higher into the atmosphere until I could no longer see it. This is the second time I have witnessed something vanish by traveling too high for the naked eye to see.", "((NUFORC Note:  Date of first event may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  We do not understand why the National Security Agency would be interested in a UFO sighting, since it would have been an agency interested in domestic events that would have pursued the event, we believe.  PD)Family encounters with glowing objects, spanning 50 yrs., for three members.I preface by saying events filled the lives of my family, in the early 1970&apos;s, leading to my being contacted by NSA. One evening, I heard a flying device in my living room, which decended, after the wall became physically transparent to it. It &quot;appeared&quot; to me, a basketball-sized sphere. It flew off at a 45* angle, retreating up and away. I could hear it whooshing, all the while. My bus. partner was in the next room. I began having dreams of floating up, from my yard, into a craft. I will never tell what transpired, in the dream, as I entered the craft, in order to prevent copy-cat stories. I heard from my sister, she knew of what I spoke. So, I am not alone.My business partner and I began having esp, and I dreamt future events. I told him of my dreams. One night, we were driving in the piney woods area of east TX. After midnight, and all alone, a hugh, very large object, glowing red, appeared as we crested a hill. It was up ahead, on the right, over a field. It flew down, as if landing, across our road, but instead, circled us. It repeated the manuever. Something was &quot;talking&quot; in my head. I said, &quot;They want me to turn left, just up there!&quot; No road was visible, and my partner questioned how I knew. I said, they are telling me, it is right up there. Sure enough. And my partner said, &quot;You have never been here, before. How did you know!&quot; So, I turned onto the small road, and came to a stop, and said, &quot;They are telling me that if I am not prepared for this, I am free to leave. They offer me that choice.&quot; He said, &quot;Go! Let&apos;s see them!&quot; I began to shake, being only 18 yr. old.I said &quot;No. I&apos;m not ready for this!!!&quot; I turned around, away from the craft, which was on the ground, up ahead, in a field. I drove off. My partner was very upset with me. I was young, and too naive. If only, I had more maturity. I have since regretted that choice, beyond words. Two others in my family had similar experiences. One had an object &quot;beam&quot; him, with a light that &quot;grew, forward&quot;. They had lost time, and a car that had all the wires charred, leaving them stranded. My sister got cancer of her chest. Their watches never worked again. The word got out, and when I was in the Navy, two years later, I was taken to D.C., and questioned by NSA, while I was in the back of a car. I told them our experiences. There were two men. Even after I left the military, one of them came to my home, and asked me to move, to a city near my sister, 400 miles away. I declined. I believe now, they wanted to conduct research, of some sort. Years passed, life was not easy, because of health. Then, on May 14, 1998, five objects literally materialized. I was &quot;prompted&quot; to go outside, I carried my cat, with me. I looked up, and they were stoboscopic, decending at a soft angle, and then the strobe stopped. They glowed blue-white. They were maybe 150 ft.,up. They assumed a chevron, with one extra object(ship?), on the right. They then turned, in formation, pointing to where we first encountered, years before. Then they flew there, at a fast speed, and disappeared, over the horizon. I  &quot;felt&quot; they said, &quot;Not to forget you.&quot; I should have returned to our first meeting place, but did not, because that was not overtly sensed. Perhaps I was not receptive, and maybe they had, indeed, returned. I&apos;ll never know. I have lived a difficult life, and just wanted someone to know. BTW, my wife used to be awakened by my crying out in my sleep, about &quot;them touching me&quot;. My marriage was short lived. She did not accept the existance of life elsewhere. What she, or others reject, is irrelevant to what I know.Thank you for allowing me to at least write about this.", "Disk shapped saucer over the city of Chicago.It was around 7pm on a summers evening when I, my Mother, Father, and two brothers saw a disk shaped object in the sky. I would say it was about 100 yards above us. It had lights around the outter rim, which were red and green and flashing. It maintained a motionless station in the sky as we continued to observe it. I got the impression someone was looking down on us, I was 15 years of age at that time. After about 5 min. it first moved off slowly traveling in a north easterly direction heading out over lake Michigan then it suddenly speeded up in a flash and was out of sight in a matter of a couple of seconds. The most interesting fact I recall about that day is, after the sighting was completed non of my family members discussed what we saw. Everyone went back to what ever it was they were doing as if it never happened. My father still lives in Chicago at this time at the age of 83 and my two brother&apos;s are now in their fifties, I am 57. My mother passed in 1967. Now this is going to sound strange, the next time I saw the alomst exact same object was in the movie &quot;Close Encounters of The Third Kind.&quot; What we saw on that day looked just liked the first spaceship which first came over the landing area in that movie. If anyone wants to talk to me about it please e-mail me.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "Object hovering at top of mountain rising slowly but steady up and to the right. The object has a bright white light that stays on all the time. There are also red and blue lights which are flashing with varying intensities. The object is moving ever so slowly but is moving. This is not a planet or star. It is definitely some type of craft. By our compass the object is southeast of us. It is fairly distant and still appears quite large. The array of lights seem to be ever changing except the white light. We have viewed it with the naked eye and binoculars and neither appears like a normal object. My best description would be that this appears to be a cluster of flashing lights. It is now 2:48 and we have been observing this object since 1:30. It is still rising and appears to be moving south. We will be watching your web site to see if any one else has observed this object. It is following relatively the same path that Mars followed this summer but it ain&apos;t Mars! We withhold our names only because we live in a very rural area where we would definitely be hauled off to the funny farm. We would however discuss this with any other viewers or intelligent beings.((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a &quot;twinkling&quot; star may have been the cause of the sighting.

An object (green ball with long yellow white tail) appeared from the top of my windshield and went straight down in the sky.  I could not tell the distance. It seemed to disappear before coming to the tree line in front of me.", "Craft follows vehicle on Canadian Highway with spotlightIt was 2:00 am and I was headed East on the Yellowhead Highway, Hwy 16. I was just a few miles outside of Houston.  I had just left the little town of Smithers and I was looking for a Fair Grounds that I had thought they had there to overnight with 5 horses that I had brought out of Alaska.  I had traveled this Highway lots of times and usually stayed in Vanderhoof or Quesnel but the road had been bad coming down the Cassiar Hwy and had slowed me down.  My traveling companions besides the 5 equines consisted of my SharPei dog (CharChar) and 1 cat (Sally).  It was my traveling companions that alerted me to something unusual in the beginning.  Char started talking to me and howling in a strange way and was looking out the rear window.  I could see a strange white glow on her when I turned around.  At first this registered as light coming off my front running lights on the Horse Trailer, the problem being they are orange, not white.  Still did not register with me that there was anything unusual yet.  Then Sally, the cat, started making strange noises I never had heard before and she actually jumped up on the seat in front with me then jumped back to the back and went under the seat.  Her hackles were up at the time.  Meanwhile, Char is running from the back rear window to me and is talking and whining and her hackles are up.  I was at this point starting to get spooked.  I had slowed down considerably looking for the Fair Grounds and had been leaning forward on the stearing wheel (there was some ground fog in the valleys there too).  It was at this time that I realized the truck was glowing with a white light and the ground around me also was.  It was like I was in a big spotlight with  one of those new blue-white headlights they have out now. I leaned forward and looked up and realized that there was something over me.  It was as larger than a large full moon in size in the sky and was a glowing green color with this large white light in the middle.  Like a stupid idiot I really slowed down and rolled my window down and listened. I heard no engines.  At this point I am trying to justify this with a meteor, crashing plane, helicopter, anything but imagining that I could be the perfect &quot;ufo medical experiment on wheels, 5 equine,1 feline,1 canine and 1 hominid.&quot; This my daughter latered reminded me of and we had a good laugh, however I failed to see the humor in it at the time it was happening. I don&apos;t think I directly thought of this however I know it had to be in my mind. The object suddently removed the light from me and then sped forward. I was at this point going up a hill and it appeared to be going to the top of the hill to land.  It was at this point I actually saw 3 points of light that were red or orange on the edge.  I thought they might have been engine exhaust or after burners.  It was a little unclear with the fog I was going in and out of.  This was not a heavy fog, more like a mist. It hesitated at the crest of the hill then suddenly made a sharp turn and headed due North from me.  It was at this point that I realized that I had come to a complete stop in the Highway.  Myself and Char were just staring at this thing.  I can&apos;t tell you what was running through her mind but I can tell you I was now scared. It went through this mist and went right up and over a small mountain there.  I could see the glow of light from beyond the mountain like it had landed.  I got going again quite quickly and stopped in the next town to call my husband.  He is in the USAF and while I am relating all this to him it was at this time I realized that the entire Convenience Store was now quiet.  Everyone in there was listening to me! One of the customers in there told me that there had been sitings in the area all Summer!  Well I ask if there was a RCMP close at hand because I still thought that maybe I should report it.  The clerk in the store he did not think the office for just reporting would be open at this time so I just determined I would call later.  There were 2 logging truck drivers there that said that I could park between them if I was still scared since they would be there until 6:00 when the mill opened.  This is exactly what I did. The next morning I started off again headed for Arlington,Washington. Somewhere before Prince George I spied a RCMP on the side of the road running radar and it was a woman.  I thought this would be the chance to talk to someone so I parked on the side of the road and approached her vehicle.  I had made sure that I had picked up one of my Business Cards first.(I run a horse transport business so I do a lot of traveling at night.  It is easier on the horses especially in the Summer.  I also had lived 17 years in Alaska so I knew this Hwy and this was a first for me on it.) When I came up the first thing out of mouth was that here was my business card, that I did not do drugs nor rarely drank and certainly had been doing neither the previous night.  She listened to my tale then handed the card back to me and kind of chuckled.  Without saying anything to me she got on the radio back to Houston, BC, Canada and told them I would be calling in a report.  I interrupted her to ask if it would be a problem if I called once I got to a land line in Washington and she said yes.  Well this went better than I had expected.  I really thought that she might have been calling out the &quot;paddy wagon&quot; with the straight jackets for me.  It was at this time after speaking on the radio she got out of the car and looked at me straight on.  She then proceeded to tell me she believed me and did not think that I was a &quot;NUT&quot; since if I was a nut seeing things at night then they had 2 RCMP&apos;s that were the same and were seeing things in broad daylight.  She said that a craft had been sited in the same area just a few days before. I proceeded on feeling much better actually.  When I got to Arlington, Washington at a motel I called the desk at the RCMP&apos;s at Houston and gave them a full report. Now, I am going to tell you something at this point.  I tried when this actually happened to give a report to you over the phone and you were very rude to me.  I had seen the lights over Texas also a month later.  THis was when they lights were appearing over Washington, Texas and several other places.  You said you were too busy to take the report over the phone and for me to file it on the Internet.  We just got a Computer here not to long ago.  So don&apos;t blame be for waiting for so long to report this.((NUFORC Note:  Date of event is approximate.  We will forward the case to Brian Vike, B. C. UFO investigator, for follow up.

I obeserved it flying NNE.  I decided to try and follow it.  I made a turn E and followed it for several blocks and it changed direction ater a minute or two.  I then turned to follow it N, and it changed direction again.  I made a final turn and I assume was noticed following it and it instantly accelerated and within less than 2 second was on the far NNE part of town.  Going in that direction it easily could be headed toward Cannon AFB, and coming into Roswell from the direction of White Sands Missle Range (SW of Roswell).((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I looked up and thought that I initially was seeing an aircraft coming in for a landing...not unusual, as I lived about 1 mile from New Bedford airport. The only reason that I continued to look for any length of time were (1) the craft was stopped...(2) no noise   (3) no blinking lights.  (4) strange appearance.  All of those quickly ruled out a chopper or plane, and every second the object seemed stranger.   As I watched, the shape was hard to determine but appeared somewhat triangular...there were lights, but they were just hues, no blinking.  There was no sound at all.  Craft made some sudden  &quot;nervous type&quot; moves, all followed by complete and sudden stops, which startled me.  It then slowly hovered across the highway, with a few complete stops,  then was completely stopped above the treeline in a non-occupied wooded area behind my home (I rented an attached apartment).  I ran and knocked on my landlord&apos;s door, but they were not in, and unfortunately I did not have any camera film.  The craft then went down behind the tree line in the wooded area.  I was shaken.  I was a school teacher (and still am)  I only told my parents and one other teacher in the area, and some close friends not from the area.  I overheard a student talking to another the next morning, stating he had &quot;seen something&quot; out near the New Bedford airport at appx. the same time...strikingly similar.  I did not talk to the student.  Another friend spoke to someone on an airplane from Boston a month later, a salesman, who suddenly spoke of seeing &quot;something weird&quot; recently....when asked where, he replied &quot;New Bedford Mass&quot;, along the highway and close to the airport.  I had never seen anything like this before, or since.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "1 mile away on the other side of the Canning River at 1:30amI was talking with my friend one Saturday night on his balcony overlooking the Canning River in Perth, Western Australia. I was sitting on a chair with my bach to the wall, while I was facing the view which happened to be the night sky with the river below. My friend was facing me, that is why he didn&apos;t see it.A few degrees above my line of sight, the UFO apeared. I guess it was about a 1 mile away directly infront of me. As soon as it appeared it shot in a curve to the right and slightly up and vanished. I believe I saw it from behind. It moved incredible fast and with no sound. It wasn&apos;t just some ball of light, it was quite detailed, as I said before, I think I saw it&apos;s behind, which to me was a dimond shape but I think it would have been a triangle if I had seen a top profial. On the 2 wing extremes of the UFO were 2 large white lights which made me think of the Lockhead Blackbirds jets, but the lights weren&apos;t blinding. In the middle of the object was a dull red colour. I estimate the UFO was about 15m wide and 4m tall, I couldn&apos;t see how long it was. The Perth flight paths are over my house and were I saw the UFO. My friends house also shows from its balcony a side on view the planes decending to Perth International and Domestic Airports a few km&apos;s away. You can also see the head lights of the planes from the eastcoast comming from the horizon over the Darling ranges in the east of Perth until they get closer and closer and then bank to a side on view for their decent to the Airport. I say all this because I am completly familiar with the air traffic around Perth, what it looks like day and night, the speeds they can go, their movability and the sound all the different aircraft make. You can easily hear a passenger Jet 1 mile away as well as a lier Jet, What I saw made no sound, even at the impossible speed it moved. My friend stopped talking and had to ask what I was looking at, a was lost for words, I never said it was Aliens but to me it is still a UFO (because I have no Idea what it was). I must admit my reaction was a lot more low key then I would have thought I&apos;d have. The sight didn&apos;t frighten me at all, and I&apos;m astonished at the fact that it has made very little impact on me at all, maybe its my way of pretending it didn&apos;t happen, I can&apos;t explain it so I&apos;vce ignored it up until now.", "an orange object flying through the night skyMy family and i returned from my sister in laws on sunday 28thsept at approx 21:00, we got out of the car which is parked in allocated parking in a car park to the side of our house, I looked up to the sky and as it is dark in the car park and we are quite high up here you get a very good veiw it was also a very clear sky, i could see so many stars, i called to my son who is 4 years old to hurry out of the car and come and have a look as he dosnt often get a chance to see the night sky as he is obviously in bed, i looked back to the sky and saw a oval shaped orange object, going straight accross the sky i shouted to my husband who was getting our baby out of the car &quot;oh my god what the hell is that?&quot; my husband looked up and also saw the object which i am pleased about, there was no noise with the object and no trailing debry, it was about the hight of an aeroplane but there was no flashing lights it moved quite quickly accross the sky i have never seen any thing like this before and was quite freaked out by it maybe there is an explanation as to what it was or maybe someone else has seen something similar, i thought i would report it as i would like to try and find out what it was", "Three silent lights pased overhead from north to south at a constant speed and positionOn a clear night, partial moon, very quiet, a freind and I were on a bluff overlooking the Missouri River. We could hear sounds from far away, jets overhead at cruising altitude preceding their noise, dogs barking 1 mile away, ticking noises from the cooling car engine after it was turned off, etc. We saw an object with three lights, one at each corner or close to each corner pass silently overhead. The lights were not marker lights, not strobes, they remained constant. the lights were not beam lights, but rather seemed the size of one&apos;s fingernail on an outstretched arm. The color was a yellowish sort, rather like the color of street lights. There were no other strobe or marker lights required by th FAA on all aircraft flying in commercial airspace, and there was no noise. It passed in a straight path and constant speed overhead from north to south. We thought perhaps it was a stealth bomber returning to Whiteman Airforce base but the lack of lights and noise caused us to question it.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We saw a large egg shaped object (too big for a planet)about 35-40 degrees up in the eastern sky.  We stared at it and wondered what it was and it changed colors from whitish yellow to red and then back to white. It was reflecting (we think) the sun as it set. It moved a little but nothing erratic. It gradually faded.  We went out to dinner and talked to several other people who saw it.  Then we asked the local police and they laughed and said it was a weather balloon and they had alot of calls on it.  I contacted the national weather service and inquired about any possible weather ballon launchings.  I received an email back from a weather rep. and he stated that they certainly did not launch any in that area (also the object was far too large) and that he had seen it also as did hundreds of others.  Possibly miliary, NASA, private or what.....no one knows.  So, in conclusion I think it deserves to be reported.((NUFORC Note:  We have received several reports from the CA/AZ/NM area recently of what we suspect are high-altitude helium balloons.  This may be one of those reports.

It was much higher than I&apos;ve ever seen a plane fly, there was no noise or contrail, and it was moving at an incredible rate of speed in a perfectly straight line.  I was able to view it for 5 - 10 seconds and then it was gone.  From where I was, it looked like it flew over the Northwest Arkansas Regional Airport (XNA), so they might have caught it on radar.  I thought maybe it was the ISS, but I don&apos;t know if that&apos;s visible to the naked eye during the day.", "The wings of the craft emmitted a low intencity green light, and the craft flew low, slow, and silent.The craft that I saw 0n the night of 08/28/03 is difficult to describe, since I could not see the fusilage. What I could see was the wing portion of the craft. Each wing starts off straight, but then is bent upwards around the mid-length of the wing and then bent downwards to form two sides of a triangle. The under side of the wings(the part I could see) appeared to have what looked like veins that emmitted a low intencity green light. The light intencity from the craft was not strong enough to overcome the light intencity of our street lights in our parking lot. Using buildings and trees as a heighth and width reference I would say that the craft was flying at 60-100 Ft. off the ground. The wing span I would estimate at being 40-60 Ft. in length. The speed of the craft at about 10 M.P.H. I could not understand how a winged craft moving that slow not only did&apos;nt run into a stall speed problem, but concidering the altitude, that it did not emit any sound.", "Three different sightings of dim, orange lights arranged in various shapes passing soundlessly over my house.This is a personal journal entry taken from the week following the sighting.May 27, 2002. It&rsquo;s been a long time and much has happened. Firstly I should report that on Tuesday, May 21, 2002 I had three separate UFO sightings. It was garbage night at around ten thirty. The evening was clear, cloudless and refreshing. I was looking up at the stars and moon, as I often do on when it&rsquo;s nice, making my last trip down the driveway with the blue box in tow. Up towards Mount Hope Airport I saw six lights, two triangles fat side first, coming as a unit towards the house at an indistinguishable height. They immediately got my attention because they were nothing like any airplane lights I had ever seen. As, what I thought to be a plane approached I observed that the lights were all the same color; orange, dim and larger than I usually see on planes at night around here. As it passed over head I became even more fascinated (perplexed) because the plane made no sound. The lights were indeed close enough that I should hear sound, and in fact, they were close enough that I should be able to see a shape or silhouette of some sort. Yet there was none of that either. In fact, I could see right between the lights to the stars beyond. Now I was transfixed and as it went a little farther the light pattern of two triangles rearranged themselves,  scattering into a haphazard pattern indicating to me that this wasn&rsquo;t one plane but six individual units. I was pretty freaked out but surprisingly less than I would have thought. I made some phone calls (two to a very unappreciative friend because his daughter was asleep (jerk!)) and then went out front to have another look. I called my brother with my portable phone but wound up talking with his wife because he was at the Leaf game. I didn&rsquo;t bother mentioning to her what I was calling about because of the subject matter. As I was rapping up the call I saw another one. This was a singular, orange, dim light (same as the others) coming diagonally from across the street, perpendicular to my house, and going west. It was a spot of light too fast for a plane but! too slow for the steak of a shooting star. It was strange talking to someone but not being able to tell them. Then finally, after I got off the phone I saw the last one. It was a line of three horizontal lights (same as the others) traveling on a similar path as the first but a little more west.", "Cigar w/ two lights (--).  Staunton, VANoticed object in sky SW of Staunton, VA at about 11:00 PM.  Watched for over an hour.  Object moved in every direction in short bursts.  It moved around, but stayed in the same general area.  Looked like two long slender lights parallel to the ground, like this --.  Viewed object in sky until I fell asleep around 12:30 AM.  This object was quicker and more agile in the air than I can explain.  It would take off real quick in a straight line, then seem to turn 90 degrees, then up and down and left and right.  No blinking lights on this craft either.  Can&apos;t tell how far away it was.  I feel sure there will be more reports than this one about this sighting.  I don&apos;t know what this thing was, but it was pulling off manuevers that I think could be beyond human technology at this time(public technology).", "There were pulsed white light surrounding an object with circular blue lights with a ring of red and white light underneath.My husband and I were driving home on Gosling Road in Spring Texas last night (11-02-03) just after midnight.  The car in front of us approximately 1/4 mile ahead slammed on their brakes and turned and sped off the road quickly.  My husband asked me if I saw the strange lightening in the sky. I didn&apos;t think it was lightening because it was white pulsing flashes. I thought it must be from a tower. But neither of us had ever noticed a tower on this road before. As we drove closer to the light I looked up out the passenger car window and witnessed 5 or 6 circular blue lights in a semi-circle. Underneath the blue lights were a red and white ring of pulsing lights. The pulsed white light illuminating from the object and flashed across the sky. The light pulsed every few seconds. I couldn&apos;t see the shape of the object because it was too dark. I only saw it for a couple seconds and it was gone. The white lightening was also gone. All my husband saw was a flash of blue lights within the white light then nothing.", "To whom this may concern and please take seriously, We could not contact or find a no. to call.While looking at the northen star on 10/22/03 noticed movement below it.Also shaped like a star from the long distance we looked upon it we knew it wasn&apos;t.I&apos;m sure you hear this all but this thing hovered,slowly then zipped back and forth and stopped momentarily and continued to do this for hours.Also it seemed to have something like a halo around it.My partner said the light sometime changed to red and green.3 hours later i went out curious and it was still there but still slowly moving west like before.Then i noticed the other,directly to the east,doing exactly the same as the one i just described.There were 2 of them.The second one not moving as rapidly as the first but still darting back and forth.It wasn&apos;t a plane and to my knowledge satellites don&apos;t hover and then zig zag all over and then hover again,this movement was far to rapid.Was truly amazing to watch.", "On a moonless, star-lit night,  greenish-orange light moves rapidly and silently  about the dark sky while being pursued by a jet.The night is absolutely clear, very dark, and moonless. Out in the rural country-- no town lights, farm lights, vehicles--nothing but black sky populated with thousands of stars all a-twinkle. Hearing a piston-engined airliner flying towards the south, I lloked up--almost immediately noticing a greenish-orange or yellowish light meandering along soundlessly, first heading in one direction then another. (quite unlike any conventional aircraft of the time) I know what it is...UFO! Calling my friend, we watch for perhaps half-a-minute what appears to be a seemingly aimless flight pattern. Suddenly, another night traveler arrives on the scene. I hear it, then see its navagation lights. A jet! a millitary plane...has to be, for (at this time--1953) there are no civillian jet-powered aircraft of any kind. At almost the same moment that I see the newcomer, its pilot spots the UFO light, immediately changes course, and makes a bee-line for the thing. Thereafter, what follows is a &quot;cat an&apos; mouse game&quot; of &quot;Catch-Me-if-You-Can&quot; between the light and the plane. The UFO zips ahead, the jet falling behind, then slowing nearly to a stop, the chased allows its pursuer to close. Once the seperation is minimal, away it goes at an unbelievably high speed--sometimes executing angle maneuvers of less than 90 deg. (with little or no slowing) until ready to once again tease the adversary. For its part, the jet is able to make only gentle, sweeping turns; as its prey, in ghostly silence, traces various geometric figures in the night sky. Only the roaring and panting of the military aircraftis heardin its utterly futile attempt to catch the soundless speck as it continues its Will-O-The-Wisp dance. It is quite a show. And, after some two-and-a-half minutes or so, the participants disappear in a southwesterly direction--still engaged in a one-sided midnight game of tag. It is my opinion that the military plane (was) a Northrop F89 Scorpion, because few (if any) single-seat jet fighters were flown at night on missions such as this. The Scorpion, a twoseat, radar and rocket equipped aircraft, was used in the intercepter roll. And, on this night, it definitely appears that one was trying to catch a &quot;boggy&quot;. There is a possibillity tat the &quot;chase plane&quot; may have been a Lockheed F-94 Starfire.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

This happened at around 23:00-23:30 on the flight deck in 1996 when I was stationed aboard the USS Coral Sea CV-43, an American aircraft carrier. The first aircraft to leave the ship before a launch is the rescue helicopter and is the last to land. I worked as an aircraft refueler (purple shirt) and was in charge of quanity and quality control of aviation fuel operations. After rescue helicopter landed,I was doing &quot;mop up operations&quot; (Making sure that all fod materail (trash and equipment) was removed so that we could get ready for the morning launch. I was walking aft of the ship alongside a shipmate (Aviation Ordnance, red shirt)when I saw an assortment of blinking lights directly behind the ship. I walked cautiously to investigate and was simply amazed at what I saw. The UFO was round and circular in shape and about 20-30 was just hovering (or floating) behind the ship with the blinking lights. In about 2-3 minutes, it simply disappeared as if it sank in the deep waters behind the ship. I realized that my shipmate had a grip on my arm with his mouth wide open and states, &quot;Wow, did you see that!&quot; I said , &quot;Yes, did you see it?&quot; I left the scene, and my ship mate still standing there in disbelief. I told a couple of fellows about it and they simply state, &quot;Why don&apos;t you give me some of what you been smoking&quot; and they simply laugh it off. I rarely tell anyone of the incident unless they initiate reports seeing UFO&apos;s. I have never seen anything since that incident, but I often watch the skies.

It sounded like a tarp flapping in a hurricane with electric overtones (bug zapper sounds). We walked towards the sound, but couldn&apos;t see what was causing it, just stars. As we got closer it was almost overhead, but still couldn&apos;t see anything. We reached our fenceline and relized it was about 20ft ahead and about 50ft up. We walked about 50+/-ft to both sides and could tell the noise was coming from the same locale. So we stood at the closest viewing location inside our fence. Our necks were getting sore from looking up, so my wife decided to go to the house to get a flashlight to shine at this invisible object. I tried SOS in morse code a few times, but nothing. My wife grabbed the flashlight and started flashing in a very erratic way. After about 30 seconds the noise changed to a loud jet engine noise and I saw an orange glowball (softball size), it zipped to the east about 100yrds and quickly returned to its original location all in about 3 seconds, almost making a tracer effect.

While I was looking upwards at her, something caught my eye to the right but somewhat almost overhead in the clouds, and I looked over and saw a dark gray disk come straight down from the clouds and hover underneath the clouds, in total silence, hovering with just the slightest of movement (there was a bulbous shape in the center of the disc of the UFO) and as I stared at it in shock for 15 seconds or so, it slowly lifted up and back into the clouds again, where nobody could see it. I was in shock and it felt surreal. I am 49 years old now and have looked for one over since because I KNOW they exist. I hope to see another sighting in my lifetime!

During our sighting another person asked what we were looking at and when I pointed up they panicked and left very quickly. There was quite a distance between the strobes, more so than any aircraft I&apos;ve ever seen.

On 9/11/03 Byler received requested mail at home from his contact at the Abatement Department at the Port of PDX. There was a note attached to a computer printout of air activity over the Portland, Troutdale, Hillsburo area. At the top was the Port of Portland insignia and the following typed information to the right of the Printout... August 29, 2003  Between 22:30-22:40 PM. All aircraft operations over the Gresham area between 10:30 and 10:40 PM. *The circles are five miles apart. ..and a note that said, &quot;Eric. Possibly the person saw the Boing 767-300 (B763) coming in from the West.  It was headed strait for him for several minutes. I&apos;m also thinking that with all the pilots in the area at that time, anything unusual would have been reported.&quot;  After examining the map Byler concurred with this opinion as the print out clearly showed the flight path and location of the plane in question during its journey towards landing at PDX. The Intersection of NW Angeline AV. and NW 5th St. in Gresham are also clearly marked on the map as mentioned in the original witness report. There are four commercial flights represented on the map, three arrivals and two departures. At exactly 10:28 PM Boing 767-300 (B763) was arriving and was due west of the witness, 14 miles out and at 6998 feet. The flight traveled for about fifteen miles at 221 miles per hour on a nearly strait on flight path toward the witnesses location at Angeline and 5th, bright landing lights on, and then circled that location at about one mile out.  It then began its strait decent to the North West toward landing at PDX. Also in the air at 10:28 PM... 1) An arrival due South of the witness, 10 miles out and at 4961 feet. 2) An arrival due North of the witness, 5 miles out and at 1486 feet. 3) A departure northeast of the witness, 17 miles out and climbing at 5666 feet. 4) An arrival that had just landed from the southeast. It has been confirmed that none of the other pilots in the area reported an unidentified during the duration of the witnesses sighting. It has been confirmed that the tower did not see an unidentified craft in the airspace of the witnesses sighting. No one coming or going from the Portland International Airport reported seeing an unidentified craft in the area of the Airport as described it should have been at the end of the witness report. The witness himself does not report seeing the 767 in his airspace when the printout clearly shows he should have. The logical explanation is that he did in fact see the 767 in his airspace.  The fact that it was dark at 10:30 PM and that he was only seeing a series of lights lead us to the conclusion that he simply connected the dots with strait lines to give the illusion he was seeing a triangle shaped craft.  This is very common with night light sightings. The fact that the entire sighting took place from a moving car also seems to account for his not hearing the commercial flight and would also seem to account for the other moments in the report when the lights appeared to &quot;pivot&quot; smoothly and turn in an odd manor. Oregon UFO Research Director Skip Schultz writes...&quot;In regards to the Gresham sighting, I have reviewed the data Eric received from The Port of PDX and the witness report. I agree with Erics analysis of the sighting. There were a number of identified airplanes in the approach pattern at the time of the sighting. One aircraft was in the reported location and at the exact time the witness reported seeing the triangular lights in the sky. Next, if there was an unknown object in the same flight pattern as the airplanes we have verified were there at the time, they would have reported this to the PDX tower. Also, if the witness was able to see the lights, the tower would have also seen these lights. The tower would have immediately called the unknown asking for identification since there would have been no transponder signal. With no response from the unknown, it would have been turned over to our contact at the abatement department for verification. At this point the Air National Guard would have been alerted to scramble and identify the unknown. This did not happen. The flight data Eric presents clearly shows that at the time of the sighting there was an aircraft in that pattern, in the exact location and landing at PDX. The lights disappearing at the point reported by the witness disappeared at the exact time that the known airplane landed at PDX. Media did not report that a UFO landed at PDX so we can conclude with certain confidence this sighting was the known airplane verified in the area at the time. There was some disagreement with Oregon MUFON as to whether the pilots would report this to the tower if they had seen an unidentified in the first place.  OUFOR is convinced that there is no conspiracy at the airport right now due to the heightened awareness and concern of terrorist threats and that if an unknown were to have been spotted our contact would have shared that information with us. We conclude that the witness misidentified the lights of a 767 on its final 7 minute approach to PDX as a triangle craft based solely on light patterns, a very common occurrence. Special thanks to Peter Davenport for sharing witness information with us and for MUFON State Director Tom Bowden for his follow up investigation in the Gresham area that included several witness interviews.   We also would like to thank Jerry Gerspatch of the Port of PDX (Portland International Airport) for his continued cooperation and information sharing in this and past UFO investigations we have conducted.

IN the middle of the night, I awoke with the need to relieve myself and exited the van through the side sliding door.  I was standing a few steps from the vehicle facing the rear and looking at the stars in a cloudless sky when I thought I detected a light moving to the right of the area at which I was looking.  But when i turneed my attention there, I saw nothing.  I turned to get back into the van when a brilliant, red beam flicked across the corner of my left eye into the front door.  I turned around to see the beam disintegrating, but intact enought to trace it to its source-a light in the same placae I had seen movement before.  Immediately upon the seeing the light, it quickly moved a short distance to the left horizontally and blinked out.  I was struck by the brilliance and richness of the beam as there was something about its aualities that rendered a warm, pleasant feeling deep within.  Unlike my first experience 34 years earlier, it took me a while to &apos;digest&apos; the event before I could return to sleep.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

She then saw another craft, identical to the first, traveling from west to east, west of the road.  Then a third craft, much larger than the other two, but otherwise identical in shape and color, was seen hovering west of the road.  The two small craft each stopped to either side of the large craft, hovered for 10 to 15 seconds, then the craft to the west merged with or entered the &quot;carrier.&quot;  Five or so seconds later, the small craft to the east entered or merged with the carrier.  For 10 or 15 seconds after this operation, the large craft remained stationary.  It then accelerated straight up and disappeared within one to two seconds.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

What I didn&apos;t realize was that while they were talking to me on the phone, the display of lights were taking place right now. The youngster asked if I would like to talk to her mother, she called for her to come to the telephone and the Mom described what they were observing at the moment. About an hour before arriving at their home, the family was at the shopping center and mentioned they could see the lights in the sky. Now calling me from their home, they are looking out the window and watching an amazing display of lights high above them in the sky. The 4 lights at equal distance from one another stayed in the same area in the sky, they turned around as if one would be looking at a Ferris wheel. She also noticed aircraft moving close to where the lights were. The witness described the lights as being a neon green in color. She also told me the lights would turn like the hands on a clock, but very quickly, then they would come together in the middle, becoming very bright. Then the lights would move back out again and perform the same maneuvers all over again but moving faster each time. No sound was heard. Thank you to the family for the report.

I also understand others may have seen the same flashing lights. My name is (deleted by HBCC UFO), I live in Ootischenia, just outside of Castlegar, next to the Castlegar Airport. It was a clear night, and I was looking to the north sky at the Big Dipper. I caught a glimpse of a flashing red/green and white light moving across the sky towards the west.  I thought it was an jet flying towards Vancouver, but then I returned my glance towards the east, above the Kootenay River valley, where the &quot;jet&quot; seemed to appear from, I saw another flashing light.  A called my husband, (name deleted by HBCC UFO), to come and see this, and he saw what I saw...then we saw another appear from the east fly over Mount Sentinel and move towards the west.  My three children joined us in our observations of the unidentified objects in the night sky. These were not jets!  Within a few minutes, there were five of these objects in the sky at one time flying in various directions.  Two in particular seemed to meet up with one another and hovered across from one another for about a minute or two, then one flew directly below it, and hovered there for less than a minute, then flew in a north eastern direction towards the back of Mount Sentinel. It flew out of sight, then in about another minute or so, reappeared from the east, (where they all seemed to come from). We watched these objects for about 15 minutes, then they all disappeared behind the mountains in the horizons. Tonight, Oct 3, I have so far seen one of these objects fly across the sky from east towards the west.  I plan to be out watching for these things again tonight.

A few shooting stars had gone over head and so we were really watching closely for anything .I had looked over to the ridge of hills on the far left side of the lake and I thought there was a radio tower with a flahing light on top of it.I pointed it out and then we realized that the light was far too high above the ridge to be a tower.The light wasn&apos;t moving and there was no sound at all.It was flashing white, red and green all lights were visable at all times, but the colours pulsed, but did not move or get smaller or larger..We actually stood looking at it for a few minutes trying to figure out what it could be. And then to the right of the lake the full moon had come out from behind a small cloud, we all moved further down the beach to look over at it.About 10 mins later when we were about to leave the beach and go back to our camp, I looked back over to the ridge and the lights were gone completely.

I live near the airport so just assumed them to be airplanes at first.  The noises sounded like airplanes coming in for landing, but there was no sound of engines just that of something moving through the air quickly.  I&apos;ve lived near the airport most of my life, so I know these were unusual noises.  About five minutes after I first heard the noises a new noise came to me.  At first it was distant, a few blocks away, but soon it was near enough to be over my neighbors across the alley.  It sounded like something hovering.  It grew near till it was extremely loud, paused for 30 seconds to a minute and then slowly went away.  There was another similar hovering noise, but it seemed fairly distant.  Honestly I was too scared to get out of bed, not to mention too cold, so I stayed in bed for nearly 10 more minutes before I woke my fiance and told him what I had heard.  You could still hear the sound of something travelling the sky without a jet engine, but there was no more hovering.  Around 4:30 you could finally hear actual Jet engines either taking off or landing, so no more anomaly like noises for the night.((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witness heard, but we wonder whether it might have been the vortices in the air, generated off the tips of landing airliners.

The lady had phoned to see if anyone else in the area had made a report on the object. The lady was on her way back home from Smithers, British Columbia which is about a 45 minute drive from Houston. She had a number of young girls with her as she was bringing them back home from a dance rehearsal which they were attending in Smithers. As she made her way up Hungry Hill, and driving slowly due to the foggy condition and just as the lady was to break out of the fog she noticed a extremely bright white object a head of them and not very high up in the sky. As they motored along the object dropped quickly from the higher altitude to just above the tree tops, still moving towards the west, or in the Smithers direction. (HBCC UFO Note: The witnesses said the white light was so low over the tree tops she thought it was going to hit). She told me her first thought it was an airplane when it was at the higher altitude, but when it dropped so suddenly she ruled that idea out, still not knowing what it was she was observing. The lady went on to say the object/light was huge. Flat like a dinner plate with something hanging from the bottom of it, there was one single green light on the object on the bottom. She mentioned that they were maybe only a half mile away from the object at it&apos;s closet point to them. The witness also said at one point the object moved in different directions carrying these maneuvers out very rapidly. The lady said she wanted to stop to take a good look due to her driving the car, but all the young kids in the vehicle were very frightend so she kept traveling along slowly and glancing behind her from time to time until the object/light had disappeared from her sight. There was no sound heard coming from the object, she did say they had the radio on, but it was turned off when they spotted the object and the car window rolled down.

Four witnesses who were near the Driftwood fossil beds just outside of Smithers British Colombia watched a strange looking object for approx: 10 minutes. The object was described as being very flat (almost looking like a wing of an aircraft), silver in color and very long. It appears the sun was reflecting off it, as it was shinning very brightly. One of the witnesses described the tips of the object as being like a jet&apos;s wing tips, slightly bent upwards. The witnesses told me the object stayed stationary in one spot, but from time to time it did move from side to side. The fellows also noted that there was a line of red lights running along the object. The folks watched the lights move from the tips of it into the center of the object then disappear. The red lights continued the same pattern over and over again while it sat stationary. As the object was leaving the area where it was first located, it grew smaller and smaller due to it moving into the  distance.

It is rather fun to contribute observations and relevant materials and inquiries from time to time.And I will continue to keep my eyes open - and let you all know what I discover every great now and then,as I walk my puppy - or step out for a quick smoke,gazing up at the stars. WELL - it seems here in &quot;Wierdsville&quot; Ohio,I have yet again experienced something very odd,yet ironically and irritably - vaguely explainable as a possible conventional object,even though it exhibited some really funky attributes. These experiences are almost paradoxical and self contradictory in nature - blending aspects of the familiarly recognizable and mundane,with the totally bizarre. One night last week - and again,later this evening,or more appropriately yesterday evening since it is now 4:00 AM by my clock(I&apos;m a night owl),I have seen low flying &quot;Mystery Planes&quot; Passing over my nieghborhood at a somewhat low altitude... Now my area is literally SURROUNDED by small,modest,municipal airports - and why not? - It&apos;s the birthplace of aviation.These airports service small aircraft mostly,such as small propeller prop personal aircraft,small business jets,etc.. The nearest airport to me is in Middletown Ohio and services a private airline comprised of vintage WW2 C47 / DC3 aircraft,the type of gull winged,dual propeller prop aircraft used to drop paratroopers at the D-DAY and the Normandy invasions.These planes are pretty good sized,I am aware of their shape and lighting configurations. They are NO WHERE NEAR the size of a large passenger jet liner such as a Boeing 727 or an L10-11,The DC3s are designed to require less of a strip stretch / tarmac length to land on also. What I saw tonight,and once last week - appeared to me to be a normally flying,albiet oddly quiet,low,and slow moving large passenger jet liner type of airplane - according to it&apos;s light configurations and colors. It was too dark to see these aircrafts shapes or silouettes on both occassions. Both &quot;mystery planes&quot; I have seen had the typical flashing red landing / belly lights,wing tip lights,flood lights,etc.. So what&apos;s so wierd about that-and why are bothering us reporting PLANES here instead of little silver balls and flying saucers from mars?-You might be asking?  WELL-THESE planes that I observed slowly passing low over my nieghborhood had several very wierd characteristrics... #1 - NO SOUND OF A DISERNABLE JET ENGINE,even though they were low enough to where the engine drones SHOULD have been quite obvious.I may have heard a very VERY low &quot;humming roar&quot; or drone sound - but not at the proper volume that it should&apos;ve been logically / normally - I&apos;de probably have to strain myself to hear it clearly over normal background noise coming from barking dogs,vehicles on the highway near me,etc.. #2 - They appeared to be flying so low as to be coming in on a relatively close landing approach,yet the two airports nearest me that are large enough to land a passenger jet of THAT size are in Cincinnati and Dayton - which are quite a ways away from Trenton.Large passenger jets CAN fly somewhat low over my area on final approach to either of these locations - but NOT AS LOW as these &quot;mystery planes&quot; I have observed. There are NO airports that can service that type of plane or accomodate it&apos;s landing near my home - even though the one I observed last night WAS heading in the direction of Middletown&apos;s field.The strips that are operated by the local municipal fields are simply too small,too tightly taxable,and far too short!Trying to land a large passenger jet on one of them would be catastrophic!  #3 - The plane I observed last night had it&apos;s wing tip lights TOO FAR BACK,as if it&apos;s fuselage tapered into a &quot;Delta&quot; wing configuration such as the shape reminiscent of a British Dehavilland Vampire fighter jet,a french SAB fighter,or the Concord.I know of no passenger planes - even small ones - that fly around here that have wings of that type.((NUFORC Note:  The witness provides a graphic of the object he witnessed.

Sky was clear and I was taking a walk as I usually do. It was just after sundown. I was walking East towards home and I saw a bright meteor flash above me heading from West to East. I merely thought I had seen a brilliant meteor. A week later while taking my walk and almost at the same time I again saw a brilliant meteor heading again West to East about the same brightness as the previous one. I thought &quot;how unusual to see two in about a week. About a week and a half later I didn&apos;t take my usual walk and was sitting in the living room and glanced out my picture window which faced East, and again saw a brilliant meteoric flash leaving a long trail and dissappearing over the roof of some distant houses. All three meteors were of similar intensity in brilliance which I thought very unusual. Especially to see 3 the same month and all were traveling West to East.((NUFORC Note:  It is not unusual for three meteors to be seen in the same area over such a short period of time, but it is unusual for meteors to fly from west to east.

We say what appeared to be a star about 20 deg. (two closed fists) above the horizon.  This star was blinking on and off, about twice per second. It was as bright as surrounding stars.  Initially, it was not moving, just blinking.  This is was caught my eye, the fact that it did not move.  Had it moved, I would have thought it to be a plane.  But it stayed it one spot for about 15 minutes, never moving.  We wondered what kind of aircraft could stay so stationary.  Even a helicopter would have moved a bit in 15 minutes.  Then suddenly the blinking star instantly moved from its position horizontally about 10 deg.  Then it instantly moved diagonally, then vertically, then one way or another.  It would hold in one position for a few seconds, then instantly move again.  If you imagine a piece of cardboard with many little white lightbulbs randomly mounted on it about one or two inches apart, and wired so you could light individual lightbulbs, and then you randomly light the various lightbulbs every couple of seconds, this would be an approximation of what we saw.  After about 15 minutes of this star jumping about, it moved to about 10 deg. above the horizon and then slowly moved away to the south, moving in the way an airplane would appear flying along, straight and even flight, no longer jumping about.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

There is about a 100 feet of sand between the water and the bird sanctuary that is on the other side of you as you walk the beach. It was about 75 degrees that night and the tide was unusally high. It is very isolated. It was a dark, clear, starry night. When we got near the lighthouse we felt a weird sensation like we were being watched. The only light is the lighthouse light. I even said I thought someone was watching us. We turned around and walked back to where we entered the beach and had an uneasy walk back to the boardwalk.

They then disappeared. The formation was very sophisticated and I grew up on Edwards AFB and my dad was in the Air Force so I know what military exercises look like and I am an engineer and have worked with flares, so I know this was not either military or flare or fireworks in resemblence. We stayed to watch the night sky as red orange formations lit up the sky, sometimes three shapes very high on the left and then two below on the left of the sky. It was some pretty sophisticated stuff. I remember that even though it seemed to happen fast, before we knew it, it was 9pm. I know it started at 8:30 because the reason I happen to be looking in that direction is because I was looking for the time. I can honestly say that I am a skeptic and whatever I s! aw scared the crap out of me and made me consider having a much more open mind.

I happend to see a &quot;star&quot; move.  It looked like any other star.  It wasn&apos;t the brightes and it wasn&apos;t the dimmest.  It moved in a circular pattern; that is it quickly (about 1/2 second) made one circle with a diameter of about 3/4&quot; (using my fingers at arms length to measure this and the following apparent distances), and then remained motionless for several minutes.  I didn&apos;t say anything because I felt that if it didn&apos;t move again my friends might pass it off as an eye movement.It finally moved again, this time it moved in a straight line about 4 apparent inches accross the sky.  There was no appearance of accelleration or decelleration; just a quick move.  It then sat motionless again for a few minutes.  It made another circle, and one of my friend said, &quot;Did anybody see thst?&quot;  I said that I&apos;ve been watching it. It behaved this way for quite some time, making circles and straight lines, and remaining motionless for minutes between moves.  The circles all seemed to be the same size, but the length of the lines varied from about 4&quot; to about 18&quot;.  It always looked like a star: no flashing or colored lights, and it always held the same brightness.  The last time we saw it is when it disappeared into the sky (or over the horizon) with a long, straight-line dash.  There it was, and then darted off, out of sight in about a second or less. What I find interesting about this is WHERE it occurred.  It was directly over what at that time was Carswell AFB.  From where we were sitting, if there was any ground activity on base, we could have seen it.  We saw no military activity.  Not on the ground, not in the air. This is a place to report; not to speculate, but I can&apos;t help myself :) I&apos;m now under the impression that thing was being operated by our Air Force.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The Satsop quake had just happened a few months before. We ran outside and looked to the south, where the noise was coming from, and as plain as day saw this object the size of a battle ship, about 1000 foot above the Chehalis River and traveling toward Aberdeen. It was moving to slow to be an airplane. It was triangular shaped with bright lights shining down over the river. As it was moving, the loud rumble stopped for a minute or so, dead silent, the shaking stopped, but it was still moving at the same speed. I nearly put a load in my pants. I ran into the house to get a camera, and the shaking and rumble began again. By the time I got back outside with the camera, it was gone from view, behind what I know as Alder Grove hill. It was amazing, and changed my view of life forever. I&apos;m still surprised nothing was ever mention about this again.

Kevin Walston from the Air Combat Command public affairs office at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia. The Langley office is the official Air Force contact office for B-2 information. &sup3;Whatever the person might have seen, it was not a B-2.&sup2; A spokeswoman at McChord Air Force Base said there were no aircraft from McChord in the area on Tuesday night, and this morning, the National Guard unit at Montesano said that none of their units were operating in the area on Tuesday either.Reports on Wednesday described the rumbling, low-flying craft as everything from a commercial jet to a B-2 bomber to a UFO. One South Aberdeen man was certain it was a heavy-lift helicopter.&sup3;It flew right over my house,&sup2; he said. &sup3;It was all lit up underneath. I could see all three propellers.&sup2;  Hope this is the one. As I remember, it occurred a couple of months after the Satsop Earthquake (July 2, 1999). The article was not front page news, which surprised  my  wife and I because of how dramatic it was for us. I remember the article mentioning police reports, and seen from Montesano to Aberdeen, and happened around an hour after dusk. The article may have stated something like  &quot;military spokesman had said that nothing was noted in the area&quot; and had speculated that the object may have been a large helicopter.We did not file any report at the time, but since then recent television shows on UFO&apos;s have shown pictures that are very close to what we had seen. I did a quick search of our 1999 archives for &quot;Helicopter&quot; &quot;Military&quot;  &quot;River&quot; &quot;Earthquake&quot; and couldn&apos;t find the article you are referring to.

It was saucer shaped and made no discernable sound. It was moving in an erratic horizontal pattern from my vantage point.

It was as bright as Mars is at first, in fact at first I thought it was Mars, and as it moved it increased in brightness about 4 or 5 times its initial brightness, or magnitude, then turned sharply, roughly 75 degrees from the plane of the horizon, and proceeded up through the constellation Cassiopeia, dimming as it disappeared in the distance. The entire event lasted approximately 12 to 15 seconds. Living as close as we do to Mt. Home AFB, I am quite familiar with aircraft lights and configuration, and this exhibited none that I am familiar with. We are about 8 miles from the airbase as the crow flies, and even at that distance one can discern the noise of the various jet aircraft stationed there while in flight. This object emitted no sound.

I stopped my car at the top of the overpass and just watched it move slowly W, right along I-195, and eventually disappearing over the trees in the distance.  What struck me most was that it made absolutely no noise, despite its huge size, and that it seemed to be gliding rather than flying.  In other words, it didn&apos;t seem to be displacing any air as it moved, and I heard nothing mechanical.

The bottom of the craft was only about 20&apos;-25&apos; above the road surface to my right and the leftmost white light (1 of 3) was just to the right of the truck cab. What I could see clearly were three brilliant white circular disc shaped lights about 4&apos; in diameter forming an equilateral triangle about 4&apos;-6&apos; apart 2 leading and 1 trailing center. A single bright red circular disc of lights approximate 3&apos; in diameter located in the center of the 3 white lights. When approaching from the rear, I leaned forward to look up behind the lights, but couldn&apos;t see anything but black and a faint smoky or black misty wake like a boat would leave in water. It looked like it could have been following the underside of the craft, but I really couldn&apos;t tell. The white lights were brilliant and looked like a hundred plus bulbs in a disc, but were too bright to see the light source, but they did not blind the eye when looking right at them. The light they gave off had a flood like appearance and lit the ground and the truck cab very well (about like hallogen). The red disc of light was bright red but did not glare as much and I could see what appeared to be maybe 30 or more bulbs. The actual count could be higher. The craft continued to fall behind at the 2mph rate until it was well behind the trailer then slowed considerably as I continued at 60mph. When a mild hill and then another overpass came, I could still see the brilliant white light glowing upward in my mirror even though I was possibly a mile or so away and over the hill. That was Tuesday, and I wasn&apos;t routed that way all the rest of that week. The following Sunday, I drove down there to investigate the area during daylight. The ditch in that area extends approximately 50&apos; over to a row of utility poles that are about 35&apos;-40&apos; in height all along the area this occurred. Since all during the event, I could not see the size or shape of the craft, this may help in some way. Also, I didn&apos;t get the precise locations of these, however I noticed there are a few lines coming from the utility poles and crossing I-29 at various points and appear to be elevated only about 2/3 the way up these poles. Maybe that explains why the craft backed off when it did. I think it might have had to stay below radar or something. When I first saw it bank &amp; drop, it went over to I-29 almost hugging the ground and I think it may have dropped where Loess Hills protrudes upwards just east of the interstate. Also, I forgot to mention the craft moved along like it was on rails, (not even a wobble or bump), nor did it have an angle of attack, (it was perfectly level). I couldn&apos;t roll down the right window (it isn&apos;t powered and it isn&apos;t safe to reach that far), but I had on an empty trailer and was on fairly flat ground and the motor wasn&apos;t real noisy, and I did not hear any noise from the craft over the moderate motor and tire noise of the truck.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and he sounded exceptionally credible to us.

There were five different colors in this order:  orange, yellow, blue, green, and red, each slowly revolving one at a time around a large invisible circular area.  The circlular area was &quot;like a plate laying down&quot; in a horizontal attitude.  The phenomenon appeared to be inside the clouds and was very large.

Very soon after sighting it, we passed from Laramie County (containing Cheyenne) into Albany County (containing Laramie).  The heavens were still bright (sunset had been at 19:39).  The only other object in the sky was the first-quarter Moon.  The &quot;cloud&quot; had an almost vertical orientation at first, and apparently hung over the Vedauwoo area (a formation of exposed granite mountains east of Laramie).  After a minute or so, the &quot;cloud&quot; took on more of a spherical shape but later did resume its near-vertical attitude for a short while.  As I drove toward the very bright object at 65 mph, it only seemed to get further away, more starlike, and closer to the horizon, until I lost it at about 20:05, some nine minutes after first noticing it.&quot;  The most likely explanation for this sighting is a high-altitude westbound aircraft reflecting the rays of the Sun and emitting a short contrail.

Has always been considered a creepy location /  make out area / and actually is very sceneic.  I was with a friend named ((name deleted)).  His father worked at UNCA as a debunker.

I suffer from an abnormal epileptic condition, and have noted when i see UFO i feel a tingling sensation that is in the epileptic family of sensation for me.  I told ((name deleted)) this and he said we were going to sit there till i admited this was none rational thinking.  This converation was nearing 9pm.  By about 9:15 was getting dark, cold, and starting to get hungry.  I still felt the sensation, but wanted to leave as was not dressed to be on a Mt after dark.  I was just about to admit to him was being irrational when i felt the sensation grow very intense. We were sitting on large rocks and over ((name deleted)) shoulder i could see what appeared to be a falling star falling from directly overhead, and should quickly vansih behind a Mt we were facing.  ((name deleted)) saw it and said...  that is just..... He paused as right before the object should have vanished it stopped above the tree line.  It was not very bright, and would say the Mt. across from us was maybe 2 to 3 miles away across the Beaver Dam area of N. Asheville. ((name deleted)) stared at the object and was speechless.  It slowly bloomed to be much brighter.  It was mainly intense white in color, but was so bright it appeared blue at the edges on the light.  The light appeared more in rays than round coming from it and seemed to pulse with energy.  I was now tingling all over with the electrical sensation. The object danced up above the tree lines and did shapes, then would drop below the mt area.  But near instantly would come back up in another area of the mt.  This went on for a period of about a min.  My friend was speaking random curses such as &quot;well ((deleted)) I cannot be seeing seeing this ((deleted)) thing&quot;  Even, My dad is going to dis-own me if i tell him this!  Suddenly the object pulled up above the MT.  and speed up and away from us in a burst of speed and simple went out of visible site. My friend ((name deleted)) looked at me and asked me if i was still feeling funny... and i answered him... even stronger now then before and started getting very frightened as right when i said this we heard sticks snap in every direction around us.  The car was about 75 feet up the hill from us and almost instantly hearing what sounded like hundreds of footsteps we made a mad dash for his Honda.  We did not take time to even open the doors... we were absolutely scared out of our wits.  ((name deleted)) dropped his keys trying to start the car.  Finally he was able to get it started and we drove down this very poorly made dirt road far faster than was safe.  After getting off the hill we came to an Ingle&apos;s grocery store that is about 3 miles away on the main road and went in simply to be near other people as we were so freaked out. We sooner after went back to my home where a large group of our friends were visiting that night.  We all told the story to everyone there and we both were stil scared out of our wits.

I have not talked to ((name deleted)) since in my mid 20&apos;s.... but am sure he would still collaborate the details of this story.

It was a very lonely drive back, as far as traffic was concerned.  About 10-15 minutes or so into our drive, we came across a VERY bright light.  At first we thought there was an accident and that it was a helicopter, but the light kept getting brighter and brighter.  My girlfriend was driving and I yelled at her to pull over because what ever it was we were going to hit it.  The light was so bright that we each had our hands in front of our face to be able to see the road.  I believe we were both kind of scared because we DID NOT hear any motors or any other noise.  My girlfriend kept saying it was a helicopter, and I told her if it was, the rotors would make noise.  When I looked over to my girlfriend, I noticed that I could see every shape of every bone in her hand, as if though the light was x-raying her hand - then I looked at mine and told her to look at our hands, because the light was almost shining right through them.  The light did not emit heat, nor sound, which was even scarier.  At that point we did not know what it was, and the light got closer, and closer to to us, it was directly in front of the car.

The more I think about it - the more I begin to think that this was no ordinary light.  Although I did NOT see any disk shaped metallic object, I DID however see a series of unexplainable lights moving around in a repetetive sequence - within the confines of a circular area.  The circular area where these lights were stayed the same, although the lights that were moving within this circular area moved in a repetitive sequence similar to a kaleidescope - only these were white lights - with NO beam as to show where they were coming from.  They seemed to just be in the same spot - made no noise - were the color of white spot ligts used to light up the sky for airplaines, but as I said before - there was NO BEAM to show them as coming from any where from the ground.  They were just in the sky.  I know that we had Northern Lights in the sky earlier that day (this was yesterday) but they would not be moving in such an arranged repetitive formation.  These lights looked as if there were 2 sets of 4 white lights - all equally spaced apart - 4 on the outside of a circle - and 4 on the inside - and 1 stationary light in the center that never moved.As 1 pair of 4 lights joined eachother at the center, the other set of 4 lights moved apart - eqal distance from eachother - away from the center.  Then they would switch off. Finally ALL 8 lights would shift in a clockwise 45 degree angle and the sequence would start all over again.  1 set of 4 lights moving toward the center as the other set moved away from the center - then the other set would come back to the center as the original set moved back towards the center - then all 8 white orbs about 3 feet in diameter would rotate again about 45 degrees in a clockwise direction.It just kept doing the same sequence for about 45 minutes.  In the same circular area.  It was about as high as 2-3 power lines if stacked one on top of another going straight up.  It was the diameter of about a large family home - and it was about 1 city block away from MY house !!  These lights made no noise.  There was no beam of light showing any origination point - as with sky lights used to guide airplanes or lights that might come from a light house.  Nothing like that.  Just up there on their own.  Repeating a type of kaleidescope sequence of repetitive movements - although the center light was the only one that never moved.The lights looked as if they were coming from the underbelly of some sort of circular shaped craft - although I NEVER saw any actual craft.  Just the lights.But it was very weird - I never saw anything like it before - and then it was gone.My husband and I came home for a moment and when we came back out again - this time they were gone, so we never saw how they disappeared or if they flew away or just disappeared... but they were out there in the same spot - doing the same thing for about 45 minutes.  It MAY have been a natural phenomenon - but why would a natural phenomenon have lights moving in such a repetetive sequence and stay in the exact same spot the entire time for almost an hour.  If it was some sort of a man made light show - then why was there no beam of light showing a source of origin? It was weird.  10 people saw it.  1 witness was a former marine - with lots of medals of honor.  Not a flakey person.  He was the first to admit that it might actually be a UFO, but that we could not see the craft if the craft was dark - camouflaged against the dark sky.  Only the lights below the craft would be visible.The more I think about it - as hard to admit as it is - it&apos;s a possible explanation.The only question with this is - why was the craft not moving for over 45 minutes? It was weird.

There is a good deal of road construction in this area so at first I thought they were just work lights.  Then a few mouments later I noticed them again, just after that the hill droped away and I got a full view of the craft. It was a large craft triangular shapped craft it appeard to be 250 to 300 feet on a side and about 30 feet thick. At each point of the bottom of the triangel there was a bank of I think 6 huge white lights ( they reminded of the type used to light up night sporting events ).  On one of the side of the bottom there was also a bank of 4 lights lit up between the lights at the corners.  It appeared as if there was room for 12 of these lights between each corner.  My best guess was the craft was headding south.  Also the whole craft was rotating as well as moving forward.  There was no sound being produced.

PD))My brother.At a family gathering in the early 1960s when my brother, who served in a special part of the armed forces, revealed that the military was fully aware of the existence of UFOS. My brother, now deceased, had worked in what he described as &quot;missile guidance systems&quot; He told us, as part of the schooling, he and about 30 others received special training in reading radar and being able to identify UFOs from other aircraft.  He said the military did not want an accidental nuclear exchange as a result of confusing UFOs with possible missile launchings from the People&rsquo;s Republic of China or the Soviet Union. He told also told us that during Cuban missile crisis he spent 2 weeks in a deep underground missile complex waiting for orders that might lead to world war 3.The army, he said, not only revealed UFO existence but also trained him and the others of his crew in how recognize their peculiar movements and characteristics on radar. The military, he told us revealed nothing more other then they were just here.My secretary.In 1978 I hired a 70-year-old woman named ((namd deleted)), as my secretary. I was director of an organization that planned and created activities for older Americans. ((name deleted)) told me when she was a young woman in her early 20s (around 1928) and living in the state of Wyoming, she used to get up early in the morning 2 or 3 times a week and play golf. She recounted one very early summer morning just after 4:30 am she walked about a quarter of a mile to the golf course. When she reached the top off a small hill overlooking the playing area, she said she was stunned to see a greenish glowing sphere-like object setting about 10 feet off the ground. She told me she was so shocked that had she could not move. She described it as being approximately 50 feet in diameter with oval shaped windows around the top third area.  She said she knew instinctively it was not from our world.  After nearly 10 minutes of just staring at this most unusual sight she said the object rose slowly from its position and began making a faint humming noise. Then quite suddenly it just streaked away and was gone with in a few seconds. She never told anyone about this for 25 years for fear people would think she was crazy. I believed this ((name deleted))&rsquo;s story because she always told me the truth. If she did not like how I was running the Agency she would tell me about it and not always pleasantly.  She was a no-nonsense person who believed neither in God, nor honest politicians.The airline pilot: For a few months in 1980 I worked at a car rental agency. One of my duties was to go to the Seattle International airport and pick up airline flight crew and bring them back for a car rental. Every time I picked up a pilot I would always find some way of asking them if they had ever seen a UFO. Every pilot but two replied no. I felt some were even irritated with the question but most were good sports and gave me their opinion (usually negative) on the subject. A few told me while they did not believe in them, other airline pilot friends did report seeing them on occasion.One evening I picked up an airline pilot captain whose name was Frank. When I asked Frank if he had ever seen anything strange like a UFO, he was very silent for a few minutes. I thought maybe he was insulted by the question. I was worried he would tell my boss. However, to my surprise he opened up and told a very interesting story.During the Carter administration, I was flying out of Washington DC with not only the regulars (passengers) but I had the Secretary of Transportation, and his staff on board.  We were about 20 miles out when three green globes or spheres appeared in front of my plane.  He said they appeared to be about 50 feet or better in diameter and were flying formation.  We not only had visual, but they were being tracked from ground radar.  He told me; because these objects were in front of the plane none of the passengers were aware of what was going on.I called the Secretary of transportation to my cockpit. I wanted a witness and I thought he would want to know. I thought this would be the biggest news story of the century. I asked him if they might have been experimental craft. He said flatly; &quot;No&quot; He said there were oval shaped windows or what appeared to be windows around the top third of the sphere. &quot;Not one of my flight crew nor did the secretary of transportation think they were other then what they appeared to be, some kind of space craft from another world.I found it remarkable that the type of craft described by both ((name deleted)) and the Airline pilot were identical even thought the two events took place more then 30 years apart.I wrote this report becuase I thought it was my public duty. If you care to print it or just keep it on record is fine either way with me. Thank you.((NUFORC Note:  We have attempted to communicate with the witness via e-mail, but his address is not valid.

As a kid and somewhat as an adult i have always been afraid of aliens and the dark.  I slept int he same bedroom as my older brother who was 5 years older than me and who always put up with my childish fears.  Well it was a warm night and we had the window to our room open to let some air in,  As we were going to bed, (there were two twin beds seprated by a couple feet facing the window) i looked out the window and saw a large orange circle with two blinking lights following it, i assume they were planes.  I asked my brother if it was a ufo and as a typical older brother he told me to shut up and go to bed.  Well about 10 min later my mom started screaming and told everyone to go to the living room and look out the big window which faced the same direction as my bedroom window.  As we all ran to the room to see why my mom was screaming (there were 4 boys and my dad and mom) we heard a humming noise over our house.  When we got to the room we all saw a disked shaped object with alternating red and white lights around it in the distance.  It seemed like and eternity that it just hovered there, as we watched we saw some planes getting closer and eventually it seemed as though it wavered a little bit and proceeded to shoot straight up at an enormous speed.  My family has had many sightings living in Putnam, mostly form the same time frame but many from when i must have 3 or 4 years old and my memories are a little vague and not as clear about those events although i do still have memories of them.

It appeared to be a hand glider &amp; drift as a hand glider but it&apos;s shape was like the formation of wild geese flying. Like a giant silver or dark grey colored boomerang. You had to really focus &amp; concentrate in order to really see it because it almost appeared to blend into the sky. It was big, and you could tell it was really high up. I then shouted and pointed it out to my family who consisted of my 17 year old sister and my 58 year old mother and we began to wonder what in the hell it was we had just seen. Keep in mind we live only a few miles from a very well known NYC airport so we can differentiate what is a small single engine airplane to a giant 747 because they fly right over our house. The object appeared to be at an altitude just guessing of say 9-10,000 feet up. There were no lights, no sound... just a steady drifting object moving southbound and then turning widely eastbound. With-in a few seconds the object dissapeared and we were all left stunned and amazed at the incident. We discussed what it might of been &amp; we just chuckled at the idea and all agreed it might of been some soft paper that just might be lower than what we thought and we couldnt tell because it was just to dark. So we continued to watch the lunar eclpse when again for a second time, I had seen the same object but this time moving from west to east and I was still facing north. A close friend of mine came walking by and I stated look!! look!!! There it is again!!! and he looked up and he too was also amazed to see this strange and weird object. He stated what the f*$@ is that. Now for the second time with-in 5 minutes we seen the same thing and now we had another witness to confirm what we saw. The object only appeared for no more tha! n 60 seconds and I started along with my family saying it was a UFO. After the object disaapeared we just all looked at one another and we looked up again. No more than 3 or 4 minutes later you could hear &amp; see a fighter jet or a some type of jet airplane with what I can recall blue and white lights flashing under the wing tips. It was moving at great speeds and at a higher altitude, also moving in the same west to east direction.", "hanging planesNote; not seen ufo directly, but curcomstances made it very possible, I was traveling by train when I came to a open field surrounding me, I was looking out of the window and I saw a plane &apos;&apos;hanging&apos;&apos; in the sky, not moving at all, firt I thougt that is was possible because of the breaking view, but after a couple of moments I realist that the plane didn&apos;t move at all, it was just hanging still overthere in the midle off the sky, after whe departed I saw another one also hanging, just like the one before.I kept looking at it and realist that this isn&apos;t normal with earth&apos;s psysics.So I pronounse that it has to been a move/ action of a &apos;&apos;ufo&apos;&apos;((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I looked straight up and saw 3 round lights moving in unison from the West to the East horizon.  The circles of grey light were located at each end of the triangle shape, and I estimate this triangle was about 100 feet across.  I looked away from the lights several times to make sure I was really seeing what I saw.  I was able to locate this moving object over and over again.  It took about 30 seconds for this object to move to the Eastern horizon.  This was no illusion!  I went to bed and dreamed of UFO&apos;s darting in and out of the clouds and across the sky.  These UFO&apos;s in my dream were both triangle shaped and rod shaped.((FOLLOW-UP MESSAGE/09MR04))Dear Peter,Thanks for all you do.  I check your site daily for updates and it&apos;s fascinating reading.I witnessed a ufo November 2, 2003, and reported it to you and it is posted in the database.  Since my sighting I have slowly come to realize that this ufo departed/exited in a very distinctive manner.  At around 9pm I saw three circles of gray light that were much higher than the typical commercial air traffic around Charlotte, NC.  They were in a triangle formation moving west to east.  I strongly believe they were separate from each other as I remember seeing the stars between/behind them as they progressed across the sky.  They were much larger than any star or commercial airline lighting.  Using the thumb measure, each circle was size of a pencil eraser.When the three circles approached the eastern most horizon the first circle appeared to curl up like it was going through an evelope slot or like it was curling upward around a cylinder or wringer of some sort.  I remember watching it curling and then all three lights went out or disappeared.  I wonder if this could be some sort of portal these crafts use to leave earthly dimension.  Forgive me if this account is of no use but I wanted to report it just in case you feel it truly is distinctive.  I also attached a rudimentary picture of the ufo that I drew on my Dell.Sincerely,  ((name deleted))((END))((NUFORC Note:  Graphic image shows three white circles in the sky, oriented in a triangular fashion.

We were collecting wood for our campfire when we noticed a very bright steady orange light moving from the zenith toward Jay&apos;s Peak, which was east of our location.  It made no sound and did not deviate from its course.  We followed the object until it became obscure on the horizon, when we noticed another, identical orange UFO on the same path and at the same speed as the first. It, too, eventually vanished on the eastern horizon after being observed for approximately one minute.  The next day, I reported this sighting to the Enosburg Falls, Vermont police department.  The other children claimed that the objects emitted many different colors, which I duly reported, but the only color I personally remember was a steady, unwavering orange.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I cam out to see 2 bright red (welding torch) type lights coming almost overhead from the east in a horizontal configuration and then when it stood over Orwigsburg for 15 minutes it changed to a vertical configuration. They were about 1 mile from me. I banged on the neighbors house and told her to get out and see the UFO&apos;s positioned over her house. Other neighbors (about 7 people came out) and watched in amazement as these 2 objects hovered in the sky. The sky was clear with a beautiful blue lit horizon in the backround. I went and got my Digital Hi-8 camcorder and put it on a tripod and got about 4 minutes of it hovering over the town. The bottom disk would &quot;blink out&quot; and then reappear. I used the 450X zoom to get right on top of it and that really shows something amazing. I am a trained observer as an amateur astronomer and an independent video producer. This object didn&apos;t make a sound (no wind was blowing and you could hear a pin drop on the sound recording)! No navigational blinking lights typical of our own aerodynamic designs. I converted the tape footage to DVD and did single frame/slow motion viewing and I can tell you that this is nothing we made. There is an electrostatic discharge around the craft often see on UFO&apos;s in reference to the propulsion system reacting with the earths atmosphere causing a corona discharge or the craft to glow--this is typical of what the military refers to &quot;recified beam-field propulsion&quot;. It&apos;s all on the video to see. What really disturbs me is the fact that I called the local TV station (WNEP) and Bob Reynolds called me back twice and said he was interested and said he would send someone down to pick up the HI-8 video tape and take it back to the studio on the 11th. They never called back.  I called the 2 local newspapers (Pottsville Republican) and the lady I talked to laughed hysterically at me. The people at the Call newspaper also didn&apos;t care much either. These people better wake up and take seriously what is going on her!! These craft are not from around here and I&apos;m quite certain they are not from our solar system. Where are they from.

It came from the northwest and was going to the southeast in a perfectly straight line.  It flew over our heads about 1,000 feet up.  It looked like a big ball of fire.  It was the same exact color as fire.  There was no sound and no shadows. At first I thought it was a hot air baloon, but it was going to fast and we couldn&apos;t see anything other than the fireball.  My fiance thought it was a meteor or asteroid, but there was no contrail and it was not falling.  When it got behind our trees, my fiance and I got up and walked back to the tree line.  We could still see it in the distance.  It had now changed directions and was going south.  I ran inside and grabbed the camcorder.  After a few minutes, I came back inside and got the tripod.  By now, we were not sure how far away it was.  We just left the camcorder alone and sat by the fire talking about how weird this was.  When we watched what we had recorded, it flickered a little - brighter and dimmer.  Then it would fade away to nothing.  It would reapper in about a minute.  Then do the same thing over agin.  Until it finally just disappeared.  I called our local police department, the county police and two neighboring police departments, but they had no reports about anything in the sky.

On October 26, 2003 while traveling along highway 97 just south of Stoner, B.C., heading north the couple saw what they first thought was a very large aircraft. The fellow told me it looked like an aircraft that would have been coming in for a landing at an airport with the landing lights on. The light they witnessed was extremely bright and again large in size. The object was to their right and a head of them at this point. Also the object was traveling over top of the trees. They soon figured out that what they were observing was not a normal aircraft at all due to it&apos;s size, brightness and how low it was flying. The witness told me they were traveling at approx: 100 kilometers an hour and they were catching up to this thing. He also mentioned, it was unlikely at the speed he was traveling that they would have slowly crept up closer to it if it had of been a plane. Still thinking the fellow wondered, could it possibly be a helicopter as it did seem to hover for a spit second or two then started moving once again. Being so low, they did lose sight of it briefly due to the trees blocking their view. Once the witnesses got to a crest of the hill and seeing there was a clearing they spotted the object again. At this point it was just underneath the cloud cover. The witnesses estimated the cloud ceiling to be at approx: 8,000 feet or close. The object, still traveling slowly, flying just below the clouds and basically straight across from them when the light just disappeared, then reappeared shortly there after and then finally vanished. The witness mentioned that the highway had a lot of traffic on it and many others driving would have noticed the object. It was hard not to see it due to the intensity of the light.

It was traveling end forward and perpendicular to our direction of travel - Southbound, from left to right us at a moderate rate of speed.  It was about 3 miles away, perhaps further.  On the front of the cylinder, above was a small, irregularly fluttering green light, on the front underside a small red irregularly fluttering light. ((female)), who was driving, exclaimed &quot;Weird!.&quot;  ((male)) was having some difficulty locating it.  It was already obvious to me that it wasn&rsquo;t anything conventional.  As we continued Southbound the object arrived at a point between us and the Oakland Federal buildings. At this time we began to make out details including four equally spaced vertical separations and a horizontal deck. Towards the leading end we could barely make out shapes. I am left with a distinct memory of this craft and crew framed against the background of the newly completed Oakland Federal Buildings.  The craft must have passed with in 100yds of them as it continued to approach.  Suddenly, in a moment, faster than I could blink, the object leaped from the location near the Federal buildings and stopped about 60ft from our windshield. It covered perhaps two miles in a manner that should have killed anything living that might be inside. At this point the I-80/880 freeway rises off the ground to about 75 feet, passes under the Highway 24 overpass and continues for at least a mile as a raised freeway.  So our vantage point regarding what followed was from 40 to 75feet above the ground. The entire side of the craft that was facing us was transparent.  It was as if one half of the tube became transparent and the side facing away from us was opaque.  It was emitting a very yellow light from its interior.  Inside, it had a deck evenly dividing it in half, lengthwise.  There seemed to be 5 evenly spaced vertical ribs against the opposite wall from the one we were looking through. The entire interior of the craft appeared to be visible.  It seemed to be completely hollow, with no &lsquo;engine compartment&rsquo;, or any other furnishings. It had similar dimensions to a cardboard toilet paper tube.  A width to length ratio of about 1 to 5. I became aware of three shapes that were visible at the front end of it.  The first was somewhat obscured by the large, white external light directly underneath.  The other two were evenly spaced from the first.  At this point I had a rush of adrenaline and my vision seemed to go telescopic. It was like this bizarre scene I was witnessing suddenly filled my entire field of vision.  ((female)), who was driving, said &quot;Are those ?&quot;  I blurted out &quot;No!,&quot; before she could say what we both already knew- aliens.  This is a scene I am not likely to ever forget.  There was no mistake.  These were not human beings. At the front end of it, with their hands resting on a thin bar or table were three people.  They seemed so similar that they looked like paper dolls.  ((female)) and I could both could see them clearly. They were standing, you could see their legs below the bar or table, facing us.  They were backlit by the yellow light and it was reflecting off the flat sides of their heads. They were staring right at us.  The sensation was one of very focused attention..  The heads were oversized, their foreheads were about a third larger than that of a human being.  The eyes were very large and dark and they have an occipital ridge, eyebrow, oriented like ours..  They seem to have narrow shoulders and hips and they have longer upper arm and upper leg bones than human beings.   This gives them a sort of stretched appearance.  They seemed to be about the same size as human beings, though I didn&rsquo;t have reliable scale of comparison. The face is small, under the eyes but because of the backlighting I couldn&rsquo;t see other details.  It was one-step above a silhouette.  Even so they were clearly not human beings.  I would like to try to describe the sensations running through us at this point.  ((female)) was doing her best to maintain control of the car while being emotionally overwhelmed.  Ian was counting down through the list of things the object was not.  I felt like Bugs Bunny looks when he loses morale and his ears droop down over his shoulders.  I slid down in the seat and made a conscious effort to stifle the fear that came with realizing that &lsquo;it&rsquo;  was happening again.  The fear was along the lines of &quot;I&rsquo;ve studied hard to understand this, and based on what I feel about what I&rsquo;ve already seen and what I have learned, I really wanna be somewhere else, anywhere else but here.&quot;  I didn&rsquo;t sense danger as much as I felt extreme self consciousness.  The reality of the fantastic was scary.  I have prepared myself for this type of thing, both as a martial artist and a UFO experiencer so the fear phase was very short-lived.  I moved through it quickly and started observations. I turned to ((female)) and asked her what time it was.   She said &quot;7:34.&quot; Then I rolled down my window and started really watching.  She took confidence from my focus on observations and started watching closely herself.  We went below an overpass, the Highway 24/ I-880 overpass, and the craft intercepted us on the other side. It was less than its own length from our windshield.  In other words, it was flying sideways from its original end-on orientation about 75 to 100 feet in front of our car.  It was about 50 feet in the air. At this point it had turned off its internal or deck lights.  Now only the two large white lights located at each end of the craft and the small red and green lights were visible.  Its interior was no longer visible. It was very difficult to see the structure behind the lights.  It hovered for a long minute directly in front of the windshield before it slowly passed in front of us, as we did 65mph, maintaining the same distance from our car as it did so. ((male)), who was in the back and was just beginning to clearly view the craft hovering in front of our car began asking questions. &quot;Rotors? A Chinook?&quot;  I rolled down the window. &quot;No, no noise, too big, way too big.&hellip;&quot;  The light from the two fixtures on each end of the craft was shining through the window and casting the shadows of bugs from the windshield onto my hands.  It lit up the inside of the car. As I turned my attention from myself to the craft, I felt very &apos;altered.&apos;  My feeling about this is that it was a result of the adrenaline rush that had been occurring since this thing started.  My sense of time went away.  The experience took on a &lsquo;slow motion&rsquo; quality.  As the light poured through the window onto my hands I was aware of a long, still, silent moment.  This sensation lasted until the craft began moving away. Nobody spoke as the craft began a second maneuver.  I could hear everything around me.  I was hyperaware.  The fact the craft was soundless and was displaying other unusual qualities at such a close range contributed to the &lsquo;weirdness&rsquo; of the moment.  It left such a strong impression that even a year later it is on our minds daily. With the window down and the object less than its own length from our car we could detect no sound.  It was absolutely silent. There was no thruster ports or jet blast, no sense of  anything at all holding it up.  It seemed to move through the air like a fish through water.  Silently.  No hum, no vibration, no sound at all.  It seemed to be very much under control and capable of very articulate maneuvers.  All we could hear was the sound of tires on the road.  Several of the cars around us slowed, we could hear the changes in tone of tires and motors.  I assume they also saw the craft. I distinctly had the internal mental impression of &quot;Stop the car,&quot; but this is the last place in the entire state of CA that you would want to try and stop. ((male)) and ((female)) said they had the same sensation.The light fixtures themselves must have been huge, I have yet to see any night time lamp in the entire Bay Area that big.  The light itself was white to off-white in color.  Maybe similar to sodium street lights with fixtures the size of Volkswagens.   At the same time it wasn&rsquo;t so bright you couldn&rsquo;t look at it.  It had a very busy quality.  Almost static. At one point I could estimate the craft spanned 8 lanes of freeway.  It was about five times as long as it was wide, I&rsquo;d guess 30 to 50ft wide and perhaps 140 to 200 feet long.  It easily spanned eight lanes of freeway. Even more bizarre was that at this point it was within a hundred yards of the Oakland Police station, no small building itself.  It held its position directly in front of us as we did 65mph.  It was now flying sideways or broadside to its original orientation about 75 to 100 feet from our windshield. The craft then passed to my right, continuing to fly next to us in our direction of travel.  The &lsquo;back&rsquo; end swung away from us was now it was parallel to us, keeping its same close range on our right passenger side windows.  It was now flying backwards with respect to its original orientation.  I studied it carefully through my open window.  I was alert, more so than in previous experiences. It slowed over the Jack London Square area as we passed by it.  I looked up through the open window and watched the &lsquo;front&rsquo; end of this thing, its red and green lights fluttering on and off without rhythm, swing over our car. Then it passed behind us, crossing back over the freeway and returning toward the East.  As we drove away from it we could make out the very rectangular silhouette of a cylinder viewed side on.   Susan began making comparisons between the length of the craft and the width of the buildings it was passing over. The last we saw of it was a pair of lights above the radio repeaters in the Oakland hills, boosting at about a 45degree angle upward into the overcast.. I turned back to Ian and said, &quot;That was ((deleted)) bizarre.&quot;  Right in the middle of downtown Oakland in front of God and everybody. I immediately began noting all conditions.  Time, location, etc..  I distinctly heard cars around us slowing.  Should have started noting license plates. There was a police helicopter hovering over Fruitvale avenue, in San Leandro with its spotlight on.  It was perhaps four miles South of the craft as it headed upward and Eastward. During its approach, the craft passed directly in front of several apartment complexes and office buildings as it approached.  It passed by  the Oakland Police station at less than 50 yards.  When it left it was visible to more apartment complexes on the South side of the Oakland skyline.  Another detail concerns the appearance of the object once it had shutoff its internal lights.  While it hovered in front of our car I noticed another unusual quality. There was overcast to 4500 feet, the ambient light of the city of Oakland was reflecting off of the clouds.  I feel there should have been a visible silhouette of the object.  There was not.  Though it was obvious that the external lights of the craft were attached to the airframe, the object itself was not visible behind the lights.  This bothered me, because it seemed unnatural.  There was obviously something between the clouds and me.  I was looking right at it, but I couldn&rsquo;t see it.  It is a very odd quality. When it passed to my right, the island of Alameda was behind it.  Directly across from Jack London square is about 1/3 of a mile of open water, then a marina, then a business park.  There is very little light rising up from a very large area.  Against this background, the object itself was visible. When it began its turn to pass behind us, the underside of the object was clearly visible.  It was only 30 to 40 feet over my head as I looked up through the open car window.  The bottom was smooth, seamless with visible lateral striations that made it look similar to an aluminum thermos bottle.   It was lit up by its own external lighting.  When I looked back at it as it crossed over the high-rises and it returned to the East, I could clearly see the out line of a cylinder over its own lights. The flight path of this craft was amazing.  The side of the craft the people were looking out of remained facing us through the whole maneuver.  The changes in direction and orientation appeared seamless.  There was a sense of acceleration as it first approached and when it left us.  There was no sense of &lsquo;correcting&rsquo; maneuvers to maintain exact distances while changing direction and attitude.  It approached to intersect directly in our path, then it was hovering in front of us at an even distance flying broadside to its original orientation.  At no time did it wobble nor did it veer either closer or further away.  It didn&rsquo;t overshoot as it took its position in front of us.  It moved with exact precision. The actual interception and turn might be considered a ground reference maneuver whereby a pilot picks a point of reference on the ground and flies as exact a course around it as possible.  As weird as it sounds, our car seemed to be that point. The entire experience lasted from about 7:30 to 7:37 plus or minus.  It took about 6 minutes. The interception and turning maneuver itself lasted less than two minutes with the remainder taken in the approach and exit.  The object was visible longer during its exit.  We saw it travel laterally then directly approach us. We watched its entire exit, until it lifted into the overcast. It is my opinion that I have seen this craft, or this class of craft on three occasions.", "It looked like it was hovering, around us the green light was getting brigter for about 1 minute and then left faster than light.It was a bright oval object flying around as high as the stars my friends and I followed it till it took off faster than i&apos;ve ever seen in my life.The color was like a dark green    color.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate, even though the event apparently had occurred just five days earlier.  PD))", "On Nov.5th,2003 at 12:20 P.M. our 12-year old son was home early from having only one half a day of school, I was home early from work and my wife was home as well. We live in Burlington, VT near the Winooski river. I was inside the house when my son who was outside yelled loudly &quot;Dad come outside&quot;. I ran out onto the deck to see my son pointing up in the sky &quot;what is it?&quot; My wife who was in our yard with our dog was looking up in the sky too said &quot;It&apos;s a UFO&quot;. First I thought they were joking until I Looked up and to my amazement saw a flying silver metallic disk navigating in and out of the clouds, it was turning upside down then right side up. I said &quot;that&apos;s a flying saucer&quot;. We had a visual on it for no longer than 1 minute at which time it disappeared in the clouds headed east over Colchester. Too bad I didn&apos;t have enough time to get my camcorder. I wasn&apos;t at all scared but my heart was beating fast from the experience. I called the airport air-traffic control and reported it to them.", "It was a beautiful summer day and me and my close friend were walking my girlfriend home from school we were about 15 years old at the time, we got there and hung around her house and talked about what we would do this summer, her parents were not home from work yet,then we decided to go outside and smoke a cigarette,and we layed out on her lawn and i distinctley remember what a beautiful clear day it was.She lived in an older type house and all of the streets had big oak trees next to the sidewalk, well I told my girlfriend that we had to get going home so we all stood up and were making small talk next to one of the big oak trees facing her house and i remember looking up and this big glowing light was just pulsating at what seemed to be about tree top level we all asked each other do you see what i see and as we were looking at this thing glowing or pulsating it just wisked up in to the clear blue sky and disappeared.((NUFORC Note:  The date is approximate.  We presume that the year of the sighting was 1974, and we have amended the date above, even though that is a guess.  PD))", "I saw a battleship size ufo that was outlined with lights but was transparent at the same time.around 11pm. my brother and I went out to feed our horses. we had gotten home really late. It was a clear sky with a full moon. You could see in the dark because the moon shined so bright. We were at the back of the barn when we heard a low pulsating engine sound . We felt a light vibration through the air. We noticed that the horses in the pasture were acting really nervous and would not calm down. So we started to look up in the sky to see what was making the sound. Off to our left (East) this HUGE slow moving ship was traveling Southward. This ship had to be at least a half mile long minimum. The only way to describe it : It looked as though it was some type of battleship or city. The outlines were in various colored lights but of colors not even imagineable. Even though you could see the outline of ship you could still see the stars on the other side of it .(Transparent) Even though it was slow the lights seemed to stream as if it was going really fast.It never stopped but continued at a slow rate. There&apos;s nothing that I am aware of that is that BIG and can travel that slow. After watching it for about 5-8 mins at least, we could still see this thing down by the Wapak area which is 20-25 miles from us. After it was around that area it went immediately straight up and was gone. It was the most beautiful thing I have ever witnessed and wish it will happen again sometime. Also about a year later we saw a huge bright red orb around the same location where the previous ship left. Noone ever believes me when I tell them, but we both saw it and we just stood in awe of it.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "It appeared to be a very bright and large shooting star falling downwards with a trailI have never seen anything like this, nor have I ever even considered UFO&apos;s.Monday night as I was leaving Wal-Mart near I-295 in Jacksonville, Florida, I saw a bright flash trailing downward like a shooting star.  I was on my cell phone when it happened and remarked on it to my friend.  When I got home I told my husband about it.  I told him to check the news to see if an airplane went down because it happened right near where Jacksonville International Airport is.  I was about 5 miles south of the airport.  But this was NO plane.  I didn&apos;t think anything else about it until I read on Compuserve news about the sighting in Durham.  I remember looking at my watch when I was walking out of Wal-mart and it was 8:35...so, I figure it was around 8:37-8:39 pm when I saw it.  Again, I do not take these kind of things seriously, but was shocked when I read the Durham account.", "We see these lights very often at night looking towards the bay just to the right and above the Baltimore area. These whitish orange lights hover side to side fairly low to the ground and ocasionally will get really bright and larger in size for small periods of time then they go back to their reg. size and whitish orange color. They hover for such long periods of time at first glance they look like a light off a tower or a star but after longer observation you find that they kind of hover side to side. We thought they might be helicopters, just when you think that they move in a way or get really big and bright. I have no idea what we are seeing but we see them on a reg. basis at least once a week. Helicopters are the only thing that I can come up with but they look really weird.", "Ufo over filled stadiumI was a teenager attending pool party on Saturday night, the last of that year. The pool was Melwood located in a valley perpindicular -to the south - of the Allegheny River at New kensington. At that valley&apos;s head - close to the river - was New Kensington&apos;s foot ball stadium where a contest between high school bands was being held. Close to the swimming pool where I was was a well lit pitch and putt golf course. The flying object appeared over the stadium and came up the valley to where I was. I saw a cylinder of dull grey metal about 150 feet long hovering above the golf course lights. This appearance was well documented in the Vallet Daily Newspaper the following day on the front page. No investigation was ever done to my knowledge.((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  We will invite the witness to forward a copy of the UFO report to our Center.  PD))", "a triangle formation of craftsmy young daughter kept yelling -see mama, plane- as we heard a plane and saw it off in the distance, i scanned the clear blue sky and noticed in another direction VERY FAR off 6-7 craft in a perfectly straight angle line and then starting at 1 or 2 craft down the line was another line of 4-5 craft in a perfectly straight line.  i had never noticed such an odd formation of craft(i am always looking up to the sky)i watched for about a minute, as they did not appear to move, then walked quickly to my front door only 5 feet or so away to grab my digital camera which was inside right by the door, it only took 10 seconds or so and as soon as i came out with my camera they were nowhere to be seen.", "8 to 12 Very bright round objects seen over Nashua, NHFrom Southern Nashua looking towards Tyngsborough, MA about 8 to 10 circular objects were traveling at a relatively normal speed.  The craft illuminated very brightly almost as if it were a reflection.  They did not seem to be burning up in the atmosphere like a re-entry, as they were travelling too slow. There were numerous colors of the reflection/blinking, like green, red and white and each object had a glow to it and you could see each one moving when they were not blinking/shining.  There was no apparent pattern to the shining, but was definately not the blinking of normal single engine plane or jet running lights or headlights.  The objects travelled from a westerly to easterly direction and seemed to vanish behind clouds and did not reappear when the clouds had passed.  There was a small engine plane directly overhead at the same time and was probably landing at Nashua airport around 8:50pm EST.  I could not find the number for the FAA tracking station or the airport tower both located in Nashua to see if they had seen what we did on radar.  The whole thing lasted about one minute, as my wife and I had time to call my In-laws outside to view the last 15-30 seconds when the objects disappeared behind the clouds.", "close encounter of the second kind, 15 feet from disk shaped craft.My mother and I were travaling back home from a day of christmas shoping in Roanoke via route 24. We were talking about the birth of jesus and the star of david and had just past the blue ridge  parkway bridge that goes over top of route 24. We where talking about the star of david when I looked up into the sky and said. &quot;did the star of david look likr that mommy?&quot; Directly ahead of us in the sky was what appeared to be the brightest star I had ever seen. It seemed to take my mother by suprise as well because of her reaction. By this time we had gone up the first hill on the way to Stewerstville, and where passing Wonder Drug on our right hand side of the road. By this time we where discussing how bright the object in the shy was, and how it appered to be gitting lower in the shy. We went up the second hill on the way two stewertsville and took a left at the Hopin store (now its a getty mart I think). By this time about twenty minutes have past from the time we first noticed the bright star. we past sterwertsville elementary on the right kept our attention on the star. By this time my mother is getting a little excited I think bucase I remmeber her saying someting about how it was fallowing us. As far as I could tell it was going along the same path as we were. We lived in the shady Grove area, and the road goes down a step hill and through a couple of s&apos; turns. My mother is starting to panic because the star is right behind us. We dirve through the curves and come too a small pond and work shop on the right side of the road. ( the pond is dryed up today but the work shop is still there). We pull off the road in front of the pond which is on the right side of the car, we rolled down the windows. By this time about 35 minutes have passed. The bright star was about 100 yards from the far side of the pond. Then the Bright lites just turned off! There was a disk (two plates face too face) object about 15 to 20 feet off the water of the pond. The moon was full that night and the reflection of the disk could be seen slowly, the disk came across the pond. The water didn&apos;t move there where no ripples of any kind. The only sound that the craft made was the sound of what sounds like an amplifer makes when it is turned up to full blast but no music is playing. My mother and I just sat ther not making a sound, watching this disk shaped craft. The craft made its way right over the car. We could not have been much more than 15 feet from it. I can say how far we where from it because it was inches away from the power lines, and power lines are maybe twenty feet from the ground. I don&apos;t know how long we sat there but we didn&apos;t get home until almost 10:00 o&apos;clock that night. My father was kind of pissed we got home so late. My mother can&apos;t remember just how long we where there either, but I am sure it was at least 1 hour and 30 minutes. there are few things I can remember fully from my child hood but this I can remember like it was yesterday the smell of the air and the sound that that craft made have been implanted in my mind. It changed my mothers live as well. She quite going to church and hasn&apos;t ever gone back. I would love to know how the technology that alowed that ship to fly!!", "Gigantic mass of light lit up the bay then followed me and split into two shooting lights over my headI lived on the water and was sitting on the beach late one summer night with a friend. At some point, we became aware of a gigantic light (with no sound, only silence and the waves) filling our little bay, as if an incredibly huge spotlight (or gigantic ball of light) was shining on it -  I say &quot;became aware&quot; because oddly enough, our awareness of this light - something so extraordinary as to warrant a seriously excited response I should think - elicited in us at first no response or comment, as if we saw this kind of thing everyday, and it was almost in passing that I finally asked my friend if she noticed this huge light shining in front of us. She said she did and we simply continued to sit there and stare at it. This huge light should have lit up the pier and the rocks on either side of it, but really didn&apos;t - it just lit up the water as if the light were somehow localized or focused on the water. I think I recall mentioning this odd &quot;light behavior&quot; to my friend while sitting on the beach and incredibly enough, I think she may have said something like, &quot;It must be the sun&quot; - which was a ridiculous thing to say when it&apos;s nighttime, and this out-of-character (in that it was absurd) comment from a girl who was an impressive student, high achiever and is now a doctor. I don&apos;t know if the light was there when we walked onto the beach and sat down (I don&apos;t remember doing that either), and have no memory of seeing the light emerge from the darkness - it was simply &quot;there&quot; by the time we &quot;noticed&quot; it and I thought to ask my friend if she too was seeing it. So after a time - it may have been 5 minutes or an hour or 3 hours (I just don&apos;t have any idea of the time), I said that it was odd that no one else was out on the beach looking at this (it was impossible not to see it if you were awake - it was that huge and the houses on the beach were right next to each other, with 10 houses directly facing the bay and the light). I decided to get up and go wake up my brother to show him, as the light was constant and didn&apos;t seem to be going anywhere, and it seemed to have been there a long time. So I walked up the beach, walked up the beach stairs to the top of our seawall and just as I reached the top, the light rose up, traveled to directly over my head, stayed there for a beat and then split into two smaller lights which then shot off in opposite directions. And that was that. It was gone. I walked back to the beach and my friend still sitting there and attempted to talk with her about it and she turned to me and said &quot;I don&apos;t ever want to talk about this again.&quot; And she walked home down the beach. And we never mentioned it again. In fact, I never told anyone until about 10 years later. Not because I was worried about what anyone would think, but because it didn&apos;t (oddly enough again) seem &quot;newsworthy&quot; or &quot;interesting,&quot; which, of course, it absolutely was. The following morning, no one else in our neighborhood mentioned it, either. Perhaps they didn&apos;t see it, or like me, didn&apos;t find it &quot;newsworthy.&quot; Another odd thing is that my friend and I were only 14. Neither of us was allowed out on the beach (or anywhere) alone at midnight (my best guess as to time, as no one was awake in the neighborhood), and my friend&apos;s parents were especially strict. Her summer curfew was about 9 pm back then. I find it odd that we were even out there at that time, that neither of us were &quot;missed&quot; while we were out, that no one came looking for us, that neither of us got caught or got in trouble for being out of the house so late at night, and that no one else in our crowded little area saw this. From the light, to our reaction, to even our presence there on the beach, the whole thing could not be stranger. About 10 years later, I was riding in the car with my fiancee, and was reading a book about UFO sightings. A description of a sighting in the book was almost identical to the experience I&apos;d had and I read it to him and told him that I had witnessed something similar. We had been together for 7 years at that point and when he asked me why I&apos;d never mentioned it before, I was truly puzzled and wondered myself why I hadn&apos;t mentioned it to him or anyone before that. In fact, I&apos;ve considered filling out your form many times before and haven&apos;t, because I didn&apos;t think it was really of interest, but now that I have finally written it down, it does seem quite a strange and maybe even amazing event.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "Saucer craft altitude 50+ feet going at 10+mph passed over apartment buildingI was sitting on my back portch on the second floor of a two story apartment building. I was contemplating life before I went to bed. I heard a noise that sounded like a plain at cruising altitude high in the sky. I turned my head up to the right and saw a light then I looked back down as my first impression was plain in the sky no big deal. After a second or two once my mind re-analyzed the image my head spun around and looked back with my mind already racing. Low and behold there was a saucer shaped craft that was about 30 to 50 feet in diameter and maybe 20 feet high hovering along at about 10 to 15 miles per hour. The altitude was very low maybe 50 to 100 feet. I remember looking at the tree in the yard and thinking it was about double the hight of the tree. The tree was a little higher than the building was a typical two storry aprtment building with a low slopping roof. I think it was about 30 feet hight or so. I just started at it very closely trying to make out the details on the body of it. I remember creases in the exterior where doors could have been. It had lights on top which I think where blue and/or red and it had three white lights on the bottom which formed a triangle. The lights on the bottom where pretty big but I don&apos;t remember them being very bright but I could be wrong about this. I was trying to concentrate on the details of the exterior which I could see because I was so close. It entered to the right of my balcony and flew across the back yard of the building and crossed over the top to my left. The building is in an L shape at about 45 degrees. So it passed over the back of the building which is the acute angle side of the building. As soon as it passed from view I ran inside and grabbed my video camera which was sitting on the cough (very cool) I ran outside and downstair out the front of the building and into the parking lot. By this time it was about 200 feet away heading away from me at the same speed, 10 to 15 mph I would estimate maybe slower. I was scrambling to get the video camera on the right setting and powered on and zoomed into the object and at the same time trying to see the object with my other eye so I didn&apos;t miss anything. Well by the time I got the video camera working it was to far away. It looked like a street light from a few hundred feet away. I had a really good zoom so I was zooming in way to far. Well you get the idea I didn&apos;t manager to get it on tape. The object made a low rumbling noise which was pretty quiet. Like I said it sounded like a jet at very high altitude at first. I did not see any exterial signs of propulsion. There was no smoke or trail of any kind and I did not smell anything either. I definitely had some type of vertical thrust acting on it because it was going so slow and it was saucer shaped. Right after the incident I went inside and spent the next 4 hours researching on the internet. I found pictures of UFO&apos;s on the internet that looked very similar to what I saw. I reported this incident that night to http://www.aliens111.com. I got an email back from them a few day later asking to put my report on their web site. I told them that was fine just leave my name off. I just emailed them again to see if they could dig up my report because it could contain details that I have forgotten or maybe identify some inconsitancies with this report I am filing now, which is my current memory of events. Thanks for listening and keep up the great work. I became aware of your web site from Jeff Rense. I was listening to his radio and heard you call for more reports so I figured I would take the time to send you mine...:-)((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witness might have observed a blimp, but that is only a guess.

Around 7:25 PM as we were aproaching Oxford on route 73 I saw a very bright light to the right of a radio tower to our north. I thought to myself &quot;I bet someone might think that light to be a UFO, but I bet it&apos;s some plane&apos;s landing lights.&quot; It remained fairly stationary, which I thought odd. About 5 minutes later the lights faded and the seperation of the object and the radio tower (about 5 miles away) got smaller and the lights got much dimmer. The object was so far away that all I could see was the brightness of the light - I looked for blinking wing lights, but the bright light overpowered them (if it was an airplane). This occured about 1/2 of the way between Collinsville and Oxford. I didn&apos;t have any binocculars with me to get a decent view of the object. At home when I have seen landing lights as bright as the light I saw on 10/15, I can easily see two landing lights close together without binoculars. I am reporting this because I saw there was a report of a UFO in Trenton, Ohio 2 days before and on another site a UFO was seen in nearby Middletown, Ohio on 10/15. (If you have a copy of DeLorme&apos;s Ohio Atlas &amp; Gazetteer, this took place near the bottom of page 64 along highway 73 just outside of Collinsville heading west towards Oxford, Ohio, before and after highway 177 crosses highway 73. The radio tower is about 5 miles north - near the intersection of Camden-Darrtown Rd. and Camden-College Corner Rd.)", "Flickering orange light (on fire?) moving across the sky; possible debris streamThe time listed is a guess--it was about 15 minutes or so after Game 1 of the World Series had ended, and I was walking to my house with a friend. I was walking west and looking at nothing in particular in the sky when I saw a very small object--it was West-Southwest from me, by my guess--basically just a spot of orangish light in the sky. At first I thought it might be Mars, still visible to the naked eye (I had been following all the Mars news during September and making a point to look for it when outside at night), but then I realized the object seemed to be moving, and the light (roughly the color of fire) was flickering. I pointed it out to my friend, and we started watching it. As we watched over the course of several minutes, the object definitely moved in what appeared to be a southeastern direction, with its light flickering brighter and darker (not radically so, but we could see the difference). After a minute or two of watching, something smaller seemed to fall off the object, casting its own identical light. It appeared to fall straight down, and its light extinguished after just a few seconds. The primary object continued moving southeasterly, and after another minute or two, its light slowly faded to nothing, taking about a minute to do so. By the time it disappeared, it was located South-Southwest from our POV.", "As a boy some 60 plus years ago I saw a round silver disc in the sky when I looked up from playing with ant hills.Im  mow age 67 but I can recall the sighting as if it were yesterday for some reason. And that I think is the most amazing thing. I was a little boy about age 5 &amp; playing with ant hills in the dirt road (it was dead-end here) when I looked to the West &amp; saw coming toward me a round silver like disk about 500 to 1000 feet above Hamlin Lake.

It was roughly 2AM and I was on patrol when I noticed a light in the sky which I thought was a falling star. As I stood there watching the object it turned in 3 objects moving in odd patterns at speeds that were not possible at that period of time. I stood there and watched in amazement as the the objects seperated and moved to different locations in the sky. the objects then formed what appeared to be a formation pattern then seperated again and flew unconventional patterns for approximately 2 minutes similar to someone moving a flash light around a dark room at simi rapid formations. Then as they just dissapeared in formation.

Every few seconds the color would change to red for a while. By now i had my camcorder and was filming away. By now, everyone else was watching too. All of a sudden, the sky around the lights turned bright red. This part lasted for about 5 minutes, then it was over. i have the whole thing on tape.((NUFORC Note:  NUFORC received a telephoned report of a similar report of a cluster of lights near Carrollton, GA, seen at approximately 2100 hrs.

The two closest to the horizon were red in color and unmoving.  Above and to the right of the red lights was a bright white light which was moving toward me until it winked out.  A second white light was to the left of the red ones and moving to the left.  I pulled over to the side of the road to get a better view, and as I came to a stop I noticed a deer directly in font of and not more than three feet from my van, standing in the beam of my headlights.&quot;  Oddly enough, all other details of this sighting are missing from my memory.  I don&apos;t remember how the lights disappeared or how long they were visible, or what happened to the deer.  Virginia Dale is a deer crossing, but having one so close is strange.", "It has been several years since I saw a hovering large ball outside, barely moving, for several days. Last night, while reading in my living room two and a half small disks emerged in front of my eyes as I read. At first, I thought it was just a reflection. Then, I observed the one reflection be repeated into two and then into two and a half, like a type of mitosis or meosis in biology. I continued to read and the clear lenses stayed in front of my eyes. They were less than an inch each. They did not seem to come from anywhere in particular. When I looked at them closely, I could see the movement of cell-type activity. It was very unusual. I sat up further and attempted to permeate the two and a half disks. Then, I backed up again to read and I could see that they were still there. Eventually, after several minutes, they disappeared. They didn&apos;t really travel or move as an entity. The insides; however, were pulsing with cell-type movement. There were silver-grey outlines inside the lens-type spheres.", "I knew well a retired air force.man who reveiled he was a doctor present at the examination of bodies at Dayton, Ohio.I heard the coast to coast airing this Friday.

He purported that he was for a wing? of SAC, the flight surgeon.  He had been called to hurridly called to the base in the night.  With little warning he was sworn to highest secrecy.

Looked like it was headed in a southerly direction but remained in the same location for long periods of time... lasted until trees obscured my view.

I do not want notarity. I am a 57 year old professional engineer and after years of looking at the night sky I have never before seen anything that I would describe as a ufo or any other object similar to what I saw up close in August. I do not remember the exact date, but it was an unusually clear and moonless night. We live in the foothills east of Seattle in an area sheltered from city light. I went out in the yard and was laying on a blanket watching for meteorites during a period of expected meteor showers. It was quiet except for the sounds of owls in the woods. After about half an hour I noticed something approaching very fast, very low and blocking out the stars to the east in my peripheral vision. As I looked upward, a large boom-a rang shaped object passed overhead at an altitude I would estimate as 500 to 1000 feet. It had no lights, absolutely no sound and seemed to be traveling at a supersonic speed without any accompanying sonic boom. I remember saying out loud &quot;What the...&quot; at which time a cargo bay or some opening on the bottom center of the object lit up with a blueish white light. I could see visible framework in the rounded front, rectangular opening. Just as quickly, the light went out. It had lit up for perhaps three seconds. Within two more seconds the object disappeared over the foothills to the west. It had passed from horizon to horizon in perhaps six seconds. Again it was extremely low, had no navagation lights and absolutely no sound. We have jet aircraft pass over our home in the day. NOTHING travels as fast as what I saw that night.

We all belonged to the Church of Scientology, and they had secretly smuggled a bunch of us down there where we were to study the mechanics of Dianetics and Scientology, for our own benefit and that of the Sea Org, as it was called then.  We were housed in one large tent which was situated some 2,000 ft., or not quite a half mile from the ocean, where which was the vast expance of rocky bluffs above the actual beach, that were maybe 40 to 50 ft high in most places.  One night around 11:30 someone noticed the lights over the ocean, so we all went out to the edge of the bluffs to watch.  Six brilliant diamond shaped craft were dancing in some irregular pattern over the coast, maybe no more than two miles out.  These craft would sometimes actually stop momentarily, then streak off again in some strange angle, seemingly mentally connecting with all of us. Even today, mant years later my brother and my friend and I often discuss this incident that happened so many years ago. We did feel a distinct feeling that not only did these craft know we were there, but that they were actually trying to communicate with us. We know that these craft were from somewhere out of our world.Two weeks earlir we all experienced a light as bright as the sun outside our tent, so we went outside and saw a disk shaped sphere glowing flourescent white intense light.

That&apos;s when I told the other passangers to check that out and everyone agreed that it wasn&apos;t an airplane or a helicopter.  All the passangers and I have lived in this town for quite some time and we know the difference between most of the airplanes and helicopters because El Paso has an airport, army base, and it&apos;s a border town.  We always have commercial airplanes,army jets, and helicopters in the sky so we already know how they look and sound. But this object was just floating in the sky for about 4-6 minutes in the same place.  The object didn&apos;t move from that exact place in those 4-6 minutes it was just flashing a orange/yellow light on and off.  Then suddenly the object will move forward and backward in a very rapid speed.  We could se it really close because it wasn&apos;t that high in the sky, and we could see the fast speed it moved forward and backward and then staying in the same place again were it was floating the first time.  No commercial airplane, helicopter, or army jet I have seen in this town has moved so fast and be so low.

These objects were high enough in the sky that they could not be seen without binoculars.

The eclipse was nearly complete with just a sliver left of regular lunar reflection, around 6:40 Mountain Time. We both saw the boomerang shaped object which was backlit by the eclipsed moon. It appeared in the lower right-hand quadrant of the moon, slightly inward on the radius between the 6 and 5 o&apos;clock positions and moving in a slight arch downward and out of the moon&apos;s light. It took at least a minute to traverse this space. In size from side to side of its shape, we estimate it to be around 1/6 the moon&apos;s diameter. It was impossible to tell where in the viewing space the object could have been located. It could have been anywhere in our upper atmosphere or in the space between the moon and ourselves as we viewed. The outline of the dark object was more fuzzy than starkly defined as well. After at least a full minute of viewing as the object moved extremely slowly, it disappeared into the surrounding blackness of the night sky. Our atmospheric conditions on that night were absolutely crystal clear and we are located at above 7,000 ft. altitude. Could it have been an owl we saw backlit by the moon? The movement was archlike so it may be a possibility. The lines were so diffuse around the edges of the object, however, and the shape of the object so consistently formed that we doubted an owl could have produced such an image. The curved longest side of the boomerang had an unnatural curvature totally unlike that of an owl&apos;s lines in flight and the speed was too slow to account for an owl&apos;s closer distance in our viewing field. Could it have been a plane? No, unless our government is working on a new class of secret boomeranged shaped craft. Always a possibility. I am a former teacher and my husband owns his own business.

Iwas driving and looking almost directly west at the time. It was moving slowly from left to right (south to north) in the direction of Alliance Airport. I couldnt see it clearly because it seemed to be shifting somehow. I thought at first it was a small aircraft towing a banner as that would account for the rectangular shape but it was too blocky in appearance to be a banner unless it was either moving tangentially away from me or toward me.The color was a greyish..but it was mottled and also made me think it was a semi transparent banner from a pretty good distance.The other thing that made me discount the banner was it was moving a good bit too fast to be a banner..they simply dont move that quickly.It wasnt that fast because i could easily get the general movement of the object even though it was vague. For a moment i thought it may have been 2 aircraft in formation but discounted that as well because of the way it moved. i lost site of the object as it appeared to move away or turn with the narrow part of it toward me..i also was going under an overpass and when i came back out on the other side scanning the full horizon lost it all together. This was a very muted image at best..but was very substantial when it first appeared. the size of it when holding thumb and forefinger at arms length would be about an inch.

Everything about it was just odd, from it&apos;s shape, reflectiveness, the way it appeared to begin moving from a dead stop, and the way it just seemed to &apos;cut through&apos; the air in an extremely straight flight path.  It was still light outside, and I could see no lights, no trails, and heard absolutely no sound (I was pulled off the highway).There is quite a bit of air traffic over this area, and as such I am rather used to seeing airplanes in the sky.  This, I can say, certainly did not look like any airplane I&apos;ve seen, nor a helicopter.  If anything, it resembled an ovoid blimp shape, but it was quite small/high up and just didn&apos;t stike me as a blimp.", "two sightings/ #1 orange earthlights follow each other &amp; #2 massive silver ball moves at high altitude across skyI have had two really strange events happen to me.  I remember the events VIVIDELY and thou time has passed I feel I need to informe you.  I love the Art Bell shows when you are a guest.I first wrote this to an &quot;expert&quot; on EARTHLIGHTS and included the &quot;moon size&quot; ball story also.  I feel that it is well described and hope that you don&apos;t feel slighted because I am sending it on to your organization. FEEL FREE TO PASS IT ON TO ANY OTHER experts.  The BIG SILVER BALL insident was at approximately 7 to 8 pm on June 14, 1998 or 1999 ( I remember that it was about 2 days after my birthday- but I can&apos;t remember the exact year ).  I wish this could help maybe you received another report of this nature about June 14 or 15.  Maybe you could forward this to Art Bell and Coast to Coast as well.  Thank You and keep looking up ( I THINK IF MORE PEOPLE KEPT THEIR EYES TO THE SKIES&lt; UFO SIGHTINGS WOULD BE EVEN MORE COMMON ).    &gt;Subject: earthlight sighting and seperate massive silver ball sighting (high altitude)  &gt;sighting #1 - Two beautiful silent orange lights &gt;Hi, I live in Kennewick, Wa ( where the Columbia and Snake River Join &gt;together).  This is also 30 miles from the Hanford Atomic Energy site that &gt;produced the Plutonium used in Japan.  The coolant water from the reactors &gt;passes directly below my home, one mile away (I mention the reactors only because I wonder if they are sometimes associated with sightings). As I was just getting &gt;home close to eleven pm on a dark evening, I stood by my parked car looking to &gt;the North in the direction of the Columbia River(one mile away).  Silently rising at &gt;approx. 30-40 mph and at an angle of 30 degree&apos;s (approx) headed up river &gt;East ( at right angles to me ) was a beautiful spot of ORANGE light.  It was &gt;a silent night and I COULD HEAR NOTHING - I was of course absolutely &gt;intrigued.  I continued to watch the light head east until it reached say a &gt;height of 4 or 5 telephone posts.  ( It&apos;s size ping-pong ball-softball or &gt;slightly bigger ).  I first saw it rise from directly in front of me to &gt;that height approximately 1/8 mile to my right or less.  At that point the &gt;light made a seemed like,sharp, 90 degree turn to the right and continued in a &gt;straight line in a Southern direction.  AT THIS TIME I WAS REALLY AMAZED AND THRILLED TO SEE ANOTHER silent ORANGE BALL OF LIGHT FOLLOW THE SAME IDENTICAL PATH AS IT&apos;S PREDICESSOR.I NEVER MOVED AND I WOULD SAY THAT THE PATH WAS IDENTICAL &gt;WITH THE 90 DEGREE TURN INCLUDED.    AFTER THE SECOND LIGHT HAD MADE IT&apos;S &gt;TURN IT FOLLOWED THE LEADING LIGHT BY 200-300 YARDS.  I continued to watch &gt;the lights go to my right ( as if following highway 395 to Umatilla,Oregon) the event took at least 5 minutes and the second light blinked out but &gt;the front light grew fainter as it continued South.  IN AFTERTHOUGHT I FELT &gt;SO BAD THAT I HADN&apos;T ATTEMPTED TO FOLLOW IT .  PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF YOU &gt;FEEL THIS IS AN EARTHLIGHT SIGHTING OR UFO SIGHTING.  THIS EVENT WAS FROM &gt;TWO YEARS AGO AND I REMEMBER IT LIKE YESTERDAY.sighting #2                                                From my yard I also saw, while watering my roses in the afternoon light, a perfectly round silver BALL it looked like a basketball up in the air high enough to be just the size of the moon in the sky.  I thought this thing may be close to me but as it moved to the east it passed in BACK of the WAVY little Cirrus Clouds that are close to 30,000 feet in altitude ( yes, I am bright enough that I thought of testing its hight with CLOUDS). Again no sound.  I DID NOT THINK IT WAS A WEATHER BALLOON/ EVEN IF ONE COULD SURVIVE BEING INFLATED TO THAT PERFECT ROUNDNESS. TO HAVE APPEARED &gt;THAT LARGE AT 35,000 feet it would have had to be huge. Bigger than a Boeing 747 because when watched from the ground a boeing 747 does not appear to be the size of the moon until it is much lower, say 5000 feet or less.  To approach that much pressure the high altitude weather balloons would be much closer to 25 miles above the earth anyway and would not even be visible). Again I could have followed the object but did not. Thank you.((NUFORC Note:  Dates are approximate.

I walked out the west facing door of my home, and in the sky, just north of due west were 4 lights.  They would move in a circle once or twice then move in to the middle and then back out and then around in a circle again. I thought it might be a strobe type light and continued to walk down our walkway with my dog..when something caught my attention and I looked straight up and there was another set of these lights directly above me, doing the same circle dance!  I stood there with my mouth open, because I knew this wasn&apos;t a strobe light.  It was a partly cloudy evening, so the lights seemed to be hazy or diffused, not sharp balls of light.  And there were no columns of light underneath as you would get with strobe type lights for grand openings etc.  I started to feel..a bit unnerved, scared even and ran back into my house.  There was one other thing, a week or so prior to this, my dog had been acting very strangely.  Climbing behind furniture, our sofa, a chair, digging and pretty much wrecking our rec room.  She has never done anything like this before.  She seemed.totally weirded out.  We would lock her in the garage till she calmed down.  Now I wonder if she sensed the presence or proximity of what I saw that night!", "Stationary brilliant variable white light masquerades as planet Mercury.I was driving my regular route as airport shuttle driver from Cheyenne, Wyoming to Fort Collins, Colorado on Interstate 25 and had one passenger onboard -- a civilian employee of the USAF on his way from Warren AFB to Vandenberg AFB, California.  At 17:32 I noticed a brilliant motionless white light about 20 times brighter than the star Sirius some 15 degrees above the southwest horizon.  I first thought it must be an airplane with its landing light on.  After 10 seconds, the light reduced to the magnitude of Sirius and stayed like this for several minutes.  Finally, I mentioned the object to my passenger, whereupon it immediately increased its brightness to 20 times Sirius for 10 seconds, reduced again becoming momentarily invisible, and then returned to magnitude of Sirius.  It held this appearance from 17:37 until 17:52, when it set behind a cloud bank in the position of the planet Mercury. At the time of this sighting, I was 27 years old, attending college in Laramie, Wyoming, had served four years in the U.S. Navy, and was a private pilot.  I had also had training in basic astronomy and astrophysics.  We had left Little America in Cheyenne at 17:00, and then checked for passengers at the Holiday Inn, which we left at 17:10.  The shuttle vehicle was an 11-passenger Ford van owned by Airport Express of Fort Collins, Colorado. Exactly 10 and 12 days later, I saw more Unconventional Flying Objects, so that this report is the first in a cluster of three.  I will submit individual reports for each.((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although witness does not indicate that fact.  One of three seemingly credible reports from same source.

It caught my attention because it was a very bright object and it did not appear to be a plane.  Suddenly it stopped moving and sat still in the sky for two or three seconds.  It then moved straight up and stopped again beneath a cloud formation.  Next a light from the object projected up onto the cloud for a second and then was turned off.  The object then shot up thru the cloud and I lost sight of the object.((NUFOR Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "One evening about an hour after sundown in 1972, approximately half-way between Rensselaer and Francesville, Indiana, an elderly friend and I were outside talking together when we stopped to observe a lighted object flying a northwesterly course passing directly over our position.  We first thought it was a commercial jet, but we heard no engine sound at all.  I estimate the altitude to have been fifteen to twenty thousand feet.  About the time the object was directly overhead, we heard what sounded like a military aircraft in hot pursuit.  Its rate of closure was fast enough that it was about to overtake the silent object.  We stood transfixed as the silent object made a precise 90 degree turn to the southwest and accelerated OUT OF SIGHT in no more than two seconds, leaving the military aircraft helplessly behind.  We watched for a short time after that, but nothing else happened.  That is all we saw.  I verbally verified it with my elderly friend to be sure we both saw the same event.She confirmed that she had. About the same period of time, I can&apos;t remember if it was before or after, along this same stretch of road, a farmer lost some of his pigs to mutilation.  Their nostrils and rectums were surgically removed.  No tracks led up to or away from the carcasses.Local law enforcement was unable to make any determination as to who or what it was.  As far as I know, the case was never closed.((NUFORC Note:  Date of event is approximate.

It had went from its v-shape to an oval like shape then right back to its original shape so perfect and absolute as if it never left its shape.Then it flew away past my house into the dark.The next day my friend and I went to the library to reaserch what we saw, looking in two UFO books we saw the same thing we saw that night.

Once again we both stood perfectly still and noticed that it did not fly in a straight path but wobbled. No flashing lights at all and definatly not a satelite because it was going to fly between two stars and we noticed it wobble and slow down as the stars were in the background.

It was so bright that it looked like a ball of plasma, pure white. Heading south then turned and flew eastbound. Again, no flashing lights as an aiplane would have.

Irwin U.S. Army training facility. The alleged landing took place approximately one week ago (10/10-11)at the Lake Beverly resort on the western edge of Coyote Dry Lake.

There is no stalk breakage and in several locations about the perimeter are large bundles of reeds that looked &quot;blasted&quot; out as if by some great force but still just &quot;laid down&quot;. Numerous cattails have been burst open by the force. In the bottom of the depression is a small area of browned reeds and what appear to be some randomly spaced depressions although the reeds have settled over these making them very difficult to discern.

She walked up next to me and stood there for a moment and staired at it with me.  She said &quot;Is that what I think it is?&quot;.  I responded &quot;Ya&quot;.  Then after a moment, It started to rise up, more like it was drifting up in the air like a ballon that a kid let go of at the fair.  Then when it got to the point were we had to squint our eyes to see it, it darted off at an incredible speed.  Like o MPH to hundreds of MPH in a second.  It stired my curiousity and my wifes religion.", "Last Friday the 24th of Oct. 2003  they were spraying an extra heavy grid of Chemtrails all over America and we were all wondering what was up.I have a beauty shop in my house and today (Sunday)I was doing my sister in-laws hair, she told me  that on Friday right before midnight she and her husband were outside and they saw some very strange things in the sky. She said that they had no lights and were very quite and looked like huge hang gliders or Manna-Rays and were hard to see but they reflected lights when they flew over them.Her daughter called the police and three officers came as well as 4 neighbors making a total of 11 witnesses.The police tried to shine a light on them but when they did they just looked like camaflouge.They said they were going south by southeast  She lives in Shawnee Oklahoma. about a hundred miles southeast of Geary where we live.Now as if that wasn&apos;t weird enough a friend of mine that lives in Geary Oklahoma had told that same exact story to us on Saturday. She said she and her teenage son had seen those same things Friday night. I intend to call everyone today and interview them, and then compare notes. Apparently there were a lot of them and they were traveling in groups of 2-3-and 4 then they would not see any for a min. or two.I am just wondering if anyone else has seen anything like this..??What could they be?", "A very clear sighting on highway U.S. 165 in Louisiana north of Oakdale near the small town of Glenmora in 1969.It was a clear bright December afternoon, with clear blue sky, unlimited view.  We were driving north on U.S. 165 from Kinder toward Alexandria, La. We had left the town of Oakdale and was about seven miles north headed toward the small town of Glenmora, La.  We were just chatting and I was looking out the window to the right where I was seated in the passangers seat.  I felt very funny all over as if something were wrong.  I looked forward and saw a very bright silver object hovering over the highway about a mile or so in front of us.  At first I didn&apos;t beleave what I was seeing was real but I saw that all of the cars in front of us had pulled off the highway and stopped.  I reached for my camera, a Canon QL Pellex, I had a lens on it that was for close in shots.  I was watching the object as we pulled over and stopped, attempting to change to my 135 telephoto lens and get out of the car to take pictures. (I WAS TOO LATE)  The object was hovering at what appeared to be about 400 to 500 feet directly above the highway.  The craft or object pevited from level to about 30 deg.s up on the right and moved at a very rapid rate to about 1500 to 2000 feet, stopped, leveled and became stationary.  The object did exactly the reverse and moved back to the level position over the roadway.  The craft or object glinting in the sun, did the same to the left as it did to the right.  Each time it moved it stayed for only two or three seconds in each position.  It then moved back to the level position over the highway and repeated its identical movement to the right once again.  It moved back to the center over the highway and paused, it tilted to a position of about 45 to 60 degree angle to the up side to the left.  The craft accelerated from zero to completly out of sight is only in only one second. The acceleration was unbeleaveable, the craft was visable for the first what appeared to be 10,000 feet as it became fainter and disappeared.  I was in the Air Force at the time and I was on leave before re! porting to my new station.  I never reported the sighting to anyone before now.  I do not beleave in UFO&apos;s or abductions by anyone from other planets.  I do not beleave that anyone from other worlds have ever lived here or visited hear.  I think we have developed these objects ourselves or they are the deamons of saton attempting to fool people.  What I saw was real in my mind and all who saw it, but it could have been deamon fooling all of us at the same time.", "Daylight Cigar Shaped CraftThis sighting occurred while fishing on East Bay Lake on the Cisco Chain. This lake is located just over the Wisconsin boarder in Michigan&rsquo;s Upper Peninsula on the Cisco Chain of lakes This event was witnessed by 3 people on the same boat.The sky was clear with very few clouds and the wind was coming out of the north, blowing south approximately 15-20 mph.  One witness noticed a strange object in the sky, directly overhead and drew the other&rsquo;s witness attention to it.  The object was heading due north at a very slow rate of speed at best guess at an altitude of 5,000 feet and much to slow for any conventional aircraft. Since the wind was out of the north, the craft had to be propelled by something. However, upon closer observation the craft appeared smooth, silver in color, cigar shaped and had no other visible means of population. We all listened close for noise a conventional craft would make but the craft made no noise what so ever.  The absence of wings or external engines/jets made us really wonder what was propelling this craft. The craft continued on its northerly course at its very slow rate of speed until it disappeared behind a nearby tree line north of us.All there observers were under no influence of any substance, save coffee. One was a native to the area for years and works in the area in the tourism field. The other two witnesses, visiting from a large metropolitan area, are both professionals in there fields.  This account was submitted with the input and approval of all three witnesses.", "Pinpoint of light moving far too fast to be a satellite...Also not a meteor because there was no trail......I saw what looked like a satellite going over head. However the speed at which it was traveling was 2 to 3 times faster than any earth orbiting object that I have ever seen. It traveled from south-east to north-west and I followed it until it went below the horizon. I have witnessed many different earth orbiting objects as well as Comets and meteors. There was NO trail behind the object. Like I said it looked like a satellite but moved far too fast to be that.

I just wish it had stayed longer so I could have gotten a better look, Thanks", "Orange disk in night skyMy best friend and I, both then 8 yrs. old, were huddled behind a bush in front of the house of a neighborhood girl we were teasing. Suddenly my friend tapped me on the shoulder. I turned and saw an oval orange light coming from the west. We watched it until it disappeared over the piney hills east of town. It travelled horizontally, at I would guess the altitude of a light plane. It was a very distinct oval; no haze, no trail, no sound. The distance between the hilltops east and west that nestle this little valley town is prob. about 15 miles, so the object was going at a pretty good clip. Our parents &quot;pooh-poohed&quot; this of course, but changed their minds a couple of days later when the Colo. Springs paper carried reports of sightings that same night around the same time (tho&apos; describing green, blue, etc. in addition to orange) from the Colo. Springs area, east of Woodland Park, and further east of Colo. Springs.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Last night while driving home from work, I noticed a red (about the color of a stop light only a little darker) spherical, steady light about 40&deg; above the horizon to my left. At first I though it was a tower light but then realzed it was too high. It appeared to be stationary but I wasn&apos;t certain because I was moving at about 50 mph.Anyway, As I kept glancing at it, I noticed that an elongated, vertical, dark spot kept moving from right to left across the object/light which seemed to indicate that it was rotating. I looked for a road to turn off on but it took a few minutes and by the time I saw the light again, it had moved westward and was closer to the western horizon. Soon thereafter it moved out of sight.NOTES: I am an experienced observer of the night sky and of various types of aircraft and their light displays. This object, whatever it was, had a shade of red that I have never seen on an aircraft. Plus it appeared to be rotating and I saw no white or green flashing anti-collision lights.The sky was clear and the object was about three times as large as Mars appears to be. Mars, by the way was in a different part of the sky.I was driving on S.R. #7 in Indiana at the time and the object was just east of Columbus, Indiana in the northern sky. This was DEFINITELY not a twinkling star or a flare.I&quot;ve seen both of those many times.", "Translocation and &quot;knowing&quot; I could fly onto elevated deck.One early morning in either 1968 or 1969, when I was about seven years old, I woke up at about 6 o&apos;clock in a different location.  I was on the couch downstairs in the living room, covered up with a blanket that my mother always kept there.  Thinking my parents had decided to paint our bedroom, and had therefore moved me and my brother in our sleep, I curiously went back upstairs, and found my brother sleeping away in his own bed.  My bed had obviously been slept in part of the night, and the room was unpainted.  I had never sleep-walked before then, nor have I ever done so since then.  I determined to get to the bottom of this mystery, so I made a point to &quot;interview&quot; each of my four older sisters, to see which one of them had played this trick on me.  None ever admitted to such a prank. At about the same time, I have another memory which in retrospect may be related to the couch incident.  I remember being outside in the backyard, looking up at our deck, which was built directly off the living room, and &quot;knowing&quot; that I could fly onto and off of, that deck.  It was more than a simple wish -- it was a conviction.  The deck was some seven or eight feet off the ground, which sloped away from the back of the house.  So adamant was I of my conviction, that I got a piece of rope (old clothesline, I think), tied it onto a kitchen chair, and wedged that chair into one corner of the deck.  Don&apos;t ask me why I did it this way, but that&apos;s the way I did it.  Once this was done, I slid down the rope to the ground, burning my hands in the process.  I had never heard of a flying saucer or UFO at this time, much less the apparent abduction phenomenon.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "round white saucer with lights on the bottom and made no sound.I was walking by a park in Medford, MA.  I looked up at the sky and saw several round ships flying around the sky.  Like a fool, after seeing them I ran up the street and told some people what I saw.  They ran back to the park with me and they were gone.  Needless to say I felt like a jerk.  I continued on my walk as this night I was meeting a friend of mine to go out for the night.  When I met my friend I told her what happened and she got a good chuckle out of the story and told me I was crazy.  We were walking on Riverside Avenue and went down to a field area in order to save time and take a shortcut.  I saw a dog running and barking.  I thought this was strange as I knew if a dog was barking there was someone in the field.  I am thinking at the time, a person was down here.  Believe me I was not thinking space ships.  I then looked up and there was the ship.  It was very white, round, and had lights around the bottom of it.  It was over our heads so I could not see the top of it.  It was so close to us that if you had a good arm you could have thrown a rock and hit it.   That is how close it was to us.  I was scared shitless.  This ship made no noise at all.  I could not understand this.  I then said to my friend, look there is one of the ships I saw before.  I told you I was not crazy when I saw them in the park.  My friend started to run away and I was (no way) going to stay there by myself looking at this thing.  I ran after her.  I tried to tell our mutual friends what we saw.  In fact, one time when I did tell others my friend got very upset with me and did not want to admit seeing anything.  She just gave me a look when I was telling the story to others that I should just shut up.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was curious because of its sleek apearance that perhaps it was some new type private jet I just assumed I didn&apos;t see the wings because of the angle I was looking at it from the side.  However I continued to watch it and it turned and continued off to my left as I watched it I thought it was strange that it was so slow moving and to my surprise it came to a stop.  I watched it another minute and it finally took off I even stopped my car in the middle of the road.  After it took off and I tried to continue to track it because of all the trees in the neighborhood I lost sight.  I never saw any wings on this craft.

Curiously it was following the path of the American River, flew over the fish hatcheries there and then over lake Nimbus when I lost sight.  Another odd fact..we have a very large company on about 20 acres, Aerojet General who builds and tests rocket engines right along side the fish hatchery.

If you&apos;ve never been to the Sky Bar it&apos;s a dimly lit outdoor bar overlooking Los Angeles, so its easy to see the night sky.  That evening was clear with a light haze in the sky.  At about 9:00PM my friend jokingly pointed to the west and said &quot;Here comes a UFO&quot;. I looked to the west and saw what appeared to be lights in a V-formation heading directly toward us.  The objects in the formation were emitting little or no light and appeared to only be reflecting back the lights of the city.  As I looked at them I at first thought it was a flock of large white birds heading towards us.  I trained my eyes on them as they approached looking for wings. As the objects neared and began to fly overhead I could see that there were no wings and the objects were unexplainable.  What I saw were lights in a triangle formation.  There were approximately 13 lights (1 lead and 6 on each side in a V-formation).  What made it unusual were that the rear lights were constantly switching places with each other.  The object was completely silent and moving at a speed no greater than that of an airplane.  The object also appeared to be flying at about 5,000 feet and was flying in a Northeasterly direction. We both watched as the formation flew directly overhead and flew over the roof of the hotel and out of site. The object was obviously no plane as from our vantage point we could watch the airplanes approaching and landing at LAX, plus it made no sound.  Even small planes a couple miles away could be heard from our view. I travel on business over 100,000 airline miles a year and have been doing it for 15 years straight.  I&apos;ve spent alot of time in the air and around airports and have never, ever seen anything that could explain what I saw that evening.

It was heading west down Rt 273.  It was going at a slow speed and seemed to be getting lower.  Maybe the height of 1 1/2 telephone poles.  I got the feeling that it may hit us.  All we saw at this point was the head light coming right to us.  It finally flew over us.  We got a look under it.  I didn&apos;t see any landing gear.  It was light gray or white.

It seemed to be 2000 to 3000 feet above ground level, moving slowly toward me at elevation, and then began rising slowly.  I had a digital camera with me and proceeded to snap some photos, and one movie mode clip, on two separate memory cards.  The object seemed to color shift from more white to more pink, then darker pink, as it rose up into some cloud cover.  I had observed the clouds being formed earlier.  They were a combination of jet contrails/chemtrails that had fanned out into cloud, and some fast forming &apos;popcorn&apos; clouds which seemed to come out of nowhere to become thicker, more dense cloud along with the jet trails.  The object changed its attitude from low at left side, to low at the right side and high at the left, in other words it became pitched in the opposite direction.  it also seemed to change size and clarity, not with respect to rising and becoming smaller, but as it entered the cloud cover it became smaller and more like a bright point of light than an oval shape.  This is also the point at which its attitude pitched over the other way, as described above.  As it rose up into the cloud cover it changed to a double oval shape, still pitched, with the lower oval magenta in color, the upper one pale yellow with a green luminous fringe, and the two ovals were separated by about half their thickness by two or three balls of dark blue color.  Size of the object was small, perhaps 1/10 of my thumb width held out at arm&apos;s length.  I had paused to take the photos, but as I had filled both camera memory cards, I put away the gear and continued walking east on Canyon Road.  The object had risen above the cloud cover, reaching a height over 30,000 feet, and became lost.  It never really stood completely still, and rose vertically and moved horizontally mostly to the west and south, but in no regular pattern, only that of its own apparent making.  It made no sound.  One aircraft! was seen flying near the object near the end of the sighting, but I had already filled the memory cards.", "Joint NUFORC/MUFON of Georgia Investigation, Meriwether County GeorgiaJoint NUFORC/MUFON of Georgia Investigation  The following MUFON of Georgia report was generated by a joint NUFORC/MUFONGA investigation regarding the events occurring on 13April03 at about 9:15PM on Georgia Hwy. 41 between Warm Springs and Greenville Georgia (Meriwether County). The principal MUFONGA investigators were Olivia Newton, State Section Director for the Lilburn Georgia area, and Jim Clifford, Deputy Director for Georgia Investigations.On 15April03, Peter Davenport, NUFORC Director, contacted this writer, Tom Sheets, SD for MUFONGA. Mr. Davenport made MUFONGA aware of the highly unusual nature of this event and after additional discussion it was decided to have Georgia Field Investigators to probe further into the case.The Newton/Clifford team was contacted by this writer and agreed to proceed in contacting the witness(es) and in visiting the event scene. As stated in the posted NUFORC report, the witnesses are related, two brothers and the wife of one brother, mature adults all. (All three witnesses posted accounts to NUFORC).The primary witness in this case (W-1) lives in the north Georgia area near Atlanta. The FI team met with him and conducted an interview on 30April03. He recounted the occurrence originally posted to NUFORC. The FI&apos;s described W-1 as being very serious and intense, holding firm eye-contact with the FI&apos;s throughout the interview. W-1 was also concerned with the post-event emotional state of his older brother and wife, since they all felt that their lives had been changed by the event.During detailed questioning, he went on to provide more details; describing the red round objects as being SOLID, and NOT transparent light; about the size of half-dollar coins; no detectable heat or cold seemed to have been produced nor was any odor noticed. The tiny objects were also described as giving off little beam like projections or rays when close to the floorboard, and perhaps numbered as many as fifty.The FI team made arrangements to meet on 5May03 with W-1&apos;s older brother (W-2) and his wife (W-3), who reside in Meriwether County. A visit to the scene of the event was also planned.The exact site was easily located on Hwy 41 about four miles south of Greenville. The FIs made photos and inspected the surrounding heavily wooded terrain. No signs of recent passage were noted (knee-high weeds and grass). Only a few houses dot the area. Later interviews with residents of the area turned up no productive leads, but some vague comments came out about &quot;unusual&quot; events in town, but with no specifics (this MIGHT (?) be related to the many past UFO reports of the 1990&apos;s as described below). FI Newton later visited the Franklin D. Roosevelt Airport in nearby Warm Springs but developed no new information.The W-2 and W-3 interviews were conducted in their Meriwether County residence, which was described by the FIs as a neat rural Georgia home, full of family photos. Interviews were conducted separately, and consisted of recountings of the NUFORC posts. W-2 reiterated that one of the red discs had remained motionless on the very area of his recent colon surgery for about five seconds, while the others continued to whirl about. He later wondered if perhaps this object had possibly destroyed any cancer cells that might have remained after the surgery.W-3 was described as an especially genuine, forthright and honest person. In fact, FI Newton ranked her as one of the best witnesses she&apos;d ever interviewed (and she&apos;s interviewed hundreds). W-3 recounted her NUFORC post, and corroborated other details described in this report(s). According to FI Newton, before MUFONGA&apos;s involvement in this matter, W-3 was so aggressive in her search for answers, that she automatically undertook chores normally completed by FIs. W-3 visited the Meriwether County Sheriff&apos;s Department, the local GBI office (Georgia Bureau of Investigation) and also met with some residents in the sparsely populated area of the event. However nothing was developed.FI Newton concluded that these three witnesses were extremely credible, and NEVER displayed any body language or clusters of kinesic-like signals that would indicate deception of any sort. Newton indicated that these witnesses felt that they were &quot;chosen&quot;, and were being scanned by these tiny objects for whatever reason.The FI team considered many causes in this case. Ball lightning (especially fragmenting ball lightning ref. Wm. Corliss &quot;Remarkable Luminous Phenomena in Nature&quot; GLB9......though the weather was clear and mild); pranksters hiding at the roadside to ambush motorists with laser pointers; automobile deodorizers that exude mist and thus might refract light; natural &quot;spook&quot; lights or glowing plasmas and other such things. Due to their large number, bizarre movements, apparent solidity, and the object&apos;s close proximity to the witnesses, these mundane explanations were set aside. During his interview, W-2 stated that he may have observed a &quot;rolling red phenomenon&quot; just outside the window of the vehicle in the instant before the tiny objects appeared inside, but it was so brief he could comment no further.FI Newton discussed this case in depth with a local physicist and two geologists. These learned scholars could provide no helpful information other than what we already knew. The Sheriff of Meriwether County served as a police SWAT/Medic and was an associate when this writer was Chief of Police in College Park Georgia. This writer discussed the case with him. He had received no similar reports, but advised that he would contact MUFONGA ASAP if anything turned up. The Sheriff&apos;s brother is also a GBI Agent and an associate of this writer and would likewise forward any information obtained via his channels.As indicated by FI Newton, it should be noted that a very short distance south of the event scene is Warm Springs Georgia, the site of President Franklin D. Roosevelt&apos;s &quot;Little White House&quot;. FDR spent much time there in the 1930&apos;s and 1940&apos;s due to the geothermal springs and their reputed healing qualities for polio victims. FDR passed away there in 1945. While such unusual geology is found in a few places around the USA, it is unknown if such terrain might somehow be connected to this case. It should also be noted that the area of the Georgia-Alabama state line experienced a 4.9 magnitude earthquake at 4:59AM on 29April03, 16 days after the Meriwether County event. The quake location was at 34.51N 85.60W placing it about 30 miles NW of Rome Georgia, which would make the quake center an estimated 130 miles or so NNW of Meriwether County. The Brevard Fault line begins some miles north of Lagrange George, running NE toward South Carolina.Several major newspapers in the southeast, including the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, picked up the case from this writer&apos;s &quot;MUFONGA Updates&quot; and printed the story of the investigation and these confidential witnesses. The by-lines referred to the event area as &quot;BOOGER BOTTOM&quot; due to our informal name for that vicinity. FI Newton, along with W-3, discovered that the local residents used that term when referring to the area. The term was originated long ago when illegal liquor was manufactured in these woods, and the &quot;moonshiners&quot; wanted such a connotation to hopefully keep revenue agents (!) and other trespassers away. The term &quot;Booger Bottom&quot; DOES NOT refer to any &quot;portal area&quot;, anomalous zone etc. It&apos;s strictly a local nickname for the above stated reasons. In fact, a bestselling book and major motion picture, &quot;Murder in Coweta County&quot;, starring Johnny Cash and Andy Griffith, somewhat illustrates how the area got it&apos;s name.........a true tale of moonshine and murder. The moonshiner and murderer, John Wallace, owned and lived in the area known as &quot;Booger Bottom.&quot; During the inquiry, we also received several citizen emails describing this &quot;true to life&quot; legend.Additional Notes- Meriwether County is on the eastern side (and considered an outlying part) of an area once known nationally by Ufologists as the &quot;Troup-Heard UFO Corridor&quot;. From about the mid-1980&apos;s through the late 1990&apos;s there were perhaps as many UFO reports received from this area as in Pine Bush N.Y. or Gulf Breeze Florida or even the &quot;Mysterious Valley&quot; of the southwestern USA. This writer and especially my associate, former SD John Thompson, spent much time through the late 90&apos;s investigating these cases. While this report is not the place to recount these events, it should be noted that the area WAS, and perhaps remains, one of those localities that has an abundance of UFOs, unknown entities, and other paranormal type occurrences.FI Newton has commented that throughout the many weeks of this investigation, the witness&apos; accounts have remained consistent......from their NUFORC postings to their &quot;sit-down&quot; interviews, including conversations with this writer and even during a national radio/Internet broadcast with Jeff Rense and Peter Davenport........consistent one and all.As it now stands, MUFON of Georgia believes these citizens encountered multiple unknown anomalous objects, up close and personal, on Georgia Hwy. 41 on 13April03.A report regarding this investigation is also to be filed in MUFON&apos;s &quot;World UFO Database&quot;.MUFONGA would like to thank Peter Davenport for passing this case to us for additional investigation.Best Regards,  Tom Sheets, State Director-MUFON of Georgia  Jim Clifford, Deputy Director for Georgia Investigations  Olivia Newton, State Section Director- Gwinnett, Dekalb, Rockdale Counties((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Tom Sheets, and Georgia/MUFON, for following up on this fascinating case.

It was a clear night with a full moon. I looked out over the fields, I live in a small village with few street lights. I noticed what looked like lights, not clear lights but fuzzy not more than 100 yards ahead in the sky I think phoforus ( I don&apos;t know how to spell it) is a good way to decribe the lights there where 2 of them going in a large circle chasing each other. After a while they met together for a while then parted and the pattern started over again. I watched this for about half an hour. above the lights was a small cloud funny grey in colour. After about half a hour they suddenly shot of in a northerly direction and disappeared.  I went inside and came out again with the other dog not expecting to see it again when suddenly they came back to the same spot. They continued for about another 10 to 15 minutes and then just shot of again in the same direction. I have not seen them since. Near our village is a small private airport, and small planes are taking of and landing regular, and I am use to seeing the plane lights and this was nothing like that.", "Roiling, red/orange disk traverses nation&apos;s capitol at supersonic speed, near White House...never reported (1974).We were on a third floor balcony of a building across the street from the Costa Rican embassy.  We first spotted the craft to the northwest, visible as what appeared to be a bright landing light of a jet liner down near/toward the Washington monument, slowly moving eastward.  This is when it first caught my attention, and I pointed it out to my friends, as it seemed oddly bright and large for an aircraft landing light.  It remained in this aspect for 15 - 20 seconds, when it suddenly seemed to veer into a south-east vector, with the apparence of coming toward us, passing slightly to the east of the White House.  At this point my friends and I became VERY interested, as what sort of aircraft would be permitted to operate so dramtically and closely to the presidential mansion?  The night was overcast, it was most likely a weeknight, possibly Thursday or Friday night.  As the object veered toward us, it began to cross the city at a very high rate of speed, faster than any fighter jet could traverse the city.  As it came closer and closer it presented a definite red/orange roiling disk, with no tail ot trail behind it, underneath the cloud deck.  Now we were very excited, and shocked, and some of us began to be terrified and a few &quot;hit the deck&quot;, thinking it might crash into us or crash into the low hills behind us.  As it passed east of us, somewhat overhead, it was presenting a pure disk (circular, perhaps it was spheroid).  I had the impression of a roaring sound, and yet, later, I realized that it had made no actual sound.  This was the most dramatic thing I&apos;ve ever seen in the nighttime sky before or since, and I was fortunate enough to have see the meteorite that later crashed in Pennsylvania in 1965 as it flamed blue-white across the sky, through our family&apos;s picture window in St. Clair Shores, Michigan.  This was SUCH a dramatic nighttime display that I couldn&apos;t WAIT to hear the official explanation the next day......but there was no report of it in the papers, and when I called the local police station, the officer handling the phone had not heard a thing about it.  The lack of reporting of this aerial phenomena was actually more bizarre, even terrifying than the phenomena itself, for how could such an astounding display, traversing the entire nation&apos;s capitol, not be noticed by others, and reported, or at least SPECULATED upon.((NUFORC Note:  Date of the event is approximate, although we will encourage the witness to try to determine the date more accurately.  We will request permission to put him in touch with Stan Gordon, well known UFO investigator near Pittsburgh, who has investigated the 1965 event, referred to as the Kecksburg Event, which occurred near Kecksburg, PA, on December 9, 1965.

The area is residential now (the tracks still used by CSX) but, at the time it was mostly farmland.  My mother and grandmother recounted the story several times that they had scene a globe hoverring about 20 feet over them just to the side of the road.  The object was orange in color and seemed luminous.  There were two other vehicles stopped by the train, one of which was occupied by a young couple that had gotten out and taken photographs.  My mother seems to recall this event making local news, although I haven&apos;t found any evidence of that.  After some time, they described three distinc bursts of flame and explosive sound at different locations on the object (similar to a roman candle) and then the object increased slowly gaining speed into the sky.  They watched it until they could no longer see it.  My uncle had acknowledged the event, but was quite shaken by it and would not discuss it.

PD))", "Three bright lights positioned like a jet &apos;s landing lights follow the car in Mississippi.Reading the recent reports of a triangle shaped object prompted me to write this. In the summer of 1974 around July 4th, I went with a college friend to visit his parents in Lexington , Mississippi. One of his cousins and her friend from the L.A. area of California had also come in for the visit. They were returning to California on a late night flight out of the Jackson airport, so my friend and I drove them to the Jackson airport. After we dropped them off at the terminal, we headed back to Lexington. There was a road that ran adjacent to the Jackson airport that lead to the highway back to Lexington, and we were driving on this road. Far ahead, just above treetop level, there were three very bright lights that were positioned like landing lights on a commercial jet. The two outer lights were like the ones on a jet&apos;s wings, and the center at a slighty higher position, like the nose landing light. We friend and I both observed the lights because of their brightness. I said they must be landing lights. We continued driving down this road and became even more curious because the lights hadn&apos;t moved at all. That ruled out their being on a jet so my friend said they must be on the sides and top of a large water tower. We came to a stop sign and needed to turn left. The lights were directly in front of us, maybe 50-100 feet above the treetops, in this heavily wooded area. There were no street lights or buildings around and it was very quiet. We had the windows rolled down in the car and the radio was not turned on. We sat there looking at the lights wondering what they could be. They were so bright that you couldn&apos;t see what was behind them or what they were connected to, much like when you approach a parked car in a dark area and it has its headlights on. You can&apos;t see the car at all, only the bright headlights. My friend was driving and went ahead to make the left turn. The road we were turning onto was a four lane, divided road with a dirt and grass median between the lanes. He pulled across the two lanes that were headed in the opposite direction, across the median area, and then turned left onto the shoulder of the lanes we needed to use. He then stopped the car with the foot brake and sat there withthe engine idling. Now the lights were on my left, as passenger in the car. I stared out the window at them and started to become a little frightened because this was unlike anything I&apos;d ever seen. After a short time, my friend took his foot off the brake and started idling slowly down the shoulder. After we had rolled only 5-10 feet, the lights suddenly rotated towards us to stay pointed directly at the side of the car, but slightly behind the car. After the rotation, they started moving beside the car, at the same speed we were going, and maintaining the position slighly behind. As soon as the rotation occurred and the lights were moving along with the car, I went into a heart pounding panic. I was so afraid of what might happen next, because the object behind the lights was big -- maybe 80 feet from the left most light to the right most. And the silence, precision and complete lack of vibration in its movement was unlike anything I had ever seen. I urged my friend to step on the gas and get the hell away, but he hesitated as he craned his neck to look out of the passenger side window. After what seemed like an eternity, he pulled onto the main part of the road and accelerated. As soon as he accelerated, the lights stopped moving, but they slowly rotated to always point directly at the car. I had my head out the passenger window so I could watch it carefully because I was so terrified it would follow us. After we had gone about 500 feet down the road, the lights started moving across the road, always staying rotated to aim at us. The movement was slow, precise and vibration free. When they reached the stand of trees on the opposite side of the road from where we had begun our acceleration, they went down smoothly and disappeared into the trees. At this point, of course, I got a little courage back and urged my friend to turn around and go back to see if we could see anything. He agreed, but we had to drive further until we got to a crossover the median. We then turned and headed back. I watched the area like a hawk during the entire time, but never saw anything else. When we got back to the median crossover that we had used originally after the stop sign, we stopped on the shoulder before turing around. I peered into the trees but saw nothing. So we turned around at the crossover and headed back toward Lexington. I watched out the back of the car until we got back to Lexington but saw nothing else. Neither my frind nor myself had anything to drink and didn&apos;t use any drugs. We were completely clear headed and lucid when all this occurred.((NUFORC Note:  Date of the incident is approximate.

As we began to look around, we noticed 5 other of these objects and none moved for the first few minutes. One to the south east began to move erratically and after about 2 hours the object appeared to move further away. I don&apos;t know if it means anything, but almost every cow, mule, horse, and dog in the area was very upset  and this is nt normal. We looked again tonight and only saw one in the northeast sky.

My wife thinks it&apos;s a plane but I told her you should have seen it&apos;s movement, It flew off really FAST and was out of sight!  I was home from work this last Tuesday , 9-30-03, the time was about 11:45 to 12:30 p.m., not quite sure.When I first noticed it, it was just hovering and slowly moving sideways a bit, just west of our house, maybe about 5-8 miles,and  I would say somewhere between 2000 to 5000 ft ?? Not sure, when I rushed back outside with my cam, it flew off after 10 or so seconds, in a north, northeast direction ( there is also a small airport in that direction too) VERY high velocity also, in a few seconds it was gone!  This is the second time I have captured something strange on film, the other time, I caught on film what looked like a B1b bomber at high altitude. but I never saved it though. If I would have thought of it at the time, I would have put the cam on record, it takes short 30 sec videos, oh well. Thank you to the witness for allowing me to post the report and pictures.

My friend asked what that was over my right shoulder just above the tree tops.  The event occurred next to the Memphis Airport, 1/2 mile west and about 3 miles south of us.  I turned and observed a Black round object facing me about 5 miles sse just observed over the tree tops.  We thought it was a large bird circling.  It was not.  As the round portion turned downward, we saw a cross section very thin that made the object appear to disappear.  As it continued to turn or move, the what I call top portion turned toward the sun and was very reflective.  It appeared to be silver, yellowish, and had what looked like a structure or beam across the top red in color.  It was going in a NE direction very slowly and rising slowly.  As it continued a tumbling motion, the top portion fully faced us.  We observed the red beam and the color of the top appeared to be yellowish.  It continued to do a tumbling motion.  We observed what I call the bottom, it was all black and round.  As it went over the airport, appeared to move north.  When it looked like it was almost past the airport, at about 3-4000 FT, a small aircraft moved below it at about 2,000 Ft.  Once that aircraft moved away, the object appeared to go NE and gain altitude slowly.  At no time did we observe noise from this craft, no lights, no string or rope.  We watched it till it got so far we couldn&apos;t see it anymore.  Once we went inside, I called the control tower to see if they have anything or observe anything.  Nothing noted from them.  Note: I work in the aviation industry, am a veteran and had a similar job in the USAF.  Have been a aviation buff for over 30 years.  I know the sound of aircraft, navigation lights, etc as this is a part of my job.  If this was a balloon, it would have to have been a very large one and at least round on the bottom, top, and have a very small cross section.  It would also have to tumble in the wind and go with the wind.  The wind was out of the SW t! o W at 10-15 knots.", "A fluorescent light blue object leaving a trail behind it, traveling at a very fast speed in the clear night skyI was walking by myself when I saw this object. Whatever I saw, it was pretty big. I&apos;d say atleast five times the size of any light beacons on the towers near my home. It traveled from NE to SW at a very high speed, was a very light fluorescent blue in color, and left a trail behind it. I&apos;m not sure how long it was actually visible because there were some trees obstructing my view. I may have just seen the tail end of this objects flight path. The night sky was extremely clear and I also noticed alot more air traffic than usual. I want to say the tip of it was rounded, almost like a roundnose pistol bullet. I&apos;m pretty sure it wasn&apos;t a meteor. I am not an expert on these things, but I can definitely say I&apos;ve never seen anything like this before.", "Watched 3 disk shaped objects, stationary, and in a v-formation, for about 4 minutes.While deer hunting, with my son-in-law, we seen 3 disked shaped objects, sitting stationary in a v-formation.one was larger than the other two.We were at about 9000 feet elevation, and the objects seemed to be just slightly higher than we were, and about two miles away. We stopped the truck , got out and watched  all 3 for a couple of minutes, before the 2 smaller ones disappered. We continued watching the larger disk  for another couple minutes, until it took off going west at a high rate of speed. It was out of site within a few seconds.The objects looked silver in color and we didn&apos;t hear any noise.

About 1 pm the pilot put on the seatbelt sign and told us we were just on the edge of a cold front that was passing through Minneapolis and we may experience a &quot;few bumps.&quot; I thought I would snap a picture of the clouds we were above just for a future screensaver. I must add that about 30 mins earlier I nudged my wife to see a passing airplane because I&apos;m always in awe of seeing a plane pass in the opposite direction. The sense of speed one gets is amazing. The passing plane also produced a great contrail. Like I stated, I turned my digital camera to the window, and as I was framing the shot I caught a flash of what I thought was a reflection from the wing. I snapped the shot and immediately took the camera down and checked the shot in the camera&apos;s screen. The Sony camera (DSC-1) has a very small screen and since I was not wearing my reading glasses, I was only able to view the basic composition and exposure. Satisfied, I put the camera away and enjoyed the rest of the flight. The next day I downloaded all my shots from the trip (70+) with the flight shot being the last one. When it popped up on the screen I was shocked at what I saw. There in the distance was an object forward of the right wing. I describe it as cigar shaped, with 3 areas of brightness along its edge and what appears to be a darker area barely visible at its mid section along the top edge. The object also has a yellowish glow around it. For a fact I know there were no other aircraft (planes) within the area at the time, because after the few seconds it took to check the camera I returned to gazing out the window, I saw nothing. I have the shot. I am reluctant to show it beyond those I&apos;ve shown it to already. I don&apos;t need to be suspect, however I would certainly rest easier if I knew what I captured with my camera.

It was so bright it lit up the houses below. I looked throught the binoculars and saw a very bright circle with a purple/blue outer glow. I then just watched it with my eyes from my backyard. It got smaller and bigger a couple of times then it stayed small and slowly started moving increasing in speed then was gone behind a hill. When I was outside I listened carefully and there was no sound.

When it reached the treeline I noticed another &quot;star&quot; moving north at a very high rate of speed. It was not a constant light, but more of a pulsing light. The best way I can describe it was like a knife being thrown. It tumbled end over end. It was very high in the sky, seemed to be in space. As it zipped through space i would loose sight of it, but following its trajectory I could pick it up. It was moving way too fast and high to be conventional aircraft. I followed it till it disappeared. It seems to slow down at times then pick up speed very quickly.

It had been raining and was extreamly dark. At that time I was still on time, when I came to the cross-roads I took the same turn I always took on to rt. 252 going towards Brunswick Ga. I drove this route many times on my way to Kingsport NJ. to make deliveries. I was driving a tracktor trailer and was loaded with shower bases. As I drove up rt. 252 something seemed to change, things got really quite. The night seemed to become still and black my head lights were not going out as far as they normally did, I couldn&apos;t see very far in frount of me, and the amount of distance I could see seemed not to change.All of a sudden I came up to a singe in the road, it was the same one I had turned at about a half houre earlier. I thought that it might of been a differant cross-road, so I took rt.252 again, and drove for another half houre or so then I came to the cross-roads again. Then I figured that someone might of changed the signes, but I knew that I turned the right way, but that direction wasn&apos;t doing any good kept comming back to the same cross-roads.I stoped and looked at my map and picked a differant route to Brunswick,I desided to take rt.40 to Kingsland then take 17 up to Brunswick, I turned on to Rt. 40 and headed east on 40 for about half an houre and came back to the same cross-roads. It seemed strange that I hadn&apos;t met any other trucks or cars in all this time, I didn&apos;t know what to think, at first I was worried that I wouldn&apos;t make my drop in time, now I was worried that I wouldn&apos;t be able to go any whear and that I might be stuck in some kind of time warp or something weard like that. I tried the other routs from the Cross-roads and they all lead to the same place, the cross-roads. I really don&apos;t know how long I was in this loop but I was scared. I stoped the truck and got out , it was really strange because I could bearly hear the engin running on! the truck. It was as if it was muffled, and all around the truck was lit up it didn&apos;t seem like it came from a &quot;light&quot; the area around the truck was light enough to see the asphalt and the texture, but I could only see to a distance of about 20 feet then it was as if there was a wall of darkness out side, and it felt threatning. I was scared enough to kneel down on the road and pray that god would get me out of there. The tears were running down my cheeks as I prayed. Then I just got in the truck and started to drive this time things started to change my lights started to light up more and I could start making out things that I could remember.I headed up 252 and got into Brunswick pulled into the truck stop, and knew I was running late, as I walked in the waitress said hello as if nothing was wrong, I looked at the clock and it said 3;00 oclock right on time I wasn&apos;t behind at all.((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

The house was shaking and the object appeared to be very close to the top of the roof. I was about 5 years old and I sleep with my mother, so I jumped out of bed and ran to mom, she pushed me away and kept looking through the drawer.The whole house was awake by now and the windows were vibrating, there was a low humming sound coming from over the house.

The light were in a diagnal straight line.  when the light on the right side would go out another would appear on the left, giving the appearance that the lights where traveling accross the sky.  I observed another light appear to the lower left of the set of 4. The lights were visible for about 5 to 10 min and then went out.  We observed them re appear again about 5 min later.   When the lights re appeared I was looking at them through my binoculars.  They were smaller white lights in the area that i could see, but did not appear to be aircraft lights.

I am not sure if i have the site for what i have to say but if i don&apos;t get it off of my chest i am going to go mad. About 3am on sunday 5th october, my shift partner and i get a call to check out a disturbance on the Tintagel/Boscastle road. Report indicated a motorist had passed an area close to the Boscastle end and had seen a lot of flickering light beyond the main road. Normally around this time of year we get reports of this nature because of the sale of fireworks everywhere during the build up to Guy Fawkes night. Kids somehow get hold of them and can be a real pain causing all sorts of problems and sometimes fires due to misuse. We headed toward the area from the south and arrived at 03:35 approx. About a quarter of a mile before Boscastle we pulled into a small parking area opposite a tea-house on the main road. By the tea-house there is  a small gathering of houses/buildings all which were in darkness. We started to walk up the main road toward Boscastle, but after walking for five minutes my partner called my attention to the area back toward the tea-house. Above the visible horizon at the back of the tea-house we observed low level flickering of amber/white light. So we turned and headed back toward the tea-house. We then continued to walk up along side the tea-house in the direction of the lights. After passing a few more buildings the path sloped downward toward a wooded area. As we approached the the wooded area the flickering was still visible just above the outline of the treetops. We followed the path along crossing a small stream and heading further in to the woods. After about ten minutes we could see that some of  the trees ahead were being lit up by dim flashes of light so we carried on toward these trees. I think we were both expecting to find a bunch of drunk teenagers fooling around with fireworks as in years gone by but it was not the case. I was first to see what looked like round white lights moving at all kinds o! f speeds in and around the trees. We walked another ten yards or so then stopped and crouched down by a large fallen tree to asses the situation. Each ball of light was a little larger than a tennis ball and they way they flew reminded me of the way a fly does with no true path of flight, they were all over the place. I tried to count them but it was very difficult due to the speed and way they were flying but i think there must have been around 40 of them.After another ten minutes a few of the balls flew in the same direction just inches above the ground toward one end of the area in which they had been flying and seemed to join up making a larger ball of light which intensified and hovered in that one area. Looking at the ball of light i could make out 7 black specks in a circle in the center. These black specks started to rotate and the light got brighter and was too bright too look at. I looked away from the main ball and back to the flying smaller ones. Each of these had intensified also and went beserk, flying at incredible speeds in such an enclosed area. I could hear the noise of leaves being sucked into the air when they flew inches from the ground. My partner shifted his position and broke a branch on the fallen tree with his arm making a loud crack. Immediately the lights stopped and rose to tree top height and then, a few at a time quickly faded out light a headlight going off until there were none left. We heard continueous cracking of branches high up and moving away from us through the woods. I got quite unsettled and insisted that we return to the car though my partner insisted that we examine the area with our torches. In the leaves were trenches and spirals and small piles of sticks. Some areas had earth scooped out with more twigs and sticks in piles around these areas. All the while in the distance we could hear the sound of breaking branches and i was feeling really not good about being there so i shouted at my partner now was the time to leave. We returned to our car. I don&apos;t know w! hat the hell it was. Surely ufo&apos;s are big things these were tiny.

Looked at the moon and a couple of stars, one of the stars begins to move torward the direction of the moon, at first I thought it was a plane, then figured it might be a satellite. When it came to the moon edge, it did not come out the other end as it should of, thought maybe nothing. About 15 mins later, I was still looking up and a little bit east of the first one I noticed another faint star move a shorter distance and then faded off. After about 5 mins after that , high altitude planes start showing up, 3 to be exact, 2 of them made a perfect X with trailing fog, smoke or what ever.It has been in my mind all this time wondering.

Sky was black. He had a bigger baler, and could go faster then I could. When he would catch up to me, I would pull out and let him pass, because there wouldn&apos;t of been enough room for the two balers to be side by side, and still be neat in the field. I had pulled out made my circle so I could pull in to the hay row again when he passed.  His tractor and mine had cabs on them.  While I was waiting, I noticed these bright lights in the sky, and I instantly thought it was a very low flying plane in distress. Although it is a no plane area - my father&apos;s ranch is about 70 miles away from any aircraft station.  Right away, looking out the window of the cab I could see that it was not flying, but rather stationary, and these lights were so white bright, and flashing like birthday candles.  I thought that it must be of the reflection of lights of his tractor and baler causing tricks on the glass of my tractor cab.  (Before I forget, this was the year I believe that there were several sightings of unidentified objects in Saskatchewan) I poked my head out of my tractor cab to see what was above me, and believe me this was not a reflection of his lights. It was not exactly right over me, but to the south of the tractor.   There was nothing between me and the object in the sky. My hair stood on end, I wanted to jump off my tractor, to try and get on his to be with somebody.  This is the strange thing about it, it took off to the east and left this string of light, then it stopped, and went south, with this string of light it left, it stopped again, and then went west with again this string of light and disappeared over the valley hills.  This string disappeared shortly after it appeared when it travelled.  Both tractors were running of course, so there was no sound that I heard.  It was a very large object - now this is just a guess - I would say it was a little less then the size of a two ton truck.  It is difficult because the lights were flashing so bright, that it was difficult to see and it was round. His tractor had already past so it wasn&apos;t his lights shining in my eyes.  I have tried to figure out what it could of been and I can&apos;t think of what else it would be.

It was gliding eastward, toward the lake, then it turned and I could see that it was not a balloon but somewhat flat like a disk but not completely flat...and shiny with a kind of orange/gold circular shape in the middle.  Then I thought maybe it&apos;s a frisbee or something...but it kept flipping, over and over.  It wasn&apos;t moving fast, just kind of gliding.

Not disputed are three eerie green chevron shaped bow shockwavesWe were heading home to Moscow, Idaho from Spokane, WA on Highway #195 when I noticed something.  I was sitting in the back of our car and looked to the west and saw what I thought was a satellite heading our direction and after a few seconds mentioned it to the rest of the occupants in our car.  After about 20 or so seconds I noticed that this object in the sky was creating a triple shook barrier in front of the craft.  These shock barriers looked like extended sergeant stripes, but were colored an eerie Halloween green color.  These shock waves or whatever they were, did not touch the prow of the object (unlike a boat cutting through the water), but there was a clear gap between the last stripe and the object.   The object seemed to me to be flying high and at a good rate of speed.  I thought it might be a SR71.  There was a orange glow behind it too!  The four of us agreed that we saw: 1)  The perfect triangular stripes that were ahead of the craft--- they seemed like they  were breaking up the atmosphere in front of it and that they extended well beyond the craft itself; 2) There was an orange glow behind the craft.  We did disagree on what the craft looked like.  My dad said it was low and he could see engines.  I say it was high and fast and my brother agreed with me.  My mom sided more towards me and my brother&apos;s version.  My dad pulled the car over, but I could not get around my Grandmother to get out and I did not want to get out on the traffic side because I did not want to get hit by a passing car.  So all in all I did not see the craft at its best when it passed in front of our car up in the sky.  I still disagree with my dad to this day on about how high up and how fast it was going and what it looked like.  However I must give this to my dad and that he is somewhat far-sighted.  He saw buzz-bombs and Me 262s flying during WW11.  I have talked to several physics professors at both the University of Idaho and Washington State University and none of them could explain the affe! cts of the apparent shockwave.  I talked to the then Idaho professor Edson Peck  (he wrote the the standardized textbook for electomagnetic waves for college students---no one could write anything better than it for at least 10 years) and he said that the atmosphere is considered a liquid, but any wave effect would not be visible to the naked eye.  Later I read a Smithsonian Air and Space magazine and it said the same thing , but they included a photograph of a supersonic jet with similar sockwaves in front of it.  The big difference was that the waves were coming directly off the prow of the aircraft and not well before it.  Also the article said that only a high speed camera like the one they used could capture the shock-waves that were apparent in the photograph.  Also I can remember after we got home to Moscow we read in the next day&apos;s paper that many people reported an orange glowing object to the Sheriffs Dept. that services the Rosalia, WA area.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

He yelled out &quot;Oh my God come take a look at this.&quot; My mom and I were in the house and it sounded like an emergency so we ran as fast as we could too my dad. He was standing outside looking at the western hills. We looked in the direction he was looking and pointing and that&apos;s when we noticed a dark metallic disc shaped thing moving slowly towards us in a diagonal direction. The disc made no noise and there were no lights. It was flying lower than a commercial or millitary plane. It was at an altitude that most of the local pilots fly. We could see the disc clearly,there was nothing to hinder our view and there was plenty of light because it was before dusk. The object moved smoothly and slowly towards us. It eventually moved over us where it hovered above us for a few seconds. I had a clear view of its underside where I noticed once again that there were no lights, it was noiseless there were no evident engine noises. I also noticed that there were no windows or doors- if there were any I couldn&apos;t see them. After a few seconds the object then began to move in the same diagonal direction towards the eastern hills where after a few seconds of travel it suddenly sped away very quickly over the hills.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I opened the door, and she indicated that I follow her.  Once outside, I heard the horses in our pasture, and the cattle across the road just going nuts with fear, and all of the outside neighborhood dogs barking.  My dog was looking straight up, snarling, and had her fangs bared.  I looked up and saw a single green light.  I watched it for just a few seconds, then I looked down and said to my dog: &quot;I certainly hope you are seeing what I am seeing&quot;.  When I looked back up, the light was gone, the horses and dogs in the area were then quiet.  You have to understand that at that time, this was a very rural area.  The next day, I questioned a couple of neighbors, and none of them had heard anything.I was unable to determine how close this light was, there were no reference points, and there was absolutely no sound but for the animals.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "I saw a flying saucer hovering above me in the middle of the street.When I was eleven years old, my family was visiting my grandparents in Kansas (where I now live)during summer vacation.  The date I gave is an estimate, because I am not entirely sure what month it was, though we usually visited around the Fourth.  I am certain it was 1972, because I know I was eleven.  I also am not certain of the time, but it was early afternoon.My grandparents (mother&apos;s side)lived in a small house (where my parents now live) on the corner of a tree-lined street.  I was inside, in my grandparent&apos;s living room, when I heard the music from the ice cream truck in the general vicinity.  (I remember each of these details vividly because of what happened that day).  I begged my mother for money so I could go run after the truck and get an ice cream treat.  My mother was hurrying around to find me enough change, and as soon as I had it, I ran out the door.  As I was leaving my grandparent&apos;s house, I saw the ice cream truck driving up the street on the west side of their house, which ends up curving back around toward the northeast on the next block.  I hurried because the truck was going around the curve and I was afraid I wouldn&apos;t be able to catch it.As I was crossing the street, what I saw stopped me dead in my tracks and I completely forgot the ice cream truck.  Hovering right above me, at about tree-top level, was (what I later would tell everyone) a &quot;flying saucer&quot;.  The diameter of the saucer was about the same as the width of the street, which is a pretty narrow street, a little over the width of two cars.  It looked exactly like a flying saucer out of some horrible B movie.  It was metallic and exactly saucer shaped, and I was looking up at it, not directly underneath, but looking at it from about a 30 degree angle.  It seems weird, but I remember seeing what looked like rivets on the underside, but it all happened so quickly, I can&apos;t be sure about that.  Anyway, the &quot;saucer&quot; hovered above me, motionless and completely silent, for maybe five seconds, then before I had time to react in any way at all, it took off suddenly and &quot;zipped&quot; straight off to the northeast from the house.  It was gone from my sight in maybe two to three seconds.I can remember seeing it last as it just cleared the rooftop of the house across the street.  This detail is so vivid in my head, that I still think of that house as pink, as it was then.  (Now it is cream colored).  I then reacted, appropriately, I believe, and ran in the house screaming and hysterical.  I remember telling my mother &quot;Call the newspaper!  Call the newspaper!&quot;.  No one called anyone, because I guess they didn&apos;t know what to think of the whole thing.  My mother says now that I had told her at the time it had little blinking lights as well.  This event is still talked about in my family, &quot;I remember the day you saw the flying saucer&quot; and I get teased about it from my cousins to this day.  It has always been very frustrating for me, because it was broad daylight, and I never knew if anyone else saw it or not.  I wish I had had someone else with me that day, but anyway, it is all true.  When I hear &quot;experts&quot; say there is a logical explanation for all UFO&apos;s, I just think it is because they have never been witness to something like what I saw, or they wouldn&apos;t say such things.I am 42 now, and a mechanical engineer in the aircraft industry.  My father is also an engineer, very pragmatic and logical. He told me many years after my sighting (after his mother died...my other grandmother) that she used to look out her kitchen window across the pasture (they lived on a cattle ranch in Texas) and had several times seen &quot;saucers&quot; hovering above the field.  She told him and my grandpa and aunt about this, but my dad said she didn&apos;t want anyone else to know because she was afraid they would think she was crazy. (She was a very stern school teacher).  He only told me after she died.  My father has always believed me, as he did my grandmother.Anyway, that is my story.((NUFORC Note:  Date of event is approximate.

One late afternoon we were out and decided to drive by his Mother&apos;s house.  When we arrived, we spotted a telescope on her front porch aimed toward the sky.  Since she was a bit off the wall, my husband said, &quot;I don&apos;t even want to know what that&apos;s about&quot; and kept on driving.  A couple of days later his mother and sister who lived with the Mother came by for a visit. During the conversation they mentioned that they had been watching flying saucers and one was above our house.  They lived further up from us on Sunset Hill about a mile.  I told them that if they ever see these flying saucers again to please let us know because we want to see them also.  A couple of nights later at about 10:30 pm there was a terrible banging on our back door.  It was the Mother and sister saying that the flying saucer was out in front of our house.  So we all four ran out to see and sure enough, off toward the Magnolia neighborhood we could see something in the sky and it was coming our way.  It was round with a dome on top and had two or three different colored lights around the area where the dome met the saucer - it is hard after all this time to recall the color of the lights but to guess I&apos;d say they were red, green and white.

PD))", "Multi-colored orb sighting report, low, slow-movingThis orb sighting gave me the creeps.  I saw it on Sunday 4-13-2003, as I exited a building materials store in Gresham/ Wood Village, OR. It first appeared as a black speck above the near horizon, and stuck around eight minutes or so. It had no glow, at first appearing black or blue black. Then it started rotating emitting a clear gaseous substance around it, visible during the sighting and in photos. It then changed its rotation, now producing a yellow-green substance from the three near &quot;bulbs&quot; two red and one green in the photos sent to NUFORC. The sky condition was mottled with light and heavy dark rainclouds not too distant behind the orb, to the south.  The pictures are not enhanced except they are cropped to eliminate excess sky, reducing the photo file size. As it flew (slowly) out of sight heading north over the store it glowed phosphorescent green-yellow-red, changing its shape to a flat slightly inclined (pitched) disk.  Total distance the orb traveled in the eight minute sighting was about 1/2 to 3/4 mile.  I would say the height above ground was about 1300 feet or 1/4 mile, and this height did not change much, if any. The orb flew by overhead at what seemed maybe 2 mph, but was probably 6 mph after doing the math, when it wasn&apos;t hovering and rotating around end-for-end like a puppy chasing its tail. There appear to be two larger spheres (connected) from studying the pictures. Not only did it rotate end-for-end, it rotated on its own axis between the two larger spheres. It also morphed shape and color almost continuously.  The pictures I got while the orb parked directly overhead, for a short duration, were poor due to my using the camera&apos;s digital zoom, and possibly the wrong mode setting.  The camera was new and unfamiliar to me at the time. All photos and description as the orb was on approach, it appearing as a black speck, to its eventual departure are copied to NUFORC as they were imaged at time of the sighting. I wish that I had used the camera&apos;s movie mode, but did not think of it at the time due to the camera being new to me.  The camera is an Olympus C730 UltraZoom with 10x optical and 3x digital zoom.  Picture quality suffers with digital zoom, aside from hand-steadying problems too.  I wish it had a lens stabilizer. There were light aircraft flying in the area probably doing touch and go landings at the airport, but they did not try to chase or encounter the object.((NUFORC Note:  We have received the photos, and they indicate a tiny white speck against a blue sky with broken clouds.  The photos are ambiguous, we believe.  The object probably was more visible to the eye, than it is in the copied digital photos.  We do not know what the object was.  PD))", "I am a retired U.S. Border Patrol supervisor, having spent 37 years in the Border Patrol and INS.  I was a patrol agent in charge on both Canadian and Mexican borders for last 20 years of my career.  I was also a special agent for a time in San Francisco with the Office of Insector General, USDA.  I worked as head of intelligence unit for the Border Patrol, working as liaison officer with RCMP in Canada. I am not a flake.  I have had a couple of UFO sightings myself and have known several people over the past 40 years, many in law enforcement in different parts of the country who have told me credible UFO stories that they experienced.  I reported most of these to MUFON several years ago and in 1977 I was contacted in Indio, California where I was agent in charge of that station about a UFO sighting there. The UFO sighting that I refer to above was reported in the San Diego Union-Tribune and I contacted the reporter/columnist about what I saw after I read his story.  He plead with people who may have seen what he saw to call in or write him.  I called him and told him who I was and what I had seen.  He wanted me to go on the local TV station in San Diego and confirm what he had sighted as he felt I was the most credible of the 45 witnesses who had called him.  Another Border Patrol supervisor confirmed that he had seen the same UFO as he departed his apartment in East San Diego to come to work.  When I asked permission from my chief patrol agent to go onthe TV show I was told, &quot;you are not going to make the Border Patrol look like a bunch of nuts...permission denied.&quot;  The other supervisor acknowledged in front of the chief that he had seen it, also.  But when the chief made his statement to me, the other supervisor said, &quot;I am out of here...don&apos;t include me in this.&quot;  What I saw and described, and drew a diagram of, and can still vividly remember it and am able to draw a diagram, was a light that was travelling along a ridge along highway 94 as I drove west on that highway in the Tecate area.  I was going to San Ysidro to go to work at the Border Patrol sector HQ.  I was stationed and in charge of the Campo BP station at the time but had been detailed to work at the HQ for a month to fill in for a vacationing asst chief.  I had to negotiate highway 94 and try to watch the object at the same time.  But it must have moved along the mountain tops in what I thought was the Jamul area.  I was looking west towards SD and I saw a heavy bank of low clouds or fog which was not unusual in the early morning as one approached SD.  The light moved from behind the cloud bank and it had a conical beam that was extremely bright.  I thought at first it was one of our helicopters that was searching the ridge for illegal aliens in that arae.  But I found out that none of our helicopters were out at that time of the morning.  The beam was just too bright for a helicopter light and it could shine through the clouds almost as brightly as in front of them. I watched the light, and negotiated the highway, which is very curvy in that area, and I had to take my eyes off it from time to time.  The strange part was when I got to the bottom of highway 94 at Barrett Junction, i started back up the hill to the ridge where I thought the light had come from.  It was gone at that time.  I was very surprised when I topped the ridge in the Dulzura area, that there was no cloud bank and no fog.  It was very clear that morning and the city lights from San Diego could be seen plainly.  The incident went out of my mind until I read the newpaper article a couple of days later. The reporter told me, and wrote in the paper also, that there were 45 people who called him and reported almost the same thing as we had seen.  The other BP supv also confirmed that was what he saw, too, but he saw it further out to the west, probably over the ocean.  Some people who called the reporter were jogging on the beach and they saw it over the ocean and said there was a small airplane moving towards SD from the west over the sea and the UFO swallowed the plane in it&apos;s beam.  There was no official confirmation from the Navy or any govt agency. The one incident that I reported to MUFON...and my report should be on file with them from back around 1977 was something told to me.  This is a really wierd story but I believe it. In 1977 there was a story that came to me through a BP agent at my station in Indio that one of his classmates stationed at Alamogordo BP station (White Sands) had gotten into some real trouble.  It seems that he and another agent went onto the missile range that was south of Alamogordo.  I think it is called the McGregor missile range. Anyway, as it was reported to me, the two agents drove quite a ways down the range in their 4 wheel drive vehicle which they were not supposed to do.  If there were illgals walking up from the El Paso area, it was customary for the Air Police to pick them up and bring them out of the restricted area to the BP.  So, the guys were just going down to scope out the area and track aliens if there were any walking in the area. Quite a ways into the restricted area, they spotted what they thought was a small cone shaped mountain which looked strange to them.  It looked like a small volcano cone, as they described it.  They reportedly parked there vehicle and climbed up the cone shaped mountain which wasn&apos;t too high, but I was not told how high it was.  When they got to the top they could look down into the crater part and saw a flying saucer parked in the bottom being attended by Air Force personnel.  They apparently realized they were seeing something they shouldn&apos;t and they crept back down the hill and got out of the area. AFter work, that afternoon the two agents are reported to have met some other agents and people in a local tavern where they guys hung out, and after a couple of beers they started telling the others what they had seen in the restricted area.  AS the story goes, it was not very long when a couple of men in &quot;black suits&quot; showed up, showed their IDs and requested the two agents accompany them, to what is assumed an office at White Sands base. As the story goes, they were debriefed, their agent in charge of the station was called in, and the two were immediately transferred to other duties with a day, and admonished in strong terms not to tell what they had seen. The agent in charge of the station was an very old friend of mine whom I worked with as partners in Carlsbad, NM for 5 years.  He passed away of cancer last year.  I called him on the phone and relayed the story as I had heard it and asked him if it was true.  We were using a government phone line.  He was an ex-Marine, very patriotic person, and the way in which he answered me led me to believe that it was true.  In a very measured voice he replied, &quot;Don&apos;t know anything about it...never happened.&quot;  And he made no further comment.  He left me to believe that he would not discuss the subject any further. Some years later, after I had retired, another retired agent in charge and I stopped by this retired agent&apos;s home in Alamogordo.  This was in about 1995.  We were having a couple of drinks and I reminded him of the call I had made to him about the UFO incident in 1977.  I asked him if he remembered my call.  He said he did.  I then asked him again...&quot;We are all retired now, you can tell me the truth about the UFO thing.&quot;  He looked at me, and in almost identical words and same measured tone, &quot;Don&apos;t know anything about it...never happened.&quot;  That told me that he definitely knew and that he had been sworn to secrecy never to tell..probably by the people at White Sands.  His ex-wife was a long time government employee, a secretary and she worked at White Sands.  So there were reasons that he could not talk.  He was the kind of person, had he been sworn to secrecy about a national security issue, he would take it to his grave...which he did.  But he let me know in his answer that it happened.  That was my take on it. The investigator from MUFON was very interested in that story alone.  He didn&apos;t seem to be interested in any of the other things that I had seen or had relayed to me. When I was stationed in Carlsbad, NM in the early sixties there were UFO stories all over the place.  There were some vivid sightings by state policemen.  One, who was station at Alamogordo even took out his accident investigation camera and took photos of a flying saucer that had landed off the highway early in the morning, only to have the men in black suits from White Sands confiscate his film.  He personally told me about that incident.  That happened in about 1962 or thereabouts. I heard about another incident involving a state police officer driving north of White Sands when his car went dead.  Everything electrical on it went dead, according to him...no radio no anything.  He got out and walked a little down the highway and every other vehicle was dead along side the highway also. He walked back to his patrol car, got in and after a few minutes everything came back on and all the other cars were starting up a moving.  He said that someone told him that they were conducting some kind of experiments at White Sands but he couldn[t find out exactly what it was. Strangely enough, part of our working area out of Carlsbad was Roswell and the ranch area to the west.  We contacted the air police people at the air base there which was still a SAC base and we never heard a word about the July, 1947 incident during that time.  But there were some other strange things that went on around the SAC base in those days. In about 1964 my partner and I were driving up to Clovis, NM to pick up some aliens that were in custody.  We had left Carlsbad abou 4am because it was a long round trip drive.  We passed through Roswell while it was still dark, and as we turned on to the highway to Portales, about 2 miles up the highway we ran into a state police roadblock.  There were two state police officers that we knew and they stopped us.  As I remember we were the only car stopped there.  They came over, and I was driving.  My partner (the same man who was in Alamogordo in 1977 that said &quot;never happened&quot;) was working with me.  We asked what was going on because there were helicopters flying over the sand hills there, and jeeps moving all around on the sand dunes.  They had spot lights and were obviously looking for something. The state police said, since we were federal officers and had security clearances, they could tell us what was going on.  They said that the Air Force people told them that one of the Atlas missiles in a silo (there were about 20 missile silos that ringed the base and Roswell) had &quot;accidentally&quot; been fired and it had a nuclear warhead on it.  They said they were told the missile was able to rip through part of the covering steel and concete doors on the silo, and that the nuclear warhead had flown off it and landed somewhere in the area and they were frantic because they could not find it. After we sat there for a few minutes, they finally told us to drive on through since we were in a marked patrol vehicle, and we did.  We were warned if we saw anything laying in the road not to get near it.  We drove through, seeing all kinds of AF vehicles prowling over the sand dunes with search lights, and drove on to Portales and Clovis. About a month later we saw one of the same state policemen in their Roswell office and remembered the missile incident.  We asked him what had happened.  He said that the AF told them that they had located the warhead somewhere back east...I think Cleveland.  they said that an old Indian was dying in a hospital from radiation poisoning.  The AF people said that they figured someone had stopped and picked up the warhead when it landed in the highway, put it in their car and drove away with it. They said that is what the old Indian told them.  He had seen it on the highway, stopped and put it in the trunk of his car and drove to Cleveland, getting sick about two weeks later. The story didn&apos;t really make much sense to us but that was what the AF said.  We also heard that one other silo had been blown up by and accidental missile shooting in it.  I recently heard some retired AF captain or something talking about how the missile silos (around Roswell, I believe) were harrassed by UFOs and there had been some major accidents in the silos caused by the UFOs.  I always wondered if that wasn&apos;t what really happened that morning and that the AF gave a cover story about the warhead being stolen by and old Indian. It was strange because had an Atlas missile been shot off in a silo, the crew in the control room down under would have been killed or something.  We never heard a word about anything like that.  It was a very strange incident that has always stuck in my mind. There are other stories that I have heard over the years from other officers, but am getting writers cramps right now. I enjoyed hearing you on the radio tonight as on occasions before.  Keep up the good work.  I will bet that your job is fascinating.((name deleted))((city deleted)), New Mexico((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

But just shortly after I noticed it, it stopped moving, started moving fast in opposite direction and then back the original direction, very slow this time yet noticable. It didn&apos;t flicker as much either, it became a steady light. That definitely caught my attention. Two jetliners passed in the sky and they didn&apos;t look anything like this object. The jetliners also flew lower than this object, excluding the possibility it was a distant helicopter. I was staring at this object for a long time, making sure I wasn&apos;t looking at a planet, star or a &apos;roid. It was much brighter than any object, except for the moon and those jetliners. It appeared the light was not generated though, but rather a reflection from a spherical object - maybe caused by the bright moon. The reflection was brightest in the direction of the moon and then faded away sharply around a sphere-like edge - a faint crescent similar to a 1% new moon, with a bright spot like that sometimes seen with a solar eclipse. The color at its brightest spot was an off-white/yellow. The crescent was darker, almost turning into a dark red before it completely faded away. The crescent, albeit faint, was rather large. About half the size of an actual crescent moon, which kind of dazzled me because this object must have been rather large if it were fully exposed. That really convinced me it couldn&apos;t have been a planet or star. I went inside because it was getting too cold for me, but when I came back outside about 1 1/2 hour later out of curiosity, it was gone. Spent a good long time staring at it though and it certainly got me amazed!", "Black cloud vortex appears, and I lose tens minutes of time that I cannot account for.On friday I was driving to Pensacola Fl to visit my parents...I live in Vernon, which is about an hour and a half away...When I was close to Milton, FL I saw a strange black moving cloud in the sky...Now keep in mind that it was a beautiful sunshiny day...it was about three pm...the cloud seemed to be moving like a vortex...When I saw it I could not take my eyes off of it...The next thing I remember is crossing the bridge on the interstate going into pensacola...I lost TEN minutes...I do not even remember driving those ten minutes...My daughter was with me, but she was asleep during all of this.....Could this be an abduction?", "at 45 deg angle 10 mi. south of post office in cliffside. moveing east to west almost as fast as you could turn your head. almost dark,white ball was thought to be plain from charlotte n.c. to atlanta with take off lights on, after it passed it was still a white ball, watched as it came from east to west thein out of site.", "In the sky over my head 2 bright white disk shaped objects that seemed to be chasing each other just playing around.

It was travelling fast, i figured it must of been travelling at least at mach speed or probably more cos judging by looking at the normal jets in the sky, the jets cant compare in terms of speed!!!!!!!

Rest Area janitor coroborates sightingMy friend and I were driving in my friend&apos;s pickup truck on the highway about 50 miles or so outside of Fort Wayne, Indiana.  It was a quiet night and no traffic on the road and we&apos;re just coasting along.  Suddenly, my friend pointed up at the sky.  &quot;My God,&quot; he said. &quot;That&apos;s a UFO.  Look up there.&quot;  I put my head out the window and sure enough, there was this big black triangular, maybe closer to a boomerang-shaped ship hovering directly overhead.  It was low, too. Maybe 40, 50, feet.  Not even as high up as a trapeze act act in a circus. On the underside there was a bright red light on one side and a green light on the other side.  Both lights flashed alternately and kind of fast. There was no sound whatsoever.  Then all of a sudden, it swooped up at full speed from its stationary hovering positiion.  I mean, it didn&apos;t start slow and accelerate.  As soon as it moved it was already at full speed.  It went in a parabolic arc to a positiion about three miles away but much higher up in the sky, still in full sight and it was a clear night anyways.  So I never lost sight of the thing. It couldn&apos;t have taken more than two seconds maybe less to travel that tremendous distance.  Then it just stopped for a few microseconds and hovered there.  Then it flew really fast in a total reversal of direction and diappeared from sight.  I was dumbfounded as was my friend. We both knew there was no technology on Earth, and neither Russia nor America was anywhere close to the kind of maneuvering that we had just seen.  The silent hovering, the speed, the abrupt stop, no deceleration either, it just stopped dead, then the reversal of direction again at a phenominal speed, again no acceleration, it just took off at full speed, flew across the length of the sky and was gone. &quot;We can never mention this to anyone,&quot; I said to my friend.  He agreed. We were both so rattled that we pulled into the first rest-area we came to.  As we got out of the truck, the little old guy, apparently the caretaker or  janitor, walked right over to us.  &quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;did you boys see the UFO?&quot;  My friend and I had just promised each other we wouldn&apos;t ever speak of it to anybody but here is this guy talking about it. &quot;Yes,&quot; I said, I was really relieved that someone else had seen it. &quot;Did you see it, too?&quot;  &quot;Oh, Yeah,&quot; he said, &quot;Its been around here for a couple of hours now.  The sheriff was just here and he got a call. Went over to a local farm where they saw it flying around over their fields.&quot;  It was about 28 ago and I haven&apos;t mentioned it to very many people and the one&apos;s that I have mentiioned it to, either don&apos;t believe me or else tell me about their own experience.  But nobody else has the kind of corroboration that my friend and I had. That is all I can remember.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "Continuous Fireworks in the sky near Arlington, WAAll I can say is that when we first noticed it, it looked like fireworks. But what made us curious was that when you see fireworks, they go up explode, and then eventually burn out. Whatever this was went up, down, back up again, then back down again, with no discernable pattern, and changing colors and brilliance the whole time. We were on our way back to Bellingham, WA from Seattle after watching The Seattle Mariners. I am pretty confident about the date but the time could be off by an hour(later). We were traveling on Interstate 5 and were just north of Marysville when we first noticed it. We watched in amazement for about 5 minutes before it went behind some trees, as we were traveling about 65 m.p.h. When we got to where we thought it would be visible again, we saw nothing.", "3 people in Abilene, TX observe star-like object performing normally physically impossible maneuvers in night sky.I had been sitting on the front porch here in Abilene, Texas, in July of 95, with my wife and one of my employees, enjoying a pleasant conversation, when I decided to walk out to the end of our sidewalk to stretch my back and legs, leaving them chatting on the couch on the front porch.Once I reached the end of the sidewalk, I looked up and noticed how bright and beautiful the stars were, so, it being such a nice, warm summer evening, I decided to lay on my back on the end of the sidewalk, and to watch the stars for awhile.After laying there for only a few minutes, I thought I saw something move out of the corner of my eye, up in the sky, perhaps a shooting star, so I moved my gaze over to where I thought I saw it.   After only a few seconds, I saw a &quot;star&quot; suddenly start to move in a very birarre pattern, in an area about the size of a silver dollar, held at arm&apos;s length.  It moved within that area for about 10 to 30 seconds, then stopped.   When I looked away from it, and then looked back, it looked so much like any other star, that I could not differentiate it from any other star I had been seeing, so much so that I couldn&apos;t even tell if I was looking at the object that had moved, or if I was seeing a star.When the &quot;star&quot; moved, it did not accelerate the way everything else I had ever seen had; and when it came to a stop, it did not slowly decelerate, either.  When it moved, it was instantly going full speed, and when it stopped, it just stopped.  There was no speeding up or slowing down.  It was either moving at full speed, or it wasn&apos;t.   And when it turned or changed direction, it did not do so with a curving movement; it just suddenly changed directions, often changing it&apos;s direction of movement 45, 90, even 180 degrees, going back the direction it had come from! After performing these &quot;movements&quot; for 30 seconds or so, it would stop for about that same length of time, and then start moving again.After seeing that happen a couple of times, the reality of what I was seeing, that I was definately seeing a genuine UFO, so overwhelmed me, that I actually wondered if I was losing my mind!  So much so that it actually scared me! I needed someone else to tell me if they were seeing this too, so I got up and, unbelievably calmly and quietly asked my wife if she would mind walking out to the end of the sidewalk with me.   She did, and when we got to the end of the walk, I turned my back to where Pete was up on the porch, 40 feet away, and told her, &quot;Honey, I want to ask you something, and when you answer me, no matter what you have to say or how you feel, I want you to WHISPER your answer to me, and I don&apos;t want you to make ANY kind of movements with your arms or hands, or even your head, that Pete can see from up there on the porch.  In fact, I am going to stand with my body between you and Pete, and if you have any pointing to do, be sure my body is between the two of you so that he cannot see you. (I am a full head taller than her, and wider.)  Do you understand?&quot; She said yes, so without looking up or pointing, I told her, &quot;I want you to look up into the sky, where the stars are, right directly above my head, but do it very casually to where Pete won&apos;t notice, and I want you to tell me if you see anything unusual, but remember!  Do not SAY or do anything that Pete could hear or see.&quot; I stood very, very close to her, doing my best to block Pete&apos;s view of her, and she began to search the sky above us.  After about 20 seconds she started to say, &quot;Honey, I don&apos;t know what you&apos;re wanting me to see, cause I&apos;m not seeing anything...&quot;, and just as the last word was leaving her mouth, I saw her eyes get big, and a very excited, stunned look come on her face, and knew she had seen it too, so I very quickly whispered, &quot;shhhhh! Don&apos;t say it! Whisper it in my ear!&quot; I leaned over and put my ear close to her mouth, and she whispered, with trembling and excitement in her voice:  &quot;A star!  There&apos;s a STAR moving around in a very weird way!  It&apos;s zipping around, changing directions, and not speeding up or slowing down!&quot;  I told her, &quot;take my hand, and with your finger, trace out the pattern that it is making.&quot;  And she drew the exact patterns on my hand that I had seen the &quot;star&quot; make.With great relief, having been reassured that I was not going insane, I whispered &quot;thank you&quot; to her, and told her that I was going to call Pete out and go through the same thing with him, and for her to be very careful not to give him any verbal or visual ques whatsoever as to what we had seen, or what we wanted him to look for.To make a long story short, I repeated this same &quot;test&quot; with Pete, and he too, went through almost the same exact stages that my wife had gone through; at first not seeing anything, and then the sudden realization that he, too, was seeing something like nothing else he had ever seen in his life! We watched that object for a couple of hours, as it performed &quot;maneuvers&quot; in a certain area of the sky, about the size of a silver dollar held at arm&apos;s length, and then, after doing that for several minutes, it would suddenly make a &quot;long jump&quot; over to another part of the sky, where it would repeat the same or similar maneuvers that we had seen it do, in the location it had just left.We all feel absolutely sure that this object was a long ways outside of any atmosphere surrounding our planet, and while it certainly appeared to actually be as far away as the stars themselves, especially when the objected stopped, I realize it was probably actually between the earth and the stars, probably far closer to earth, than to the stars, although when the craft stood still, it looked so much like all the stars, that there was NO way you could tell if you were looking at a star, or at the craft!  (I have a feeling that this was deliberate on the part of &quot;some body!&quot;) We watched it for perhaps two hours, during which time it slowly made it&apos;s way from almost straight overhead, to towards the southeast.  (My wife says it moved towards the southWEST.)  We watched it for so long that we could no longer stay awake, having all of us put in a hard work week, and seeing that it was apparently going to do nothing but continue what we had been seeing it do for the past two or three hours, my wife and I went in and to bed, and Pete went home.   Even now, years later, we still sometimes watch for it to reappear, as we are sure and hope that it will.Since then, I visit endless websites and listen to Coast To Coast AM and other programs almost every single day, hoping to hear about others who have seen a similar object, and every now and then, I do!   In fact, I read of someone seeing what is apparently the same exact object, only YESTERDAY, October 16, 2003, on the National UFO Reporting website, and so I felt prompted to also post my report of this similar sighting.In conclusion, I&apos;d like for it to be known that I am 50 years old, that I was born on an Air Force Base, that I have been a student pilot, and have attended dozens of air shows, and have watched many television programs about air craft, but I have never, ever seen anything that could even remotely do the kinds of things that this craft did!   Unless the pilot of the vehicle had some kind of survival gear light years ahead of anything we have now, there is no way a human could have survived the instantaneous application of g-forces that were obviously applied to the body of the vessel&apos;s pilot, (if it even had one!)   And obviously, the craft itself had to be light years ahead of anything we have now.Having been a communications technician, and always being strongly interested in these kinds of things, I would dearly love to have the opportunity to work with, and hopefully even to take a ride in, one of these vehicles, some day! PS: Abilene is the home of Dyess Air Force Base, the home of the B1 bomber, and this incident happened about 3 miles from the base, but over East Abilene, not over the base.

I noticed nine shining objects in the sky (I was facing East and they would have been located between 45 and 90 degrees up, left of center vision area.  The top three were further distance apart. I looked away to see if anyone else was around, when I looked back up the object on the far right was now on the far left. Three in the center we very close together and one of those three looked very red, about three others appeared to be reddish on the right side - I think that was from reflecting the evening sun, which was behind me. Three of the objects moved to the right. One that was moving form a perfect rectangle to the three that were close together, then kept moving to the left. They did not move like airplanes or other known aircraft. Five of them did not appear to be moving. They were so high up that I could not tell exacctly what they were or exactly how they were shaped. At first I expected whatever they were to be moving closer to the earth (gravity), but it happened in the opposite way. Slowly they began to fade away, as if moving further out into space.  Two remained slightly visible for several more minutes.  They looked like sparkling stars, except it was broad daylight and there were no clouds in the sky. It was much too elaborate to be military - they were too far away and too stationery for too long.", "Flashing, skipping lights from a disc shaped object moving extremely fast in Kansas City.My two friends and I were driving south on State Line Road about 85th Street and a friend pointed northeast and said to look at the lights. I saw lights far in the distance that were red, blue and white.  I couldn&apos;t tell the shape of the object, all you saw were the motion of the lights, but you could watch the way the lights moved. The movement of the lights made it appear as if it was disc shaped.It moved in a circle around the horizon at incredible speeds, around the circumfrence of the city.  It appeared to be skipping up, down, forwards and backwards. It did two counter-clockwise diamond shaped patterns in a row on an unseen path while the lights were flashing.  That is the way it seemed to move; by skipping to a new location, sometimes in short distances, and sometimes at extreme distances. It flashed and skipped to a new point in the sky, then in a flash it skipped back to the same spot. This was all happening below the cloud level. It seemed to have no set destination to its path. It would go backwards (farther away from us) and close again. We lost it in the trees for about 30 seconds because it was so low. We followed it to I-435 and it was south of the highway and then it seemed to cross back across the highway again. It was moving so fast that it seemed it could have gone across the state and back in a few seconds. There was no sound coming from it. It moved like no object I had ever seen before.  Maybe the lights only appearred to flash because of its skipping.", "light formation in san bernardinomy friend and I were on agua mansa and we were talking about how the air felt weird, eeire... and there were 3 lights that were moving around in big circle formation-uniform speed and it seemed like when they crossed paths their lights would get brighter and kind of more compact-at first they were softer looking...but got brighter and more intense with each circular rotation(all 3 went in opposite directions, but  joined together at one point...at least one light was kind of blue and one was yellowish.)

At about 4 am we were awakened because we had lost electricity and it was very hot inside the hotel room. We opened the balcony door and sat there a while. Soon my daughter noticed that the valley overlooking the balcony was lit up by a pale white light. It was like a dull white floroscent glow. Soon it faded out and we were confused. Then we noticed that a &apos;star&apos; was moving overhead. It was fast but not as fast as a shootng star. At first we thought it was an aircraft but then realized that aircrafts have blinking/strobe lights. This was a star moving at high speed. Then we noticed another big star moving left to right slowly. Again this was hard to believe but then we noticed that as compared to other starts in that area this was the only one moving. Soon this bright star lost its light and faded away. After a lot of thought, discussion and debates I am convinced that this was a sighting of two UFOs.

The ceiling fan above me was not on. I have five small dogs two were out (out meaning having run of the house) the others were in their sleeping crates. Well the story just about ends here because I saw nothing. Here is what did happen I awoke sometime in the midmorning with all the dogs sleeping as close to my head neck area as they could muster, I was VERY groggy but was stunned to see the ceiling fan going faster than it is designed to go. I mean it was spinning wildly almost as if it would spin right off the ceiling. Still groggy and having to go to the bathroom I stood and went to the hall at which point I notice the swamp cooler was not on (I keep it on 24 hours a day) I went to switch on the hall light and got no response I looked at the swamp cooler switch and it was on. Almost forgot to mention TV was off though on when I fell asleep also I live alone.Returning from the bathroom I picked up to cordless phone and it didn&apos;t work went to the other phone and same thing.  The cable box above the TV no longer showed the time which is constant and contolled by the cable company. I felt, not sick, but like my ying and yang were off. Just out of sorts. I called my mom and arranged to go have lunch.I went out to the fuse box to flip the switch thinking something broke the circut. But there were no switches down. Flipped them all anyway. Once inside nothing came back on. Except the ceiling fan. Went to meet my mom and before I got out of the car looked in the mirror and noticed brown dried stuff from my ear down the side of my face. It was obviously dried blood. I asked my mom after cleaning area to look inside my ear she said I must have cut myself because there was a mark inside the ear. Well I don&apos;t pick or scratch at my ear and the amount of blood that had poured out was mu! ch much more than a fingernail scratch could produce. When I saw my mom she said she had been concerned because she had tried calling and the machine didn&apos;t pick up and after two days she grew worried.....TWO DAYS?? &quot;What do you mean two days Mom I just saw you yesterday! &quot;No that was two days ago this being the third day&quot;  I am dumbfounded I slept for two full days and two full nights. Impossible!!! I would at least awaken to go to the bathroom but didn&apos;t. When I got home I called an electrical contractor friend who came out and said there was nothing wrong with the fuses and that power was still coming to the house. He couldn&apos;t figure out what was wrong. This is an electrical contractor! I felt to crummy to deal with this. So I left the house and went to a friends house and then to feed my horse. When I got home the swamp cooler was on and working as was the hall light. The tv and cable box were not on I found a few outlets that had power and plugged the tv and cable box in and much to my surprise found that they were &quot;fried&quot; as was both phones answering machine and get this the surge protector!! Fried! None of my neighbors had their power out and SDG&amp;E said there was no spike in my area. That is all I am quite curious as to what caused this and if my ear and sleeping for a stunning two full days and nights are at all related. It is noteworthy to mention I do not take drugs and do not drink. Any insight? I am perplexed.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "((NUFORC Note:  Date, we believe, should be December 09, 1965, the date of the event at Kecksburg, PA.  We have amended the date above.  PD))I Saw The Kecksberg UFO!  It was a warm December night in 1965.  I was 14 years old and my cousin John was 12 years old as we left my house to sneak a few cigarettes down the alley.  We lived in the suburban community of Bridgeville; 12 miles southwest of downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  We came to this lithographic building which had a loading dock in the back.  It was the perfect place to sit and smoke in secret.  We knew we had to leave soon.  The time was getting late into the evening.  But, before we made our way back to my house:  Something pierced the night&apos;s sky over my left shoulder.  Our heads turned to the left and our eyes could not help but notice a bright ball of light!  Both John and I were stunned.  Our mouths dropped.  The object was about the size of a full moon and it trailed sparks or little bits of light.  The odd thing about it was the thing did not fall straight down.  The UFO went laterally; sideways; almost up!  Whatever this was...it could not have been a meteor.  A shooting star (or space debris) falls down.  A natural object does not move horizontally.  Meteors do not go up. There was no sound.  We could not tell its distance from us since the object appeared just like a big dot of light.  This was no saucer with lights or any kind of features.  The entire sighting lasted for approximately 5 seconds.  Then, the object passed over the southern hill; behind the trees of what was called Cook School hill. John and I immediately reacted.  We ran to my house very excited.  My father, an old skeptic, thought we were crazy.  UFOs were not a part of his belief-system.  Nevertheless, I convinced him to drive us up to the top of the hill and check to see if anything came down there.  At the time, my cousin and I thought the thing could have hit somewhere around Cook School.  My father humored us and drove us around.  We saw nothing strange.  This convinced my dad that there was nothing to this UFO business.  &apos;Ah, UFOs&apos; he would say and had a good laugh at my expense. Thirty-eight years had passed.  I don&apos;t smoke cigarettes anymore.  I had seen a number of UFOs in my life.  When looking back at the past, I almost did not put this experience in with those other unexplainables.  Probably, the reason was it did resemble a close meteor fall.  I assumed this was merely a natural event and was nothing extraterrestrial. Very recently, on television&apos;s Sci-Fi Channel, they showed previews of &apos;Kecksberg Exposed.&apos;  This was a 2-hour special hosted by Bryan Gumball.I looked forward to this because they were calling it the &apos;new Roswell&apos; and it happened in the Pittsburgh area; my home town.  Minutes into the show, my mouth dropped (as it did 38 years ago) and I said &apos;Oh, my freaking God.&apos;  I saw the Kecksberg UFO!  I certainly should have heard of this event and I&apos;m a little ashamed that I&apos;m not that up on UFO history.  Actually, I&apos;m glad that I didn&apos;t put 2 and 2 together before this point because that would have lessened the revelation that occurred during the documentary.  The most compelling factors in the show that led me to conclude I saw it was:  1) This was the time I had my sighting; late one warm December night in 1965.  2)  Kecksberg is 25 miles southwest of Pittsburgh; Bridgeville is 12 miles southwest of Pittsburgh.  The object moved south and it appeared to us to pass over the southern hill.  3) The UFO, according to all reports, did look similar to a meteor. In an old newsreel film, an interviewer asked a very young Kecksberg resident:  &apos;What did it look like?&apos;  The boy answered:  &apos;A star on fire.&apos;  A street in the small farming town of Kecksberg was named METEOR Street because of this encounter with the object.  People who were able to get a good look at it said that it was acorn-shaped.  An acorn monument was erected in the town and stands to this day. The first reports came out of Canada and the thing in the night&apos;s sky continued southward.  The UFO buzzed the Pittsburgh area and turned...which, of course, indicates that it was not a natural phenomena.  Thousands of reports flooded into news agencies.  KDKA received hundreds of calls alone.  If I was only mature enough, I would have searched through newspapers the next day.  This would have told me that my cousin and I were not alone in our observation. Kecksberg was another Roswell because the military was dispatched.  Oncemore...government agents, soldiers, Men in Black converged on a small American town.  Guns were pointed at citizens; people&apos;s lives were threatened; there were &apos;radiation&apos; scares; and authorities told people to lie.  People witnessed that federal &apos;suits&apos; seemed to give orders to the military. This convergence of government officials does not happen when a meteor falls to Earth.  Of course, there are those that will say the Kecksberg UFO was a piece of Soviet intelligence...and that was the reason for military intervention.  The same was said about Roswell. A large, flatbed truck was seen entering the wooded area where the thing seemed to come to a soft landing.  The truck was empty when it went in and covered when it left.  To this day, the Kecksberg controversy rages on as townspeople are divided as to what really occurred.  Some deny the fallen object and that feds made any appearance at all.  Others claim to have had been in direct contact with government intimidation. This writer is very pleased that something did happen at Kecksberg.  I wish my father was alive so I could tell him that I was not crazy.  Or...look dad; there are many others that are just as crazy as I am.

The craft was shaped like a saucer. The lights on the object initially caught my eye. There were 10 to 20 lights in rows across the middle of the saucer. They were fairly dim and slowly changing in color. The colors were light green, light brown, light orange, and yellow. I immediatly knew that it was something that I&apos;d never seen before. The speed in which it moved was very deceiving. It slowly moved higher in the sky in front of me and just when it was almost out of sight, I witnessed a solid ray of light shoot from the object up in to the sky an connect to a brightly glowing object that was fixed in the sky. Then the object seemed to follow the ray of light up closer to the bright light and finally disappeared. When it was gone, to my surprise, the bright light remained because it was what appeared to be a star.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Our home was high above the city and the back yard looked out on rolling hills of farm land.  We were trying to move some articles, after work, before the big move on Saturday.  As I brought in a load, my wife asked &quot;Is that a UFO&quot;.  She was standing at the sliding glass doors in the kitchen, looking out above the hills in the back yard. I saw a disc shaped object off to the East, Southeast.  It seemed to have multicolored lights rotating around the perimeter, red, green, blue, and yellow as I remember.  There was also a very bright spot light shining directly down from the craft.  I really couldn&apos;t give a very accurate description of the size or distance, but my best guess would be that the object was about the size of a small plane, say 50 ft in diameter and possibly 1 to 2 miles away.  There was no noticable sound which I would have expected with a helicopter or plane.  This area is very quiet, and having served in Vietnam, I am quite familiar with the sounds of helicopters. I got my binoculars and watched the craft until my wife said, &quot;We need to finish unloading the Van&quot;.  On each trip back in the house, I would again go into the back yard and look at the craft.  I think it just started moving then moved away real fast and disappeared.  In the following two years that I lived in that house, I spent many evenings in the back yard and never again saw anything remotely like this disc. A few years later I tried looking up any information that might have been reported in the local paper.  I found none.  Roughly three years ago a local radio talk show host mentioned he saw a UFO when he lived in Santa Paula, which is roughly East, Southeast of Ventura.  The time period sounded about the same. About four years after the incident I was talking to an ex next door neighbor.  She mentioned that there had been a UFO sighting in that area and that she had gone to pick up her daughter at an evening church class.  Something above the car shinded a light so bright on her car, that she had to pull over to the side of the road until the light went out. At the time of the sighting, I had been a mechanic at a local dealership for about 8 years.  My wife was a technologist in the medical field, and the neighbor was the wife of a local doctor.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was just 17 years old and it was in Rio de Janeiro, June 1970. When the weather was nice, I and my friends used to go a suburb named Barra da Tijuca.  In the 70s, Barra as we called it, had just a bunch of houses in its first 15 miles of unspoiled beach (now the place is full of luxury skyscrapers). As everybody else, we bowled, laughed and had a wonderful time with our girlfriends in front of a paradisiacal beach. Close to the beginning there was a biological marine reserve with barbed wire fences at both sides of the beach road. There is also a nice restaurant at the Marisco rock, at the end of the 15-mile long beach. One day however, on Friday or Saturday of the week before my 18th birthday, I was driving my girl home in my blue Opala Chevrolet from this restaurant a little after 3 AM. We were speeding fast on the bumpy beach side road to arrive at the girl&rsquo;s home before her mother woke up. I was singing happily while listening to the radio and seeing the beautiful night sky with a full moon and bright stars. I was totally unconcerned while my yellow high light beams vanished the darkness ahead of us. When we started crossing the marine reserve with its fences, the radio suddenly started to give static and went completely off. I thought it was just because of a bump on the pavement. Then, the road lights also went off in a sequence of stretches, blackening out the entire beach, but this was not unusual at that year in Rio. However, to my total surprise, seconds later both headlights also went off entirely, and the ENGINE stopped!  That was something else ! We still had half a gas tank, and I felt it very strange that a motor could stop at such speed ! I had never heard of such a thing!  I hit the brakes at once and they worked perfectly (mechanic drums) while trying not to leave the road, as we were going damn fast. Since the road was perfectly straight and there were no close trees, only the beach on the right side and the long lagoon and vegetation about 150 feet on our left side, I managed to stop safely at the side of the road. Both of us were a little startled, but I dropped from the car to see if the tires had suffered any damages, but they were intact. I tried to start the engine, but it refused to go and more - there was no sign of electricity whatsoever. This puzzled me as everything had been working perfectly. I checked the circuits, cables and connections using a cigarette lighter but everything seemed OK. Well, we were stuck in the middle of nowhere, with a small chance of getting mugged, robbed or worse. I walked around to see if there was any house or lights approaching, but we were entirely alone. A wind started and I looked up to the sky, but it seemed to me that it was going to rain as I could no longer see the stars. A big round black cloud was just in top of us and I could already feel some cold and electricity in the air, just like before some storms - but the sky had not a single cloud moments before! Well, what a bad luck !  We first stayed outside near a tree, so that if a burglar came he would not find us, but as no car appeared for 10 minutes, we decided to get into the car, get some shelter and relax. The last time I looked at my clock it was about 3:30 AM. It seemed to me that I had dozed for a while, when I woke up suddenly with a loud noise coming from shaking fences, the girl screaming at my right, and a super-bright beam of light - so bright in fact, I thought it was the highlights of a motorcycle gang. The girl immediately complained from a strong headache and eye strain, but I could barely see and was not able to do nothing besides hugging her at that moment. When the lights diminished I got out of the car. First I looked around and could see the barbed wire fences stopping to shake and shivered. How strange was all that! Then I looked up to see the cloud, and noticed that the black cloud now had bright colored lights shining in a circle over us. At that time very few people cared or worried about flying saucers, and my mind was in beautiful girls not UFO&rsquo;s. I guess that as I do not remember seeing people then, but a huge shape, I did not realize I was seeing a flying saucer but rather something very unusual. I met something unexpected and felt uneasy, dizzy, confused, a little scared but I do not know why, I was not in any way terrified, paralyzed or the like. We noticed that the lights were splitting from half sides of the circle to meet at their opposite sides, going back and forth, I had a very, very strong feeling of being closely observed, tried to run back but felt suddenly weak, stumbled but continued to the car. I found the girl trembling and, ridiculously enough, we both yelled at those lights to get off. It took them a long time (10 minutes?) to leave. Then, the cloud literally exploded in light, and slowly got high in the sky above us. It took a few seconds at uniform speed to reach the beginning of the 15-mile long beach stretch (we were near the middle), and then it propelled itself to the beginning and then upwards in the direction of the open sea with a tremendous acceleration to become just a point in the sky, and join two other points. Minutes later, the beach road lights went on again, I could start the engine in the first try, the radio was OK, and we could finally get home. I could never talk to the girl again. Her mother was really worried (read pissed off) since she had to go to the hospital because her right eye had been severely injured - her retina suffered burns and seemed to have &quot;dripped&quot; in the white sclera area. I myself had a very strong headache for almost two weeks but it went off. Months later however, I started having strong &quot;surges of energy&quot; throughout my body (I still do), have some odd dreams, premonitions and feel like floating at night (I still do sometimes). Strangely enough, for some reason (mental block, innocence ?) I can recollect fear but no panic at any moment, besides people made fun every time I tried to tell them what had occurred, so my mind repressed what happened as &quot;unimportant,&quot; and I did not made any effort to remember it clearly until fifteen years ago, during a spiritualist meeting. Spiritualists are a different kind of people who always look to expand the truth - like it or not. As strange is the fact that, thirty years later, I got acquainted with a good friend of my wife, ((male&apos;s name deleted)), that has my own age and is also an engineer, and passed through a very similar experience in the very same week, in almost the same circumstances, and also suffered from similar after effects! He even told me the UFO had been detected by the Navy radars, Rio&rsquo;s traffic air controllers, and even noted on the news. I can&rsquo;t remember all these details, but later learned they were true. Anyway, by different paths, we both became spiritualists, and give &quot;energy healing passes,&quot; and are very good friends. One day I shall do a regression to dig more about this. I obviously think the governments know all about this kind of phenomena and there is a huge cover up, which makes me wonder how far from the whole truth is &quot;The Great Conspiracy&quot; of Ernesto Bono. It is clearly much exaggerated (sometimes a total fantasy), and is poorly documented, but if just half of it is true we are in deep trouble!

I told the guild here comes a airplane. He said &quot;that is odd&quot; because we were in the upper part of the Yukon near Mount McDonald and you do not see many airplanes there especially at 3 in the morning. Suddenly the cluster of light stopped dead still in the sky. It appeared to be about 3 miles away. Then it started darting around, up and down, then sideways. Then stopped again. We watched it for about 5 min then it darted around again, then stopped and held steady. Light were red, blue and white. I viewed it through my rifle scope and it was a triangle of 12 lights. Lights where white through the scope and all of equal brightness. As we walked on we could see it for about 30 min. As we walked we entered some willows and lost sight of the object. When we came out it was gone. It was the most unbelievable thing I have ever seen.", "Triangular shape light in Hurst texas that stayed making small movements for over 2 hoursWalking in a local park with someone else at night I noticed some light flickering different colors with an apparent shape to it. We stopped and watched for around 30-50 minutes and noticed planes go past but this object never moved. It appeared to have 3 strip lights making a triangle and a single light underneath, it was a distance off but I could see this shape. Every so often we noticed what appeared to be like a small beam of light appearing underneath it at a slight angle that but it did not reach the ground just a little underneath the object. The lights flickered red, green and yellow I believe but not like that of any plane (we are near an airport so I know what plane lights look like and the airport is off in a different direction). After a while it started to move a little, but there was no acceleration or deceleration, it just moved left then right a little and then in a sort of s shape upwards. We watched as it would make this movement now and again. Upon returning home from the park I could still see it from the house and observed it for a long time waiting to see any kind of movement that I could relate to a plane or helicopter.

I noticed five (5) white lights flying over the highway in an odd way.  They appeared to me at first to be airplanes, but after watching more closely, there were no red tail lights.  They moved across the night sky towards a transmission towers that were flashing red warning lights.  At this time, the five lights appeared to hover next to these red lights, making me think they were helicopters searching for something.  I turned my vehicle around to follow the white lights, and as I did, I noticed that the hovering continued until I was probably mile away from the transmission lights, when suddenly all five lights went out simultaneously.  They did not land anywhere, not did anything else appear next to them when the lights went out.  All totalled the experience lasted 8-10 minutes from the time of sighting to the lights shutting off.  To note the type of weather outside was partly cloudy, but warm.

The  lights stayed in the area for approximately 20 minutes. I asked the folks if they knew which direction the lights went and they were both unsure.  They may have looked away for a minute or two and then when they glanced back the lights were gone.  Then on the same morning, two hours later, they  saw  more some strange objects and took photos of them as well.  I found the pictures to be very interesting and beautiful with the rainbow as a backdrop.A number of objects can be seen very clearly in the pictures. The witnesses said the objects stayed in their area for approximately an hour, and told me this event was extraordinary.  They watched them flying north and maneuver themselves as if they were lining up one after another.  They also would change positions, spreading out, and coming back together once again.  At one point the witness said they seemed to  leap frog over one another..  It was a strange and exciting experience for the couple.One of the witnesses said someone else must have surely seen this event as it lasted so long and was so very strange.I would really like to thank the couple for sending me the pictures and report.Pictures can be found here: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/minnesota_into_canada.htm  Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.Home - Phone/Fax 1 250 845 2189 HBCC UFO Forum Board http://216.147.50.102/HBCC-UFO/index.php email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/hbcc_ufo_research.htm", "Triange shaped object moving across the sky in New York City on a Lunar eclipseWe were standing ontop of a building on 30th and 7th ave busy watching the Lunar eclipse.

At first it looked like a piece of toilet paper flying through the sky, but this was a fixed shape.  Then we thought it was a glider, but the shape was wrong and it was too high and much to big to be a glider.

They were not geese, but a series of very dim lights outlining  the front part of a massive black, triangular aircraft. It was very quiet and very low.I watched it fly by slowly for a few seconds and quickly ran to get another witness when it was overhead. A split second later it had vanished.The shape of the craft was not a sharp-lined triangle, but had subtle indentations almost like  gigantic bird wings.

I noticed some movement though it was slow and purposeful. It was bright red - which is why I thought it was some type of aircrafe -  and seemed to oscillate in its luminosity. It would grow brighter and larger then reduce in luminosity and size in no apparent pattern. We used a cheap Camcorder with a slight zoom lens to see a closer picture of whatever it was and it appeard in the small LCD as a red disk. After about ten minutes time it just dissappeared.

I was working building a sunroom onto our house and as I looked up to see if the upper frame was level I saw a ufo coming from the north. It was bright, starlike, and it made a loop around the house and hovered above me for about five minutes. I went into the house and got binoculars and looked at it. In the binoculars it seemed to change shape, from a sphere to a elongated figure. My daughter came out of the house and I showed her the ufo. She was surprised to see a bright star in the middle of the day. I gave her the binoculars and she also commented that it was changing shapes. This ufo gradually grew dim and we went into the house to eat lunch. After lunch, I decided to get the video camera out with me in case the ufo returned. I went back to work and as I was coming out of the garage with some wood I had cut, I saw three ufo&apos;s coming from the north. I quickly grabbed the video camera and recorded the ufo&apos;s as they traveled above the house. These ufo&apos;s were bright and closer , and are the ones in the video. They were also spherical in shape, and traveled in unison. I also got another shot of a ufo moving above the tree, but this is shorter. Most of the video I took that day did not turn out.

I asked how it was possible to travel that fast it told me that the shape of the craft in which we travel is key. Only a sauser shape or cigar shape,or round vessil could travel that fast because of the pressure that is excerted on a craft at that high a speed. though we were communicating rather well, something went terribly wrong.

We were both shocked to see a V formation of lights composed of 7 or 9 points or globs of light pass completely across the sky, coming from behind the southern horizon, all the way to the northern horizon in approxamately 5 seconds. I had never then or now seen aircraft fly at this rate of speed. An airplane would take at least a couple minutes or longer to cross from horizon to horizon depending on altitude. I had the impression that their altitude was very high because there was absolutely no engine sound what so ever, although I have no way of knowing this for sure. They did not have the appearance of stars or meteorites, as they were not distinct points of light. They rather had a sort of oval or round shape but it was hard to tell because they had the appearance of diffused white light. We, as kids would, knew they were &quot;space ships&quot;.

I still figured it was probably a C-5, but i watched it anyway.  As we came to a part of the road where it dipped down a bit, I noticed that the trees were about to come in the line of sight, and I expected to lose track of it, instead, i could see the light THROUGH the trees still.

My friend and I both could not believe what we just saw...even when the light turned green, we! still sat there and watched it, and as it got closer, it was obvious that it was going to come directly over head, so I got out. The craft had roughly about 4 to 6 BRIGHT white lights, and they were formed a triangle shape, and really resembled that of the leading eadge of a large plane.  I couldn&apos;t make out the shape of the actual craft because of the lights.  The thing that baffled me was as it got closer and closer, I heard no noise, I even told my friend to turn the car off, which he did, and even as it passed, the only sound we heard was a very low, kind of hum, NOTHING like that of an aircraft engine, prop, turbo-prop, or jet.  As I looked at it...it was really hard to judge distance, it looked like it was both big, and high above, yet at the same time, it looked small and really close to the ground.  Neither of us said anything to anyone, yet 3 days later, while I was in class in school, a friend of mine said she and a friend saw a UFO a few weeks before, and that it had really bright white lights, and it was also near RT.13, I just got goosebumps.  I was just speaking to the friend that was with me about it, and he said someone he spoke to saw the same thing, on the same night, but he&apos;s not sure who it was.", "a steaking light in the bright morning skyOn an unusually bright sunny morning, I witnessed a pale blue light streak through the western sky; it very much resembled a shooting star, but it occurred in very bright daylight.  I was on a bicycle, on my way to work when I saw it and astounded, turned around to look at the car behind me. It was a taxi cab, and as the driver approached the nearby stop sign, he pulled over and asked if I saw that.  I said I had, and did he know what it was?  He did not, but I was happy to not have been the only witness to a very odd light in the sky.", "Clark, WY. object or Light heading S.W. at 20:51 hoursI took my dog out at 20:51 hours saw what looked like a satlelite but was moving to slow. I had a 600,000 candle like spot light so I flashed my light at it just fooling around and about a minute later it came to a dead stop. This scared and freaked me out so I came in and locked the doors Why I don&apos;t know, but I emailed norad and they actualy replied I still have there reply if you want me to forward it to you. They said they did not track anything unusual.", "Tubular shaped thing,that changed shape and seemed to navigate its directions was flying over my home. several witnessesI looked up and saw a v shaped tubular thing flying from east to west towards SF Bay.it began to change shape and turned into a donut looking thing then turned out to a reverse v shape opposit of the original v shape,  Then as that one got out of sight two more showed up and did the same thing and changed shapes and crossed paths and and one was switching position with the lead one. several times then got more far apart but still flew the same directional pattern they and the the first one was headed,  I am going out to look for more.((name deleted))", "&quot;V&quot; Shaped craft over Night Sky in Alvarado TX. Oct. 1997About 10pm my wife and I were returning from Ft. Worth, TX. I was pulling into the driveway which faces west. The sky was clear and dark except for the stars which shone brightly against the black sky. We live in a mobil home which runs north and south. We have a security lamp on the electric pole which illuminates our driveway near the house. Even before I completly stopped the car, I could not help but notice something EXTREMELY LARGE passing slowly over our house. We both got out of the car and uttered virtually the same words. &quot;What the Hell is that?&quot; Moving from South-West to North-East about 10 miles an hour was some huge flying craft. It was difficult to estimate size because it&apos;s only illumination was about seven glowing white lights along the wings in the front of the craft. In other words one light was centered at the nose and four down each wing. The craft was &quot;V&quot; Shaped like the front of a stealth fighter. It was enormous. I have since held my thumb up to the sky as a passing Commercial airliner flew over which easily covered the Jet. I believe the Jet was in the neighborhood of 3 thousand feet. It would have required both hands in front of my face to cover this craft that we saw. It passed so slowly that I knew it was no jet. The stall speed of even a propeller type craft was not even being met. It made absolutely No noise whatsoever. It was not a helicopter. As matter of fact it was too large to be even close to size of any Balloon, Plane , Helicopter or anything else that I have seen Man Made and in fLight. FT. Hood at Kileen, TX. is in the Direction from which it came. It blanked the stars out of the sky as it passed over which is how that I could tell that it was &quot;V&quot; Shaped. It had no flashing beacon nor the standard Red and Green Port and Starboard lights nor the flashing beacon all of which you expect to see on PLANES and Helicopters. Of couse I take into account that these would not be present if the Military was flying a secret &quot;STEALTH&quot; craft over. I believe that th! is Craft was flying no more than 1 thousand feet up. With that guestimation, I would say that the width was at least 3000 feet across and 1000 feet long. It blanked out a considerable portion of the sky noticing the disappearance of stars and their reappearnace. We observed the craft some 30 seconds until I could no longer make out the shape. The white lights along the wings did not seem to cast light in front of the craft They were however, visible even after it had passed over us. I never heard anything about it on the news. I have since heard of simular sightings within months of our sighting. I was prompted to leave this account by Mr. Davenport&apos;s Radio visit to COAST to COAST listening on  KVIL AM 570 Dallas WT. Worth and subsequently on WKOI AM 1200 San Antonio as we recently drove to Shreveport LA.((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.  We will encourage the witness to attempt to determine the date accurately.  PD))", "On Mon. Oct. 20, 2003 at approximately 8:45 PM I saw a fireball like object streak across sky in a east to west direction.I was at my son&apos;s soccer game and right at the end of the game I saw a fireball like object streak across the night sky in a east to southwesterly direction.  It looked like a bottle rocket type firework but bigger like a professional sized firework but it did not explode.  It just streaked across the sky.  I would have completely dismissed it as some type of firework but it had  blue green sparks flying off of it and I read on the internet today that a similar sighting had been reported over Durham NC at approximately the same time,  8:45, and that that object was also reported as &quot;trailing a tail of green streaks.&quot;  My sighting was between 8:45 and 9:00 PM, also in NC, just west of Durham.  The report, which was on &quot;What&apos;s New On Compuserve&quot; also said A Durham County deputy sheriff said his sighting was near interstate 40.  I 40 is right behind the soccer field where we saw this object. I&apos;m not sure how many others there saw it but I heard a few Ooos and Ahhs, after I saw it so I&apos;m assuming others there saw it too.  My mother-in-law saw it.  I&apos;m assuming everybody else that saw it also dismissed it as a possible firework because nobody said anything else about it.  Everyone was too excited that we had just had a very exciting soccer game with my son pulling off a hat trick in the last two minutes of the game.  A hat trick is 3 unanswered goals back to back.  My son&apos;s team won the game 8 to 2 so everyone was so excited about the game that nobody thought anything more about the firework looking object.  But there was just the one object and it didn&apos;t appear to come from the ground.  It was more like it was just streaking across the night sky, but close enough to the ground to look like a firework.  It also made a sound, not very loud, like a firework streaking and I recall hearing a faint &quot;pop&quot; like sound like a firework exploding but it was not very loud.  Neither was the streaking sound.  It was like I was hearing it but like it didn&apos;t sound close.  Even though the object appeard close! The sound sounded like it was far away.  The object itself appeared white hot in the center and when I heard the faint &quot;pop&quot; sound I recall seeing orange as well as the blue green sparks but the orange came from the center white light like it was exploding or breaking apart like an explosion but there was no sound of a loud explosion, just a faint &quot;pop&quot; sound.", "The craft was V shaped with large orangey lights along the bottom it flue low and slow with no sound over the bay.The UFO I saw look like this. It was one craft and it had a metal look and was gray or like a dark grey.and it made NO sound as it was flying. It was shaped like a V and it looked streem lined. It had large orangey colored light`s along the bottom of the craft. This I have NEVER seen before in my life, I could see the HEAT vaper coming of the lights and the craft and It looked HOT!! I would say it was about 3/4 mile away from me. It looked like it was flying at about 600 feet (est). I saw this craft as I was sitting on my belcony at night in the front of my house with clear sky`s. And I watched this craft fly low and slow infront of the mountins,  it flue over the bay in a strait line till it got to the end of the bay it turn left a little. Then I lost sight of it after it went behined the trees that are in front of my house. This sighting lasted about 35 seconds.", "large white fireball or super flare...i was with a friend sitting in a car smoking. we were on another friends property which was a soybean field. we were waiting and chatting. i brought up the fact that every time that this person and i hung out together strange things seemed to happen and no sooner did i say this a large white fireball or flare shot down from the sky there was no sound and if it was indeed a flare it seemed to be shot from the highway towards the local middle-school.this incident occurred about a quarter mile from us and lasted about 5 seconds. we both passed it off as coincidence but who wouldnt?((NUFORC Note:  One of two reports from same witness.  Date is approximate.  PD))", "The Object was above our car hovering.  We didn&apos;t see it move towards us ...it was just there in an instance.I was at Nassau Beach with my friend it was the middle of winter. The place was deserted.  While we sat looking at the ocean, I noticed a bright light which could have been a plane. My friend wroked for Grumman at the time and said that it was a plane.  I continuted to watch the light and saw that a second bright light appeared next to it, while we were both watching, the lights merged and became 1 and started comming toward us.  We immediatedly left the area, got in the car and headed out of the large parking lot.  We stopped at the traffic light(turning onto LIdo Blvd) we looked toward the ocean and saw this very bright light stationary in the sky.  We didn&apos;t see it move towards us but it was over the car about 30 ft above us, there was no sound.  We both were extremely frightened and sped out of the parking lot.  It seemed to follow us when we got onto the Loop PKY (also pretty empty) it looked almost like a star keeping pace with the car at a far distance off.  WHile we sped down the pky I noticed that it got brighter again. Once we got onto a more populated pky (the Meadowbrook) the light dissappeared as quickly as it appeared.   Needless to say nobody believed what we saw.  The next morning we went back to the parking with some friends and burned into the pavement was a huge circle. The burn mark was apox 4-6&quot; thick and about 100 feet around.  I tried to report what we saw to the local police dept,  but like everyone else they didn&apos;t believe us.  I really don&apos;t care who believes me, I know what I saw, it was only 30 feet above the car.  It was round and had blue and white ligths under it.  To be honest I have never NEVER been that scared in my life.  I will never forget it.((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))", "3 Weakly lit egg shapes in tight formation.Location : Sydney, M4 Motorway Westbound near Cumberland Highway Overpass. This is a zone of medium density housing near Parramatta. I cannot imagine anyone in the location who looking in the direction of this object not seeing it. We were in a car moving at 90kph in a straight line. The object was directly in front of us moving from right to left and perhaps 45 deg and away. We saw it for about 30 seconds as with smoothly cruised past. Opening the window we heard nothing out of the ordinary, no jet scream nor chopper thumps. The night was clear, no rain for weeks, no clouds in the sky. Temp was perhaps 9-12deg. Stars could easily be seen. I don&apos;t recall wether the moon was out. Object Movement : Moving southwest. Approx 100-200m off ground. Travelling slowly and an airborne object, perhaps around 100-140kph. After it had passed to perhaps 1km south west of us it seemed we could only see a static red light(not flashing or any kind of strobe effect). Once we saw the red light we continued seeing it for another 40 seconds before we had passed it(on our left) and it was obscured behind the Motorway walls travelling south approx above the Cumberland Highway. Description : Perhaps 3 Egg shapes locked in to a tight structure. no connecting structure was seen but they remain at a constant distance and in the same formation. We saw the bottom of this(these) object(s), so what we actually saw resembled the bottom fifth of an egg. Initially it looked exactly like three white helicopters in a very tight formation. The objects appeared lit from below by a weak light. There didn&apos;t appear to be anywhere the light was coming from. Not the ground and the was nothing beneath the object. While the object(s) was at it&apos;s closest we saw no lights flashing or static, just the three weakly lit egg surfaces. At no point did we see anything above the three surfaces. The three surfaces that we saw were equally sized, perhaps the 4-5m across each 6-7m long and perhaps 10m apart. This did NOT look like a commercial airliner from below, the closest object we could associate it with would be three large white helicopters in a dangerously perhaps impossibly tight formation, again no flashing lights you&apos;d expect to see on aircraft. My wife travels this route nightly at the same time, Mon-Fri. Never before has this appeared nor any following nights. There are no nearby airports. Helicopter reports of the Sydney Motorways&#x5C;highways are seen in peak hour only(morning &#x5C; afternoon.) and generally fly 3-4 times higher than this object. Traffic on the roads at that time is sparse yet constant car &#x5C; 100m). There was no acidents or unusual traffic events. There would have been a number of cars facing this object as it passed before us. It looked extremely &apos;out of place&apos; like seeing a jumbo 50m off the ground, very wrong in the context of the medium density built up residential area. My wife mad a comment that it looked like an object &quot;poking out of the bottom of a cloud&quot; or &quot;out of some fog&quot; to describe the way only a few slightly curved surfaces could be seen. [Feel free to contact me for more info. I think I covered everything. Perference for email conversations, work phone is provided.]", "I was driving home from work traveling southbound on Loop 12 when I first saw a very large cigar shaped craft hovering directly over the road.  It had a very bright, round white light on top and a bright round red light at the bottom.  I did not notice any noise associated with it that you would expect from such a low flying aircraft.  I slowed to about 25-30 MPH as did the other vehicles on the road.  The craft at first was almost directly above me and seemed to be at about the height that traffic helicopters fly except that this object was at least as large as a commercial jet.  As I watched, the craft moved along slowly above the road, staying just in front of me.  It then slowly rotated clockwise until the red light was on the top &amp; white light on the bottom.  It then rotated back to it&apos;s original position and moved to the east side of the road where it rotated again but to a horizontal position.  It continued to move around some and then crossed back over the road to the west side.  Once there, I saw an arm or wing come out from the side of the craft so that now it is kind of &quot;L&quot; shaped.  The wing had pulsating red lights in a circle on the end and then a solid, concentrated beam of white light was emitted from the tip of the wing down to the ground.  It appeared similar to a search light, but was more concentrated.  The beam moved around along the ground.  I watched the craft my entire drive south on Loop 12, then onto Spur 408 until I exited onto I-20 and could no longer see it.  During the entire sighting, traffic around me was also moving very slowly, and some vehicles had pulled over to the shoulder.  It was a clear night and the craft was so large, so close and with such bright lights, that it would have been impossible not to see it or to mistake it for a plane or helicopter.  I have never seen anything remotely like this and to be honest, I hope I never do again!", "Rendezvous of 2 white lights, followed by enormous, pulsing light rings.I noticed a bright white, smallish blob of light traversing the night sky, at high altitude, traversing the sky from east to west.  It caught my eye, because objects at that altitude do not more that quickly.  It was not moving at an ASTOUNDING rate of speed, but it was moving too fast for the average jet operating at that altitude, so it caught my eye.  As I watched it cross the sky I noted that it seemed to be heading for an identical small blob of light that was STATIONARY, situated at the same altitude, due northwest.  I watched this drama unfold, as the objects seemed to be heading for a rendezvous.  They finally met, and seemed to form a larger blob of light, though there was some separation between them.  Then the pulsing rings of light began, light pulses that were slow, forming vast concentric and expanding rings around the center of the two objects.  There would be a huge flash, followed by an expanding light-ring that filled perhaps 1/16 of the sky.  As one light ring dampened out, the process would repeat.  At this point, I dashed in the house to get my wife to come see.  She also saw the light-ring phenomena.  Finally, the light rings stopped, and the two bright blobs of light simply disappeared.  Again, this event was not reported on in the local papers, in spite of the fact that this was a HUGE phenomena.  I thought it could have been some kind of USAF operation, perhaps an exercise in signalling, but nothing was ever reported.  The date is very approximate -- it could have been anytime between December `1999 and January 2000.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  One of two reports from same source.  PD))", "BRIGHT RED OBJECT DECENDS/THEN TURN BRIGHT GREEN/BLUE AND SHOOTS OFF!Alright my friends and i often frequent the mountain in our town due to there never being anything to do.  We like to just sit out in certain spots and listen to music talk about our days we do this sometimes up to 1am.  So on october the 12 Sunday i remember specifically because we were whining about working the next day.  My friend Greg and I were sitting in his truck facing North East. I have seen NUMEROUS shooting stars i have watched meteor showers and this was no shooting star!  So about 12:00am we were listening to music when out of the corner of my left eye From the north west direction I see a Burning red light falling SLOWLY in a parallel motion it fell so slow that i had time to look over It was intense red like it had just burned in from the atmosphere almost?   Then it stops turns the brightest of green and fly in the north east direction paralell once again and vanishes in a brilliant greenish/blue flash.  This happened in a matter of seconds but a shooting start wouldnt have give me time enough to look before it burnt out and sure as heck wouldn&apos;t have shot back into the sky!  I looked at my friend Greg and said GREG i just saw some craziness, he said huh?  He hadn&apos;t seen it, but told me he HAS scene the same type of thing in our town before, so being me i ask around to other people id say about 5 people i asked have seen some mysterious flying object here.  We are 40miles from Edwards Airforce base but 20 miles from Lockead Skunk Works.  All i can say is i have been searching to see one since i was a boy in New Mexico would stare out of windows forever at 5 years old and now 15 years later i see it not expecting to :)  We aren&apos;t alone and this is for sure:)  100billion stars in our milkyway galaxy they say, and there could be up to 400billion in it but 300 of which we cannot detect and each star could possably be surrounded by a Earth like planet figure the equation :)", "Follow up to : Blue-green luminescent objects moving at a high rate of speedI am the neighbor, as reported in the following report:  Occurred : 11/26/1999 17:50 (Entered as : 11/26/99 1750) Reported: 12/4/1999 09:24 Posted: 3/11/2003 Location: Redondo Beach, CA Shape: Formation Duration:10 sec. Blue-green luninescent objects moving at a high rate of speed, producing no sound and maneuvering at incredible angles to each other.---------------------------------------------------- I thought it might be worth while to give my take on the report. As stated, I had just scored (the winning shot I might add) and threw my head back, and hands up in victory, when I exclaimed &quot;What the heck is that?&quot; I saw 4  fairly dim &quot;lights&quot; if you will, bluish-green in color, tracking east to west at a pretty good clip. The speed, east to west was constant. Their speed relative to each other, varied. My first thought was they were those spotlights used for attracting attention to businesses around the area, except there were no clouds to reflect the light, nor were there any &quot;beams&quot; emanating from the ground. Lastly, spotlights travel in a set pattern, extending out from a focal point, then returning, these definitely came in from the east, and disappeared on the western horizon. Now, all the while, these four lights were not just moving east to west, but performed maneuvers similar to those of the previously mentioned spotlights. At one point, they all came together, sort of spun around each other, then separated back into a new formation. While almost directly overhead, two of them stayed stationary in the center, while the other two, (one on each side of the two stationary lights) made circles as they flew. A little hard to explain, but if you hold up two fingers on each hand, put the index fingers touching side by side, and start rotating the second fingers in opposite circles (one move clockwise, the other counterclockwise) you can get an idea of the formation as it passed overhead. Of course, the tips of your fingers will represent the lights themselves. Now remember, these varying &quot;formations&quot; are still moving at a constant speed east to west. They traveled somewhere between 3/4, and 1/2 of a persons field of view, meaning east horizon, to west horizon in just about 10-15 seconds. The speed seemed fast, yet they almost seemed to be moving in slow motion. They made no sound whatsoever, which was noted immediately, since they did not appear to be that high in the sky. I cannot guess at an altitu! de, because I don&apos;t know the actual size of the objects. If they were the size of a car, then I would guess somewhere between between 1000 to 1200 feet. (ONLY a guess)  The two children who also witnessed this are my kids, and while they were enthralled by what they were seeing, once the objects moved out of view, became very scared and &quot;clingy&quot; for a lack of a better word. They were obviously shocked by what they had seen. Like my friend said, we live close to the airport (actually 2, LAX, and the smaller Torrance airport), so we know what planes are, and the normal tell-tale signs. (shape, lights, engine noise, flight behaviors, etc.) We had to play it off in order to calm the kids down. Later that evening, after getting them calmed, in bed, and convinced the aliens were not landing tonight, I went back over to my neighbors to discuss what we had witnessed. We both agree that we don&apos;t know what we saw, but we don&apos;t want to label it, especially without any other evidence besides our own accounts. A very surreal experience.", "I was sitting with my friend at Red Bank where the bridge was at the Allegheny Resoivor. We had been fishing and saw a light cross the sky from west to east. What made this light interesting was that it stopped about four times as it made an arc across the sky. That meant it wasn&apos;t a sattelite or a plane. It was very high up but it was a moonless night. We watched it for at least an hour. I remember it was a Sunday night. We usually traveled from our hunting camp back to Pittsburgh Sundays but we stayed this evening and left early Monday morning. As we were driving back we listened to KDKA and at six thirty a report came on that a Ufo had crashed in a lake in eastern Pa. We listened intently. The seven oclock radio news said that people had witnessed the Ufo crash but they nevr named the town or vicinity. Then at seven thirty the KDKA news said that the National Gurad and army had surrounded and closed the area. That was the last we ever heard of it! There was nothing in the newspaper. Our light in the sky had been traveling west to east.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We are not aware of any crash in 1974, although one may have occurred and we are not aware of it.  PD))", "My husband and I saw a bright white light with a short tail glidding fast accross the sky from east to west.My husband and I were sitting outside this evening around 18:10 Mountain time taking in the cool autumn air when my husband looked up and seen a bright white light with  a short tail.  I looked up as well and saw the same thing.  It was teardrop shaped and glidding along pretty fast.  My father is a pilot and I learned enough to know from him that the object was not a military jet, airliner, hellicopter, or small airplane.There was no sound what so ever from this object.  We watched it for a good 45 seconds to about a minute.  We know that it was not a ameter cause it was moving too slow to be a meter. The object was heading west from the east.", "Large seemingly round object burning up with tail that dissipated towards end of sight, too big to miss,orange tailMy wife alerted me to something she saw in the sky to the south, southeast of our home saying  &quot;Honey, What is that thing in the sky?.&quot;  I was working on my truck and didn&apos;t want to get up for nothing because of back problems, but with her insistence I got up and looked toward Maryville, TN;  There was an orange ball falling from the sky with a tail (orange)that was traveling at what must have been an incredible speed.  If you would stretch your arm out and compare the distance between your forefinger and your thumb, it was about an inch long. This object had quite a tail on it for the first 45 seconds or so, then it seemed to dissipate to a certain extent as the object came further towards the ground but the tail flared up in the same orange color on several occasions. At this point I would have to guess its altitude at 2 miles, maybe less. I figured that maybe it was a satellite coming out of orbit, but the funny thing is that it was very close to McGhee-Tyson airport.  I called them and they said they&apos;d seen nothing at seven o&apos;clock, Saturday, October the eighteenth, two thousand and three.  The guy I talked to seemed interested and said he&apos;d call me back. For whatever it&apos;s worth, we saw this very thing and it was cool. I&apos;ve never seen anything like it except in movies or science news. My background is that I&apos;ve always loved the sciences,fairly smart and am happy that I witnessed this falling object that no one seems to know anything about. Thanks. Wish that I&apos;d have gotten my camera but I thought it would be on the news about a satellite going down or a meteorite.", "I submitted the following to a French UMMO site isn1997. For years I have been trying to track down a craft&apos;s symbol my 4 yr. old and I saw around 1978 in Pasadena, CA- a strange &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; type of ship with a very obvious &quot;H&quot; on its side (although slightly cursive)- the ship looked almost cartoonish and flatly 2_dimensional, seemingly suspended over the San Gabriels, heading West. Although there were several people in the area and apparently interested in what we were looking at, no one else saw it. We casually talked about &apos;our sighting&apos; over the years as it was such a clear, vivid vision and it had been my son who was the first to notice it. We even drew pictures that same afternoon and, over the years, made a few sketches to maintain a fresh visual recall.Interestingly, his pictures always showed a very odd perspective, as though he was viewing it in extreme close-up whereas my view was more of a typical upper sky sighting as seen from standing on the ground. One night about 10 yrs. later, I heard him gasp as CNN aired a Moscow UFO story. Apparently a ship had landed near an apartment complex where many children were playing and many of them excitedly described seeing a UFO. One of the kids had even sketched a picture and as he proudly held it up to the camera, we saw that he had drawn a similar ship with the SAME ** H ** ! Then, about a year later, TNT was running a 50&apos;s UFO quasi-documentary (OVERLORDS of the SKIES) and I was stunned to see a crude representation of an analogous craft again demonstrating the &quot;H&quot;. The narrator mentioned that the ship was said to be from the planet UMMO (!!!). I made a halfhearted effort to track down the video but discovered it was actually a motion film of which no one seemed to have current knowledge. I keep meaning to contact Turner Broadcasting and request a repeat but haven&apos;t done so. I later learned of a book with UMMO in the title and had a local bookstore run a search but was told it was out of print. Anytime I have asked about the sighting, I have been told by a few wannabe Ufologists etal that it was actually a famous &quot;hoax&quot; yet allegedly seen by about 15,000 people across the US sometime in the 50&apos;s; some say it was the 70&apos;s. Actually, I remain a bit of a skeptic (altho we sure saw something!), Have you any knowledge about this particular sighting or symbol? Even called Art Bell last year (1998)  to ask but rec&apos;d a cursory &quot;Never heard of it...&quot; and got one of his infamous quick disconnects (smile). There&apos;s more to the whole story involving both my son and I and some eerie pre and post strange events but, for now, am simply curious as to what  you think of the actual symbol.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "Light over Southern Indiana town of CrandallThe strange multi-colored blinking light in the sky is back over Crandall again, for two nights in a row now.  It was here last Tuesday and Wednesday nights, but I did not see it over the weekend due to low clouds and thunderstorms.  This time around it did not appear in the exact same spot the two consecutive nights, rather it appeared in slightly more easterly tonight than it did last night.  Last night there was what sounded like a single engine plane that cut a wide berth around the object, but then went on its towards Louisville.  The thing looks a lot like the North Star times five, though it blinks wildly between white, red, blue, green, and yellow...but mostly looks white.  Having observed it for many nights now, I&apos;ve almost got myself convinced that it&apos;s a particularly bright star.  But this is impossible.  I know of no star that instead of rising and setting, simply appears (although I have not witnessed this) at 3am and vanishes between 5 and 6 in the morning.((NUFORC Note:  Suspected sighting of a &quot;twinkling&quot; star.

It was North of Kingman, and I was amazed shocked off my rocker at what I saw. I froze in one spot and I don&apos;t remember if I said a word for a while. All of a sudden it hit me and I was like O my God there is a huge saucer floating over my neighbors house. I mean this thing was HUGE and had Gold flashing lights. All it reminded me of was gold and dimonds. It was so bright and so glamour like. It was kinda rotating back in forth in small motions. I started to yell into the phone. I told my friend to 3-way my Mother and get her outside. While she wasn&apos;t answering the phone. I looked back up. Just in time to see the saucer take off. I ran over to my Mom&apos;s house and told her to get her butt outside. She said she was so jealous, because I always catch this kinda stuff. I told her to hang around and see what happens. About 2 mins later about 40 planes filled the sky. They all met over the Cerbat mountians and then seperated. My Mom was like whats going on? Yes we do live by an airport, but I promise you I have never seen more then 5 planes in the sky on any given night. I watch the sky every night for atleast an hour to 5. After the planes left a huge bolt of green light flew out of the sky and landed in the little mountians by my house. At this time my Dad came running out. Then all of a sudden here comes 40 planes again. Then another huge Gold glowing light was hanging over by the Kingman Airport. We looked at it in the telescope and it looked like 2 gold cat eyes. My Parents and I were both blown away! Then here comes all these planes again. Within 5 mintues all the planes were gone. The intense vibe was gone and it was like everything was returned to normal. For the record. I do not take any meds, drugs, and I was not drunk. This was very real and very freaky! Thought I would share my experience!", "A large black trianle shaped aircraft with three lights quietly and slowly hovering very low.On my way home from work early Sunday morning I noticed some bright lights just above the trees.  I thought it was for a ball field but I&apos;d never seen them there before.  As I got closer I realized they were too high up to be attached to the ground but they appeared to be stationary.  I was only a few blocks from home and it was hard to tell if it was moving until I stopped for a stop sign.  It was hovering slowly and very low.  When I reached my driveway and turned my engine off I could hear a low hum.  It was right above my backyard, big black triangle shaped with three lights I watched for a few more minutes as it slowly traveled north.", "Circular craft over Lake MichiganStrange circular craft(a) with 3-4 blue, flashing marker lights.

Suspect craft(b) was military. Craft(a) hovered over Lake Michigan area. Appeared to be near Chicago,IL area. Object was observered for aprox 30 minutes. Unusual amount of civilian aircraft observing object as well for this area. Took photos, but lens was not powerful enough to capture craft.", "My Mother heard what she believed was a UFO.My Mother has told me this story twice with about a thirty year interval between the tellings.  I believe it was an experience that greatly impressed her and the story was substantially the same at both tellings. When I was approximately 24 months old (born 1/16/52)my Mom and Dad and I lived in the two upstairs rooms of my grandparent&apos;s house in Virginia.  At that time the area was very rural.  My Mom said that she woke up one night after midnight and I was crying.  She was also aware of a loud buzzing sound like bees.  She went to the crib and tried to quiet me but was unsuccessful.  She began to become frightened and the noise was intensifying and hurt her ears.  She tried to awaken my father unsuccessfully.  She said that her thought was that the noise was coming from a UFO. (I guess they were often in the papers at that time.)  She thought of going to the window to look but was frightened and reports feeling they did not want her to look.  Eventually she picked me up and rocked me until the noise gradually faded.  When the noise stopped I stopped crying and, eventually she went back to sleep.  The next morning at breakfast she tried to tell the family about the experience but was ridiculed.  Nobody else heard anything. However, when the paper came that day the headline story was about UFOs over Washington.  The one thing that doesn&apos;t make sense to me is the date.  Apparently the date of the big DC sighting was July 1952 when I would have been only 6 months old.  I was in my early twenties the first time Mom told me about this.  It is possible she got the dates wrong or was confusing the Langly AFB chase, which I believe also made headlines with the Washington sightings.It also seems that the way she discribes my behavior, simply crying might be more characteristic of a very young baby that a two year old.  I spoke quite well by the time I was two.  In any case when Mom told me this story again this summer and was so consistent I thought it was worth recording.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Next, a large ball of orangish light appeared and 2 lights broke off into a horizontal formation.  They faded out again.  This went on for almost an hour.  Sometimes the ball would break off into a vertical formation while other times into a horizontal or diagonal formation. It would only stay visible for 5-6 seconds at a time.  The last 10 minutes were the most active. It broke off into a formation of 4 from the main ball of light ( all perfectly spaced ).  Then when it re-appeared it broke off into a formation of 5 lights.  And finally into a vertical formation of 6 equally spaced lights.  The main light would never moved once it appeared. Once each ball of light went to it&apos;s place in the formation, the formation stayed still for 5-6 seconds and then would fade out all at the same time. My wife went next door to tell our neighbors.  When the neighbors came out to see,  the craft(s) never revealed themselves again.  I have never seen anything like this before and neither has my wife.

The night before was a crisp clear cold night. We were standing around the fire, talking, listening to music when my brother called us to, &quot;Come look at this!&quot;  We went to where my brother was standing and looked to where he was pointing into the sky across and above Rock Run.  We saw an extreamly large triangular shape moving over the ridge of the mountain across from us (McIntyire Mt.).  My husband quickly went and turned the radio and generator off.  The triangular shape continued to slowly follow the top of the mountain. We could clearly see stars in the heavans until this shape moved between us and the stars.  The form was a solid mass that blocked the light from the stars. We all noticed that this huge thing made absolutely no audible sound. I saw that it had three bluish white lights, one on each corner. My brothers also noted a red light.  I did not take notice to a red one. It&apos;s hard to put to scale how big this was, but I can tell you my opinion is that it was at the very least the length of two football fields long and one half of that wide.  It dissappeared over the mountain and that was the last time we saw it.  It was unnerving to say the least.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

While driving, I became aware of a light in the passenger side, front-seat window which persisted for some time.  At first I thought it was merely reflection from a farmhouse or barnyard light.  But after passing some houses, it continued.  Curious, I stopped the car alongside the road and got out so I could look over the top.  I saw the light about two hundred yards from the car in a field, maybe a hundred feet off the ground.  Immediately it shot straight up and faded out of sight, almost instantaneously.

We watched the lights go over the bus very high and fast, and as I looked around the bus, sudenly I realized that everyone was sitting in their seats, like nothing happened; I asked people if they saw that, but they just sat there with a blank look on their face, and would not talk for the rest of the trip to Houston.((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.

The light was as big as your pinky finger nail when held at arms length, and appeared to be 20-30 degrees from the horizon and several miles away.  At no time did the light move up, down, or side to side, rather it appeared to be stationary and then slowly faded from bright white to darkness ... the entire process took about 10 seconds... like someone tuned a dimmer switch. (or like it was moving away at an alarming speed)  Initial observation of the light was that it was similar to landing lights on the front of an airplane, however, there was only one light and appeared much brighter than landing lights I have seen before.  Additionally, there were no other visible lights within the vicinity of the single white light.  Both during the time we saw the white light, and in the minutes that followed as we looked for any signs of plane or such in that area.  If it had been a plane, it simply would not have disappeared that fast as the other aircraft in the sky were plainly visible long after. The light appeared due north from Highway 19, approx 20-30 degrees from the horizon, and appeared to be 4-6 miles away (the distance was based on my observation of two aircraft in the sky at the same time, to the east and west of the bright light, and moving in a northeast, and northwest direction)  Even though the other aircraft in the sky were at some distance and moving away from us as well, they were clearly visible for 5 minutes or so after the Bright White light faded.

It was very cloudy and very dark, so I looked back forward then my curiousity took over and got the better of me so I looked back and saw two windows, then looked back down the road and at first I thought that the blimp was up, but then it hit me that because of the lightening, rain and wind that nothing would be up and flying. Now I looked back and left and paid closer attention to the windo3ws. This time the first thing that struck me was how wide they were but the odd thing was just how narrow they were. They didnt seem that high off the ground and hanging in a cloud. They were 6&quot; to 8&quot; long and about 1/2&quot; high and very bright but not like headlights. I saw no beam, but more like a room light up with bright lights, where you cant see out but people can see in. I thought I saw movement behind the lights but that could have just been my eyes playing tricks on me.

By the time I ran inside, got the binoculars and came back out that object was gone. Still, it had looked unusual so I decided to stay outside for a bit and continue looking. There were several conventional aircraft in the sky and it was calm and clear. It is dark out here in the desert away from town and to the west there are few lights- it is mostly ranch land. I didn&apos;t see anything else and was getting ready to go back to the house, but all of a sudden there was a bright flash in the sky to the northwest but nothing more, then a few seconds later a very bright orange light appeared about a hand span above the western horizon- I still had the binoculars and took a look at it. It was a large glowing orange disk. It was glowing like a burning ember in a wood stove or fire place. It was moving fairly rapidly and it seemed to wobble a bit- sort of rocking back and forth. It was moving south and then it seemed to go to the west away from me. It had no discernable features except it color and shape. When it looked like the object was heading west I ran to get my husband who was working at the computer- I wanted a second witness to this sighting. By the time he got to where I had been standing all that he could see with the binoculars was a glowing orange spot that eventually dissappeared. From my vantage point this sighting was over very flat open country just south of Red Mountain. The object could have been 10 miles away. What is interesting is that it may have been moving in the direction of I-10 so others may have seen something in SW NM or SE AZ as this object was big and bright. I think I watched it about 15 seconds and it was probably visible for about 60 seconds.

They were very faint but larger in diameter. It came from the south and was heading north north west across the sky. I have seen alot in the sky out here and all was able to be explained. I would love to hear that this was no big deal because I do not as of tonight, beleive in UFO&apos;s. There was no noise coming from this object, and it had to be in the atmosphere.

From a distance it appeared stationary over my neighborhood with one extremely bright white light on each side of an equally bright flashing white light.  This was a head-on view of the object.  We continued down the street heading straight for it, still hearing no discernable noise from the object.  As we came up on it, the object was blocked out by a pine tree just a little further up on my side of the car, so we decided to stop right there in the middle of the sreet.  When the craft emerged from behind the tree in line with the car we were stunned at how low and silent it was traveling, it seemed to be just above the top of the tree making no engine noise at all.  This was when I got a full view of the craft, which appeared to be a jet-black triangle against the black sky with three brilliant solid white lights at the points and one flashing white light at the center.  As my friend and I watched the thing creep by, we tried fumbling with a disposable camera but it wasn&apos;t working.  The object seemed to have been going in a slow straight line for the entire time we had observed it.  When it passed directly in front of me I tried to get out and have a better look, but as soon as I popped the door and had a foot out, the object immediately veered to it&apos;s left and emitted a sound like nothing I&apos;ve ever heard.  The only way I can describe the noise is that it was like a chilling high-pitched scream, not like a jet engine which I&apos;m very familiar with living near military installations for my entire life, but a howling that made the hair on the back of my neck stand up.  After turning, the object picked up speed and passed over the top of a house in a small court on my right and was gone.  We tried catching up with the object out on the main road and back through our neighborhood, but it was as if the thing saw us looking at it and then disappeared.  I estima! te the triangle was at least fifty feet wide on it&apos;s sides, I can&apos;t really judge the thickness of the craft having seen just mostly the underside, and I&apos;d say that it was at an altitude of no more than 100-150 feet, traveling parallel with the ground.  The object was in my plain view for about thirty seconds and observed altogether for about three minutes.  I have never seen or heard anything like it before or since.  A few weeks ago though I came accross some UFO footage and photos of the Belgium and France triangle flaps which exactly matched the head-on view and underside view and the lighting of the craft I saw.  Viewing the footage really helped put to rest the last remaining doubts I had about what I witnessed.

As was described by the writer, A small cylinder shaped object {not a drone} moving all around the military aircraft with no visible propulsion. The writer also suggests that the object was in fact being escorted by the aircraft. This certainly sounds within the realms of possibility and perhaps is accurate.

I was standing facing due north but staring straight up watching the stars as I waited for the dog. Out of the corner of me eye I noticed an object &quot;speeding&quot; (faster than any jet) from the southeast to the northwest in a straight line.  It was oval shaped, about the size of a pea held at arms length.  It was not brightly lit like a star, but had a dim glow, sort of close to what a flourescent light looks like at half strength before it flickers completely on.  The color was brownish red. I almost thought it may have been a balloon, but the speed it was travelling at -against the wind, which was blowing the clouds around quite a bit at that time- and the straight line it travelled in, discounted that theory.    I also thought of the possibility of a goose, but I&apos;m not sure they fly at night and would think if a goose belly would be that visible at night then so would its wings. It looked to be roughly several hundred feet in the air, though I&apos;m not a good judge of altitude. I watched it for about a minute until it disappeared into the swirling clouds to the nw. The entire incident was over with before I could have run inside to get a camera.

Shortly after leaving the house I noticed a strange, bright light shining through a section of clouds. About the same time I was wondering what it was, my husband made the comment, look at the landing lights from a plane reflecting on the clouds. We stopped to watch, waiting to see the plane emerge as the light was moving in our direction. It was like watching the light from a flashlight and as the person moves toward you, the cone-shaped beam gets larger and brighter. This beam was getting VERY bright and I kept thinking that the clouds must really be reflecting that light because I&apos;ve seen planes in cloudy conditions and they&apos;ve never even remotely resembled this. We kept watching and waiting and when the light finally reached the clouds edge, it just seemed to melt away leaving only a line of cloud/smoke that continued the same direction of movement. There was no plane, no craft or any evidence that anything was there except that line of cloud/smoke that kept drifting in the same direction and slowly dissapated.", "Two groups of lights in formationTriangle One: Three white lights in a horizontal equilateral triangle about half the width of the moon.

Blue lights seemed to be scattered throughout a spherical area in the center of the triangle. The blue lights repeatedly flashed in the same &quot;seemingly random&quot; sequence with a momentary hesitation between cycles. Length of cycle was about two seconds. Distance between triangles was about the width of the moon. All lights remained in ridged formation which never varied. No physical structure or &quot;craft&quot;  connecting the lights was visible and no stars were obscured. Elevation was approximately thirty degrees. A faint engine noise could be heard. Two other people in separate houses under the apparent path of the lights reported hearing a rumbling sound from something passing overhead. While standing in a street in Grandview, WA, the lights was first seen to the north traveling east. Over the next five minutes they traveled one complete circle around the town until reaching the point where first sighted. Apparent radius of route was maybe three miles.

I remember the lights more than anything. The only thing you left out from my recollection was that you suddenly yelled that the craft had gone straight up almost instantly while it was still at a great distance, and when I looked up, it was much higher over the horizon. I&apos;ve always wondered to this day why I can&apos;t reconstruct an image in my mind of exactly what shape the object was, because it went almost directly over our heads at a low altitude. Oddly enough, I&apos;ve been thinking about this incident a lot lately, but I don&apos;t know why. The only shape I remember was triangular. I wish I could go back to that instant and see it again. I firmly believe that UFO&apos;s are a reality, although I wonder why so many reliable sightings describe so many different sizes and shapes of these craft. If you ever remember anything else about that night, let me know. It&apos;s always gnawed at me. Love,  ((name deleted))----- Original Message ----- From: ((name deleted)) To: ((name deleted)) Cc: ((name deleted))Sent: Thursday, October 16, 2003 9:30 AM Subject: Emailing: ((deleted)) Dear ((name deleted)),  I don&apos;t know why I feel so strongly about writing this down.  I guess I want to know more about what I don&apos;t know,  and I believe that desire is healthy.  The amount of time I spend thinking about the &quot;U.F.O. phenomena; however, well, it might be time spent better doing something else...but I digress.  I have read some references made to a U.F.O. &quot;flap&quot; which occurred in the southeastern United States circa 1974-1975 and in fact I remember reading in the Montgomery Advertiser at that time some articles mentioning some U.F.O. sightings.What did we see that night...was it September of 1974...on our way to Auburn?   As I remember, we were going up there to a &quot;concert&quot;...a band that a friend of yours was in maybe?  What I remember is this...We were on I-85 heading to Auburn from Montgomery and it seemed as if it were around 8:00 P.M. when we left Mom and Dad&apos;s.  It seems as if we were about half way to Auburn when I first noticed a bright white &quot;star-like/planet Venus-like light appearing many miles ahead of us on the right side of the interstate.  I had been looking at it and initially thought it was Venus.  I remember asking you to look at it and I remember even joking about wouldn&apos;t it be cool if it were a UFO but I didn&apos;t believe it was anything other than a planet or a star when I first saw it.  That is until I / we noticed it moving...crossing over the interstate and coming toward us.  I remember seeing the object changing colors and intensity from bright white, to a dimmer white, to a medium intensity red and back to white again 2 or 3 times.  The colors seemed to alternate in time from 10 to 30 seconds.  I remember the object crossing back over the interstate to our side continuing straight toward us.  I remember one or both of us saying that the object wasn&apos;t any star or planet.  I remember the object seemed to cross back over to our left and us pulling off to the shoulder of the interstate.  I remember we got out of the car, was it Dad&apos;s old Galaxy 500?  It seemed as if we sort of just leaned against the car waiting for this thing approaching us.  I remember being very excited at seeing something neither of us had ever seen before but I don&apos;t remember being at all afraid.  I know I had no doubt that you wouldn&apos;t let anything happen to me...not without one hell of a fight anyway.  When it passed overhead it seemed to be over the middle of the interstate...maybe 500 feet up.  My recollection of what exactly this thing looked like seems hazy or maybe it&apos;s because I had never before or since seen anything that looked like &quot;it&quot; ! looked.  It seemed to me to be somewhat of an elongated &quot;sewing-thread spool&quot; with the flat ends oriented to the top and bottom of the &quot;craft&quot;.  I had the distinct impression there was an inside and an outside dimension to this &quot;thing&quot; because it looked as if there were a &quot;triangular-shaped &apos;window&apos; or translucent &apos;something&apos; giving me the distinct impression of looking into the &quot;craft&quot;.  I remember thinking the interior was illuminated by red light but that there was some white light or lights on the exterior of this &quot;thing&quot;.  It did not make a sound.  It seemed to be moving 30 to 40 m.p.h..  How big was it?  Maybe 10 times bigger than our car...I can&apos;t really get a good grasp of it&apos;s size.  I remember we watched it continue on it&apos;s way seemingly following the interstate.  I don&apos;t remember it disappearing.  I remember getting back in the car and continuing on our way and I remember wanting to turn around and try to catch back up to it.  It seems as if we did turn around at an exit but for some reason I&apos;m not sure if it was the first exit we passed or an exit further on.  I believe we did turn around and head back towards Montgomery.  I believe we drove most of the way back to Montgomery but when we didn&apos;t see &quot;it&quot; again, we turned back toward Auburn.  I don&apos;t remember anything more of that night clearly.  I seem to remember standing in your dorm and relating our experience of the evening to a friend of yours.  Nothing else.Well, there, my recollection is put into writing.  I think it odd that I haven&apos;t written this down before now.  I absolutely don&apos;t care one wit of what anybody thinks of me recounting this event.  I  believe we saw a &quot;craft&quot; under intelligent control that night but I don&apos;t know that it was extraterrestrial.  I do know that it was something outside of any other experience I&apos;ve ever had.  I hope I have another experience like it again.  I love you ((name deleted)).  I&apos;m glad I was with you that night.  Love,", "UFO with black exhaust sighted in Independence, MO Oct. 11, 2003The night sky was overcast with an odd low greenish haze/fog with the full bright moon shining through it evenly all over the sky.  It was bright enough to be able to see well enough to walk without a flashlight.  It was not raining and the temperature was cool. I noticed an uneven break in the clouds at about 75 degrees from the horizon and pointed it out to my brother and daughter who were with me.  We noted that there was a very dark black cloud right behind this light area, and no other dark clouds in the sky.  The object moved from South to North very slowly but the bright light did not change shape, so I began to suspect that we were not looking at a break in the clouds at all, but rather a craft of some sort with a round half moon shape with fog concealing it.  The black cloud did change shape constantly and looked like some type of exhaust, but it stayed right behind the bright object.  At one point, I could see stars behind both the black and white areas at the same time.  It was very large - the size of a lunch plate held at arm&apos;s length. No sound was heard by any of us. We watched it for about 10 minutes until it dissapeared from sight.  It is hard to explain, but I &quot;felt&quot; that it was a very large craft that might have been transparent with a black exhaust coming from it.  I would be very interested in finding out if anyone else saw this. It is interesting to note that I drove my brother home right after this incident and after only 10 minutes we saw that the entire sky was free of any fog,haze or clouds, and the full moon was out.  I wonder if the UFO caused the fog in order to conceal itself. I have no photos as I knew they would not come out, but I could do a drawing of it if desired.", "I had just had my car tuned-up that day and my mother and I were on our way to work at an ammunition plant, 2nd shift.

All of the lights on the car went out also except the idiot lights on the dash.  I put the flashlight togather and it would not work.  I took out my lighter and got out to check the engine.  My mother was helping look for loose wire ect. and was right next to me.  Being late at night and next/ between wood and a swampy area you hear a lot of frogs, owls,dos and other night dwellers calling.  When the noise stopped my mom started looking around to see why.  I was still under the hood trying to see what was wrong with the car.  When mom asked me what that thing was I didn&apos;t really understand what she was talking about until she pointed out the craft.  As there was no moon its a little hard to tell the size but I think that it was about as big as a football field long and twenty to thirty feet high.  It had lights around the edge.  These lights flashed in an altrenating pattern of red, white, yellow and blue or green.  There was no noise at all and it was moving very slowly following the power lines down the river.  I guess that we watched this object for three to five minutes.  In all this time there wasn&apos;t a sound from any animal in the area, but the minute that it went out of sight all the frog, owls ect. started back up.  Mom and I got back in the car and were trying to figure out what to do whent I noticed that the headlamps were back on.  I looked at Mom and said maybe the car would start.  Sure enough it started just like a new car and we drove on to Lone Rock and the first bar.  That was the only time I have ever had a drink before going to work. Mom and I only talke to each other about this for years.  No one else.

It stayed in the clouds darting back and forth and changing shapes. It was dark in color and it would fly back and forth in the cloud.

Then suddenly it changed direction from horizontal to a rising 60 degrees back to the west and covered a great distance that was either a rise in altitude or approach to our location. At the distance that it appeared to be a few inches of travel to us was miles of distance.

It had to travel at great distances in its location since it was a good ways distant from us and out over the ocean. It could not have been one of the jets from our air station because they were grounded in the evening because at that time Japan had a no fly rule to keep the noise levels down during the night hours.

My wife and I were eating dinner at the Himalayian Inn restaurant, in a courtyard off the town square of Sonoma. All of the lights went out in the open-air courtyard and alley that is shared by several businesses, including an Irish pub restaurant. We would learn after dinner that the lights had gone out in the eastern half of the town. We never heard what happened or why. It was about dusk when we had decided to eat dinner, choosing to sit outside because of the pleasant night.  We were in the middle of the main course when the lights went out.  The restaurant owner came out and we chatted for few minutes as I pointed out a couple constellations and Mars.  He went back inside to find candles and flashlights, while I sat down to finish my dinner. Just after sitting down I saw a very bright light, similar in luminosity to the International Space Station [ISS], which I&apos;ve seen on several previous occasions. The light was moving directly north, roughly parallel to the town square.  Because we were under a small veranda, I only caught glimpse of the bright light when it was at about a 60 degree angle.  It moved at a speed similar to ISS, but after about 2 seconds, its light suddenly dimmed and for the remainder of the sighting it gradually faded out of sight. I commented to my wife about it, but she hadn&apos;t seen it. We were in Sonoma for the Michelin Challenge Bibendum as members of the invited press. I own a small refractor telescope and have frequently observed satellites with my naked eye, through binoculars and through the Richfield telescope. Had the object not suddenly faded in luminocity, I would have concluded it might have been the ISS, which will also exhibit similar behavior when it crosses into the earth&apos;s shadow. However, since this object was moving almost due north on an apparent track that would keep it in the sun&apos;s light, I suspect the drop in luminocity would be attributable to other factors.", "Miraculous angelic orb of incredible speed seen by two witnesses in Simi Valley, March, 1978.At 22:00 hours on the evening of March 7, 1978 my friend, Steve Glick, and I were returning from a drive-in movie back to my home at ((street deleted)) Ave. in the city of Simi Valley, CA. I was driving a 1966 Dodge Dart and pulled into my driveway, which was due North. As we got out of the car, my friend said with great emphasis &quot;what the (bleep) is that&quot;. I looked up into a cloudless night sky and at an altitude of about one to two thousand feet above us, at a distance of perhaps five miles, was a transluscent orb of oval shape travelling horizontal to the ground at an extraordinary rate of speed. Within moments the orb then banked downward and then shot straight up into a cloudless night sky and accelerated to a rate beyond the realm of aviation that I was aware of and then blinked once and disappeared. The entire event took less then fifteen seconds. It was clearly not a vessel that either of us had ever seen before and, in fact, did not appear to be a vessel at all but a kind of &quot;angelic&quot; or &quot;celestial&quot; plasma. It did not hurt our eyes to look at it and seemed to operate with intelligence and trajectorical intent. The acceleration of the orb was in the realm of the miraculous and caused us both to question what we had seen, or if we had indeed experienced this at all. My friend then said to me &quot;We didn&apos;t see that&quot; and to this day has not spoken of the event at all. I, however, continue to be informed and changed by it to this day. I would say this UFO experience was more of an &quot;Angelic&quot; witnessing rather than an aviation event.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We were in a residential neighborhood.It was dark out. About 8:00pm. There were houses accross the street from us. Very close. While chatting with my friend i looked accross the street. And i glanced up, up above a house accross the street. There were tall trees directly behind this house. And what i saw was a ring of lights in a circle. It was very large, bigger than a couple houses put together. The lights were different colors, they were very bright alsmost glowing. They were in a horizontal plane above this house, just sitting there. And i said what the heck is that, well putting it nicely. My friend said i dont know. I said thats not normally there, and she said no. And i said its not making any sound. It was close enough we should have heard some sort of noise . I mean it was directly accross the street from us. I said well it cant be a balloon  becuase a balloon would have fire, and would not be out at night anyway. Then all of the sudden it started moving. It was almost directly over the house accross the street from us, and directly above the trees. It started moving away from us. There was no sound. It was so strange. Anything that big, should have made noises, and that close. It did not move up it went sideways , horzontally. Away from us. Almost as if it knew we were looking at it. Before it moved it was just sitting there above the trees, then it just started moving , away from us. So i said lets get in the car and chase it , and get another look, but by the time we went around the block , it was gone. I thought about calling the police, but said noone would believe us. So ive only told a few people about this, and most people say they believe me. Scince this happened to me, im always watching the skys. Hoping to see something again.

It had a white light that shined straight down and made no noise at all that he remembered. This frightened him quite a bit and he went in the hanger where the watch supervisor was at his desk and asked him to come and see the craft.When they went back outside it was gone but the fellow who saw it was so excited that he wanted to call the Air Force early warning radar site which was also on the base at that time.The radar site said, &quot;Yes we saw something on radar but we get blips like that all the time.&quot; This tells me the Air Force was very aware of what it was. Also none of us knew of groom lake at the time which was only a short jet flight from Fallon.I always wondered where they got it if it was Air Force.This was all duly entered into the VA-125 night watch log.The witness took a lot of flack over the sighting and the next day in the log someone wrote. 2100 no saucers sighted.However the man who sighted was not the kind of person that made things up or sought attention by doing things like that.Obviously I&apos;m not a witness.

Ofcourse i wasn&apos;t, but the physical feeling of a struggle to raise up off the couch was definitely present. As i could only sit  i couldnt stand still have no clue as to why. i noticed the woods behind my house was completely illuminated as if there were flood lights on or a landing light on a helicopter as if it was searching. I know for a fact it wasn&apos;t any rotory aircraft. I also recall as if i was very cold  and started to develop goosebumps in a big way. Eventually i was able to force myself to stand up.

Just some background on my &apos;observing&apos; experience.My sighting was not during these exercises but during an outing to a drive-in theater.  It was still light out and I was biding time waiting for it to be dark enough for the movies to begin.  Above and to the left of the screen I noticed an object (I would place it as North, North - West, to the left of the Mt. Lemmon/Catalina range as you face it from north/west Tucson and about 30 deg. above the horizon) I can best describe as blimp shaped but somewhat narrower, pointed ends, silver in color but I don&apos;t recall it as being reflective, NO protrusions such as the cabin or fins that a blimp would have.  I first thought that it was some kind of experimental weather balloon but I noticed two other factors that didn&apos;t fit that profile.The first was a cloud looking trail, long and snake like but detached from the object as if the object had stopped or stalled where it now was.  The observance of the trail (white/gray colored) lead me to the second observation of the object, neither the trail or the object were moving much if at all.  Now I&apos;m starting to realize how distant in height and large this object is.  My estimate is maybe three football fields in length although it is very difficult to estimate since there weren&apos;t any nearby objects to compare it to.  The object and the trail seemed to stay pretty much in the same position for the next 15 minutes of so. There was a noticeable but slow drift and change in the trail during this time.During that time, I took advantage of other witnesses in the car next to me.  I remember there being at least three people in that vehicle, a convertible.  I asked them what they thought the object was.  I still remember the reply clearly, a fellow sitting in the front seat starred again at the object and said &quot;I&apos;ll tell you what, I&apos;m in the Air Force and it&apos;s nothing that I have ever seen&quot; (Tucson as you know is the home of Davis-Monthan Air Force Base).  This was great confirmation that my imagination wasn&apos;t playing tricks on me.I hated to loose sight of the object but before it was totally dark, I wanted to make my way the snack bar and use the pay phone to call the newspaper and ask if there were any reports coming in.  They didn&apos;t even seem to comprehend my question so I didn&apos;t get very far in that direction.  It really made me wonder if they were playing dumb!  Here this object was in plain sight, dozens of people just at the drive-in could observe it, surely you would think the newspaper would have some reports.  Maybe I just called too soon or just got the wrong individual. As I went back to read your archives to see if there were any related sightings, another report brought back something I had observed some years earlier although not really a UFO sighting.  as a preteen/teenager in Tucson , I use to make an almost daily trek from my home to the nearby drugstore.  The route took me through a small area of undeveloped property (desert vegetation), a route I knew with my eyes closed.  On one trip to the store (1959-61?) I couldn&apos;t help noticing a round area where all the cactus and shrubs had been smashed to the ground, a perfectly round area.  Not a very large area maybe 10ft.  I also noticed some tracks, each track mark had three indentations as if a foot with three pads or toes.  I&apos;m fuzzy on the space between the tracks, could have been two feet or more apart but I&apos;m not sure I remember the actual spacing.  Could be rabbit tracks or... well I&apos;m not much for recognizing animal tracks, I&apos;ll leave that to someone else. End report.((NUFORC Note:  Dates of two incidents are approximate.  PD))", "White lights race through the sky in clear daylight, fighters in persuitFirst saw bright tadpole light in perfectly clear sky speeding from north to south, from horizon to overhead in 15 seconds, well up in atmosphere. As it got overhead, it slowed and came to stop, then proceded to make maneuvers in loops, forwards and backwards, stopped again and then raced off east.  About 5 minutes later 3 F-16s arrived and circled in attack formation for approximately 15 minutes.  Another 2 similar lights moved through the sky in similar patterns and directions over the next 2 hours after the first event.", "Lights like a plane, not exactly the same, and disappearing after trees blocked my view.My boyriend and I and our baby were driving North on US1 through Rockledge, and I saw some flashing lights up ahead and to the west.  The area has lots of radio antenae in the area, but what I saw seemed to be an airplane heading North as well. As I watched (from the backseat), through the front windsheild, I saw two white lights perfectly opposite from each other, and two red lights.  One was to the left of the leftmost white light, and the other was in the middle, a bit more forward (sort of in a triangle formation) than the two white lights, sort of taking the &apos;point&apos;.  The red lights would alternate between which one was on an off. I asked my boyfriend what it was, and, knowing that I was a stargazer who often mistook things for UFOs, he said it was an airplane.  I looked again, and saw that it seemed to be descending (like an airplane would).  I asked what it was doing, and he suggested landing.  However, I know that there are no landing areas anywhere near where it was (for those familiar with the area, it was northwest of the Gannette/Florida Today office building).  He suggested Orlando, and I said that it&apos;s too low and it wouldn&apos;t make it to Orlando before it landed.  Then he suggested Merritt Island, and it was headed in the wrong direction.  Then he suggested Titusville, which was northward of where we were, and I conceded... However, the low flying plane seems to slow down, because now I could see it through the driver&apos;s side window.  I couldn&apos;t see any body at this point, but now the white lights were gone, and the red lights were there, still alternating between on and off. Then, I guess we caught up with it so it was by the rear-driver&apos;s side window.  I looked out and saw a very vague black/gray triangularish shape.  I couldn&apos;t locate any wings, however, and at that point, the red lights were both on at the same time. I looked forward and told my boyfriend something, and when I looked back to look at it, we drove past an area that blocked the &quot;plane&quot; with lots of trees.  When we broke free, the craft was no longer there.  When the road curved to the northwest a bit, I looked again, and still couldn&apos;t find it.  I looked every direction and still couldn&apos;t find anything. I might not know a lot of aircraft, but I was under the impression that that a) had blue lights as well as red, and b) couldn&apos;t disappear suddenly.  I like looking for UFOs, and my boyfriend doesn&apos;t exactly disapprove of it.. but he does make fun of me for it sometimes.  I think it probably would take something extraordinary for him to believe that what I saw was really a UFO. A story about what was happening in the county that night:  There was a hostage situation abotu 20-30 miles south of where I spotted the UFO.. but it had ended  at 7pm, about 4 hours earlier than when I saw the UFO.", "The motionless objects sparkled like jewels,then came together and back to formstion in a split second.I was unloading the 4-runner and looked sse and noticed a very bright light that seemed to get even more intense and puse back to just extremely bright. Colors at the center changed quickly. Blue,red,silver,orange. It was like a jewel or prizm spinning. It was low on the horizon, not moving, I got my girl friend out side. Then I noticed that 3 more of these objects had the same type of colors pulsing but not nearly as intense as the lowest one. They were far lower in the sky than stars you could discern easily. The three lower intensity ones emitted a gold to bronze color so at first I thought them to be satilights and went back to watching the lowest and brightest one. They were all in a formation of a square. The brite one at 10-15 deg obove horizon and the one on the right was to the lower right of Orions belt. Suddenly they came together and went back as quick as the shutter of a camera could click. They must have covered thousands of miles and back to their original formation in a split second. Now the lowest one got even brighter and looked like the Christmas star depicted in drawings with the rods of light or energy being expelled in every direction at the same time the other three seemed to mellow to a redish-gold color like they were cooling off. I called 911 and asked the dispatcher if any one else had reported an unusual event in the SSE sky and she told me no. I know what I saw.", "hook shape of multiple small lights gliding silently at night during lunar eclipseA hook shape comprised of about 30 small white lights (as if two sides of a traingle) moving silently from the northeast and curving across the sky towards the northwest, where it eventually went beyond my sight line. This was during the lunar eclipse. The lights did not change configuration, no blinking. It seemed to maintain a consistent altitude and speed.((NUFORC Note:  One of many similar reports from the New England, New Jersey, and New York City area.

The light was so intense that ((name deleted)) turned around at the same time I was saying &ldquo;look at that&rdquo;.The object split into six objects each 1/4 the size of the original. One object moved upward, two flew right, two flew left and one moved straight ahead. The pattern was similar to a five pointed star, with each tip moving away as a ball of light. As the object separated the individual balls changed color and stretched. The color was white, blue and red smeared or streaked as they moved. The upper ball and the two to the left disappear leaving the right two coming toward our location and grouping together about 25 to 50 apart. These two began to slowly blink in a ruby red color, one blink about every 4 or 5 seconds.They flew within about 8 or 9 hundred yards of our location in a arc back toward the mountain(north). ((nameds deleted)) saw this. The center object turned yellow and move toward the lake and disappeared also( we heard a faint jet sound at this point). We stood outside and talked about what we had saw and about two or three minutes latter a shower of sparks fell into the lake area. The shower of sparks was about 1 hundred to 150 feet long and about 8 to 10 feet wide ,it fell to the south east . About 10 minutes latter we heard a large military helicopter .It came over the mountains to the south very low to the terrain, it flew to the location of the thing that fell made a turn over the location then flew toward Kernville. ((name deleted)) and I went down to the lake to see if we could see anything .There was an odor of hot metal in the air. There was a truck near the location where we estimated the object to be. The truck was moving side to side and around in circles someone was walking in front of it. We decided to try to ask them if they had seen the object but the truck sped off.((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION FROM WITNESS))The data box should have instructions &quot; not to include personal data except first names&quot;. The reason that mine was included is I first wrote the report on correl then copied it to the spot.Also, to bad someone could not come up to investigate as stuff from the yellow object fell to the ground or in the lake near the shore(alot of stuff).There was one other vehicle looking in the area for it, as my son and I were.If the lake continues to get lower it may become visible.

I suddenly noticed the stars disappear momentarily which then transferred my vision on to what caused the effect - a completely dark triangular craft with two or three unblinking red lights, very small lights, on the top of it.  I immediately thought it was an airplane as Jefferson County Airport is only 5-6 miles away, but it was *completely* silent.  It was maybe 3 blocks away from me at an altitude of about 500 feet and traveling no more than 60mph or so.  I&apos;d estimate it&apos;s size at about 3 times that of a standard F16 fighter.  It was most definitely not a stealth fighter or a B2  bomber; I&apos;m familiar with military and civilian aircraft and this fit none of the profiles.   Once I was able to track it with my vision I followed it&apos;s path, which was south, and was able to see three dim white lights at each corner of the triangle.  Also at this time, I was able to see the &quot;rear&quot; end of the craft which exhibited 3 or 4 (was hard to tell) circular, amber-colored (or glowing amber, I&apos;m not sure) lights.

The lights wonI lived on Portage lake in Michigan, near Ann Arbor. My friend ((name deleted)) and I were standing on the dock and noticed seveal lights approaching from the west , they were quite high- estimated at at least 20,000 ft. They were travelling at a very high rate of speed, and approx 70 degrees overhead, they slowed and almost stopped.They were &quot;flying &quot;in a V formation. several minutes after the initial sighting, comin from the same direction that the lights had come from, several more lights appeared going toward the lights. We soon recognized these to be jet planes(presumably military). As they got closer to the lights, the UFOs departed at an incredible rate of speed, leaving the &quot;chase&quot; planes far behind. The time frame for the ufos to dissapear from overhead to the horizon was maybe 3-5 seconds. The planes remained in the general area flying a search type grid for 10 minutes more, and then returned back in the direction they had come from. Within the next several days we talked to a number of other people who lived in the area within a 10 mile radius of where we were, and they had witnessed the same objects, complete with &quot;chase&quot; planes as we had within the same time frame.I am sorry the date is only an estimate, I have never documented the incident until now.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was the shadow of 6 perfect, unattached circles, moving at about walking pace. From my perspective, each circle on the ground was about the size of an over-sized dinner plate. This was a perfectly sunny and cloudless day, but when I looked up toward the sky to see the cause of the shadow, there was nothing. It was quite amazing to me, I remember, that I couldn&apos;t see what was causing the shadow, despite it&apos;s large dimensions. Any other craft casting a shadow that large would have been easily spotted in the sky. I followed the shadow for about 20 yards until the yard ran out and thich hedges obstructed me. My first immediate reaction was to run inside to tell my parents (since my father had a sighting in 1962, of a green cigar in the night sky over Treasure Island, FL), so I knew that he would ubderstand.

When we both got out of our trucks, we both immediately looked up to the South West sky and couldn&rsquo;t believe what we were seeing. We immediately ran towards the open fields out back to get a better look and we saw a bright light, bright as a star, moving west to east across the mountain ridgeline with what looked like two aircraft following it. The light began to move erratically and then disappeared like in a second&rsquo;s time. The two aircraft, which I can&rsquo;t really call them jets, continued East bound and then both turned and went up in elevation and began to head north right over us. As me and w#2 were looking at the aircraft coming towards us, we had the most weirdest feeling that something is going on ....verrry strange. The two aircraft had lights on them and the one to the right had a more common look to it. The aircraft on the left was larger and had more lights of which many were on and different colors. They seemed to be changing position throughout the pass over. As the aircrafts came directly over us, we noticed that first of all, everything was silent and as we watched them the one on the left seemed to have a reddish glow in front of it and it was hard to stay focused on because it appeared to be changing shapes or something. It, to me, had a mutli shape to it something like the Star Trek Enterprise. w#2 said it looked like a shape of a stingray. Just as the aircraft passed by over us at a very slow pace, we noticed that the aircraft on the right had somehow disappeared and the strange looking one on the left, began to change it&rsquo;s lights and the back of it had two bright lights that began to move in towards each other and then began moving apart and moved apart enough that the shape of the craft seemed to have changed. We were amazed that we heard absolutely nothing! Not even noises of vehicles or anything. It was very tranquil as if we were in a dream or something. At this point, 7:41 pm, I made a phone call and w#3 was alerted. Me and w#2 then were saying to each other, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe this just happened&ldquo;. Then a moment later, the bright light appeared almost right over us, much closer this time and we held upon to each other&rsquo;s shirts and watched this light, that was still for a moment, while saying over and over again, &ldquo;Oh My God, Oh My God,&ldquo; The bright object then began to make a few moves and then it began to travel from West to East and simply disappeared. W#3 immediately looked outside and apparently he witnessed the one aircraft and observed that it did not look like a jet, while moments later, he witnessed the bright light travel fast from West to East. He then came down with an instant severe head ache. Myself and w#2 did not experience any type of headache. While we were looking to the East basically at Mars and the almost full moon, we were just so numb to as what just happened and then we noticed an enormous amount of air traffic in all directions in the sky. We both said, where did all these come from? Then a moment later, while looking back at the moon, a jet comes from the Northeast heading Southwest and left a fat lingering contrail right in the path of the moon. I immediately said, &ldquo;Now, with all the strange stuff that just happened, what the heck is the reason for that?&rdquo;  Then at around 8pm the skies were back to normal with no air traffic. The entire event lasted maybe about 30 minutes of which me and w#2 both left of our doors to the trucks open out in the driveway and they were both dinging the whole time. Even though it lasted almost thirty minutes, the entire time felt like no more than two minutes. This event prompted me to write about it to the Conway Daily Sun with contact numbers and email and my letter appeared in Friday&rsquo;s edition. I have since received approximately 12 phone messages, 8 emails, and 3 actual phone conversations. Apparently, we had a similar event take place the next night, on Thursday, when apparently the aircraft that was tracking this light or fireball, tried to keep up with it, from which possibly they caused two different sonic booms and many people then, thought something is very wrong. these are just some of the eyewitness&rsquo;s without knowing my story  One woman called me Friday morning from Effingham and said she was out for a walk and she saw what looked like a fireball or something go screaming by West to East and then moments later two jets heading in the same direction. I had reports from a man in Woonsocket village in West Ossipee about a sonic boom he heard and then another one shortly after, then as he went outside to look if he could see anything, he didn&rsquo;t, but he heard jet engines for about two minutes or so. A women in Edelweiss about a boom that &ldquo;rocked her house&ldquo;, she thought &ldquo;this is it, were going&rdquo;. She was told by her association that it was probably a sonic boom that happens occasionally here  She did hear other booms about 20 minutes later but they were off in a distance. I had another man from Madison tell me that he heard just a massive explosion that shook his well built house and all was quiet with no sirens or any sign of an emergency. He didn&rsquo;t know what happened..  I then had a women who was walking near the high school and said, &ldquo;she saw two air craft. One had it&rsquo;s normal flashing lights, and right above it, there was another something flying, had maybe two or three lights and it was maybe a little ways ahead of the plane, it was pretty strange and I wasn&rsquo;t sure that I was seeing things myself.&rdquo;  A man from Bartlett asked me if it was a light moving against all laws of physics?  Another Bartlett man saw the light and looked away for a second or so, and it was gone. A man from Berlin had a bad dream Wed. night that his house was visited by a UFO and now he is just curious what did happen down in our neck of the woods... He&rsquo;s never had anything like that happen to him before. He&rsquo;s not a reporter but he would like to know what went on. He believes that stuff like that can happen . A women in North Conway saw the event  A women from Chatham saw it, but wouldn&rsquo;t tell me until I told her. Another women and four other fellow workers in North Conway who witnessed a silvery strange looking thing over the Moat Mountains.      I don&apos;t know if this is what u saw but this is what my friend and I saw from The Vista in Inter vale that night and it was probably a little later then 7:30...closer to 9:30 till maybe 10... My friend and I work in retail and we usually go to the Vista after work and talk and relax...We are there quite a bit and have seen some interesting events should I call them in the skies over Bartlett and surrounding areas.......but Wednesday night was totally different.....There seem to be as we were sitting in my friends vehicle that above the mtns straight ahead of us and above was an object that &quot;hovered&quot; for a very long time it flashed colored lights and seemed from the distance that we were seeing it go in a track not in circles but like a square or rectangle. and it would do much like a hover-craft bob up and down but all of a sudden we saw flashes of ground light from behind the mtns or seemed to be anyway. We must have watched that thing for a good 15 min just doing what it was doing and then it began to descend behind the mtns and it dropped quickly and then totally disappeared out range...My friend and I left quite perplexed...because we had never seen anything like that before......not at the Vista anyway...and that leads me to another part of this.....my friend and her brother watched something from her window Thursday night...she said she saw a plane a jet and it seemed to be chasing a &quot;light&quot; in the sky far ahead of it...the light would appear and disappear it seemed to be going at a tremendous rate of speed....she said there were two Sonic booms that shook her house and everything in it! And she wanted to know if any one else had reported that BOOM! She lives in Madison,NH........Please email me back I would love to know what u saw...and if she and I witnessed anything like you and yours did? I was so excited to see someone had seen something that I couldn&apos;t believe ....... My  daughter told me that you have seen things in the sky before and if you say you did you probably did! I have no doubt in my mind of that!  Have a great day and keep in touch with me please we could compare notes I am sure......... A fellow believer,  Hi, I saw your letter in the paper regarding strange events in the sky  Wednesday evening. Well, what my daughter and I saw was before sunset  and it  was in the west, northwest sky and not a cloud in the sky except for  this  very strange, almost looked like a crescent shaped cloud, but it was  very  odd looking and both my daughter and I were like, What the heck is  that? It  was driving us nuts. We were on our way to Hannaford&apos;s to do some  shopping  and when we came out it was dark and we could not find the object  again. Although, I think my daughter said she saw it.    Hello,  I am sending this email in response to your letter sent in to the  Conway Daily Sun. Something....odd seemed to happen last night. It was around 7:45-8:00, when we heard a large crash that shook  the house. It almost seemed the window in the living room was  going to fall out of place. We had no idea what happened, so we  ran to get flashlights and ran outside. Immediately we heard a plane, but it seemed closer then usual. We  looked up and saw a moving light, we presumed a plane. So we went  around the property, looking for whatever happened. You&apos;d think it  wouldn&apos;t be that big of a deal normally. Except the shockwave was  so sudden and intense we both seemed to have a bad feeling about  it. We didn&apos;t find anything, but a few strange occurrences happened. First of all, we live in Madison, and the most air traffic we get  is 1 plane a week. Last night we heard, at least, 4 air planes in  less then an hour. One of which was like one we had never seen  before. It had 2 very rapid flashing lights that flashed from the  wing and belly. Also, one of my our friends also heard the same thing. They seemed  to experience the &apos;Shockwave&apos; that rattled the windows, but  nothing else. Finally, one of our friends that live in Conway experienced  nothing, so it seems very &apos;centralized&apos; to where we are. We don&apos;t think it could be an earthquake, as it felt more like an  impact. Not sure if has anything to do with your sighting, but  it&apos;s too coincidental to ignore. Perhaps they are connected. If you think there IS some connection, let us know. Thanks    &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  3 of us saw this light show...it was fun to watch see ya around the town", "3 starlike lights moving together in unison very bright and low, then disappearing together.3 lights about 120,000 feet, 160degress SE of Tucson, looking similar to stars, moving closer than further away, back and forth for the duration of about 30-35 minutes and then suddenly dimmed and disappeared.", "The object appeared to be a large airplane, but it was a dark grayish color unlike any any military planes. My wife and I were driving along the highway, neither of us remember any other traffic on the road. We first noticed that the craft seemed to be   be standing still in the sky so we slowed down and finally pulled over to the side of the road. We opened the window and even though the (plane) was not very high i n the sky, it made no sound. Eventually I got out of the car and walked to the side of the road. I remember the gravel under my feet. My wife says she doesn&apos;t rememeber me leaving the car, so that remains unclear. Shortly after the incident, my wife and I just returned from a party were entering our home when the phone rang. The person on the other end said he was with a ufo group that met regularly at lakehurst navel base. He asked if I had seen something unusual or reported a ufo. Since My wife and I had told no one  of our sighting, and because he got my first name right and my last name wrong and I had never heard of the group he spoke of I quickly rejected his offer. My wife and I discussed again what we had seen. We surmised that we had seen some new military aircraft, larger than a 747 that could remain staionary for almost a half an hour without making a sound. We felt after that phone call it might be best to stick to that story, even to ourselves. But that is only where the story starts. A couple of years later, to quick smoking we both decided to visit a hypotherapist. The sessions worked, but later my wife admitted to remembering something she had never told anyone. She told me that years before our sighting, she had experienced, missing time while driving near her home, in Woodbridge NJ. She said that it was almost like waking from a strange dream, angry and frustrated because she appeared to be lost only a few miles from her home. It was then that I was able to tell her that I remembered a similar occurance. While we were still just dating I was driving home from her house to my house at the Jersey shore, when I felt myself getting drowsy. The next thing I remembered was awaking at my exit, some 30 miles later, only checking my car&apos;s clock it seemed to have taken an hour to make a drive that usually took half the time. As we talked, my wife also related something else that raised the hairs on the back of my neck. She said that one night in bed she woke up only to see someone or something seated on the edge of our bed. She said that the figure said nothing only quietly stared at her, while she unsucsessfully attempted to wake me. She than said that she went back to sleep, and until the night she told me had forgotten the incident, chalking it up to a bad dream. For all these years since we have laughed off all those incidents as bad dreams or silly misconceptions, until last week, @sept 25th 2003. My daughter who is married and a mother, living with her family in Georgia, (we currently live in Arizona) was talking to me on the phone when she mentioned a strange incident. She told me that she had awakened a few nights before to see a troll like figure on the edge of her bed. When I hung up I told my wife she shouldn&apos;t have told our daughter about the troll, as we&apos;d called him for years. When she swore she hadn&apos;t and I saw the look of concern on her face, I knew she was telling the truth. We decided then not to tell our daughter anything, but to tell our story and see if some one else has experienced something similar. Nothing has happened to us persoonally recently but the incident with our daughter has left us perplexed. Are there any other intergenerational events like ours. By the way our daughter has never to our knowledge seen a ufo, though when she was in the second grade she won an essay contest by writing a story describing being taken up in a space ship. Her teacher was so enamored by the reality of the story she asked us if she could keep it and thinking nothing of it we let her. Now we are sorry we didn&apos;t keep that story, because it might have been a  true accounting of an encounter.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "The lights changed into the shape of a large triangular craft.I took a call from a witness who is living in Laval Quebec. He reported on October 13, 2003 that he was with his family driving back home on a very over cast night, with only a few stars shinning though some open patches through the cloud cover. He said it was so strange, he spotted two lights where he could see no stars shinning due to the cloud cover in the direction he was looking. As soon as he saw the two lights, another passenger in the car then noticed almost right away on his left side (drivers side) two more bright lights which appeared out of no where and were a little higher than the first two. He mentioned that they drive by this same area almost everyday and have never notice seeing any lights before in this area  The witness also told me there is an electrical plant, I believe he meant a power sub station/transmission towers and the lights were sitting low over the power outlet. As they were watching, and making a left turn onto another road one of the passengers in the car said, &quot;the lights are moving.&quot;  They stopped the vehicle and started to watch. All of a sudden the lights changed, and in the witnesses words, they changed into the shape of a large triangular craft. All the lights which were first noticed were all white in color and one single red light at the bottom of the object in the middle. As mentioned above, he said the object was very low, he told me his best guess would have put the object some where around 200 meters off the ground and right above the power station/transmission towers. They observed the whole event for approx: 3 minutes. As it started to move away from the area, it first would move slowly then picked up speed very rapidly and went out of their line of sight. The fellow told me this thing moved very easily, like sitting on a cushion of air. The gentleman said, this was a life changing experience for him. Thank you to the witness for the report.

I happened to have a perfect view.  What happened was impossible and I would like to talk about it more.  You can call me at 847-((number deleted)).Please contact me this has been disturbing me for a very long time and I need to talk about it.  Thanks  Hello my name is ((name deleted)) this is a real documented case of something very strange that took place.  No one knows or is willing to talk about it now.  It was documented on the 10:00 news in Las Vegas about 7 years ago.  The Government said nothing they neither denied it or tried to cover it up. I along with several friends had a perfect view.  However I did not see the entire outcome this just ending.  If I saw the whole thing I think I would have locked me up in a mental hospital.  Who knows maybe it affected me more than I thought.  And that is why I&apos;m acting so strangely.   My friend or co-worker saw the whole thing and that was the last day I saw him.  He never came back to work because it affected him so much.  All you had to be doing was looking south at the right time and you would have seen an amazing sight.  What I saw lasted only several minutes and the main display only a few seconds.  It will be a day that I will never forget.  I believe it took place August 13 on a Saturday night around 8:30pm what year I don&apos;t remember anymore.  It was about 6 or 7 years ago so the date can easily be checked out.   At any rate I was pulling into the showboat hotel.  I was driving a cab at the time so you know I was completely aware of my faculties.  It has just turned dark. Right around 9:30 I saw my friend or co-worker standing over his van looking directly south.  Normally my first instincts would be to ignore him and get into the cab line as quickly as possible.  But he looked like he might be in trouble so I pulled over got out of my cab and asked him if everything was all right.  He said yes but look at this.   I looked where he pointed and I said so what there&apos;s nothing there.  Everything was pitch black all you could see was a nice clear sky and the stars.  You could see forever that&apos;s how clear the night was.  Then all of a sudden something happened.  I thought I saw a shooting star. Beautiful crystal clear white lights shooting straight up like something you might see at the end of a comet.  Little tiny crystals or like very tiny little white stars.  Millions of them shooting straight up about as wide as normal full size airplane from wing to wing.  They were so clear you could see every one of them.  Like I said I my first thought was like it was a shooting star.  But then I said wait a second this thing is going straight up beginning from several miles up.  A shooting star goes across not up that defies the laws of physics.  It went up for maybe half a mile before the lights started to fade a way.  When I saw that I went into a state of shock.  When the lights fizzled away a tiny ball appeared about the size of a helicopter.  Difficult to tell the size because of the distance between us maybe 20 miles or so.  The ball hovered and from that ball more light appeared like the first white light.  But this time the color of the light was red very bright red.  It came shooting straight out towards us.  It came outwards and moved down at the same time.  And when that light sequence faded another ball appeared just like the last ball.  Now there are two balls at least 300 yards apart.  Now more red light appeared the same as the other red lights.  But these shot straight across.  And when those lights faded away another ball appeared.  The three balls formed a perfect triangle.  The crystal lights that appeared like I explained did it precise formation.  Extremely amazing thing.Now you have three orange balls about the size of helicopters hovering for several minutes.  The more you stared into this thing the more you thought you saw an out line of  a ship.  But you couldn&apos;t be sure.  Then the lower right ball started to rotate and all three balls vanished and that was all I saw.I discussed it with my friend and we saw the exact same thing.  But he saw the beginning, which I did not.  He said the lights came down from the stars.  He was so scared he took the rest of the night of and I never saw him again.   It was on the ten o&apos;clock news.  They did a short section on it.  With no answers then at the end of the news they said it was Elvis coming down to the mgm.   A lot of people who saw it convinced  themselves that it was all a fire works display.  But there was a problem with that.  The first problem was that it was completely silent.  The second problem was that the part I saw started half way up the earths atmosphere and was amazingly clear.  To this day I can&apos;t watch a fireworks display because it&apos;s way to primitive.  The next day no one would talk about it especially the news network.  When I told them I had a perfect view of it they just didn&apos;t want to hear about it.  Whatever this thing was it was huge.  The government can&apos;t hide things forever.  Eventually one time somebody will have no choice but to listen to the Aliens when they come.I need to talk about this please contact me at 847-((number deleted)) or e-mail me at ((e-address deleted)).  I know Aliens exsist and I belief that this is a bigger cover up than Roswell.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "back in 93I can&apos;t say for sure what exactly I saw.  I&apos;m not going to say that it is an alien spacecraft, but that is the closest I can come to describing it, or them.Actually, when I was about 10, me and my brothers where out walking along the road.  We noticed two strange metal objects off in the distance up in the air.  The strongest point I remember about this was that they made NO sound, whatsoever.  We witnessed them fly towards us, then slow way down.  THe two disk shaped objects seemed to have lights all around the edge of it.  I can&apos;t remember for sure how large they were.  But they completely stopped about fifty feet above the tree line above us.  At this point, we all were about to crap our pants, so we ran as fast as we could to our home, and refused to go back outside for hours.  My mother never believed us.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

On my right, above my head, coming from the Los Alamos area, appeared the biggest thing I had ever seen in the air.  It &quot;floated&quot; right over me, from the passenger side to the drivers side and kept going.  It was totally silent but  had a luminescence.  As it went over me, my old (real sheet metal) Ford truck stopped.  I turned off the radio, which was still working.  The truck would not restart.  I had to call a tow truck.  My cell phone worked.  The next day I called my long-time mechanic ((name deleted)) and asked him what was wrong.  He said to call the next day.  The next day he told me&quot;You&apos;ve got to come see this to believe it.  I&apos;ve been a mechanic for 40 years and I&apos;ve never seen this happen.&quot;  I went down to the shop.  He said &quot;I&apos;ve seen distributor caps crack, but I&apos;ve never seen an entire distributor pulled out and exploded.&quot;  He opened the hood, and there, magnetized, and stuck to the inside top of the hood, were the pieces of my distributor!

My now husband, then fiance, were sitting in a PARKED/TURNED OFF car at Garrett Mt. New Jersey, which overlooks the city of Paterson. He was sitting in the drivers seat and I was sitting in the passenger seat. We were looking at each other and talking. Suddenly, we noticed a HUGE disk hovering over the city of Paterson! It seemed as huge as the city itself. Underneath the disk there were round lights of red, blue, green and yellow. The lights seemed as though they were rotating. Within several seconds the radio started to flicker on our PARKED/TURNED OFF car. It was a fuzzy, unclear signal. I remember the car sputtering as though the engine was trying to turn over, my husband does not remember that; he only remembers the affect that the craft had on the radio. Then, just as suddenly as it appeared, the disk was simply gone. There were other people parked there that day. The odd thing is that we never got out of the car and nobody got out of their car. We have been searching for someone else who saw this.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

All I can say is it was a windy, dark night but the air was warm. She has caught something on film that is not all reflections of light - the shapes turn to beakers, rectangles, and squares - one definite blue ball and seems when they get near the lights on the poles, those lights get very bright. We need someone to watch this nearly hour video to get their opinion. At one point a light turns red in the sky, blurs and then suddenly becomes a silver bar. There is also a purple light that shows up too. The camera also was exhibiting different characteristics while filming - PLEASE CAN SOMEONE GET IN TOUCH WITH US!

I saw what I first thought to be shooting star come slowly into sight, moving quickly from slightly SW to slightly NE. It was visible long enough for me to think &quot;Oh, shooting star, cool....look at it go&quot; and then it slowly vanished. I had enough time to think &quot;That was cool...&quot; when an object came into sight at about the same rate but moving from NW to SE. It immediately struck me that this quite likely could be the same object but with a changed vector of about 45 degrees. It quickly disappeared from view. I sat and contemplated this for a bit and had decided a shooting star could hit the earth&apos;s atmoshphere and change directions when a 3rd object appeared moving from the North to the South but this object appeared to make 4 S curves before disappearing. At this point I checked the time with it being 21:45. There were no aircraft in the area, nor did I spot any satellites.", "A chervon object floating in the sky suddenly drops towards the earth and disappears.I saw a chevron type object floating still in the sky.  It was about 8 times bigger then the average star.  Suddenly it dropped straight down towards the ground and disappeared.  Very weird but very cool.  It wasn&apos;t a just a star cause I saw plenty of shooting stars that night.", "I am now a believer in UFO&apos;s because of my experience with a Green object last night.Last night while I was waiting for my girlfriend to get home from work I became bored with computer work so I went outside to look at the success of my attempt at burning leaves. I live out in the country and the only light was from my porch light and a large streetlight that&rsquo;s on the side of the house. After attempting to see if anything was burned and realizing it was too dark I took a deep break and looked up to see if I could see any stars. (Before I was heavily into computers I was very interested in astronomy so sometimes I just look to see what is out there). It was quite cloudy so I really couldn&rsquo;t see any so I turned opposite of the house to look see if I could see any peaking between clouds. When I turned I noticed an object that looked green with a glow. As a very skeptical person at first I thought to my self that it was some airplane. Then I realized after further observation that it was not an aircraft and it was like something I remember seeing when I was about 10 years old at my grandparents&rsquo; house in Ozark, Alabama. I watched it closely and tried not to blink. After what seemed to be a very long time because I was so full of excitement, but was realistically around 3 to 5 minutes the craft flashed an orange-red color and then disappeared. What I think is the most odd part and a part that actually gets me nervous for some reason, is the fact that I didn&rsquo;t mention it to my girlfriend when she came home, nor did I even think about it the rest of the night. It wasn&rsquo;t until this morning when I went to survey the progress my fire had made in the daylight I then remember what had happened. I ran inside and realized my girlfriend had already left for work and I had no one to tell. I then got on the Internet and searched for any information I could find about other sightings in my area and found a few, but none were like what I saw. I eventually found the National UFO Reporting Center&rsquo;s website and reported my sighting. As a person who was previously into astronomy and who used to wonder about life on other planets, but thought they were too far away to visit here and figured that most cases were hoaxes, I am now a true believer.", "Blue-White orb shoots across sky rapidly, then disappears, on an unusally clear, calm night.I didn&apos;t think this was much more than a shooting star until I saw the report from Bellevue, WA on the same evening.  (Bellevue is south of my location)  At approximately 12:20am, I was taking my dog for a final walk before going to bed.  The night was extremely calm, and the sky was extremely clear. (both rare in the Seattle area)  I stood in one spot, waiting for him to do his business, and was scanning the sky for satellites, and constellations.  I finished scanning the north sky, and turned to scan the southern sky (towards Bellevue), and just as I turned, I saw a bright blue-white light, about 5mm wide in the sky (from my point of view) very quickly shoot from west to east with no trail, and disappeared completely after it had traveled about 4 inches (once again, from my point of view).  I took note of the time, becuase it struck me as odd, and seemed to be too large in the sky to be a normal shooting star that would disappear so quickly. I live in a valley, so I cannot be sure how high it was, but it was to the south-south-east, and 65-75 degrees up.", "Back in 1992 I was workin at a dining facility on the Naval Base in Orlando, Florida. One morning, I had to call in sick but because I was ill and was barely awake at 4:30 AM, I mis-dialed the number (which I have forgotten since then). What I heard on the phone shocked and confused me. It was a pre-recorded female voice sayin something like &quot;Please enter your star classification code and your password and a UFO destruction team will be out to your site immediately.&quot; I cannot remember exactly now but I&apos;m sure it was very close to that. To be sure I wasn&apos;t hearing wrong I re-dialed the number and got the same message. Later that morning, I dialed the number so my brother could hear it and again so my mom could hear it. Sure enuff they heard the same thing. How odd. One might think it was someone&apos;s answering machine but it sounded too clear and there was no mention of leaving a message at the beep. A prank maybe? Who could have known I&apos;d call in sick to work at 4:30 AM? I&apos;m almost sure that message was legit.

Upon further observation it became apparent to us that they were not stars because they were smaller than all the other stars and they were flashing in a serial pattern (one after another in order) from green to red color. The flashing made the object appear to be spinning perhaps, or atleast moving slightly, but as we watched (and as we checked on it throughout the night) it continued to be present and obviously out of place. As we are star lovers and fond of viewing constellations we knew that it was not something normally visable in the night sky. It didn&apos;t move rapidly or look like a plane and our only other thought was that it was a space station, but we felt oddly; uncomfortably certain that it was simply a U.F.O.

I looked up in the sky and told my friend as a joke that &quot;what if a UFO would come from those clouds and pointed at those clouds moving towards us and started to move my hands from the clouds towards ourselves. Just as I was saying that my friends shouted &quot;LOOK A UFO&quot; and we both saw a circle shaped flying object just where I was pointing, coming out of nowhere with great speed with first a bright aura white light that later turned red midway in air, the craft then slowed than from it&acute;s incredible speed and then just vanished in the clear sky. We where shocked and started to figure out every possible explanation to what we had just wittnessed, we told eachother that it could have been a metroid (sp?) or a starfall although it was much closer and could both slow down and accelerate. It clearly felt that they where listening to our conversation since they showed up just as we where talking about them.

The report seems a bit &quot;theatrical&quot; to us, but that may be a false impression.  PD)) 3 craft on  interstate 80 west took control of my autoOh gee, where to start?... Um...  I was on my way to see my sister-in-law in Cleveland OH.  It is about a six to seven hour drive (depending on how you drive) from New York City.  I have made this trip several times alone; in fact, I should have been a trucker with all the miles I place on my vehicles a year.  I had taken a half-day from work so I could sleep and be well rested for the long drive.  I packed a few bottled waters, some Ritz crackers, and a handful of grapes.  I do not drink coffee, I do not smoke, and I do not use those &lsquo;no doze&rsquo; pills.  If I am tired, there is always a rest area or the side of the road.  Therefore, I guess I can say I was ready to travel, wide-awake, and not under any influences.The roads were empty, the main reason I travel at night, and the weather was slightly cloudy.  The last sign I recall seeing was the Chesapeake Watershed indicator- lets you know this area sends its water to VA.  I had very little company trucking wise on 80, they were all moving way to fast for me.  (Should anyone recall my little auto, I pulled into the passing lane to let you all fly by.  Something about lane changes at those speeds in large vehicles frightens me.)  It was uneventful driving.I would say halfway through PA, the sky cleared.  There were no headlights in my mirrors and no tail lights as far as I could see.  The stars came out.  I have a telescope and star gaze often.  I pulled over on the shoulder between mile markers.  (I am going back shortly and will get the exact mile.)  I was on 80 west.  Using 80 as true west and seated in my auto, the Orion constellation was to the south-southeast declination + 40 to 45 degrees and the moon was left of Orion and almost directly behind me, almost due east.  It was half full, waning, and declination of +30 to35 degrees on horizon almost lining up with the tip of Orion&rsquo;s extended right arm.  To see Orion I had to turn and look out both driver front and back windows.  The moon was in the farther most corner of the back driver&rsquo;s side passenger window.  It was so far back in the window that I got out to look up at the sky.  It was clear as glass.  There were no streetlights or houses or the glare form a town to interfere.  I saw some stars I haven&rsquo;t seen in a while living in the city.  I sat on the boot of my auto for maybe 8 minutes just looking up.  I can say 8 minutes because the song &lsquo;Blue&rsquo; was playing and it is just about 8 minutes long.  Ah, size!  The moon was about the size of a racquetball at arm&rsquo;s distance, it was very bright.  The ground was cast in the silvery blue of moonlight.  Bright enough that when I got back in my auto I drove several miles before I realized my headlights were not on.  Orion seemed to occupy the space of a standard mouse pad at arm&rsquo;s length.Well, a Wal-Mart truck screamed by and I heard some roadside gravel hit my auto prompting me to get back in and go.  I gave one last look at the sky and remarked aloud to myself how the three sisters in Orion&rsquo;s belt seemed brighter than normal.  I shook it off as I could see all the stars for a change and maybe that was it.  Again, it was such a bright moon; I drove without lights for a few miles before a passing FedEx honked me into turning them back on with quickness.  I think I drove for about 30 minutes, there was some light traffic from the trucks, and they passed me and I blinked them back over.  I passed a rest area and had 80 to myself again: no lights in the mirrors or taillights before me.As you can imagine, 80West turns here and there.  Orion moved in my windows almost to the front.  I just needed to glance out my window without turning to see him.  This is where it becomes weird.  I shall endeavor to do my best.The three sisters in Orion&rsquo;s belt seemed to grow as I drove.  No, I was not tired.  I have not had the pleasure of highway hypnosis.  I was munching my crackers and trying to sing.  A line of 8 trucks, Wal-Mart, G.O.D, J.B. Hunt, and several municipal waste carriers flew by frightening the life out of me that I pulled off the road on the center shoulder.  It was not enough that I expeditiously moved into the passing lane to get out of the way of these maniacs.  No, they were barreling down in both lanes, blinking, and honking as they passed each other, almost drag racing and advancing on my little blue &rsquo;90 Toyota Camry sedan with bright lights blaring.  There was not choice but off the road completely.  I sat there until I was certain they were miles ahead of me.  If I were sleepy, under highway hypnosis, or just lost in my head, I was fully awake and alert now.  I eased back on 80W letting a few fellow travelers pass me.  A pickup from IL that had Truck on it&rsquo;s tag, a green Lexus, a tow-truck towing a racing team trailer, All Car Racing Team-white, silver, and maroon formula racing car logo on the back ramp.  Then I was alone again.I looked up to Orion out my window and for a moment saw six sisters.  Then suddenly they were three.  I thought my eyes failed to focus, but the three sisters were huge then back to normal size.  I drove on with a mounting feeling that something was just not right.  I kept watching the belt of Orion.  They were getting bigger and brighter and to my horror closer.  Panic started to grip me as I turned another bend.  That is when I realized what might be happening.  God, I&rsquo;m seeing a UFO.  There were three spheres of bluish white light just of center of Orion&rsquo;s belt.  If not for the bend in the road, they would have aligned just perfect.  They were just about the size of a dime at arm&rsquo;s length.Nah, I am just tired.  I poured one bottle of cold water on my head, just to be certain.  I looked out and they were still there.  I looked with earnest; maybe this was night balloon flight.  I have been on one and it is eerie.  Hot air balloons with lights shining up from the gondola into the balloon giving it an otherworldly glow.  I saw no burners and the shapes were perfectly round.  I stepped a lot harder on the gas.  Every abduction scenario I have ever heard raced through my head.Not me!  I grabbed my mobile: no signal.  I topped 95 MPH and my car began to shake.  All I wanted to do was get to other people, another traveler, truck even- just not alone.  I had to bring it back down to 80MPH to stop the shaking.  My eyes kept a watch on the three lights.  They seemed to be following me.  I glanced at the radio 2 am.  I looked back out the window and they were gone.  I craned my neck to see out every piece of glass and saw nothing.WHEW! This was a relief.  They were gone.  I eased of the gas and coasted to about 50MPH.  I opened the last bottle of water and poured it on my head.  I was sitting in a puddle, but it was preferable to ((deleted)) probing.  I eased my poor auto around the next corner and freaked.  All three balls of light were headed straight at me.  Yes, sure I though it was a vehicle in the wrong lane headed straight at me but this highway is split in half by some serious hills and valleys.  You would have to be suicidal to drive the wrong way.  However, they were at the tops of the trees ruling out a truck or car.  I feared for my life.My steering wheel suddenly started twisting left and right, swerving me all over the road.  I gripped it so tightly trying to keep control, I put a blood blister on my right thumb.  The more I fought the harder it became to control.  It seemed to me that the lights were controlling my auto.  In that clarity that comes in absolute terror, I let my steering wheel go.  They obviously were more powerful than I was and if they had control of my auto, how was I going to get it back?  I resigned myself to ((deleted)) probing and let go of the wheel.  The moment I let go, my car straightened out and the lights surrounded me.  There was one on the front bumper and one on each side.  They guided my auto on 80 for a few minutes, send beams into my auto, attempted communication, and then they shot up into the stars and were gone.  When I looked back at the clock it was saying about 2:15 am.  It seemed much longer.I got a very good look at their details.  They were perfectly spherical.  They all seemed to be identical.  The one on my door is the one I studied.  It was about 2 meters in diameter, made of a metal, and every millimeter was seamed in an intricate lattice.  It looked as if the latticework were the actual joins that made the sphere.  There was no external openings for the light or any propulsion jets.  It seemed to be bending light around it.  I felt vibrations like an electric shaver pulsing through me.  I saw what looked like the ripples from the hot pavement in the heat of summer pulsing just between it and my car door.  Perhaps it is some sort of energy field that pulled it through the air and now was holding my auto.  Between each sphere and my auto was this ripple, maybe some magnetic field that allowed them to control my auto.  There was no sound, not even my auto.  The engine had stopped.  The timbre of the tires sounded as if I were driving through snow.  The power to my dashboard dimmed, all the lights just barely faded out.The spheres changed color.  I could not detect the source of the lighting.  They went from the white blue of twinkling stars to a dim silvery blue almost the shade of the moon light on the ground then back to the white blue.  The sphere in front changed to a pale washed out sea foam green.  Then as it an aperture had opened a beam of that same pale green light shot out through my engine to me covering my pelvis.  It felt as if someone had struck me with a bat.  Not so much pain as being forced back into my seat. The sphere on the passenger side shot a beam through the door at the same level in the same green.  It was very short and painless.  When the beam stopped the sphere changed to the sea foam green.  I turned and looked out my window to see the last sphere change to a deep sapphire blue.I felt a slight bump, like a high speed bump.  That is when I knew what the ripples were.  My auto was somehow in the air from the moment I let go of the wheel.  It was some kind of force/magnetic beam.  As soon as I touched down, the two green spheres changed to a pulsing red and shot up into the sky. The blue sphere was still at my side.It opened my window.  (I sure as heck was not going to open it.)  I could see the entire sphere.  The intricate lattice seemed to glow in a deep purple.  Below it on the pavement, the air seemed to be buzzing, not rippling like before.  The sphere was about eye level with me as if trying to stare me down.A bright light blinded me hitting me square in the face.  I could feel its warmth on my skin, feel the same electric razor vibration, and I could not see.  I was paralyzed with fear.  I could not move, scream, speak, think-anything!  Suddenly there was this mechanical voice.  It sounded as if it came from inside my head.  It felt as if it were all around me.  It said, &lsquo;sorry for your loss.  It is our loss as well.&rsquo;  It was like a machine trying to imitate a sound it never heard before.  It was monstrous and harsh, but is had sincerity in it as well.I could move.  The light was gone.  I reached out to touch the sphere, but before I could raise my hand, it turned red and shot into the sky.  I stuck my head out the window (I know fatal mistake).  It joined the other two and they blinked out of sight in less than a second.  When I say joined I mean as a group not into one unit.My auto started.  The lights on my dash came back up.  It said 2:15am.  I was going about 5 MPH.  A truck horn made me stand on the gas and get out of its way.The next exit was I believe Loch Haven.  I got out and changed into something dry at the rest area.  Several trucks were parked, sleeping.  All my music is somewhat eerie and spooky.  I choose the radio.  I landed on Coast to Coast and there you have it.", "A flying yellow silent explosion-esque shape, faster than any plane I&apos;ve seen.It was yellow and it looked just like when a firework JUST explodes, the small explosion not yet in it&apos;s full, but it stayed that way and was moving across the sky.", "ME AND MY FRIEND COULDN&apos;T FALL ASLEEP SO WE WENT OUTSIDE HIS HOUSE JUST TO GET SOME AIR.

PD))", "West Central Missouri UFO Flap In Early Autumn 2003 Submitted by Brian Adams of the Missouri Investigators Group investigated the National UFO Reporting Center&rsquo;s online sighting reports as permitted by Peter Davenport, Director of NUFORC. A mysterious long UFO seen as a row six very bright amber lights has appeared over the west central Missouri region over several nights in September and October in 2003.   The UFO was reported by farmers, factory workers and commuters that consisted of either seeing the object hovering over the pastures off the side of the road or moving over the trees in dense woods. So far there hasn&rsquo;t been any report of unusual animal deaths or close encounters associated with the UFO sightings.  However, there has been a recently reported corn field crop formation that was reported on October 4th where this UFO did appear over is currently under investigation. It began on the evening of September 6th with a couple of Pleasant Hill, MO area residents driving up over a small hill on a rural road then stopped to watch a strange row of bright lights hovering over a field between Harrisonville and Pleasant Hill.  I called Amber C. the girlfriend who witnessed this UFO.  Amber told me the UFO was lit up with six very bright amber lights that made it hard to determine any real shape of the craft. But after observing it for only a few moments the UFO lights suddenly went out and no object was seen at all in the dark sky.  Amber said they didn&rsquo;t hear any sounds by the UFO at any time.  The weather was clear and warm. On the evening of September 9th Rick D. was driving back home to Independence from his farm in Shawnee Mound on Highway 13 in northern Henry County near the Johnson County line.  Rick noticed some bright amber lights in the direction he was traveling believing that there was an accident ahead on the highway. Coming around a curve expecting to see emergency vehicles Rick instead saw something quite strange instead.  Cars were parked on both sides of the highway so he slowed down to see why.  Through the windshield Rick saw hovering over the east side of the road two parallel sets of six bright lights that each arched slightly over the trees near an abandoned gas station.  No sounds were heard coming from the UFO outside by Rick at any time. Rick realized that the other drivers had stopped just to watch these lights in the sky.  A small gap between the sets of lights was noticed but Rick said he couldn&rsquo;t see any structure at all because of the bright lights.   Rick then attempted to take a photo of the UFO through the passenger side window as he got closer.  (The film was developed a day later and it only showed a faint ball of one of the UFO lights through the window. Rick&rsquo;s camera&rsquo;s flash was unfortunately on and it obscured most of the UFO lights outside revealing mostly the interior of his vehicle.)  Suddenly the UFO lights blinked out and nothing else was seen in the except for the full moon rising up in the clear sky.  Rick wanted to stop and find out what the other drivers thought about the UFO but they all began to drive away in both directions. Rick said at least twenty cars had pulled over but he thought it was strange that nobody stayed after the UFO was gone.  So he drove on home while listening to a nearby Warrensburg radio station&rsquo;s talk show hoping somebody would mention the UFO sighting.  But nobody called and no news about it was reported. The next evening on September 10th in Clinton, MO at 10 pm Edwin S. reported that he observed a strange ball of yellow light the size of a dime at arms length that was very low to the northeast at 10 pm while letting his dog outside. The UFO moved to the north before getting lost in the trees.  Edwin called the Clinton Police Department but there were no other reports of this object. In Windsor, MO in northeast Henry County is where a factory worker named Logan M. was out on a break on the factory parking lot just after midnight on September 11th. While in his truck with a buddy the two noticed a very bright light moving very low above the trees to the south.  Assuming it was a plane or helicopter coming in their direction it was apparent that it wasn&rsquo;t a normal aircraft approaching.  I spoke to Logan and he told me that the light began to move slowly towards them in a northerly direction but it didn&rsquo;t make any sound at all. The silent UFO really impressed them Logan said and as they watched it flew virtually overhead. Underneath the UFO it had two yellow lights at each apex with a much larger yellow light in the middle that Logan called a dome. (see attached drawing of the UFO by Logan).  The UFO continued over Windsor but turned in a SW direction soon disappearing behind trees. Later that night at the factory Logan said that his buddy told him while he was outside taking trash out to the dumpster in the rear parking lot he saw the same UFO lights appear again. The next day Logan met another factory worker who said his girlfriend mentioned that she saw the UFO. The girlfriend called to see if the Henry County Sheriff&rsquo;s office had any sightings reported.  The Sheriff&rsquo;s office in Windsor did say that they got dozens of other calls that evening.  They reported   seeing a strange lighted aircraft flying over the town but the Sheriff&rsquo;s office told them that everything was okay. In our interview Logan said that this was not a B-2 Stealth Bomber or a military helicopter at all.  Living just ten miles south of the home base B-2 called the 509th bomber squadron Logan said that everybody has seen and heard the B-2&rsquo;s flying by in their takeoff and landing patterns numerous times.  &ldquo;The B-2&rsquo;s are loud and they have normal flashing and landing lights.  This (UFO) thing didn&rsquo;t at all.  It was very strange.  Obviously, the other witnesses felt the same way as I did after seeing this thing.&rdquo;  Then on September 23rd in central Missouri two strange but separate sightings about a half hour apart were reported by the witnesses seeing a similar looking UFO near their homes. Around 9:00 pm a semi-retired cattle farmer named Jerry C. was driving home on a rural road in western Iron County near Boss, MO.  While going up a hill Jerry suddenly saw six very bright amber lights in a straight row appear just above the woods on the north side of the road.  The lights were hovering and not blinking at all but were the size of soccer balls.  To get a better view Jerry said that he stopped and as he began to back up the lights immediately went out. At 65 years old Jerry said that he never has seen anything like this before.  His stock dog was riding in the bed of the pickup truck.  Jerry said that the dog seemed to be very nervous and scared.  Jerry emailed me a couple of days later saying that he was out cutting some firewood on a ridge and when he was finished noticed his dog had disappeared.  &ldquo;The dog is always at my side and doesn&rsquo;t chase my cattle. So I looked around and found the dog had been hit by a car.  It was suffering and I had to put a bullet in him.  Funny thing is that this is the exact spot on the road where we saw the UFO.  Weird isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;  Then at 9:30 pm Daniel K. and his mother were inside their home watching TV on the north side of Cuba, MO or about fifty miles north of Jerry&rsquo;s farm.  Daniel&rsquo;s mom then noticed a strange lighted object through a window moving above the trees.  She and Daniel saw five horizontal lights for a few seconds appear to the south of their backyard.  They ran out to the back porch to see what it was but the lights went out.  Suddenly the lights appeared again to the southwest but then the lights turned off again. There was no sound of an aircraft heard at all. I called Daniel&rsquo;s home and spoke with his mother about their sighting report.  She estimated that the lights were four and a half miles away because a main road called Highway F is about that far from their home.  She said that they&rsquo;re surrounded by thick woods so it was difficult to see because the UFO was flying low just above the tree tops.  She said Daniel did call the Cuba Police Department to see if anyone else had reported seeing the strange lights in the sky but there was none. Another weird report came in from the Pleasant Hill area on October 10th.  James H. said that a week earlier his brother-in-law found a strange crop formation while harvesting a corn field on Saturday morning October 4th.  While up high inside the cab of the combine the brother in-law saw that the corn stalks had been cut down at ground level in a perfectly square area he said was 10 by 10 feet.  He got inside the formation and noticed that the cobs or ears of corn had been removed from the cut stalks and then pressed down into the soil with the cobs standing in a pattern.  It looked like an 8 with a small line or a 1 at the side of the 8. But unfortunately instead of going around the formation the brother in-law drove the combine through it. The brother in-law told James he even got off of the combine to pick up the cobs stuck in the ground and put them into the combine.  However, the brother in-law did notice that the cobs hadn&rsquo;t spoiled so whatever did cause the formation happened recently. Nobody has been into the corn field since to check for any evidence afterwards because of the area in question is several hundred yards from any road plus recent rains has made the ground very soft so it&rsquo;s inaccessible even by 4 wheel drive.  Hopefully later this fall a visit will be successfully made to the crop formation spot to gather samples. Now what is interesting to this crop formation and the September 6th Pleasant Hill sighting is that this corn field is exactly where the witnesses observed the UFO hovering over that evening.  The rural road the witnesses were on called Christmas Tree Lane is the south property line of the corn field just east of Highway 7.  They saw their UFO on the north side of the road over the corn field. It&rsquo;s still possible that there are other witnesses in the area who may have seen this UFO as well but they have decided to not report their sighting or mention it to anyone.  The Missouri Investigators Group (UFOMIG.com) will continue to pursue additional witnesses and do follow-up investigation on these UFO reports. Updated: I&apos;m tonight (Nov. 8th) just reading the recent sightings over Missouri the first week of November, 2003.  On Nov. 4th, 2 more UFO reports having a straight row of 3-6 very bright amber lights seen over Elisnore and Greenville and on Nov. 5 a UFO seen over St. Joe similar to the Windsor, MO craft.  I&apos;m also reading about similar sightings of these UFOs reported seen over Pass Christian, MS and Alexandria, VA on Nov. 5th also over Kittery, ME on Nov. 6th.  Besides these reportts there were more similar UFOs seen over Arkansas and Kansas during Sept. 2003.((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Brian Adams, Barb Becker, and the other investigators of the MISSOURI INVESTIGATORS GROUP, for performing the follow-up investigation on the multiple cases in Missouri, and for sharing the information here.

It was light outside and I looked out our bay window and almost at eye level, I noticed what at first I thought was a plane.

This was flying I would guess 300-400 Mph, but hard to guess as all other objects ( planes ) were much smaller.

They were so unlike anything he had ever seen, he was certain they were UFOs.  The sincerity with which he described the experience greatly impressed my mother and me.

I drove slower because it didn&apos;t move like an airplane and I wanted to watch it. It would go a little ways. Stop. Direction didn&apos;t matter - did what it wanted. I could see my husband had driven up to the house, so I stopped to watch it. It was round and far enough away that I could not see any other distinguishing shapes or color - only a brighter-than-bright white light. Neither of us was doing anything and that was boring. Finally, I got out of the vehicle and looked up, held up my arms and said &quot;come get me&quot;! . . . .the darn thing took off. . . like up until it couldn&apos;t be seen anymore.(I showered and used deodorant soap that morning.

BYE!!!", "Two Brilliant Star objects in twilight skyRosamond, California October 12, 2003 - Sunday 18:25 P.M., My son-in-law and I just finished loading a few items into his pickup truck. As we stood there talking in front of my house,for some unexplained reason I looked up into the sky and as I did, there in the southern sky about 60 degrees off the horizon, were 2 very large brilliant stars situated side by side. I got my son-in-laws attention immediately,and asked him if he knew what these 2 stars where. My son-in-law who is a school teacher could not identify them either.It was a twilight sky, and too early for any stars to appear yet. We stood there puzzled not being able to determine what or why these stars were so visible when there were no ohter stars visible yet. One of the stars was more like golden yellow orange color and the other was a brilliant white star. After what seemed less than a minute,I thought the white star accually moved downward from the other star. I asked my son-in-law if he thought the white star had moved and he confirmed that it did. A second or two later the white star began a more progressive movement downward from the other star. I then realized that this was no star and I ran into the house to retrieve my binoculars making my way out to the backyard patio. As I focused in on the descending star, I could see that it was a brilliant object some great distance away. It was now in a constant slow decent. I then rushed back into the house to grab my video camera. By the this time my son-in-law, daughter and wife were outside and they too had sight of this object moving down. As I returned back into the backyard with my camcorder the object was now very low in the horizon and dropping very fast. I could not locate the object in the viewfinder and lost the chance to get any video, before it became obscured by the neighborhood surrounding tree line. The sighting of this star object lasted 1 minute. As for the other orange star object,it now seemed to move further down from its original sighted position (40 degre! es of horizon)and relocated itself in the southeastern horizon.This star object had moved in the time that my son-in-law and I moved to the backyard from the front of the house. However,neither one of us accually saw it move. At this new position, the orange star object stayed in this location for several minutes. We all went into the house after this. I returned to the backyard and by now I could no longer see it,but in its last location, the planet Mars was now becoming visible. Something strange happened during our observation of this orange star and I find words difficult to explain it.Some people may want to interpret our observation of the orange star as being the planet Mars. To them I will say this; The planet Mars does not make its appearence in the southeastern sky, here in southern California, until 18:45 PM, at which time it first appears at a low 30 degrees off the horizon. It is a faint yellow and is not easy to see at this time. It does not begin to take on a orange color until 19:40 PM, when its position is about 70 degrees off horizon.My son-n-law and I are convinced that these were not stars,flares,meteors,aircraft, balloons or any other objects known to us. I&apos;m a retired Air Force veteran with 24 years experience in aircraft operations. I can honestly say that I can&apos;t correlate this to anything I&apos;ve ever seen. I feel that others may have witnessed this event as well. It was too obvious not to have been noticed. I checked with the 3 local newspapers for any reports the next day. Nothing unusual was reported relating to this starnge sighting. I also contacted the community affairs office at nearby Edwards Air Force Base and they had no reports or similar reports to thier office. For now I choose to classify this as a UFO sighting.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and we found him to be exceptionally credible.  We were satisfied that he would have been able to distinguish the lights from landing lights on aircraft, a possibility he had considered.

I looked through the flooded trees and saw what I thought was a backporch light, an orange floodlight. I mentioned to my brother the light, it was annoying me and said we should move the canoe. He just stared at the light and was practically speechless. Finally I realized why, when he brought it to me attention that we were in the main body of the resevoir, there couldn&apos;t be a house there, the light was over water. After looking at this large orange light that looked to be approximately 100 yards away a most, the light starting rising, it rose directly over our heads in a crystal clear night, never making a noise. Suddenly the orange light became a light that resembled a white floating pencil at about a 500 feet up, it only remained this way for about 10 seconds, the &quot;pencil&quot; shrank to a dot, and then it literally blasted into outer space, that&apos;s the only way to describe it. It went straight up and went from 500 feet over our heads to a fading dot in space in about 3 seconds. It never made a noise, didn&apos;t emit any color or flames after blasting off, but did leave a cloud of smoke that took about 15 minutes to dissipate.I was in a panic and shaking uncontrollably, and we left soon after.Suprisingly my brother was shaken but calm, at least calmer than me, as he claims to have seen an equally remarkable event if not more so to him, including being spotlighted by a craft and a loss of several hours of time while in North Carolina several years earlier.As farfetched as this sounded then and even now, he is very stable,never was one to make up stories, and since I know what I saw with him while fishing was the most incredible event I have ever had, the fact the he relates one sighting with the other means my brother saw something and experienced something he feels was just as remarkable if not more so years earlier.For me this was probably the most remarkable thing I have ever witnessed and am again shaking now 25 years later as I write this. It was something I have tried numerous times to reconcile in my mind over the years, to see something that I thought was a backporch light blast into space, it&apos;s something I will never get over or forget.((NUFORC Note:  The date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

Three couples have reported seeing green lights in the area where the ladies had the missing time. Although this sighting report is a bit earlier in July, we still may have a connection to the whole case. I saw in mid- July may have left evidence of some sort if you would like to look into it further.  Sometime in the middle of July 2003 before I went to bed I smoked a cigarette on my back balcony facing I think SW looking towards the mountains behind my house. It was around midnight and I seen this bright neon green light lighting up the base of the mountain moving slowly along. There is rolling hills directly behind my house. Behind those hills a draw with ponds up those hills complete grass until it reaches a mountain same parallel as Black Mountain that is the ridge I am talking about but behind black mountain towards the back country in the direction of Ellison  more it is hard to explain. Anyways this bright green light moved around level with where the trees would about be.  This light I saw was not too high in the sky. I kept watching it didn&apos;t know what it was figure a UFO again. Weird thing  at 2 am that morning sirens woke me up and I was very disturbed so I went outside for a cigarette and it looked like a huge forest fire coming towards my house, flames in the air and I couldn&apos;t tell how far away the fire was so I woke up my boyfriend and we started running around wetting everything down.  Later that morning my hubby went to work, no sleep sadly, and he drove down Lahka Rd to see how far fire was away. About 5 acres away we estimated. Strangely enough these fires started way back away from the roads, way up the hill pass the houses in the middle of a grass field up towards the mountain.(the night I saw that green Light!)  I  have kept wondering how the fire could have started because it really was an odd spot to start. There was no lightening that night either. Clear sky. Never heard about this huge grass fire on the news! (dumpster fires make the news) My neighbors didn&apos;t even know the fire happened! I know the previous week to this fire that someone through a carelessly discarded cigarette into a ditch off Mackenzie rd not far from here but I was thinking that maybe you might want to just take a walk up to those fields that were burnt and have a look. Or ask the fire dept if they know the cause of  that  fire. Interesting. Fire was basically on Lakha Rd or Latta Rd (Lakha turns in Latta after a little ways)but way way up the hill where there is no road. You can see the 2 large burnt patches if you are driving down Hwy 97 towards Kelowna just a little ways past airport look at the hills on left hand side before you reach the Old Vernon Rd set of lights.Or turn up Old Vernon Rd and look straight. Well I thought I would share this with you in case someone else may have witnessed that green light and then big grass fire the same night.   oh, that light by the way was not a plane. I see planes all the time because I live quite close to airport.  This did not move like a plane and it was not a helicopter( too dark for a chopper and it would not be out at 12 am) I would have heard it for sure because sound carries well out where I live.

It was white with an orange tint and was still approaching when I reached home three miles south of town.  I viewed the UFO through binoculars as it flew silently over the house at an estimated 1200 feet altitude and estimated speed of 100 mph.

After doing my work at the station I locked up and headed back to the main pumping station. On my way back I witnessed a flash of bright white/blue light all around me (outside...in the truck with me). The light was so bright I stoped the truck right away and had trouble focusing (kind of like the effect when someone takes a picture with the flash on). After rubbing my eyes and regaining my focus in my eyes, I continued on my way. It scared me but after thinking about it, I passed it off as lighting. A few months after that the same thing happened again. Bright flash of light, only I wasn&apos;t in the truck I was walking to the truck. Needless to say it scared me once again. Being the second time, I said something to my co-worker about it. After telling them, they  told me a guy who worked there before me had told them once about a bright flash light.

As I watched it move across my windshield I was waiting for it to break out of the clouds but it never did. I believe it was traveling away from me and not descending. It moved very fast from right to left and then it made a sharp turn to the right and then back to the left agiain then disappeared behind some trees on the horizon. It seemed to kind of change axis when it made its turns. I would estimate it was probably 3 miles or so away when I lost sight of it. It was medium grey or a dark silver color and was about a half an inch long as it appeared through my windshield.

I saw two instances of a UFO. On Friday night, we were shooting bottle rockets. I was looking up and saw what looked like a star at the moment, disappear out of site. It was bright, sort of close to the brightness of a satellite, not as bright as say international space station, but was just sitting still, then vanished.

I was laying there, on the floor, on what used to be a patio, but was now enclosed with windows all the way around it. There is a tree just to the north of the house, but a great clear view to the NW. I was laying there, watching the fan turn above me. I was closing my eyes trying to go to sleep, and I remember the feeling that something was telling me to look towards it, as if something was looking at me and I had the sense to look back, I can&apos;t really explain it in words, it was more like the beings in the craft told me to look through telepathy. I rolled over and sat up a bit (on my elbows with my back arched) and looked out to the NW. There was my first definite UFO. It was bright white sphere. I was told before by my mom and step father of a bright light that was behind our house in MN that was shining through the woods and went back and forth, which happened a few before this. Just as I saw it for about 5 seconds, it disappeared, into thin air, blip, gone. I remember me saying under my breath, &quot;cool&quot; I haven&apos;t experienced such a sight since then.

I have been trying to reach art or george with no success. my mother told me that when she was leaving my aunts, which is south phoenix, ahwatukee, that she looked up and saw this huge gigantic object moving over, saying that it was at least a few football fields. she said that she could see the stars around it, but not in it. I have heard theories about the lights over the mountain ridge. I have heard that there was a big visual, ie the lights, and that it would distract most attention to what was actually going over phoenix, which would make sense, since my mother saw it over head.

However, all of this is conjecture, since we did not witness the lights.  The dates of the sightings are approximate.  PD))streams of light and triangular lights seen over Saskatoon, SK.NOTE - Date and time are approximate... This report is from 1994. I was caretaking in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. My wife-to-be (at the time) and myself would often open our apartment suite window and gaze out at the sky. We had often noticed in the sky 3 red lights at various locations in the sky that always seemed to remain fixed in the sky (at about 25-30 degrees above the horizon, and certain fixed locations unknown degrees from north and south. they always seemed to be in the same place. for example one was always just a bit east of the peak of a house down the street.) even though the other stars in the sky would move. We had jokingly called the red lights our &quot;friends&quot; and would often jokingly say, &quot;oh look, our friends are here&quot;. One night, we were standing in the window watching south. one of the red lights was there, almost due south and always at the same height in the sky... We had suggested to ourselves that the light was nothing more than the light of a plane heading either to Regina (The Capitol city of Saskatchewan) or coming in from it. But, after over 45 minutes, the light had not changed position in the sky at all, and the flight from Saskatton to Regina was only about 50 minutes. So that ruled that out... and we still couldn&apos;t figure out the peculiar red color of it. About this time we noticed that the loight would &quot;jiggle&quot; slightly... just a short, small up and down motion. We thought to ourseleves, ok... we are imagining it and continued to watch and it would jigle again... we watched the other two red lights and noticed they were doing the same thing as well. To make this easier to follow, I&apos;ll call the red lights &quot;south&quot; (the southernmost one we thought might possibly be an airplane), &quot;east&quot; (the red light to the east of us) and &quot;north&quot; for the one just to the north of us. We became amazed when south jiggled yet again and then a stream of, well, for lackof a better term, northern lights style white light appeared to travel from south to east. A coupole minutes went by and a second stream went from east back to south after east jiggled. We were amazed when we saw that... the light was in a straight line, and acted like an airplane contrail appearcing, making a longer line until it almost reached the other light and then slowly fading out after about 6-10 seconds... all to the south and east of us. then the same thing happened with a stream of the same style light from east to north and back. At this point, just to the south of the position of &quot;east&quot; there was a huge white flash (similar to the white flash from the fireworks that produce the huge &quot;bang&quot; minus the &quot;bang&quot;)and then the same white color stream proceeded to appear from &quot;East&quot; but it created a clockwise spiral pattern that radiated out from the spot where the white flash had occured. This continued to happen for another 20 minutes or so, with &quot;east&quot; being the center of the activity. There were a total I recall of about 8 straight lines and 3 spirals. After the &quot;show&quot; had finished we continued to watch &quot;our friends&quot; the red lights, and saw a small trianglar shaped light (imagine the ship from the old asteroids aracde game) leave &quot;north&quot; in a northerly direction, loop around in a counter-clockwise direction and head north again at a high speed (approximately 1 handspan / per second with the hand held outstretched above my head). My wife claimed to also see the same thing happen to &quot;east&quot; as well. We have absolutely no idea of what it was we saw. It was one of the most spectacular things I have ever seen in my life though. We would be willing to submit drawings of what we saw via email if requested.((NUFORC Note:  Time and date of incident are approximate.

We were driving in the car in Wapakoneta, OH (The hometown of Neil Armstrong- first man to walk on the moon!)

It was strobing White-Red-slight blue lights then all of a sudden it slowed way down and then we seen it split into 2 small strobing lights. The more we looked at the strobing lights, the more than seem to just simulate a plane. You could definitely tell the difference after awhile. They were more of a fading light. The 2 lights moved opposite direction and then the 2 split again into 4 strobing lights. Moving opposite of each other again. They almost seem to dance in the night sky. If you were to blink at the wrong time, you would have missed them split, it was that fast. All of a sudden, from the north, came some planes that appeared to be headed to that part of the sky. My girlfriend, seen the lights splitting and she stated she seen them split again. There was a few more planes that came in pretty fast with the activity. I don&apos;t know if they seen the activity and wondered what was going on, or they were trying to fly by to cover up the unusual activity. One could only imagine! It was definitely an unreal experience and a true UFO phenomena. Anyone else in Ohio seen this type of activity? If so email me at ((e-mail address deleted))", "While marching on a bivouac maneuver in (?) September 1954, I caught a glimpse overhead of a disc-shaped, metallic in color object that just came from nowhere straight down and stopped.  The bottom was concave and very distinct in detail.  I was called upon to &quot;eyes front&quot; while I marched, but I couldn&apos;t help but look back up and when I did, it just shot straight up from a large disc to nothing.  What I mean is, it shot up at such speed that it kept getting smaller and smaller and then disappeared.  I know what I saw and can draw a very vivid picture of it if needs be.  It was definitely not a weather balloon ! !  I&apos;ve never spoken of it.  You just didn&apos;t do that.  Until now.  Thanks for listening.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We were traveling on a paved road which for the most part was free of traffic. We passed maybe one car before the incident. The night sky was clear of clouds and spotted with stars. I do not recall the moon cycle at the time, but I believe it was a sliver. It all began when we were just having a conversation about the evenings visit and dinner. I was just admiring the stars out the mini vans window when I noticed something catch my eye. It was postioned to my right of the vehicle in the sky. The object was spherical and a deep blue color. At first I thought it was a plane light but i&apos;d never seen a plane light that dark before. I quickly told my dad who glanced over as did the whole family. The object remained almost even with our vehicle. In this I mean it never traveled out of our line of sight. My dad slowed a little and my mom put down her window to make sure it wasnt a relection. After viewing the object for a couple of minutes it was my mother who stated that she something on the drivers side of the vehicle this time. In the night sky on the opposite sid eof the road was a similar object but this one was dark red. The light from these vehicles didnt pulse, didnt blink, but were constant the whole time. It was at this time that I felt a sense of awe and unbelief. Both objects kept up the same distance and speed with each other. It appeared that each was just smoothly traveling as we were. After taking in both objects, for some reason I leaned forward to look up higher and was stuned by what I saw. I pointed out an off white spherical shape positioned above the road. This would put the lights in a triangular formation. After watching them for about 3 minutes the red and blue lights lifted even with the white light. The two outside lights began to draw in towards the white light and they appeared to change position on the opposite side of the road. After this the lights then d! rew closer so they were almost side by side. They then increased thier traveling speed and quickly flew off into the night sky. It was also at that time that we came into an area with a large number of trees that obscured the objects departure.((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))", "Iam an insurance salesman born April 9, 1947, age 56. I have lived in Northern Nevada since I was age 16. I am college educated in the medical sciences and have specialized in group medical insurance sales since 1981. I have never reported a sighting before although on two nights several years apart and many years ago I witnessed interesting phenomena that may have had mundane explanations.I had only driven on Highway 375 in southern Nevada one other time previously. A month earlier my wife and I drove down to Mesquite, NV together in daylight.On this night, there was no moon that I noticed. It may have been below the horizon or not have risen yet. I was traveling again from my home in Reno, Nevada to my home in Mesquite, Nevada to meet my wife who was waiting there. The night sky was perfectly clear and the weather pretty warm for this date in October. More stars were in the sky than I  could ever remember, but no moon!  At the time I began witnessing the event I will describe in detail, I was on Highway 375 aproximately 20 miles before reaching Rachel, Nevada. At this time I am not absolutely sure which direction on the compass I was pointing but my guess would be Southwest. In any case, as I would notice later on there was a very bright star or planet high in the night sky almost immediately in line with my direction of travel. I was moving slower than normal because the area is Open Range and cattle are everywhere, sometimes in the center of the highway. Anyway, I was moving about 60 mph and very attentive to road conditions. To my right, near the top of my windshield in the Camry, I was startled by a bright orange colored globe that &quot;appeared&quot; for about 5 seconds. As soon as I came to a dirt road on the same side, I pulled over got out but kept my motor running. In the night shadows I noticed a hillside that grew into a small mountain range about a quarter mile away and ran away from my position in the  direction of light I had seen. I guessed that the object was at least 10 miles away althought I had only the dark mountain range to relate to. It was bright orange, the orange was not pale at all but had a lot of red in it. The shape was like a fat cuban cigar, not long at all.In a moment, I noticed two very small white lights paired together and moving upward from the horizon under the area I had first spotted the orange object.  Then parted about 500 feet up from the horizon,going in almost horizontal paths 90 degrees away from each ohter.I followed the white light that was moving toward the small mountain range and it turned and headed along the range. In a few seconds a jet began to follow this light closely. Over my car engine which ran pretty quietly, I could hear the jet engine. Also, I saw the flashing lights of the jet and it looked like the jets I have noticed in the air all my life. Also, on this highway I had already noted that a lot of air traffic was evident on my left, very high in the sky but that nothing commercial was on my right, only these strange sights. It was so quiet I even noticed the noise of the commercial jets, as high as they were, earlier after stopping. After about 10 minutes the jet following the small white light was gone over the far horizon and I was looking for any other white lights when two more orange globes appeared briefly near the horizon that I had seen the white lights rise. They were the same color and shape but they were lower over the horizon than the first orange light. The lights came on in sequence, first the one closer to the mountain range, then when it went out in a few seconds another to its left came on immediately and also stayed on for only about 5 seconds. The lights had a distinct fat oval shape and clear definition. They didn&apos;t grow to oval shapes like a blast would but they simply appeared instantly and disappeared instantly. A few more minutes went by before I decided to continue on to the Little Ale-e-inn bar for a chat with anyone who would listen.As I again drove slowly down highway 375 toward that bright star or planet I reached a higher point and to my right noticed a few red and white lights blinking on the horizon. This time the object seemed to be on the ground and could have been a small plan on a runway about 5 or so miles away. I kept on driving but shortly I was forced to stop again!Just to the left of the bright star or planet I noticed another very small white light that could have been a dim star except that it was moving in my direction and to my left at an angle away from the star. That didn&apos;t excite me but within a second or two after following its travel path, it became a bright orange globe, just as bright and exactly like the previous two. In about 5 seconds it disappeared and immediately another appeared just ahead of it. The instant the next light went out a third appeared just ahead of it too! Each light was exactly the same shape, size and coloration.I pulled my car over as soon as possible and this time I turned my engine off thinking that I may stay stopped a while so I didn&apos;t miss anything. The first thing I noticed was a low humming sound that seemed to emanate from every direction. If I had the engine running I am sure I would have never heard the sound! In my imagination I thought the sound to resemble a high speed electric motor that had become frozen. The second thing I noticed in the direction of the first sightings about 15 or so miles away was a white glow like a large city gives off when you are far away in a very dark area. I thought that it could be Las Vegas lights but that city was at least 150 miles from my position. However Las Vegas is the brightest city anywhere and it was possible.While at this stop I almost immediately noticed several little white lights, like the head of a pin that seemed to wander aimlessly in the sky on the right side of the highway. Most were pretty high up and a couple so faint i could only see them clearly when I looked at them with peripheral vision. In about 10 minutes I became anxious again to get to the bar and talk to anyone local about my sightings.I arrived at the bar but the lights were out, nobody home. I drove a little bit farther, past the buildings and trailers untill I got to a wide dirt road. At the road I turned into I parked and got out because i was still curious and wanted to see more. I immediately noticed that the low hum was not there. I also couldn&apos;t see any moving white lights, only stars. About 5-8 miles away, down the dirt road toward area 51 I did spot a lot of vehicle lights that appeared to be on high beams. I had noticed no traffic before this time so I decided to move on in case they were base security.", "Very large object w/ white and blue flashing lights..I was driving home and looked up and saw very bright white and pale bluish colored lights flashing not to far above the tree lines. I stopped my car and turned it off and watched through the window as the object slowly moved westward. The object made no sound and appeared to be around the size of a football field", "Lighted round craft hovered and then dropped down quickly and shot straight out and away. While hovering, craft made a moaning sound.We were travelling cross country and stopped at a camp ground for the evening.It was very deserted there because it was the off season. We parked at the top of a hill. Just as my mom and dad exited the car I heard my dad say &quot;what the hell is that?&quot; He sounded afraid. I jumped out of the car and stood next to them and in the night sky very close to us was a round, well light ufo. I say UFO because I simply don&apos;t know what else to call it. I was very young, about 8 at the time and really in shock so I can&apos;t give much in the way of detail. The craft seemed to be hoovering in one spot and I do recall an eerie sound. The only time I have ever heard a sound like that again was during an earthquake. The only way I could describe it would be as a moaning noise that went up and down in pitch. After staring at the craft for a moment or two, it just dropped straight down very quickly and then shot off in a straight line and was gone. I have never really discussed this with anyone even my mom and dad. I think we were all too shaken to ever discuss it again. I have only one other memory of that incident. I beleive it was the next day. Walking thru a little country market with my parents. I was still very shaken and I honestly don&apos;t remember what happened between watching that craft shoot off and when I was next walking in the store. I don&apos;t think we were abducted because I watched it leave but I do seem to have some time memory loss. Thank you for hearing my story((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))", "IT WAS JUST A SERIES OF LIGHTS THAT WERE REVOLVING IN A SORT OF CIRCULAR PATTERN. THE LIGHTS WERE CLEAR WHITE AND I SAW THEM FOR ABOUT 6 SECONDS AND THEN THEY FADED AWAY. THE SKY WAS CLEAR AND BLUE.", "Just after nightfall I observed a cluster of white blinking lights high overhead, moving steadily in a westerly direction.I was walking home, headed west.  It was nearly dark and the full moon was behind me.  I looked up, noticing a bright star and wondered if it were Mars. Then I saw a white blinking light high overhead which I assumed was a plane, traveling northward. Then another blinking light caught my eye, quite a bit lower than the first.  Almost immediately I saw that this second light was accompanied by 5 or 6 more. They were all blinking, moving fairly quickly off to the west. They resembled a group of fireflies, yet their movements and the blinking seemed co-ordinated, not random, and they appeared to remain equidistant from one another.  Before I could discern a pattern or definite shape to the formation, it disappeared behind the trees on the horizon. I heard no sound. I&apos;ve watched meteor showers before, and as a child once saw a spectacular auroral display, but have never experienced a UFO sighting. Whatever this was, it was a lovely sight...", "I wasted40 minutes of my life gazing at flashing lightsHello! First of all , I want to get this clear, I don&apos;t fully believe in U.F.O.&apos;s.I am simply a victim of being at the right place at darn near the wrong time.  I was on my way to the bathroom, and I heard the dogs in the neighbor hood all going crazy. I sliped on my pants and went to check on my dogs. while on my way to the back of the house, I began hearing this noise, like a big airplane or something,so I then thought maybe it was some truckdriver coming by, but anyway, I went outside stood in the back yard and of course looked for the source of the yard, finding nothing. Although the noise was still there, well more like pass over, so I walked around the side of the house to the front yard and still I saw nothing (BUT STARS!!, It was clear as day) I didn&apos;t waste no more time.  I wrote it off as alow flying plane and sarted up the steps,Looked back one more time and this time I saw about 6-8 helicopter type things.the noise was still there but it sounded like it stopped,not the noise the noisemaker. the heilcopter things had a blue and red flashing light and if they were indeed helicopters, they where to high to be heard but the flashing lights could be seen good enough to tell it was a light in the front and one in the back.Now back to the big noisemaker that has stopped or landed,well first of all I knew that an airplane couldn&apos;t stop in mid air, and also there are no airports around my house. I went into the house to get my girlfriends opinion and we both came back to look.  now about two of the flashing lght things appeared to be going towards the noise and the rest are moving around like helicopters.(just hovering, but still together). then about maybe 30 sec. later and one of the flashing light things came back towards the other flashing things but this time it was moving much faster than at first. Then the group started to break up and it look like two of the flashing things stayed in spot and just flashed.  Now for someone who could give a hoot nanny bout the whole outer space subject, I can say that for last night I spent about 40 minutes of my life trying to fix a good view at Hell,I guess Either nearly dead stars or helicopters and I heard the first airplane that landed in N.W. Moultrie, Ga. I couldn&apos;t explain then and I can&apos;t explain now, so I wanted to  share that with everyone.", "I married a woman from the Mexican island of Cozumel, state of Quintana Roo.

I drove around the area right after, but could not find anything unusual. I think it was similar to the July 23, 2001, fireball witnessed by thousands of people from southeastern Ontario to northern Virginia that scientists believed to have been caused by a stony chunk of asteroid no larger than a suitcase, which exploded in the atmosphere 10 to 20 miles above the Earth&apos;s surface.", "fast moving Chevron/ V formation of lightsI was on the patio of my apartment looking at the sky as I often do at this time of night.

I live fairly close to the Mobile Airport and am well experienced in seeing aircraft on approach. What I saw, however, was nothing I have seen before. If it had been a single light I would have believed it to be a satellite, but there were aproximately 6-7 lights in a perfect V formation with a single light extended out in front. It moved extremely fast, hence the comparison to a satellite, and the lights were not much brighter then the stars of Cassiopeia which it traveled fairly close to.

While talking, I saw in the sky and clearly noted what, appeared to be a distant orb. At first I thought it was the landing lights or &apos;approach&apos; lights for an airplane, as Oakland and San Francisco are often filled with commercial air traffic. Upon closer inspection though, I noticed that the apparent distance and stable quality - and indeed the color (a pale white-blue that I wouldn&apos;t associate with the operating illumination system of a commercial aircraft) - of the light didn&apos;t appear to be sourced from a plane. My next assumption was that is was a satellite, due to the uncharacteristically clear and beautiful weather we have been having in the San Francisco Bay Area this year, you can catch one or two satellites a week zooming by in orbit reflecting the light of the sun, if you care to look. However, this object, although probably most similar in appearance to an orbiting satellite, was of too great a size and brightness to be even the largest of low orbit satellites. This thing would have had to have been huge to produce an illumination of that magnitude at orbital distance. It&apos;s smooth and extremely regular emission of light, at a very consistent brightness, and it&apos;s dead straight trajectory from roughly West to East - at an apparently level path from my vantage point there on the ground, and almost its ponderous quality of movement quickly disqualified any description of a &quot;shooting star&quot; or meteor that I&apos;ve ever heard. It had a roughly similar size and slightly diminished brightness compared to the current appearance of the now closely approached planet Mars in the night sky. NOTE: I would like to plainly iterate that this object was indeed NOT the planet Mars itself, to dispel any ideas of mistaken identification. Perhaps the most notable thing about this light was that after about 15 seconds of very consistent traverse, it slowly, and extremely evenly, faded to black without any apparent change in velocity. I&apos;ve never seen anything like it before...", "I noticed they were flying in unison....I was on my roof at about 5:30am on Sunday, October 5th, looking for what else? A UFO.

In the eastern sky I notced a metallic saucer shaped object travelling towards the north at a fairly high rate of speed.Being inside my automobile and on a busy street, I have no idea if the craft could be heard or not. It did not appear to be close enough to the ground to hear any sound anyway.I was amazed at this scenario as I am absolutely certain it was no conventional aircraft of any kind. I immediately began to honk my horn and even rolled my window down in an effort to garner another witness to this phenomena. Despite the volume of traffic on that busy thoroughfare(13th Street), I was unable to attract anyones attention. To this day, I find that circumstance very peculiar to say the least. I continued driving and abruptly pulled into the nearest parking lot so as to watch further. By this time the object had disappeared behind some trees only to reappear as two having split in half.There also appeared to be what seemed to resemble smoke trails behind each component.  They also looked to have been closer to the horizon, but I cannot be certain of that fact due to the possiblity of them being much farther away than they appeared. (due to the curvature of the earth). They simply disappeared below the horizon. I find it very difficult to believe that I was the only witness to this, nevertheless, I have been unable to locate any other witness(es). I do not consider myself a UFO enthusiast on any level. I have had 4 sightings in my lifetime, this was by far the most intriguing of them all. I do not read on the subject with the exception of the &quot;Gulf Breeze Sightings&quot; back in 1992. I did however report this to a guest on the Art Bell show a number of years ago (perhaps 2 or 3) and he replied that it was probably a meteor. I am certain this was no meteor. I am an amateur astronomer and have seen many meteors. Aside from that fact, again, this was in a bright, cloudless, sunny sky. I never really made the effort to report it to anyone else after this experience. In fact, I reported it then as I am doing so now only after the happenstance of venturing onto an interested party of which I never really sought out. The first reporting occurred after I had listened to an ArtBell show during one of my many bouts of insomnia. This time I ventured onto your website link from the CoastToCoast website. As far as my background is concerned, I am a college degreed individual, seriously and sober minded, and not given to hyperbole or fantasy. My exposure to any occult activities have been passive only as I have never practiced any form of occultism, but I have read somewhat concerning the various phenomena within this realm.((NUFORC Note:  Date of event is approximate.

At first we thought the object was a kite, because of its erratic path, but then it would often straighten up and move in a very deliberate direction, like a manned object. I used my digital camera as a binoculars by looking through the zoom lens at maximum range, and after close inspection I clearly saw something moving on the side of the object facing me. To me, depending on the size perspective, it seemed to be either a small craft reminiscent of the old Apollo Lunar Landers, or it was something like an Autogyro, the old &quot;flying chair&quot; device that&apos;s been used in military recon missions for decades. If it was the latter, the movement I saw on it could have been the person operating it. The object was seen by a great many people in the parking lot and by persons on the Eastern By-Pass.

This beam of light was a white color and was very distintive like and upside down V. This beam would sort of fade in and out, we watched the beam for about 5 min or so. Just amazed how it would fade in and out . And of course we joked about it being a UFO. Within in another min. or so a very bright ball of light appeared and it just appeared from nothing. It moved left to right, up and down, it moved pretty rapidly but it would just go a short distance. It was sort of like dancing. I know that sounds crazy. At this pint, we knew that it was not a plane, helicopter, weather ballon, or any of the other 100 or so things we tried to make it to be. It was beautiful. And then it just disappeared behind a small cloud. Now I was jumping up and down in the seat telling my friend i needed my camera. Got the camera and waited. Another few minutes passed and we kept and eye onthe cloud we last saw it and sure enough it reappeared and there were 2 of the balls of light. Same size and shape. I can&apos;t tell you how big they were. But to me and my friend they looked like the same. Very bright white balls of light. These 2 did exactly what the first did.

Immediatly i noticed straight ahead a &quot;star&quot; that was emitting colors. So i decided to watch it to see if it was a plane or whatever. It never moved but i could clearly see green white and red rotating or pulsating. A man walking his dog came up and asked what i was looking at so i pointed. He immediatly said &quot;strange&quot;. I asked what he was seeing and he said the same thing-christmas colors. We watched for 10 min. or so and decided it wasnt moving but wasnt a star or plane also. I ran back and got my 8x hunting binn to get a better look. Wow!!! You could look at mars,stars but when you looked at this it just sparkled colors. My neighbor came out to smoke a cigg and saw me outside. He looked too and couldnt believe it when i told him it hasnt moved in a half hour. Next his wife was looking both saying they saw green white and red too. He went back and got his binn. 10x -still couldnt make out a shape-oval to egg shaped maybe. By now there were more people outside looking because of warm weather they heard voices outside and wanted to see what was going on. A hunter went in and got another pair of binn. to get a better look. Everyone agreed on what colors we were seeing. People watched for 45 min or so and went inside. I stayed outside and wouldnt take my eyes off it. Soon another pulsating object exactly the same came to it and got about a dimes width  apart with your hand extended out. It soon kind of floated down below the original one and they now started moving slowly to the northeast together. The 2nd one kind of faded back to where it came from and the original now started moving. It now was holding in the northeast sky but higher up and acting funny. The neighbor across from me came back out and said it was gone but i showed her how far it had moved across the sky. We both watched for about 45min.-colors still evident but higher up and now its kind of &quot;dancing&quot;. It would buzz up and down /right left. I called up my son that i wanted him to see this. When i got to his house we positioned ourselves so the light was in the phone lines for reference. It moved upward slowly but zig zaggy.I left at midnight(work) and my boy continued watching till 1:50 am. He said at the highest point he swears he saw another light come out of it thru his binn but couldnt be sure. He said dad the light just vanished!! Since this incident I have found out the &quot;hunters&quot; dad got out his telescope on his back deck and watched for over 45 min.-said in years of having telescope never looked at anything like this.

These are very small dots of light traveling in various directions, and at different speeds. The average viewable time is approximately 1 1/2 minute.  For the past several evenings I have spotted what appear to be satellites coming from slightly west of North traveling in a straight line toward the South.  As they approach a point about about half way across their transit, they make a turn to the right, and accelerate at a high rate toward the West.  As they start to make the turn, they appear to slow down.  There is no sound or lights, or any clue that they are anything other than mundane satellites. The speed they achieve as they travel to the West is amazing.", "As I was driving down Bridgetown Rd. to pick up my son from Taylor High, while going down hill, I saw an object in the sky, it was the shape of a cigar, very bright like fire.

When it got down to the road in front of me, it then look like a saucer shape with very bright lights all around. I think I was momentarily in shock. I screamed, but noone heard or saw me. The houses around were dark like noone was home. I yelled can anyone see this or hear me, but noone was there. It hovered in front of me, but I don&apos;t no how long since I seemed to be in some state of shock. And then it took off into the sky very, very, fast in a zig zag fashion and disappeared into the horizon. I didn&apos;t tell anyone but my family about it.

I fully expected to be pulled over, and hoped the trooper had seen the abject also. I pulled alongside the trooper, expecting a strange look, when I noticed his dome light was on, with a brief case open on his lap, frantically searching through the papers in the case. I waited for a couple moments at the stop sign waiting to be pulled over. After I was not arrested, I excitedly got back on the highway in the opposite, in persuit of the triangular craft. I followed for about a half mile north, as the craft moved northeast and I lost sight as I went Due north. The direction the craft was heading was towards a military base in Grayling, Michigan. I am close to a local private pilot, I am quite sure the craft was headed toward restricted airspace.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I am doing about 90 mph in a cornfield; my friend in the back seat is yelling it&rsquo;s over us! So I slammed on the breaks (to avoid hitting a tree), and we watched as it slowly crept off.

I followed it as it slowed, and turned to see if I could identify what large bird it might be. It was very bright, a rectangular shape, like a row of white vanity lights over a bathroom mirror. My partner counted 2 sets of three lights. It seemed to have some sort of rod sticking out the front. My partner called to me to see if I was watching it. He kept exclamining aloud and it seemed almost to sense us and fly away very fast and very smooth. It headed south and then curved west. It seemed to change shape and texture when it curved.

My boyfriend and I were standing out in a field in Bridgewater, NJ.  There was very little ground light and you could see a lot of stars.  The sky was very clear and there was very little cloud action.  The moon was about 80-90% covered and he and I were looking around.  Then he points up and says, &quot;Do you see that?&quot;  I saw a very faint point of light.  It wasn&apos;t emmitting it&apos;s own light though, it was as if it was reflecting.  The light was a dark red.  The moon at no point during my watch turned red from where I was.  From what I understand, my cousin was watching from the next county over and said that the moon was an orangey-red.Anyway, the light was traveling away from the moon quite swiftly, I would saw about 40-50 mph from the ground.  Much faster than any plane that flies around here.  It was moving quickly and I lost a couple times, but it was zig-zagging.  When it would move sharply, I would pick it up again.  It was unmistakable.  The movement was very much like a bat, but it was up way too high to be a bat.  Well above cloud level.  The light zig-zagged away from the moon heading south, I believe.  It didn&apos;t come any closer towards the earth, it traveled on the same plane, you know.  It was very faint though.  And we both saw it.He said it was a UFO, that he&apos;d seen a lot in Long Valley.  I know it wasn&apos;t a shooting or falling star, I&apos;d seen a lot of those in the Caribbean.  He speculated it was a satellite, but I don&apos;t think those would be large enough to see from Earth.  I saw this with my naked eye and I&apos;ve never seen anything like it before.  It was definitely not a plane, and I wonder if it was because of the eclipse, and the decreased amount of light that allowed us to spot it.", "5 lights moving in different directions over oceanme and my wife seen in the evening sky over head what appeard to be a satalite or a meteor? a very bright lite brighter than any star  moving from the north to the southwest over the ocean . it never changed its speed as it went over or away to the south west.what was very different about this was it started flashing very bright and was moving back and forth within a small area. i grabed my binoculars and seen a very bright red light flash below it and that light disapeared .it was a small distance away from the bright lite then i seen several, i counted 5 lights around it sort of in a triangle but changing there position rapedly  of which appeared to come from the bright light, 2 went out from the light in 2 different directions 1 south east and 1 north west at a high rate of speed they both had a red light strobe but each flash they moved faster and faster away faster than any plane i have ever seen !! there was no sound at all!! very strange  ??????", "the eeg shape thing moving with great velocity and glowing completely with white light  following a rainbow paththe object was egg shaped glowing fully with white light and was moving with superb velocity 4-5 times if a person see&apos;s a plan moving in the sky .

These are some facts that Ken has left out,  the stretch of road he is referring to is only about 3 nautical miles off the end of the north and south runway at Eplley airfield in Omaha .Also this stretch of road is approximately 16 miles from Offfutt Airforce Base,  Which is one of the most air guarded Airforce bases in the United States ( this is where they hid President  George W Bush on 9/11/01), With these facts I realized anything at just about any altitude in this area would be covered by extensive radar by both Eppley and Offfutt.I am not calling Ken a liar, but like I had said his description was very much the same as I have seen on other occasions on the very exact same stretch of road, the difference being on one occasion I stopped my vehicle to get a better look and realized that a jet on gliding approach does not really make that much noise and on a dark night with their landing lights only shining on parts of the fuselage, gives it the appearance that it looks more like an  odd shaped disc and because of the brightness of the landing lights it makes the non illuminated parts of the airplane very hard to see,", "A hovering object in the vicinity of &quot;The Lady of the Mountains&quot;.Travelling North on interstate 15, just past Butte on a streach of road going uphill.

My friend and the guy I was talking to were like wow did you see the lightning, but I was the only one that saw the tail of whatever it was burning out.

However, that is just a guess.  PD))", "It was early evening yet not yet completely dark on a clear night. In an slightly rural area. Our parents and siblins were already in their rooms. My sister and I (around 12 and 14 yrs old) were looking out my upstairs window watching what we at first thought was a airplane that was fairly close to our house, but there was no sound.  It seem to move quite slowly and we both stood in silence as we watched it, then all of a sudden it just stopped and it shot this beam of light straight up into the sky as though it was searching for something above it, the light moved back and forth straight above it.  At this point we began to scream at the same time as we tore down the stairs at the same time running into our parents bedroom sreaming for our father, we ran to our parent side of their bed as they were reading.  Our hands shaking  and not sure if we should cry or scream more, we all, the whole family ran outdoors to see but it was gone.  In that area there was nothing to interfere with viewing the whole sky, but there was nothing there, it was just gone.  To this day my sister and I talk about this and still get chills.  I have never seen anything like this since.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We watched for about a minute as it kept a straight course.  I looked down to step forward and when I looked back up my eyes focused on a rather bright star - next to where the satellite had just passed.  My partner did not stop looking up.  As my eyes found the satellite, we both saw it turn red and it looked like it shot straight out - towards space, then disappeared.  It happened really fast, like, a second or two.   We watched the sky for another couple of minutes &ndash; thinking it would reappear &ndash; but it did not. Planes come by our way frequently as we are almost beneath the flight path for Ames Research/Moffett Field.  Shortly (within about 30 seconds) after the satellite disappeared there was one such flight coming into Moffett.  I don&rsquo;t know if this came from the Moffett plane, but a contrail floated across the sky &ndash; visible to our eyes &ndash; roughly in the same path that the satellite had been going (we think it strange but probably not connected).  Perhaps it was the exhaust from the Moffett plane. Perhaps you will have others reporting about this in the Bay Area and we aren&rsquo;t the only ones who saw this.

There was a lighted dome in the center. The craft was moving slowly from SE to NNW at about 5,000 feet. Over the Franklin Mountains, this area is just east of Ft. Bliss and slightly southwest of White Sands Missle Range.I have a background in science, masters degree, and work at one of the military installations, I am familiar with many types of aircraft. This was very different. From observing the crafts speed, size, etc. I would say it traveling just slightly faster than stall speed, the craft was more or less 300 feet lateral and 100 feet front to back. Both of us are trained scientists working in our disiplines, there is no question about what we observed.((NUFORC Note:  We have received several similar reports from this area in the recent past.

As I was looking at the sky (Moon) i noticed something that looked like a Shooting Star. I asked my Fiancee to look at it. When she did it slowed down as it was going across the sky. Then it turned and did a figure 8 and proceeded into a circular motion.it was red then faded to white Then it turned too the left and shot strate backwards off into the distance.  Earlier this Month i was looking outside from my home and noticed a white light in the shape of a circle. I was looking at it for approxamately 5 seconds and it immediately stopped glowing and disappeared. I was a little shaken by this event but didnt think anything of it until tonight ( the second sighting) You must get a lot of these Sightings. But im telling you right now this is REAL!!! I&apos;m a highly intelligent person. And never thought anything of this sort before, i saw these two objects. It wasnt a plane,or a shooting star. It was a outside object that i have NEVER seen have so much control if itself. It was almost like it knew that we were looking at it, and wanted to let us know and understand that it WAS there.

The first 4&quot; or so was a Blue color with White borders, with the remaining 2&quot; or so a dark orange/red with the orange/red streak breaking up the farther East it went.  The width of the streak was about as wide as a pencil eraser held at arms length.  Speed: VERY FAST. At the end of the visible streak, the object went invisible!

I have seen many entries into the atmosphere by various different craft, but this is completely unlike anything I have seen before!!", "This object was observed by 4 adults and 7 of us kids, I felt a loss of time I cant explain.I had to have been 3-4years old! But the memory stayed with me all these years.In 1997 living in Los Angeles I went home to visit my mom who is still living and 78yrs young.My conversation started out one day as Mom I know Im not dreaming this but do you remember...before I could finish she said I know what youre going to say and yes you did see it. So, I went on to describe what I remembered seeing which was a silver cigar shaped object flying above this old school building in the background. She said talk to your aunt she remembers it too.At that time I didnt have the opportunity to do so.  But in March of 2002 I was visiting my mother again after her stroke.And at that time my aunt was there too. So we talked about it and she verified the same thing my mom had said yes we did see it. The lights around it and everything.  It scared everyone so bad it wasnt talked about except between the two of them.It wasnt discussed even with my uncle nor my father.  They checked the papers to see if anyone had reported it because this happened in broad daylight. They listened to the radio but nothing reported.At that time they didnt want to appear &quot;nuts&quot; so they just kept it to themselves.  They felt that being it was a beautiful Sunday afternoon and since we saw it others had to have seen it.At that point my mother said no one said a word the adults had been sitting on my aunts front porch and we kids were playing on the sidewalk running in and out of the gate.They just gathered up  and we got in the car and were taken home. Now, thats where our memories differ. I remembered everything they described.  But I also remember more. What I can add to the memory is that the object came down and hit hovered above the ground in the field next to the school.  It had to bemaybe 4-5 feet above the ground. Given the fact that I was just a child and not tall. I remember looking at the star ship and the lights around it was pulsating around the middle of it like a neon light goes around in a circle. The windows were rectangular panels but their were no seams. It all looked like one piece.it wasnt a shiny metal craft but it was a silver color.  For whatever reason I wasnt afraid.  Next, I remember being on the sidewalk across the street from it and in one of the rectangular panels was a little being about my size.This little person was in proportion in size. He appeared to have large eyes and tho his dress was like part of him it was as if we communicated through telepathy and he was saying goodbye and he raised his hand as if to wave at me.  This is the even more strange part...Nothing was moving but me and as I ran back to the gate opening at my aunts house all of a sudden motion started, I felt a slight jolt as things started moving again.  Everyone was jumping up gathering us up and getting home in a hurry without saying a word as to what had just happened. I had buried it in my mind til my own son had turned about the same age I was at the time and began to show me he had some special &quot;gifts&quot; from God. It triggered that memory in my mind.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "A bright white circular object moving quickly from north to south.I was standing outside with two other people at about 9:40 PM. I was facing east when I noticed a very bright circular white shape in the sky moving rather quickly from north to south. The object appeared to be about as big as looking at the full moon. Myself and both of the people I was with saw the object for about 10 seconds before it went out of sight behind some buildings. I don&apos;t think the object was a meteor or space debris, it did not have a tail and the brightness was consistent.", "triangle aprox. 20 ft on each side with a large white light in the front, two blue flashing light on the back, and small red in centerMy fiance and I was coming home from Trumann.

I woke him up and pulled over to the side of the road. the night before we had a sighting in the same place but the objects were not close enough to get much detail.  this night we had my home video camera with us in the car just in case we seen it again.  when i got the object in sight and seen it was heading over the road, i stopped to where i thought it might cross and pulled over to the side to wait.  he grabbed the camera and i was turning it on when it went over the top of my car. he said &quot;look at that&quot; and when i looked up i seen a large triangle figure that was a little higher up than the pine trees to our right.  the object was CLEARLY not a plane.  it had a large white light on the front tip and a blue flashing light on each of the back two tips.  when it went over our heads we could see a small red light in the center on the bottom, but by the time i got the camera on and got out of the car it had already passed. i got the back of the object as it went away and then it appeared to sort of travel up like it wanted to fly at a higher level.  i recorded from the time i got out of the car untill you couldnt see much detail anymore. the video will be very useful if it could be still framed but i was so scared when i shot it that its kind of jumpy where i was shaking.  these objects are in that area every time that we pass through there but we never have stopped to wait on them to come closer.  the night before when we witnessed a similar sighting they didnt come that close to us.  we called his parents to tell them what we were seeing and my phone kept cutting out with static sounds (which has never happened in the two year period that ive had that phone). as we pulled off my car lights lit up and beeped and then stopped and went ba! ck to normal. and the next morning when we woke up it was all over the news about a sonic boom heard in a town that is about a 25 minute drive from there.  there was even metiors hitting in some parts of arkansas. the only other thing we saw that night was something that appeared to be a falling star but we didnt think anything of it untill the next morning when we heard about all of the other activity.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and we found her to be both sincere, and credible.

I noticed a round red ball (basketball size) object darting around in the sky to the north of us, I mentioned this to my brother and we stood there watching this ball moving at incredible speeds not slowing down while reversing direction. when our friend walked up, we mentioned it to him. The moment that he joined us in watching this object the object stopped then moved toward us very slowly to alight upon an oak tree about 20 feet away from us. It then moved to center of bonnie mine road at about 15 feet in the air and began moving south down this road. We followed this object for about three quarters of a mile where the object alighted upon the cross arm of a light pole . upon our arrival at this pole this object lifted off and returned to the center of the road where it continued south.The object continued south for approximatley one quarter mile then turned left to cross a cow pasture. We arrived at the fence of the cow pasture and began arguing about crossing the fence to continue following this object. We were a little afraid to cross this fence to follow the object so we argued about doing so. While we argued this red glowing ball was suspended in the air aproximately 50 feet away and 20 feet in the air and absolutely quiet.We argued for about five minutes while watching this very beautiful and graceful ball in the night sky, Finally my friend decided that there was no way that I was going to cross that fence and gave up the argument. The very moment that he made that decision the odject shot straight up and out of sight in a fraction of a second. Over the years I have reviewed this encounter very carefully many times. The actions of this object would suggest to me, for example, that it had the ability to determine our thoughts. This object was at times less than 20 feet away and I was able to study it very closely. I could see into the ball of light and determined that it consisted of light. There was no craft, jus! t a ball of light. It was very similar to the ball of light filmed in Enland that appeared to be creating a crop circle. That ball of light appeared clear or whitish.

The wing tips were exactly spaced between the objects and the speed was exactly the same for all of the objects.

The story begins while my family and the couple mentioned, along with their son, were vacationing up north on Portage Lake.

Being only a few blocks from home, he peddaled home, as fast as he could, with the water tower and stationary ufo on his right and the field and his home on the left (Dan and Ann&apos;s home at the time was right at the field&apos;s edge).  Dan immdeiately got Ann to come and see the spectacle outside.  When they both got back outside, the disc was over the field, moving slowly in the direction of their home, then it stopped.  Dan and Ann watched the disc for several minutes, as it slowly changed direction, heading back toward the direction of the grocery store Dan had just came from.  As it! flew, it slowly spun (I am almost positive they said it spun) and was outlined with greenish-yellowish, almost fluorescent lights. During flight, it silently zig-zagged slowly back and forth while still heading in the same direction.  Dan and Ann watched the disc until it flew out of sight.  They never heard of anyone else seeing it or of any reports in the newspaper or on tv.~ These people I have known my entire life telling me of this event now, to me, makes the phenomena of UFOs and otherworldly life a reality.  Another thing that the couple emphasized in the telling of their story was that the disc moved as if it wasn&apos;t effected by the same scientific barriers as we on earth currently are- the way it zig-zagged during flight effortlessly gave them the distinct feeling that this craft was either other-worldly or far, far, far ahead of its time.(the date, time, and year of the sighting are mere estimates- I am absolutely sure that it was in the 1970&apos;s, though).((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It did not make any sound and moved slow, while over us.  Best guess would be 50mph or less, as it moved away from us, it gained altitude and speed, it then did a most unsual maneuver, then shot of in a straight line into space.  I am posting this because it seems that a similiar UFO was sighted in the general vicinity in March of 1996 and I would like to verify the unusual way the UFO left the area as described in that report and see if it matches what we observed.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Fishing was slow so I looked to the sky to see if I could spot any meteors. I saw a light dancing just above the mountains. I yelled to my friend to look and we both saw it speed to a stop, and then dart off to where we could no longer see it. We later heard what sounded like jets flying overhead minutes later, but we could not see lights from the aircraft. A couiple of years ago talking to a work mate who lives about five miles away from our sighting, said his son spotted a low flying sauser with lights that he also saw hovering above his house around Chritmas of around 1997.

It was a very cold but clear night. I live at a high elevation and the stars were very bright. As I stared at the stars I noticed an unusually bright blinking object. It was brighter than the other stars and was blinking with numerous colors at a high rate of intervals, unlike the lights of a plane or jet.I told my wife that I thought it was strange and asked her to come out. I retreived my binoculiars (Belle Howell 8x40 extra wide angle) and was in awe at what I could see.There was a bright circuliar light with what looked like four or five rapidly blinking lights. The object was stationary and not emitting any noise. I could not believe what I was seeing. Words cannot describe, I wish more people were there to witness this--- whatever, I dont know what it was. I then went next door and woke my neighbors and let them look through the binoculiars, there reaction was the same as mine.I called the local airport in Oxford to see if it was a weather balloon.They told methat there were no weather balloons in the area.I have some of it on video. I am not a pro so the picture did not come out to to good, but good enough. The object had moved further away at this point. After about a half hour it vanished. I hope to take it somewhere and see if they can clear up the picture. It was at night so you can not make out any clear shape.

It had dim yellow lights that were spaced out evenly in the front and were in the form of a triangle but without the sharp point (more of smooth edges). The back of it also had dim lights but fewer in numbers. One or two lights of same nature in the middle.  When I noticed it first it was a bit illuminated by the light  from the ground and I could see a shape of it.  It was a solid object (dark) except for the lights, and it almost looked like an egg, but it was so quick that I&apos;m afraid I could be mistaken of the shape.  My mother saw it at the same time, but as I called my husband out of the house, the object disappeared behind the trees.  It was flying silenty, and rather fast.  It didn&apos;t look like a plane, because it appeared to have too many lights and it was too broad.  It couldn&apos;t have been a flock of birds because it didn&apos;t change shape and moved too fast.  It just didn&apos;t look like anything I&apos;ve seen before.  I am very puzzled.  I would like to add that my mother had a sighting several weeks ago.  An object of a triangular shape with dim yellow lights on both sides, looked almost like a flock of geese, flew silently and quickly over our house.  She thought that it was birds, but first it&apos;s too late in the season, second, it was dark, so nothing could illuminate the birds like that, and third, the lights didn&apos;t change shape.", "Blue object shot across the skyTraveling south on the Interstate 5 adjacent to the Griffith Park Golf Courses, a bright blue comet-like object shot across the sky.

But, not enough to inhibit your vision. you could actually hear the snow land it was that clear out. We stopped the car and watched the craft for about 15 minutes as it hung motionless. The only think that seemed to move were the lights that out lined the craft. It was triangular in shape. It appeared to be about 300 feet in the air.It could have been 200 feet long.

We ran toward it, and as it seemed to hover, quite low, we could look right up inside of it-- it was a large, round or oval(disk shaped) craft with a row of lights around the perimeter of the underside of it.  The lights seemed to move around the perimeter of the craft.  We could see what seemed to be a bright hazy light coming from what appeared to be the bottom of, or inside of the aircraft.  After hovering, it moved away, but continued at a very low elevation for quite a while-- all of the kids on our street who were outside ran after it for as long as we could before losing sight of it.  As long as we were fairly close to it, we could hear a rather strange whirring or whooshing noise.  As my mother had gotten a glimpse of it from inside the house and the porch, she called and made a report to the police department.  The next day there was a small article in the Savannah newspaper  stating that there were numerous reports of the sightings, but the air force had determined that it was actually a weather balloon.  However, I don&apos;t think it was, judging from my memory of the object.  There was nothing about it to suggest a balloon of any kind.  I have long been curious about any other reports of this sighting, but have been unable to find any, and the Savannah Morning News cannot even find the small article about the sightings in their archives (I&apos;m not positive about the date, or even the year, but am fairly certain it would have been the early 1960&apos;s).

A loud buzzing noise woke me (I remember covering my head with a pillow).  I realized that the buzzing seemed to come from inside my head.I went to the window and saw what I thought were 3 electrical company employees (linesmen) at the far side of the parking lot (less than 100 feet from my view).  I thought they were electrical linesmen because they had their backs to me and appeared to be wearing hard hats (vey shiny hard hats that looked like chrome). Each was dressed oddly (I say this because they appeared to be wearing dark &quot;wet suits&quot;.Each looked to have on &quot;mittens&quot; as I saw only a &quot;thumb&quot; and what looked to be a mitten like glove. Each of the individuals looked to be 5 feet tall or less. I said quietly to my wife &quot;what the hell are these idiots doing out there in the middle of the night?&quot;  The 3 were clearly visible because they were illuminated by an overhead light source.  One &quot;individual&quot; was looking up into the tree line, another was looking very intently at the ground and the third was looking around almost as if keeping a watch.  I continued standing at the window behind a very large, potted philodendron plant that we kept in the bedroom. The three individuals suddenly turned as if they were given a command (right face) and faced directly at the window where I was standing. (Please understand that the bedroom was on the second floor and we had not turned on any lights nor made any noise to attract attention - the buzzing was still quite loud at this point).  I felt immediately uncomfortable and crouched down behind the plant.  As the individuals turned toward me, it appeared that one of them had a reflective stripe running down his pant leg (much like the satin stripe on tuxedo trousers).  The helmets were no longer visible from the front (only slightly around the perimeter of their heads - for lack of a better description - like an ancient Egyptian headdress).  They had unusually large reflective goggles over their eyes (or unusually large reflective eyes). I asked my (ex)wife to please take a look.  She got out of bed and came to the window.  My recollection is that the 3 individuals then turned to their right again (all at the same moment).  They all walked as if they were in a strobe light.  Two went out of my field of vision (behind the maitenance garage in the parking lot) and one simply &quot;disappeared&quot; from the open field.  The overhead light and the buzzing stoppeed at the moment the last individual &quot;disappeared&quot;. I did not tell my Ex what I saw but asked her what she had seen.  Her description to me was the same as what I witnessed.  She, however, described them as walking away in &quot;slow motion&quot; and she was also unclear as to what happened to the third individual. We went back to bed.  The night was clear prior to the incident but it did rain after the incident.  In the morning, I went out behind the garage to see if there were a light source.  There was a fixture but it had not spot light bulbs in it.  There were no marks on the ground.  I saw no craft and maitained that if it had gone forward, backward or up I would have seen it so it could only have gone into the ground. I mentioned the incident only to my closest friend who insisted that I get the number for UFO Locater and call them to report it.  After 2 weeks, I relented and went to the Ridgefield police and got the UFO Locator 800 number from them.  I reported the incident to Locator and asked if anyone else had seen or reported anything unusual that night.  They told me that there had been 26 reports for that same night from Katoonah, NY to Danbury, CT (along the power grid and fault line - which I never knew existed).  They subsequently called to interview me about the sighting.  When I told them the craft could only have gone &quot;down into the ground or I would have seen it&quot; they asked me if I thought that it could have gone to another dimension or time.  I had not considered that possibility and said so. The memory is still vivid after nearly 27 years.  It was suggested to me that I submit to hypnosis to see if I could recall more.  I did in 1981 and had kept a copy of the tape that was made.  I heard myself yelling about the individuals looking closely into my face - yelling about their eyes and yelling for help because I was outside of my apartment.

I was letting my dog outside and I noticed a bright light to the south. It was still dark outside at this time. At first I thought it was a plane but it was not on a normal flight path. I know this because I watch the sky quite often. Also it was moving too slow to be a plane. After about 30 seconds of watching this light move to the north I decided to get my camcorder. I began to record and as I zoomed in I was shocked. There were three bright lights in the shape of a triangle. I taped it for about 30 seconds before my battery went dead. I have watched this tape a dozen times and can see the faint outline of the triangle. Unfortunatly it is on a actual hi-fi mini tape and I cannot zoom in on the object. I need help getting this put into digital format.", "I do not care what you do with this, there has to be an explanation.First, I am a skeptic; I have given up on my childhood imagination to make things better than they appear.  Secondly, I punched in UFO on Google and this is where I am.  I am somewhat disturbed by what has happened last night and on the way into work this morning I still feel disturbed.  About 1930 hrs last night, I stepped out onto my back porch to check on the horses.  Coming out of my door, I immediately noticed a plane with red and blue lights on the wings and that it appeared rather low flying, since most planes are at cruising altitude around my place.  As I looked just to the right of the East bound aircraft, I noticed a huge white light traveling in a Southerly direction.  I said, &ldquo;man these planes are going to collide,&rdquo; I immediately yelled for my wife &ldquo;come here now and quickly.&rdquo;  As she came out the back door I said &ldquo;what is that&rdquo; she said &ldquo;that is a plane&rdquo;, I said &ldquo;no&rdquo; pointing straight up &ldquo;that is a plane, with the red and blue lights on the wings&rdquo; (this was the plane the object I thought was going to collide with as it was just about over the house now.)  She freaked!  I freaked and started shaking &ldquo;no way, absolutely not.&rdquo;  Ok, I was not disturbed by the fact of a white light traveling (reflection from the sun, etc&hellip;); I was disturbed buy the fact of its speed and its ability to stop on dime.  Now this stopping could be explained by my angle to this being about 50 degrees or so to me standing on the deck and could mean this object was climbing.  That it is explainable.  However, I know what is off that deck out over the area during the day as much as I do at night.  I am disturbed with the fact that as this object traveled and stopped traveled and stopped, traveled and stopped, it freaking disappeared!  It was gone!  Poof!  I am a professional and cannot go around blabbing this off that I saw something that cannot be explained.  I feel better now that I have described this as it defies everything I have ever thought physically and mechanically possible.  Do what you do with! this stuff &ndash; I do not care.  Thanks for listening.  One other thing is that shortly after that incident about 4 minutes or so, another plane was on the same path at about the same altitude.", "I was bowhunting before dawn and the field in front of me was suddenly illuminated from an unknown source.I was sitting in a tree stand, bowhunting for deer.  It was still completely dark.  The tree stand was approximately 50 yards from a cornfield.  The whole field was suddenly completely illuminated.  I then saw 2 small lights moving across the north side of the cornfield.  After 2 to 3 minutes they came back across the field and disappeared.  The field continued to be lit up for several more minutes.  Then the light went out and it was completely dark again.  At no time did I hear any type of sound and at no time did the light move.", "In the clear afternoon sky I saw two bright lights moving in a random motion.It was a bright clear afternoon with only a few small clouds in the sky. It was a couple of hours before sunset. I was walking my dog in front of Sheffield Elementary School when a light in the sky caught my attention.  As I looked up I saw two bright dots of light over the school.  At first I thought it must be a reflection of the sun on a commerial aircraft but I realized that wasn&apos;t the case as a watched them.  The two lights were moving in a random motion, gently zigzagging in a South West direction.  I believe the objects were quite high but I cound not be certain.  One of the lights stopped almost directly above me and the other light circled around it and came closer to it and stopped.  After a couple of seconds the 2nd light continued cirling around the 1st and headed in the opposite direction, the 1st light then started going in that direction, again both moving in an oscillating motion.  The 2nd light made a big arc and headed South.  The first light approached the 2nd light and again they both stopped for a couple seconds.  They both started heading South towards Montague Center, they moved further apart from each other and from then on kept moving in a straight line and kept getting higher as they went.  By this time I had walked around to the back of the school and I was looking at them from a completely different angle so I know the brightness wasn&apos;t a reflection. As I continued to watch them a commercial jet flew across my field of view.  As I watched them go through a small thin cloud their brightness only dimmed a little, then they went into another cloud and I lost sight of them.", "Strange Line Over ManhattanI was watching the Lunar Eclipse on top of the Empire State building when I saw the strange formation. It looked like a wavy line floating across the sky VERY high up. It was hardly lit from the city lights. There were many people around who saw the same thing.

Date and Time - Tue Dec. 16 2003 at 10:50 p.m to 10:55 p.m  Location - Glen Rose, Texas  (about 80 miles southwest of Dallas/Ft.Worth)  My Question - Please email me if anyone else saw the same object. I cant be the only person to have seen it My email  tardo03@hotmail.com  I was walking out to my truck to head to work. I work the night shift and its located very close to my home so that allows me to leave about 5-10 min. before 11pm to make it there on time. Just as a habit I looked up to the night sky to gaze at the stars. Off in the distance toward the west and moving east/north east I spoted what I thought was a very low flying plane. As I continued to watch the object some things began to occur to me. On the out skirts of my home town there is a TXU Nuclear Power Plant about 5 miles out. We dont often see low flying anything because of it. As the object came closer I noticed 3 very dim lights on it. On the left was a green light and on the right was a red light. In the middle, slightly higher was another red light but it was noticably smaller than the two on either side of it. I know that all planes have lights that display these colors but these lights weren&apos;t blinking that were on constantly and did not flash once. I was still thinking that this might be a plane but there was no sound and with how low it was flying anything moving or flying through the air would have some sort of engine nosie but this thing was perfectly silent and steadly moving ahead.  Not until the object passed over head did I see the true shape of it and it was a perfect triangle and looked mostly black or a dark grey. I jumped in my truck and tried to follow the flying triangle but lost sight of it behind nearby houses and trees as I made my way to the road. By the time I reached the road it was hardly visable and disappered into the night sky. I estimate the size to be about that of a private jet or small comerical carrier and the speed at about 50 mph and the height that it was flying between 120-130 feet. I don&apos;t know or assume the object had anything to do with the nuclear power plant but I think they may have some sort of radar that could have possibly detected the object. Please email me back if you or anyone else might have any info on this event or let me know if there were any other re! ported sightings in the area.

I had the keys to his car and shined this blue LED into the hills to enhance the visibility as to what was happening.  A few moments later, I heard odd crying-distress sounds as if they were from a child or cat, etc. I assumed it was an animal, but however was shaken by the experience and ran inside the house.  After I told my cousin of the sounds, we went outside with his camera to see what we could find.  We heard the sounds again, which were shortly followed by odd electronic beeping sounds, not tones that would be musical, but microtonal noises.  We became frightened, and got in the car and drove to my house, which is 100 ft up the road.  We loaded the keyboard into my garage because the house was locked and we forgot the keys to the house.  We relectantly stepped outside again and heard more rustling.  Oddly, his steering wheel had become very sticky, like a film of slime, (this might be condensation, but could be related).  This was a truly odd, crazy experience. EXTRA NOTE - My cousin, who is now 19, saw an unidentifiable creature in the hills when he was 10 or 11 years of age.  He reported this creature as being like a monkey or sloth, clinging to a tree...it was a sandy brown colored animal, slender body with a big head...he became frightened and ran inside the house.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Suddenly a VERY large light the shape of a cylinder, dropped straight down out of the sky traveling at a speed I have never comprehended. It was solid white light. It appeared to be in our outer atmosphere. But it was so large seeing it out in space, it had to be absolutely enormous. It just dropped out of space straight down toward earth. It had white light trailing behind it similar to a comet. It was so large it size, and just dropped behind Mount Umunhum (mountain that separates Santa Cruz from San Jose).

I have seen very bright, red objects slowly gliding through the nights sky (approx 2000 ft), to slow to be human.  These objects have a very bright white light that seems to orbit around them, clearly giving them a disc shape.  They will move across the sky slowly, sometimes then shoot of into the stars, sometimes stop completely, sometimes manuever in a different directions.  Lately ( the last week), every night I have noticed a couple ufo&apos;s in the same spot that to the naked eye appear to be VERY bright twinkling stars, but when further observing, I looked through binoculars, and was AMAZED at what I saw; Clearly, they where white/yellow objects hovering/still in the sky with BLUE, GREEN, RED, White, etc.  lights flashing all around.  They are clear as day that they are within our atmosphere, and obviously some type of space craft.  They are fascinating to watch, and I told my friends who didn&apos;t believe me at the time, but I showed them as well, and they are now shocked and amazed that they actually are there!  I believe they may be watching/observing, and that them BLENDING in with the stars, is actually a form of CAMOFLAUGE for lack of better words, and this is how they stay virtually are unseen by most.  I am getting a telescope this weekend, and I will take pictures and send them in, but until then all I can say is LOOK CLOSER.  I would also very much like to know if there are others in Maine that can say they have seen something similiar, or any ufos for that matter.

While there, I became fascinated with UFOs, for a number of reasons.  The most signifacant thing that turned me into a believer was an actual sighting.  I remember it perfectly:  It was about 8:30 pm and I was watching TV in my bonus room.  When the commercial came on, I walked into my room to get a pencil for this quiz-type thing that was on the show.  I had a fairly large window in my room (it faced my neighbor&apos;s feild in their backyard), and we had quite a bit of air traffic in my neighborhood (I lived in a suburban neighborhood), so it wasn&apos;t unusual to have airplanes flying overhead.  But tonight when I looked out there, it was different.  The craft I saw was much to close to be an airplane, and it was noiseless.  I would have missed had I not looked out there.  It was like a &quot;V&quot; in shape, but more boomerang-like.  It had 6 lights that I could see.  It was set up like this:  o O 00 O o        (&quot;o, O, 0&quot; represent lights)  The two lights on the sides (the smallest ones) were not blinking at all.  The two slightly bigger ones were blinking slowly, and the biggest ones (in the center) were blinking rapidly.  It was almost like a code, or a pattern, the way they were blinking.  Every second the middle light blinked, the smaller ones blinked with it (if you could understand that).  The lights seemed to change colors, from a tint of green to a tint of red.  The color that there seemed to be more of was a bluish-white color, like halogen.  It moved south-western directly over my house, and my neighborhood, at speeds slightly faster than I have seen any airplane move.  It could have been an airplane, except for one vital thing.  It was silent.  It was about an estimated 50 feet over house, and if it had been an airplane, my entire house would have reverberated.  Instead it moved silently, smoothly over my neighborhood, right over my roof until I could see it no more.  I dashed to the front of the house, ripping open the door, but it was no more.  The craft had disappeared.", "I was looking up at the sky slightly northward hoping for a glimpse of the aurora due to recent high solar flare activity when I noticed a large very dimly glowing round object silently moving across the sky in an east to west direction.  It was barely discernable because it&apos;s glow was so dim, but it looked much larger than I would expect any craft that high up to be.  If my estimate of its height was in error it should not have been so dim or silent.  I see planes in the sky all the time because I live near the Honolulu airport and I have even seen many helicopters in the night sky flying without their lights on, so it was startling to see something so very different in the sky.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It appeared to be hovering directly over Branmar shopping center, probably 200 or 300 feet in the air. Each time there was a clearing the trees I could see the object. The trees only covered the object for a few seconds at a time. After about 5 minutes my view was again blocked by the trees. Once I reached a clearing, again after only several seconds of obscured vision, the object was gone with no trace of which direction it went.

The object was not a star or planet as I have been avidly watching this part of the sky recently to see mars approach to earth.

This is how I was able to know that the craft was stationary-as the car moved around the curve I was turning and could see the lights beening out of sight as we came &quot;behind&quot; it on the back side of the curve. (there was lights there also. As I was looking behind me I noticed that the dog was staring at it too!  We drove on not saying anything at all for a few minutes and my boyfriend asked,&quot;Did you just see something back there?&quot;  I said yes. He said,&quot;what did you think you saw&quot;?   I said, &quot;you tell me what you saw first&quot;.  We had this back and forth exchange for awhile before we talked about it because neither wanted the other to think them nuts!  He did see it too.  The rest of the evening we both felt as if we were in a dream like state.  I tried to call the Mattoon air port I didn&apos;t get an answer.  The next day my boyfriend brought me the paper and there had been several sightings that night.  One in Terra Houte, Indiana, and another in Decatur I think.  Any how I do not know what it was but I am positive of what I saw.  I haven&apos;t seen anything like it since.

The sun had set, and the dusk was gradually fading into night. The hills and mountains were shrouded in black and the horizon glowed a bright pink bordered by a dull yellow. We were in the middle of the desert, mind you. At some point on the highway, my brother asked me if you can see shooting stars more clearly in the desert. &quot;I don&apos;t think it&apos;s quite dark enough for that,&quot; I said. At that moment, three orange-yellow lights flashed into view in the sky over Prescott. At first I thought it was an airplane, but I realized that couldn&apos;t be the case: the lights were arranged in a staight line of three fireballs, and the one on the far right blinked out, and the middle one followed it and blinked out as well, leaving only one light in the sky. A split second later, however, the middle one flashed back into sight and then the far right as well. The three fireballs shone brightly; they were round and fat and cast a constant glow, meaning they didn&apos;t glimmer or glitter at all. Except for when they blinked, their luster didn&apos;t oscillate at all: no glimmering, shimmering, glistening, glittering, gleaming or other such pretty verbs. After some 7 seconds or so, all of them blinked out one by one--from the right to the left.

On 11/20/03 at 20:00hrs I witnessed two lights, side by side, that were separated by approximately 1 degree. They flashed in unison twice. The color was about the same as a flash on a camera. The flashes were about 1 second or less apart. I went inside to get my binoculars. When I came back outside, I waited for the light to reappear, as it had before. It did reappear, but there was only one light and it was more round (it was still no larger than Mars looked recently, but this was not Mars)and the color was more of a yellow-orangish hue. It had also moved about 10 degrees to the east and only flashed once. I waited for more. At 20:23hrs the light came back between the positions of the other two sightings and seemed to twist and fade from blue-whte to a yellow-orange color. I have not seen them since.

Scopeville is around 70 miles south of Kansas City, just south of the village of Parker, Kansas. At approximately 7:30 PM CST, I was observing Mars through my 8 inch Meade LX90 telescope when I noticed a bright red light on the southern horizon.  For an instant, I thought it was the star Sirius but quickly realized that Sirius should appear on the eastern horizon, and the light was nearly due south of me.  I turned my telescope on the light and saw that it was not a single light but two nearly identical lights, looking very much like a double star, each being of first visual magnitude.   As I continued to observe the lights, I noted that they were moving slowly to the North Northwest.  I followed the lights in my scope until they were overhead and slightly to the west of me.   At no time did I observe either red/green navigation lights or any flashing strobe lights. I attempted to get a digital photograph of the lights through my telescope and obtained an image of two fuzzy reddish orange patches of light.", "I live in New Westminster (deleted by HBCC UFO) Street.  Just about 20 mins ago at approx 4.30 P.M. I saw what I thought was a streak across the lower part of the sky probably close to Richmond.  I thought at first it was airplane, you know when they streak across the sky with the sun somewhere in the background lower on the horizon.  It had a fairly long trail, that&apos;s what caught my attention. It was orange and white across the full length of it. It moved across the sky from left to right and was very bright against the soon to be setting sun. But there was still enough light out to make out all details, as the sun was full in the sky.  When I headed out onto my balcony to get a closer look rather than through my bedroom window, the thing reversed and started going from right to left.  Still not too concerned about what I saw although a little bizarre, I continued to watch it move to the left.  Suddenly the streak of what I thought was vapors, it  just suddenly disappeared within about 1.5 seconds, and it all came together as one.  That was unusually.  The vapors don&apos;t just dissipate within 1.5 seconds.  Then I saw an object in the sky again and it was rather small.  Then I thought for a moment there were two, close together.  At this moment I grabbed my cell phone and made a call to a friend to tell him what I was seeing. The reversal was wired (from going left to right then right to left and the disappearing vapors, that was weird. Thank you to the witness for their report.

There was a telephone pole between me and the air craft.  I stopped my car confused as to why it wasn&apos;t moving and watched it for quite some time.  There was nothing in my life experience that I could draw on to explain what was happening to me.  I sat there tranfixed just looking at it for what appeared to be a long time trying to make some sence out of what I was seeing.  It was approx. 1 1/2 car lengths across and was made of a material that looked like burnished aluminum.  There was a &quot;seam&quot; in the center as you would see if you put two plates together in a () direction but on it&apos;s side.  Strangley enough there was no sound coming from the saucer nor from anything else.  No sound from birds or any other noises one hears at this time of day n a country road.  I was about 15 to 20 feet from this object and it never moved until I lost my nerve and drove away as fast as I could.  I had two other sightings that summer.   All three were up close and personal.  The third time my mother was with me.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

As we watched (the sky was still bright from the explosion) then it crashed into the water about 1.5 km off shore. As far away as we were you could see the water splash from the inpact. After that there were no flames like there would be if a plane had crashed. I am 100% positive this was not a plane nor a meteorite.

The house where we were is situated on top of a hill facing east-southeast.  Directly across the highway from the house is a field that had recently been clear-cut.   The house is about 1/8 mile from the highway.  Anyway, the night was clear and we were all getting ready to party.  I can attest that the friend I arrived with and myself had not had any alcohol yet.  I can&apos;t speak for the others.  We were all out in the yard just off the front porch.  I turned away from the porch and looked across the highway, as I guess others did at that time, since we all chorused in on a &quot;What the hell is that?&quot; comment at about that same time.  What I observed was a pink, amorphous object perhaps 1 mile away, directly over the aforementioned field.  I guess at that distance it was about the size of a nickel held at arm&apos;s length.  By this time everyone had looked, but I guess we were all pretty much speechless.  The center of the object appeared to change color slightly, maybe going into an orangish color.  The shape of the object had been shifting continously and at no time had taken on a &quot;normal&quot; shape.  It moved towards the south very slowly on level, then took about a 35 degree or so downward turn. It continued down for what I guess would be 25 yards or so, then came to a stop directly above a small stand of trees that had not been cut.  After a few seconds, the object began to descend downwards, still very slowly, and went behind the stand of trees, I assume to land, and we lost sight of it.  The object had no lights but rather the entire thing glowed with the pinkish light.  It could be called a neon pink probably, as it was pretty intense.  The idea of investigating came up, but was quickly voted down due to mass cowardice(myself included I must admit).  I&apos;ve heard a lot of stories and seen a lot of strange things around there, but that one took the cake! Anyway, we were all there for at least an hour afterwards, I personally watched the area very closely, but did not see the object again.  My friend and I discussed it later and agreed that it was unlike anything we had seen.  I&apos;ve also ready several reports on here and haven&apos;t read of anything like it.  Maybe it was swamp gas, but we don&apos;t think so.", "((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and found her to be exceptionally lucid and credible.  She insisted that she viewed the object of interest for several minutes, as she drove to work.  It then suddenly shot off to the west.  Please see other reports from California, and other states.  If her report is accurate, the object was not a meteoric event.  Meteors do not hover in the sky.  PD))A bright yellow egg-shaped firey object suddenly appeared in the west on 11/20/03 at l7:30 hours, suddenly vanishing and leaving a smoke trail.About 5:30 p.m., mountain standard time, I was driving home from work and was about 2 1/2 miles from my home in El Rito, NM  (the one near Abiquiu) when a large bright yellow object suddenly appeared in the western sky.  Venus was setting brilliantly in the west, and this object looked like it was one inch to the left, or south, of it, if you held up a finger and squinted. It was an egg-shaped object but definitely had some jagged protrusions, particularly on the left side, and looked to be all on fire.   It was about as big as the sun which had just set. When the object first suddenly appeared, it was zooming toward Earth straight down and moving at the velocity of a shooting star.  But unlike a shooting star, it never zoomed across the zenith of the sky or made any horizontal movements.  Flames appeared to be shooting out from the jagged protrusion on the left, and from the top (the part pointing away from the Earth), although the whole thing looked to be on fire , and bright yellow. As the object was zooming toward Earth, it suddenly vanished!  It did not go down behind some mountains to the west of us--it just plain vanished, leaving a wiggly crooked smoke trail behind it.  The smoke was blue-black or black, and it hung in the air for a long time. By 5:45 p.m., I had arrived in El Rito.  It was almost dark but I could still see a glimpse of the smoke trail through the trees.  This entire incident lasted about 15 minutes. I was travelling about 45 mph when the object first appeared and I slowed to 30 mph.  I continued to watch it for at least another couple of miles.  I didn&apos;t stop. The most amazing thing of all is that the object suddenly vanished without hitting the Earth.  The smoke trail in the air was most definitely between us, here at El Rito and the mountains to the west of us. El Rito is about 55 miles northwest of Santa Fe, in the mountains of Northern New Mexico, in Rio Arriba County. That&apos;s what I saw!  That&apos;s my report.  Weirdness!

It was just before the full eclipse, I know the time approx from reading prior when the full point was to be reached just after 8pm local. It was in the final of eclipse. I had been outside in a dark area of the yard, I had been observing the moon, mars in the south, air traffic, and was looking also for sattelites by this time, which i have several times seen after my eyes get adjusted. Looking east at the moon, at a point 10 degree south and 1 o&apos;clock high to my position i detected movement very far up, at first i filtered it out cause it was unlike any other movement i have seen in the sky before. I had nothing to compare this too and initially dismissed it. It came from very high up, outside the atmosphere i would have to say. It moved oddly..a translucent trail..it shifted/wobbled/fluttred its way to a point se at 30 degree altitude and settled a few degrees lower. I have observed aircraft since a child at boing feild in Renton, seen the harrier, sr-71, f-18&apos;s tail dance on the tarmac at airshows, and i recall being unable to identify what i was seeing cause i had no real world anything to compare it too. I was thinking..thats not civilian, and then out loud to my partner I said &quot;Is that military?&quot; Can you see that thing, Can you see it? and she responded to an affirmative, and she asked what is it&quot; and i replied i dont know, keep your eyes on it. I was standing all this time and i forced myself to move so as to take bearing on it. I was having difficulty judging its size. It was either footballs feilds in size about a mile away or Really big farther away. I noticed two things right away. the whole area...just lost sound and when i made sound it went into the direction  of the craft. WHat I saw was the Back end of a craft. There was a length to it forward that i was unable to get clear veiw of, but the back end of it showed as a wide thick rectangle. there were three round areas spaced evenly apart where light of changing hot colours emitted on the extreme ends, twinkling. I could see detail of the ! structure. the surface showed no indication of conformance to aerodynamic principles of smoothness, intead it showed angular extruded surfaces. It was white surfacing. The craft reminds me of battlestar galactica craft it was flatish white and some areas were highly illuminated. The whole craft semed to shift and then it could be seen sitting where it was, or its lights went off, like it blinked or the light was bending/flashing around it. There was more than one moment where everything was black and just the six round hot lights in the sky and I thought of ballons when i realized this craft was floating in the air stationary. It took over a minute for it to come down from up high and settle where i could see itlike this and I got to see it like this for about 10 seconds at least. It did a wiggle quite visibly and it started to ease forward and then it darted ahead, I called out behind me &quot; It&apos;s leaving&quot; to my partner and sked if she was seeing it taking off and she said yes. this craft was big, very big for us to have observed it as it travelled across the southern most/east, or south portion of the sky. It increased speed in  jerk and I exclaimed verbally how fast it was and got a ya from my partner. It sped south and then angled/deflected west into clouds or ?. About a minute or two later a thing i have also never seen before came flying at low angle from the east. It was bright, lite yellow/white glowing object in or out of the clouds the light of it showed, it was not round but an angled shpe of &quot;glow&quot;. it travelled in a straight line. I was moving accross the horizon so fast i puzzled if it was up close, I accept the fact that this was a large object far away travelling at very high speed. I felt rather than heard its passing, it was radiating but not at what my ears pick up maybe. i think,it too did something to the sound. It travelled from east to west like the first craft and was gone.. We waited outside listening and looking. The moon was gone and the area was now clouding over and after anothe! r 10 minutes went inside to warm, my partner started to talk about it and i said stop, you go draw what you saw and ill go draw what i saw. We drew and  had saw the same rectangular object, we both agreed it had fluttred down. She clearly recognized it to be machinery/craft,  but was unsure initially of size and distance. we both saw the same set of three lights and the rectangle backend of the craft and some structure forward. When the craft moved forward the pair of three round ligt areas remained constant in spread apart and facing direction. We kept asking ourselves if we had just seen what we had seen. And the answer was always yes, we were not intoxicated and the drawings proved to us we had both seen the object, which I cannot deny was clearly an intelligent or purposeful moving craft that I SAW come down from very high up hover and do a systems check or something and then move south in quickening/blink/shudders/hops forward. My Partner is a Doctoral Candidate in information sciences, I am a late 30&apos;s software consultant with a background in oilfeild exploration and commercial diving. I have good eyesight. I know that what i saw was big, came from way high up, hovered so i could see the round engine ports of some sort, and that after a breif time, it moved out at very fast speed. It was soooo obviously a space craft that i was left knowing somehow that I am primitive, stuck on a planet of socially primitive beings.  Additional details and impressions. I saw or had sense that a number of things or objects were moving around in the air, but got no clear site of them if there were, but feelings that i get when bats or birds or bees, mosquitos, came up at the time and i tried scanning a bit with my eyes, the returned to trying to focus on the craft, which could be only for a second before it twinkled, blacked out or twisted light around itself. I also felt scanned, or as if i was being watched, that is a clear unmistakable fact that i felt that, and we both expressed the fact to each other of having felt it..being looked at. When the second craft, the glowing object, I gotta confess, I was all senses lit up and very spooked and ready. I kept us outside, quiet for long enough to establish that there wasnt imediate nearby detctable action then went in and did best to establish to myself what i had seen. After we agreed that what we saw was a spaceship, we both got quiet, she went onto the internet, I made some more checks on the night sky that was now cloudy, then sat down and went over everything I had just saw. I am known to have a photographic memory. We both know what we saw and we are both wondering what kindof peoples are we that interplanetary society is ignoring us, or blatantly moving about so. We are evaluating everything we know in respect of implications on our ...human society with respect to why a clearly advanced society or intelligence is not being acknowledged in our common daily understanding or is about the planet and ignoring us. Are we observed to be unsociable?   Clearly this planet was visited by a spaceship on the above date and time, it is now a fact that I am going to have to live with. Being as I am relatively young something tells me that this is not the last time that I will have direct knowledge of these objects, and the implications will some how be made manifest. I also realize now that the object moved in such ways that my brain kept trying to interject that it was not there, as it moved in speeds/shifts that i had no prior knowledge to confirm it too. I am confident now that having the experience that i can anticipate the movements of these objects and tune an movementy awareness for them, much like training the eyes to see sattellites as opposed to aircraft or stars.((NUFORC Note:  We presume the date of the alleged sighting was in the year 2003.

As I said, I was taking some photographs and looking up, it was partly cloudy and I noticed one or two &quot;conventional&quot; aircraft in the sky and identified them by their red/white flashing lights as well as some sound.  The other object appeared and looked to be higher in the sky than the other aircraft, however also appeared to be larger.  I didn&apos;t think anything of it first and went on with what I was doing.

We noticed the colors kept changing from whitish to orange, green, red and various colors in between. I got my telescope out and looked at it. It was then that I could see the shape and how the colors swirled from the inside of the object. The colors changed like that of our fiber optics. It was fascinating to see. The object made no sound and hovered in the same spot for 5 in. or so. The object to our south went red and got very small and appeared to drop straight down. Then it was gone.

So far, scientists don&apos;t now for sure what happened. Astronomers do not think the flash was caused by recent sun flares, or last week&apos;s Leonid meteor shower. Whatever it was, they don&apos;t believe it caused any damage. Astronomer Brian Day said, &quot;Most meteors burn completely in the atmosphere. This was big enough where something might have come down, but if it did, it was out over the Pacific Ocean.&quot;  Astronomers say it was likely a space rock that put on quite a light show when it burned up on its way through Earth&apos;s atmosphere. It was seen as far away as Sacramento.", "Long Triangular Object seen around eclipseI was with some of the physics and math students at Williams College were looking at the eclipse that night and I noticed this flying object out of the corner of my eye. After further discussion, two of the other students saw it as well. We believe that it was a UFO because of its flying nature and odd shape that didn&apos;t look like a plane. It had a definate haze around it, but one could make out three standout areas that were more luminous. It was like a triangle, but one that is very long and not very high, almost like a semi circle with ends.", "sighted a huge, bright, full &quot;moon&quot; without typical moon markings directly above the roadside.Thursday,6/11/1964 was a beautiful clear night.  Driving north on Rt. 128 a short distance before the Rt. 109 exit, I glanced ahead to my left, at what I thought was a huge bright full moon a short distance above a small pine tree on top of a rock formation.  I was mesmerized by the fact that it was so large and bright and so close to the roadside.  My fascination turned to terror when I realized that there were no markings on it.  I also, couldn&apos;t shake the feeling that I was being watched.  I sped up, desperately wanting to get away and yet, also wanting to take the next exit,(Rt. 109) back to the previous one, (Rt. 1) to return and see it again.  But, I was a young woman, driving alone and shaking like a leaf.I was deep in thought,puzzling over what I had just seen, when, a few miles away, where the trees and foliage by the roadside no longer blocked my view, I saw the real full moon on the horizon, markings and all.  At my family&apos;s behest,I did not reported it to the police. I was a teacher in the local high school in my home town of Arlington and they were afraid that I would be held up to ridicule.A couple of weeks later, I heard a radio interview with a man who was the head of the UFO group in Ma.  I contacted him and submitted the form he sent me.  His first name was Raymond, but I cant remember his last name.  I never heard from him, after that.In December, of 1964,(I remember it as the final Sunday issue of the Boston Globe for the year,) a full page spread was run concerning UFO sightings in N.E. for the year. It was stated in the article that 3 people in Hingham, Ma. had reported that very same sighting, on that date. So. at least I was vindicated before my family, who were skeptics.I have never forgotten my experience and have spoken of it many times over the years. But, I still have difficulty dealing with the attitudes of those who listen and look at me askance.  I know what I saw was real.As for electrical effects...from the time I was a small child, during an electrical storm, I get an odd sensation in my chest, a reaction I guess and I felt that same sensation as I drove past that object.", "Three dull  yellow lights in the sky!!!At around 1814 I was out on my balcony smoking with my wife and was looking at the night sky as I always do when ever I go out. I happen to look over in the area across from my apartment towards the stadium, and noticed what seemed like a bright landing light on an airplane over the horizon. At first I thought it was just that because it was not moving really fast or turning rather just sitting in one place. Then as I am watching this light waiting to see it turn for the glide slope for it&apos;s FAP into SD Airport another light came up from below the horizon at least from what I could see to be the horizon with a building in my view. Anyway another light came up same color and size as the one I am watching, and moved along side of the first light. These lights were a dull yellowish color not blinking or turning other colors. So with the two lights now side by side, the first one moved up and away towards the 2 o&apos;clock position at about 1,000 feet agl, and not fast at all. It was kind of like a bump and go method the second light just stayed where the first object was while the first object moved across the horizon. Now I did not and could not see any visible beacon lights on any of the objects and was to far away to hear sounds of engines, but they were perfect in size and remained a constant dull yellow color. With the 1st object now moving away and the 2nd hovering in place, a third light of the same two I am watching moves to within about 25feet of the 2nd light and begins to hover along side. There were other IA flying all around the area some on FAP and others going to and from the costal area, but none towards these objects. I being foolish in my thinking said to myslef in my mind, I can see you and I know you are there and then I got freaked out. As soon as I said it the object I was looking at got real bright like it was flashing towards me and then all the lights were gone like as if someone turned the light swith off gone. I don&apos;t want people to think I am nuts I&apos;m not, I am in th! e militray and know what to look for when spotting aircraft and the different types of aircraft we have. However I am suprised that I am the only one to report this as anyone who was looking up at the sky would have seen this as clear as day.", "Organized human-alien abductionIm not sure if this is the correct place to explain what happened to me when i was ten years old back in the mid seventies..but it wont hurt to tell my story. It was a week of my life that kinda haunts me to this day. I havent discussed this to anyone before..because..it does sound kinda crazy..but the older i have become and the more ive learned about alien life forms..the more creepier i felt about what happened to me back then. Ill start off first by stating what i believe...I believe through my learning and hearing about how aliens basically make their own humans..by impregnating women....in lack of better terminology..using humans..human Dna whatever..they have the technology..like we almost do..to make their own humans. Who knows....that couldhave been the way Mary got impregnated with Jesus....CRAZY? Yeah some people think so..but ???  Anyways...i was ten or eleven years old and i signed up for this soccer camp one summer. The soccer camp was more than a soccer camp..cause it bused all the kids who joined way up into the mountains to camp and play soccer and fish etc...It was alot of fun. West Valley Soccer camp was the name of the &quot;oganization&quot;.A couple of really weird things happened to me that week...and at the time i just shrugged them off, and didnt pay to much thought to any of it....but the events are still with me today more than ever..and im 37 years old now.Now this could be just innocent weird things that happened that have nothing at all to do with other life forms..but who knows maybe someone else might have had something like this happen to them too.   Well..all the kids in the camp slept in bunk beds in lil cabins.  One morning,,all the kids awoke..and wheni woke up..from the top bunk..immedaitely the kids that in the cabin strting asking me what happened to me that night. Did i fall out of the bunk?? Why did they see a couple of the older counselers carrying me and putting me back in bunk in the middle of the night???  Now i had no recollection or memory of any of this happening to me.  That in itself is really bizarrre because..if i would have fallen out of bed i would have remembered.  Well..one more event took place...they had a big 7 mile hike they called it..where the counselours and kids would all hike somewhere for 7 miles and camp out for the night and the next day hike back. Well yeah..it waqs at least 7 miles..and when we came to the place where everyone was going to camp for the night...it was a public lil campground or something  but the oddest thing that didnt trip me out then but does now..was that all over this lil camp ground..posted on the trees...and taped to the port a pottys..was these papers stating that campers should be aware of some kind of bubonic plague or something that was out of control in the wild animal population in the area.  Were these signs there..to scare away people and make this area ideal for the &quot;Soccer camp counselors&quot;?. I dont know...but i do know one thing.,..i woke up in the middle of the night..a hundred yards away from the other campers who were asleep...just .. i guess&quot;walking in my sleep&quot;???? In that week two things happened to me that never before or after happened to me ...it was just all too weird.", "Bright Green Light above Mesai was in my car coming home from Phoenix with my mother. on the right was the 101 i was on the 202 i looked left and saw a bright green light and when i looked back i saw a green trail from where it flew off. it was circular and was green. if anybody else saw anything like this please email me @ ((e-address deleted))", "Hovering white circle, half the size of the full moon explodes without sound shoots up into the stars and vanishes.Shortly after moving into our new home we noticed, while moving around inside our home, my wife and I would catch a glimpse from the corner of our eyes, outside the picture window a bright flash of light, coming from the back yard.We asked each other,did you see that? wondering what it was, it only lasted for a second. This happened for approximately eight days,and always in the evening beginning around 9:00PM.This would happen only once a night (that we knew of) and not every night.The light was so bright it would light up the entire picture window like day light, in a flash we would turn our heads to look and it was gone.One night(within the eight day period)I was sitting out on our pool deck,it was about 12 midnight,when this circular object rose above the horizon about 30 degrees, without any noise it approached very slowly above my head about 11:00, a             (70 degree angle)when it stopped and hovered.It looked like the full moon only half the size, no glow just a yellow/white circle. I watched it as it appeared to stay still watching me. Before my eyes this thing exploded without any noise, concentric rings of light blasted away from this circle lighting up thr entire back yard. It was so bright you could see the veins in the tree leaves. In less then a second out from the center of this object a missile shaped object shot out and moved at an extremely high rate of speed away on a near 80 degree angle up into the stars, about five seconds it was among the stars still moving as it vanished out of sight.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We saw an airplane from one mile and my son said oh, air plane. I said yes this is a Saudi Aramco air plane. They have a few of them to shuttle there staff and also helicopters using same route on a daily bases.  While we were driving, traveling 30 miles speed we saw a plane and it did not move. We came close to it, it was on our right side not far away, maybe 300 meter in the air. So we stopped to see it. I thought it is going to land or had a problem, but Safaniah is 40 km away so we came to complete stop. The plane still in the same place. I thought it was Harrier fighter plane (saw them during gulf war) but this one is white and so beautiful. The minute we stopped, I asked my son to make right turn towards it and this thing started moving north.  We both said oh it is moving now, good but moving at a high rate of speed. May be 10 seconds and it is gone. Nothing else in the sky as it was a clear day too. By the way my son was driving off road and only under my supervision. It was capsule in shape, no windows.

While there I rented a fast card and for fun I drove it out to The Bonneville Salt Flats near Windover, about 100 miles west of Salt Lake City.  I spent the afternoon seeing how fast my rental car would go on the salt flats and otherwise just exploring and appreciating the beauty of the unique environment of the vast salt flats.   It is so vast that at some point in the middle I could perceive the curvature of the Earth as I could see nothing but salt as it stretched out and met the horizon and the clear blue sky.  As the Sun began to set over the far mountains to the west I headed back to the access ramp and got back on the highway toward Salt Lake City. As I drove east and as the Sun set further I could see a car about a mile in front of me as it just turned on its tail lights and then there was another car about a mile in front of it.  I noticed as we drove for about an hour the entire time we all seemed to maintain the same relative position, about a mile apart as we traveled.  I set my cruise control for 78 MPH and just pointed the car straight as an arrow east toward my destination.  Twilight began as all shadows disappeared and some stars began to appear in the sky. Out in the distance I was suddenly alarmed to see four extraordinary objects as they were bouncing and tumbling and heading directly towards me head-on!  They were large globular shaped bodies about 1 meter in height, not quite round and not quite consistent in form.  They were translucent so that I could clearly see an inner nucleus that was complex beyond my comprehension and appeared like many lights or eyes.  I could see each of them was spinning inside like a wheel within a wheel. Before I could react they overtook me.  I braced for impact but then felt nothing as the tumbling objects passed right through the car.  I turned my head and followed them with my eyes and saw them clearly as they continued rolling and spinning out the back of the car.  I turned my head to put my eyes back on the road in from of me and immediately I saw four more objects heading directly for me. These objects were like dark shadows of the others, slightly larger, duplicating their shape and motion exactly.  Again before I could react they overtook me, but this time I felt a massive impact that slowed the vehicle instantly from 78 to about 45 mph.  As before I watched the objects go through the car and out the back and then continue tumbling and spinning and following the four objects that were before them. I turned my head back to the front as I noticed a loss of power and saw the check engine lights indicating my car had stalled.  I restarted the engine and began to bring the car back up to speed.  I looked once more behind me and saw nothing but road and darkness. At this time I overtook the car that had been traveling a mile in from of me for the past hour.  It was moving slowly and erratically as it struggled along in the slow lane.  As I thought about why that car had been moving so slowly, I saw the next car pulled over and parked on the shoulder with its hood up and the occupants standing around looking somewhat confused. It was only a few seconds afterwards that I realize that the objects must have caused these other vehicles to stall as did mine.  By this time I was at least &frac14; mile down the highway and there was no way to turn around, so I continued on my way. Although my car was normal after restarting the engine I do have some form of physical evidence to indicate something odd had happened that day.  To past the time I had setup a portable CD player and connected it to the car&rsquo;s audio system with a cassette adapter.  It was playing at the time of the incident and at the same time that my engine stalled the CD player died.  Later I tried to have it repaired but I was told it was &quot;burned out&quot; by some kind of electrical overload.  Beyond this small piece of evidence I will tell you I have never felt quite the same since, but for me I felt somehow enhanced knowing there&rsquo;s something else out there.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I would like to tell you about what I saw back on September 6, 2003. I had just arrived home after attending the Fall Classic Show &amp; Shine at the Nose Creek Park. It was 4:00 p.m. in the afternoon. I was looking out my livingroom window, which faces east. My home is situated (deleted) of the tracks, in (deleted by HBCC UFO). I noticed a white, completely perfect round sphere going in a  northerly direction. It was definatly NOT a balloon. There was no string attached and it was perfectly round, as balloons are not.  It stayed at a constant speed and was completely unaffected by wind currents. It may have been going about 30-50km./hr. It stayed at the exact same height. I watched it until it disappeared out of sight. I felt like it may have been following along main street, however it may not have been. It was also difficult to tell the size at that distance, but it may have been larger that a beach ball. I have never seen anything like it in my life. Has anyone else mentioned this to you?

My parents are no longer alive to verify what I report here.  It was a hot July night in 1952 and my parents and I were sitting in our backyard trying to cool off.  My mother and I were lying on a blanket, looking at the stars.  My mother was pointing out various constellations to me when I noticed a small green, disc-shaped object circling in a tight oval path.  It seemed to me very small and far away.  I asked my parents what it was.  They had no idea, but they became quite interested in it.  My mother eventually went into the house and phoned someone to report what we were seeing.  I don&apos;t kinow who she phoned--police, media, or whatever.  The following morning, our newspapers (Washington Post, Washington Daily News, etc.) were full of front page reports of UFOs over DC.  The photos that appeared in our newspapers in no way resembled what my parents and I had observed.  With 50-some years of hindsight, I now wonder if I witnessed a &quot;mother ship&quot; to the objects that were photographed over DC that night.  I know this report is way out in left field from what was originally reported about this event, but I think maybe my parents and I saw something in addition to what was reported in the media at that time.((NUFORC Note:  We are grateful to the witness for this report.

It&#x5C;&apos;s the first and last time I&#x5C;&apos;ve ever seen a UFO.  I was at the Cleveland National Air Show, and even though I&#x5C;&apos;m not sure of the exact date, I KNOW it was Labor Day weekend.  It was the last time the B-2 Bomber (awesome!) did a fly-by here, which I feel could be a key to this incident.  The incident occurred early in the show when the Golden Knights were enroute for their act.  I distinctly remember watching their plane slowly zigzagging at 9 o&#x5C;&apos;clock to reach the proper height for their jump.  It was a perfectly clear, warm sunny day, without a cloud in the sky ANYWHERE, which I found amazing in itself!  (Being in Cleveland, totally clear weather seldom occurs).  For some reason I looked straight up at 12 o&#x5C;&apos;clock and saw a clear grouping of 6-7 white orbs close to each other but not in a specific pattern.I think it was seven because I remember thinking it was an odd number.  I was with my ex-husband at the time and because it was early in the show, there wasn&#x5C;&apos;t anyone else sitting close to us (it figures). We were not on the main grounds of the show but at a nearby outdoor restaurant upper deck.  This sighting was NOT clouds!!!  I called my husband&#x5C;&apos;s attention to it at the time, and he was kind of freaked out and admitted he thought it was a UFO.  This was a macho man whose middle name is &#x5C;&quot;denial.&#x5C;&quot;  He didn&apos;t want to talk about it afterwords. Anyway, all they did was hover for about 30 minutes more or less and I remember watching them slowly fade into nothing.  There was no sharp movement or changing colors, etc.  I did not see them around for the B-2 flyby, however, which was about 2 hours later.  That&apos;s it.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

An hour or two after sunset there was a glow coming from within a large cloud formation several miles offshore, and it was far above the ocean&apos;s surface. At first we thought it was heat-lightning: that&apos;s what it looked like.  But it didn&apos;t go away.  It glowed steadily for maybe ten minutes. It was uncanny.

I jumped off the couch and looked out the window. I only had like seven seconds to see it but it was huge! It was a diamond shape and it had lights on each corner. I think it also had another light in the middle but i am not positive. It was huge though and it was fast. It flew over my house exstreamly quickly.

A family re-union was taking place inside my home at the time and several others were with me while observing.  Out of nowhere an oval craft appeared about 1,500 feet directly over our heads.  The craft was completely silent and appeared to be about 30-50 feet long.  It was metallic on the bottom and had four oscillating soft looking lights.  The color of the lights were white, amber, purpleish and green.  Ocillation events for these four lights occurred about every second or two.  The craft stayed in this position long enough for me to grab a few of the other relatives inside, one of whom was my uncle who had a commercial flying liscense.  My uncle immediately called a nearby radar station at a local airport.  They stated they didn&apos;t see anything unusual on their screens.  After about three minutes the object left out of sight at a 45 degree angle at tremendous speed (no trail and still no sound).  I estimate its speed must have been every bit as fast as a meteor since it completely disappeared from sight into a clear night sky within two seconds.  To this date I am still mystified by what we saw and can not begin to even guess at the technology employed by this object.  The Air Force Project Blue Book mission caught wind of the report in our local paper and sent me a 20 page report to fill out.  I was already deeply into astronomy at the time and even then found the report criteria quite insulting (ie; where was the moon, how big was the moon, etc).  All I know is that I have seen strange aircraft, the planets, and lots of other celestial objects most of my life but this was not even close to being an astronomical event or piece of earthly origin equipment.  Thirty six years later and I still find myself considering hyposis to try and better understand this unusual event.  I think I&apos;ll make that promise to myself as a New Year&apos;s resolution.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "the object distorted the visible sky yet you could see through it and it was boomerang shaped,very fast, and silent.V shape,luminescent,very fast. Lights moved about inside of triangle shape. Object was very large and moved west to east. No sounds during entire episode. Observed objects on 3 other occasions in an hour and a half time frame. Our area was quite dark, living in a rural town of 5000 pop.  No surrounding lights to reflect light off of.  No clouds or moonlight present.  Object(s) were very fast and silent.", "UFO sighting near Kennedy Space Center 2000This happened in Merritt Island, FL about 5 - 10 miles south of Kennedy Space Center.  I was driving about 50 mph North bound between Grant Rd. and Hall Rd. (though closer to Grant Rd) when a brightly lit craft that seemed spherical hoovered closely parallel to my 1991 Mitzubishi Mighty Max Pickup.  The craft emitted a low hum which I could feel throughout my body.  Every hair on my body was raised, though I suspect from fear.  The light completely filled the cab of my truck but i was able to see out my windshield fine.  I was unable to get more than a fleeting glance because I was affraid and unable to look at it more than once.I would slam on the brakes hoping the craft would pass but it would stay perfectly parallel to me.  I sped up to approx 90 mph which it also matched, perfectly.  I was driving in the left lane north bound on SR3 which is bordered by a grass island then the south bound lanes.  The craft was above the grass island.  It then went staight up and disappeared.I slowed down and looked around for a helicoptor, police car, riding lawn mower anything that could make what I saw NOT a UFO.  I saw nothing.  I was a skeptic until that morning.  I cannot say whether it was man made or alien being that I live within 10 miles of our access to space.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

My wife and I had seen this UFO before several months ago.  It traveled from the southern sky to the southwestern sky in a circular motion for about ten minutes.  I tried to get my telescope out and put the eyepieces together to see the object more closely.  At the same exact time I got the telescope ready to look at the bright gold object it disappeared! My 10 year old daughter was frightened and went inside just before it vanished.", "Bright star like objectI went outside, just before midnight. There was a very large star like object in the North sky. I could not keep my eyes off the &quot;STAR,&quot; it was beautiful. It was a bright yellow/off white color.  It held its position for about a minute or so then very slowly moved south over my house. By the time I ran though my house to get to the front yard it was gone.  Had no tail, no blinking lights, absolutely no sound, and way too low to be a plane. We live in the desert outside of the city, our view of the stars is wonderful, I can always see the satellites pass over. This was not a satellite. Very Exciting, but I am still a bit freaked.", "Both my wife and I saw a flying saucer craft directly over our back yard at an altitude of no higher than 75 feet. It was above us for about 40 seconds with no sound and seemed to hover/glide on the spot. We clearly saw design characteristics.Metallic highly shiny body, no visible linkage between metallic components, about 100 feet in diameter, portholes in the middle of what appeared to be an upper level or dome and bottom the porthole were all around the craft except for the front (on direction of forward movement.) There was a window that was angled inwards about 45 degrees in the front (forward direction). The window appeared to be in the under side of the craft. We could see orange/bluish light coming from the inside but did not see any occupants. The window was about 4-5 feet in height and probably about 10-12 feet in length. The craft had small ski like devices on either side (lower) of the frontal window but they seemed to be like docking devices like the shape of an S but the top of the S facing forward. Underneath craft were rectangular (2) long shapes that covered the diameter of the craft and in the middle section of the bottom side. The rectangular shapes were part of the body but protruded in rectangular shape. No insignias, just solid metallic body. I kept saying what a beautiful craft and my wife kept saying oh my god the whole time.The craft made no noise whatsoever. It seemed to levitate but with that slight side to side movement.At the time of sighting, I was cleaning my swimming pool a round 10:00 PM. The is a residential area (Santa Clarita Valley) where 10:00 PM is like 3:00 AM. I spotted the craft coming towards the house in a southwest direction and instantly knew that was not a normal shaped craft. I ran some 12 steps to the family room and called my family but only my wife ran out. As she did, the craft was right on top of us, motionless except for the slight gliding from side to side. It stood there about 40 seconds. It faced downwards and that is when I saw the window. I also could determine that swimming pool lights were not causing reflection on top side and that in effect it was highly reflective. After that it kept moving in the same direction at 40-50 MPH and began to disappear between homes. I jumped on top of a block wall and saw it continue (between homes) for at least 4-5 miles and then I could not see it.I told my wife not to discuss it but to draw what she saw as I did. I had more details but we agreed that we saw the same things.While we were seeing it, I made sure there was no helicopter suspending this craft.We called the local sheriff&apos;s office and they said they had no reports. The craft had to cross the Interstate 5 freeway to head towards my home and at the altitude which means someone had to see it on the freeway.There was a sighting filmed in Mexico City near some high rise buildings. What we saw resembled that very much. Please keep me posted. Since the experience I have read everything there is to read on the subject. I am confident the government knows more. This object was a solid craft and definitely not powered by anything man-made.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates no date for the sighting.  We have sent him an e-mailed request for the correct date, and have assigned an artificial date, for the time being.  PD))", "Appears like large star changing colors and shapes, moving in zig-zag pattern then remaining stationary.Driving home with my sons tonight, we all noticed this star that kept flashing red/blue/gold/white. At first I told them it was probably a jet headed toward us so we were seeing all the colors. As the colors flash, it appears to change shape to a diamond or triangular shaped light. But the &quot;star&quot; started darting about, going up several degrees at one time, then holding, then zigging to left or right. We started calling out these directional changes to one another, as well as colors, to verify we all were seeing it right. This was in the southeastern sky, but well above horizon in mid sky. After about 15 minutes, the &quot;star&quot; became stationary, and we went inside. I just checked, and it&apos;s still outside in more northern position, but did not move much while we observed it this time. The color changes have died down. Nothing else happened. It just seemed like too much movement and light color changes to be a regular star.", "Let me start by saying this event happened years ago but a friend just told me about your web sight. I was fishing with three friends at a lake. The sun was going down casting an orange glow in the sky. We were gong to the car when one of the guys said he had left the keys somewhere &quot;back there&quot;. So we split up and started to look.I was walking by myself,the area is flat with trees around but to the north is the lake and you can see a lot of sky. All of a sudden I see a cigar shaped object to the north going east to west, not real fast and I could not say it was white because the sun was making it seem slightly yellow-orange. Then coming up fast behind it is what looks like a military fighter, chasing it and getting closer all the time. You have to know that at my location I could see a lot of sky in that direction. I am yelling for my friends to look up but they can&apos;t hear me. The jet is still not close enough to me to hear the sound so there was none. Then I could not believe what I saw, a box, at least that&apos;s what it looked liked, appeared in the sky directly in front of the cigar, it also was the same color, a square door in the center opened up, it looked like a freight elevator door opening up, and the cigar went into what looked like a very,very black opening, the door closed and the box just vanished. The jet, you could here it now, circled around twice then turned east and left the scene.I was too far away from the aircraft to even tell what kind it was but it sounded like a single engine. I just stood there for a few minutes staring, then my friends showed up, I asked then if they heard me yelling, nobody did, so I told them what I saw and they said I was nuts.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

While attempting to make a left on to a very busy street I noticed an object in the sky.  At my location it was easy to gain repeated visuals of the target as there was a fixed object (telephone pole)which the target was in close proximity (like lining up the sights on a rifle), total approx viewing time 30- 45 sec.  The object caught my eye because it reflected light from the sun (like a single mirror).  The object appeared to be large and stationary (that is to say it did not appear to shrink or grow in size due to forward or reverse motion, also, it did not move Left or Right or up and down in my view of the horizon).  The object appeared to be shiny gray in color and oval in shape.  As I looked at the sun in the West the object was about 45 degrees from it at my location.  When I looked away (to check for on coming traffic) to make a left (heading west) the target was no longer their.  I scanned the horizon to reacquire the target, but it was gone.  I do not believe it was a plane (to large, no contrails,and not the right shape), at first I thought a blimp, but I could have easily found the target again as a blimp cannot deviate so drastically as to appear to vanish.  The day was cold (approx 33 degrees); the sky had very little clouds (the thin ones that are high in the atmosphere), However, nothing could have obstructed my view.", "in 1974, I saw a white triangular object moveing low and slow over orchards and fields north of chico CAAt approx. 3:00AM walking home throu a newly planted almond orchard.Looking north toward the airport I saw what I took to be the red and blue wing lights of an airplane a few miles away,after a min.

There was no street lights or any sign of reflective light, so the sky was very visable. Leaving her door as she walked with me toward my car I had this feeling of something was going to happen, I always watched UFO doc on Travel&amp;Sci fi so I always been excited about seeing one, but never really wanted to. We are walking and as I keep looking in all the sky in all directions in good detail I see nothing. As I mentally let it go in my head I sat in my car saying my final words and starting my enginge, I happen to oddly glace behind behind her staring into a sky seeing a bright light, not LARGE but bigger than a start fall straight down below the treeline. Shocked by this I still wasnt certain if this was a falling star ( which I believe does not fall straight down that far)so I kinda freaked out wondering, &apos; what was that?!&apos; My girlfriend pondered but knew I was not kidding from my expression so I asked her to go inside and drive down her long driveway because its very very dark, and you have to open and close the gate.  So we went back inside grabbed her keys then walked back outside.  While walking back to my car we searched the woods where I showed it went straight down.  As we kept walking the woods would be clear from walking between the trees in the distance, therefore a BRIGHT white light would appear every 10-15 steps. The whole time I&apos;d say walking to my car we each saw the light in the woods 3 times.  My girlfriend became very uncomftable. I inquired why she was, she replied &apos; My whole time living here I&apos;ve never seen a light like that there night or day.&apos; we hurried to our vehicles and I left her house in a hurry.  As I got home she quickly called my cell saying &apos; when I was driving back I saw that same light just above the tree line move from an upper-right point all the way to the lower-right point she said it was as fast as an old clock tick. She was ve! ry very scared and I assured her it was okay that it would go away. That night lets say I couldnt sleep very well, I waited to the sun came up to go back to sleep. Early tonight she has called (11/15/03) and says something very bright is still in the sky, larger than a star in the spot she believed I saw it in.Oh during this whole time it made no sound, I would believed this was not an ufo except from what I saw walking by looking into the woods and what my girlfriend swore she saw.", "Star like,very large and extremely brightI am at my Father-in-laws and stepped outside to smoke a cigarette. I go to the back fence to pet the dog then turn around and look up to the sky as is my habit.I like to look at the stars every night I can. I see what at first is a extremely bright star with a magnitude similar to Sirius but actually brighter. I am thinking to myself that it should&apos;nt be there when I notice it&apos;s moving from south to north.I&apos;m thinking this is impossible. So I step inside the door and holler at my Father-in-law and tell him he has got to come out and look at this. He is a total non believer in anything such as UFO&apos;s and the like. He comes out and I point it out to him. I ask him &quot;what do you think it is&quot;? We agree it is definitly not a plane(no sound) but it looks just like a giant star. He says maybe it&apos;s a satellite but I have saw them before and I don&apos;t think so.It&apos;s too big and too bright. We watch it until it goes out of sight.He goes back in and about a minute or so after it disappeared I heard and saw a jet on a course that could be like it was keeping an eye on the thing.One more thing my father in law mentioned that he thought he could see like a tail on it.I have better eyesight than him but who knows.", "There were two crafts hovering for several hours.At 1:00 am my husband went out to bring in wood for the fire.

It sped up, slowed down, and changed direction several times. It was a bit larger than a star and it was circular in shape. I opened my deck door to try and get my mom and dad to come out and see it but they didn&apos;t get out fast enough. The object stopped and disappeared within 10 degrees of Saturn which is currently in Gemini.", "I viewed three UFO&apos;s in the sky, moving at high speeds and amazing shapes in the sky not possible by human planes.I first noticed the objects as I was playing basketball outside.  I have been a UFO fanatic since i was very young, and still am.  The sun was on the horizon, giving the sky an orange-yellowish color.  The three objects were moving in various angles, shapes, and speeds.  at some points, they would move halfway across the sky in almost no time at all.  I observed them with my normal vision before i got my binoculars.  when i looked at them more closely, their shapes did not change, making me almost certain that they were circular or spherical in shape.  As i watched further, i noticed that they were almost playing around.  One would stay motionless in the center, while the other two would move in almost perfect circles and/or ovals.  Almost sparatically, one of the UFO&apos;s instantly disappeared from sight.  Mind you, these objects were way above the treeline, so it must have escaped at a tremendous speed.  the other two UFO&apos;s continued their flying routine, and sometimes would have one of them revolve almost perfectly around the other, motionless one.  At some points, they would disappear and then reappear at a different area in the sky.  what was strange was that they were both orange, which im guessing was because of the sky&apos;s color.  But what didn&apos;t make sense was the fact that the shape and color of the ships were so easy to distinguish in the sky.  they should have been hard to be spotted, but they were visually clear even by the naked eye.  I could only stand and watch in awe, and i knew that i was too young to have my parents let me use a camera of any kind in the house.  Then, the most amazing thing happened.  In the middle of the revolving dance, the center object began to grow larger, and it&apos;s glow became much greater.  the other object then flew right into the other ship and disappeared.  the remaining UFO then began to move in violent yet beautiful circles.  And then, just like that, it disappeared.  to this day i haven&apos;t forgotten a single detail of what i saw that day, and i h! ave been waiting to tell this story for a long time.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Their speed appeared to be that of  a jet military fighter aircraft, and on first observation thought - great- two F-14-s or what ever. The aircraft were headed South  and after crossing over the Interstate they abruptly went to a hover. I was closing quickly on the stationary aircraft and then observered a third aircraft to my left traveling South, by this time I was within less than two miles from the two hovering aircraft.  The third aircraft came into the formation with the other aircraft remaining stationary in a very abrupt manner, similer to what would be called hot rodding if a helicopter pilot did this. The aircraft remained in hover together for atleast a minute or two before rapidly accelerating and departing out of to the South in level flight.  Would judge their altitude to of been at about 500 to 700 feet.The craft appeared to all be the same, however the aircraft who entered the formation is the one aircaft I focused my attention on.  In general shape it appeared to be simlar to the aircraft Dick Rutan is building to go into outer space, but that is where it ends.  The craft was a delta/flying winged aircraft with winglets or vertical stabilizers on the outside of the wings, the nasel (nose) of the craft was rounded and the empenage (tail section) appeared to have a slight down wash. Upto this point all seemed normal, but where a normal F117 or other aircraft would have a cockpit canopy  an oval shaped tower was located at 90 degrees to the rest of the plane - simlar to the command bridge on a submarine.  The surface of this tower was porouse, looking  like you skin does under a microscope.  It was curved over at the top as if the center might be open or accessible to enter or whatever.  This tower had three colours ringing it horizontally, they were flat gray, black, and a magenta (maroon), appeared to blend into each other with no clear division of the clours.Everything seemed normal aerodynamicaly for a high performance plane except for this unusal tower sticking up (i.e. immense drag etc.). The rest of the aircraft appeared to be a light gray along the lines of  what some Air Force planes are painted.Have not came forward with this at the time of siting because I thought just possibly the craft could be of this world and felt it not my place to disclose any advance craft of our nation.  However, it has now been about 13 years and I&apos;ve sure not heard of any such craft in our  military inventory as of late.In closing, I am a retired soldier (22 yrs.) who worked in intelligence and hold a commercial aircraft license airplane single, multi-engine land with instrument and CFI. I seek no attention from this, but only wonder any other folks might have seen similar aircraft.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

As they drew closer, the lights seemed to spread out and all of a sudden and all of the blue lights blinked out approx: one mile in front of them. The two men thought was rather strange as they had never witnessed anything like this before. The witnesses could not make out any type of shape, or structure as everything took place rather quickly. Mind you they both mentioned that there may not have been any body to the lights. It wasn&apos;t until the fellows were at junction (highway #3 and #6) did they wonder where approx 25 kilometers. Both men sat stunned, the driver pulled the car to the side of the road and the two guys just sat and looked at one another for a couple of seconds, then starred out the front windshield not saying a word to one another. Finally after a few minutes of silence the passenger turned to the driver and asked what the heck just happened and how did we get to the junction when they knew they still had a large number of kilometers to travel.  The passenger then noticed a trickle of blood running down from the drivers right nostril which alarmed him to know end. The driver used his hand to wipe around his nose area and then found blood on his hand, be started to panic due to all this strange things that just took place. Immediately the driver put the vehicle in gear and started traveling north on Highway #6 towards Samo picking up speed as they drove along. The evening was very cool outside, but inside the vehicle it was rather warm. With both men shivering with coldness (from fright and a possible experience) the passenger turned the heaters temperature up to high and both of the fellows were still not able to get warm and comfortable. Very frightened, cold and an over whelming thrust coming on they traveled along almost in shock. After traveling a good distance to their destination which was Fruitvale, B.C., they arrived at a family members home, got out of the vehicle and as they walked up the sidewalk to the door, the diver broke down. His friend told me his nerves were shot at this point. A family member had seen the vehicle and the fellows pull into the driveway I was going out to greet them both when she saw her loved one bent over crying hysterically. She yelled out loudly and two other people in the home ran out to lend a hand with the man. The family was very upset as you can imagine and questioned the men to find out what was wrong, not imagining what they were about to hear. After some time a hot bath everyone settled in for the night. Both men trying their darnest to get some sleep, which wasn&apos;t easy after what just happened, finally they dropped off only to start having vivid dreams. One of the fellows remembers being in an object. He did not know exactly what it was. But in his dream he did believe it was a room of some type.

It was travelling south along the beach road.  Ont he ocean side of the craft, a light swung out as if on an arm of some sort, the light then accellerated away in an easterly direction at a speed I canno describe.  It was a blur it went so fast.  The craft continued in a southerly direction for several minutes, the object then returned with the same alarming speed, &quot;docked&quot; and folded back into the craft.

The arrow shaped arrangement of lights meaned there were possibly 5 or 6 on each &quot;wing&quot;These lights were very dim, and i could barely see them. However, they did continue to move in an erratic pattern to the south until i could not see them anymore. The boject made no sound, and the lights stayed relative to their original position on the craft.

The lights were lower than a commercial plane, and the lights were not small as you&apos;d see on a commercial aircraft, however they were traveling straight at a normal rate of speed to the south east. I ran to one of my bedroom windows to see if I could see what type of aircraft had such large lights, but in fact I could not see any craft at all, just the lights, even though they were close enough that I should have been able to see what the lights were attached to, if they were indeed attached to anything at all. The sky was clear. The lights were quite large and did not blink and they were all the same size and color and were round. They traveled in an exact coordinated pattern, this being two lights fairly close to each other on the bottom &quot;row&quot; and the other light on the &quot;top&quot;, forming a triangle. I never heard any noise. They traveled at a steady speed and I watched them until they were not in my line of sight in either of my bedroom windows, then I ran downstairs and went outside to see if I could see them, but they were gone.", "Light over the skies of GeorgiaWhile on the way to dropping my mother off at a dinner rehersal on Fort Gillem (an army base located in Forrest Park, Ga), I looked up while being checked in at the guard station. I saw in the sky a light that I thought to have been the sun. But to the south of this light was where the sun was positioned, noticibly brighter and more visibly defined in it&apos;s shape than it&apos;s neighboring visitor. The light was white with a lightly yellow colored brightness. The light was shaped like an acute triangle at the left with the bottom nearly paralell to the horizon. The right side was undefined and lead almost what seemed to be a curved line back to the base of the light. The light did not move and was wider but smaller than the large sun. The skies were spattered with thin clouds that were so much like lace that an airplane could easily be seen through a great majority of them. I childishly raised the question &quot;why are there two suns&quot; to my mother as I pointed to the western skies. She became as baffled as I at the sight of this luminous spectical.When an M.P. finished filling out a visitors pass and had barely had time to hand the pass over to me I pointed and asked him if he knew what the second light in the sky was, he looked but seemed puzzled and only responded with a &quot;what.&quot; My mother then leaned over to try and convey in better detail the question at hand by saying &quot;there are two suns.&quot; She also pointed and added a motion of the head that meant for the soldier to look again. He did, and apparently noticed the light in the sky because his head remained to help his eyes focus. &quot;Do you know what it is?&quot; The soldier answered that he did not and I teased him saying &quot;come on you&apos;re the government.&quot; Hearing my sarcasm, he replied &quot;that&apos;s just it, I&apos;m in the Army&quot; I and my mother continued and kept a watch on this light that began to fade then dissapear. We reached the chapel soon after and continued to talk about what was just witnessed, and as we talked in the car I saw that the light had resumed it&apos;s place in the sky only to dissapear once more only moments afterward. I used my cell phone to call a local television station WGNX Atlanta via 411. After allowing the automated system attempt to search my request a live networker assisted me by routing my call for me, but there was no answer. A church friend of ours pulled up a few seconds later. My mother and I began to tell her of what we witnessed, of course followed by the pointing also recieved by the guard. She studied the sky and saw nothing. After this I hav yet to see the light again.", "There were 3 teardrop saucers3 teardrop styled crafts came toward me as i rested outside my truck.

As we took the left at the flashing light towards Rome (I apologize about not remembering the route number) I noticed a small orange light high in the sky, I told my friend sitting in the front seat to check out the moon and we both kind of blew it off.  As I continued driving the orange ball increased in size and continued to decend to no more than 3 feet above the road surface 300 yards in front of us.  The shape of the object was spherical, but there were no defining edges to it. It was brightly illuminated in a deep orange color, the light from the object reflected off of the road as well as the farmhouse it was in front of.  The object&apos;s diameter was easily 50&apos; as it was larger than the two story farmhouse.  At this point we were 300 yards and closing the object rotated 90 degrees on the Z axis and it appeard to be two balls of the same size at that point.  This is when the girls in the back seat saw it and started screaming, which caused me to panic.  I spun the car around and headed back toward Sylvan Beach as fast as I could go.  I attempted to look back and see if it was still there, but my car had louvers on the back window and I could not see the object behind me.  My friend in the front seat looked out of his window and said that it was following us.  I gunned the car and we parked under a bridge that leads to the park in Sylvan Beach.  We looked around and it was gone. After we calmed down we discussed what we saw.  This was not a hallucination, we were not under the influence of alchahol or any drugs.  This was a long time ago and I can recall it as if it just happened and I have 4 other witnesses that would testify under oath.  I thought that this should somehow be recorded in case anybody else had seen somthing like this that night. I have lived in the area most of my life and have never seen anything like this.  Being that this was close to Rome NY where Griffiss Air Force Base (A SAC base) there must have been some kind of radar signature.

I noticed  a disc or spherical object  covered with numerous red and white strobing lights hovering silently approximately 50-100 feet above the treeline. It remained completely stationary in that position for about 3 minutes after I began observing it. Then it slowly descended behind the mesa and out of view. A few seconds later, it came out from behind the mesa and drifted somewhat languidly toward the S/SW. Airport Mesa, incidentally, is purportedly home to one of the Sedona energy vortices.((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what an energy vortex is, and we are not aware of any in Sedona.

My cousin said what is that, so I turned around and looked up in the sky.  I saw an airplane pretty high in the sky and said an airplane and turned back around and he said no look lower.  I turned around again thinking he was pulling my leg, but this time I had to look for a second and then I could see it.  It was very low to the ground, maybe 150 yards up and very close to us.  The first thing we did was run to it.  It was moving very slowly from West to East.  It blended in with the night sky, with a few exceptions.  We ran directly beneath it and looked up at it.  It stayed at a constent speed, very slow.  It was long, about 50 yards from our view point, looked like a string of lights or string of stars moving through the sky. The one way to know for sure that there was something there was to look at the stars in front of it, while we were beneath it and watch it move over them, the stars would disappear and the lights that looked like stars would just be moving along at the same speed.  It looked to me like it was reflecting the image of the stars above it to the bottom of it.  Some of the lights would twinkle a little.  I seam to remember som kind of round windows on the side but am not sure.  I could not tell the exact shape since it was the exact same color.  You could tell that it was one very big object and it was silent.  It didnt slow down or speed up, we walked under it for about 10 blocks until the T in the road.

It was black and shiny, probably about 50 feet wide, boomarange shaped, and about 100 feet up with no lights (I could see the light from the spotlights around the field shining off of it). The whole sighting lasted about 3 to 4 seconds as it moved quickly, but not fast, towards the downtown area.

My wife asked me if I had been letting her listen to Art Bell and we went to bed.I woke up around 06:30 to meet my daughter when she woke up. When she woke up I asked her a series of questions and this is a pretty accurate transcript of our conversation. It&apos;s one I may never forget. Remember she was 3 and 1/2 years old at the time. And she was and still is a fairly bright kid.Me: I heard that mommy had to come into your room last night. Did you have a bad dream? Her: No, I went to a space ship.Me: What do you mean you went to a space ship? Her: Some aliens came into my room and took me to their space ship? Me: But when mommy came into your room you were sitting on your bed.Her: I came back by then.Me: How many aliens were there? Her: Three Me: Did you get a good look at them? Her: Yeah Me: Can you draw me a picture of what they looked like: Her: I don&apos;t know how to draw aliens. You&apos;ll have to show me.Me: Aliens are cool! But I wonder sometimes what they look like. Did you see their hands?.Her: She held her left hand about 8&quot; from the tips of her right hand fingers sort of like an extended &quot;time out&quot; gesture and said &quot;They had long fingers&quot;.Me: Did they have hands like your hands? Her: No they were skinny and long Me: Did you see their faces? Her: Yeah.Me: What did their eyes look like? Her: Big eyes.Me: Did they talk to you? Her: Looking confused she finally said yeah Me What did they say? Her: Nothing, they had no mouth.Me: But you said they talked to you Her: Yeah. I don&apos;t know.[I&apos;m thinking telepathy at this point] Me: They had no mouth? Did they have a nose? Her: really little. But they had big heads Me: How tall were they? Her: A little taller than me.Me: Where did you see them? Her: standing by my closet.Me: How did you get to the space ship? Her: I don&apos;t know we were just there.Me: Can you draw me a picture of the space ship? Her: I don&apos;t know how to draw a space ship, you&apos;ll have to show me.Me: It was dark in your room, was it dark by the space ship too? Her: No it had lot&apos;s of lights, all different colors but they were all on and real bright.Me: Where did you go on the space ship? Her: On a table.Me: What did you do there? Her: I just layed there. I was scared to move Me: what did they do? did they hurt you? Her: she repeatedly points at her temple Me: They pointed at your head? Her: No, they poked me.(I&apos;m now thinking implant) Me: They poked you? with what? Her: something pointy, right here. And it hurt a little. And she points at her temple again.[I saw no marks of any kind] Me: When mommy came into your room you were sitting on your bed. How did you get on your bed if you were in a space ship? Her: I don&apos;t know. I just floated down.Me: Did they come back with you? Her: they went back when momny came in.Me: I saw an alien in a movie and they were scarey and all different colors and different.She interupts me and says, It hurt a little when they poked me but they were nice. and I think they were green or something.I then asked again if she could draw me some pictures and she repeated the I don&apos;t know how you&apos;ll have to show me answer. So I had a little 3 and 1/2 year old girl who was transported from her bed in the middle of the night to a space ship, implanted and presumably examined, had a conversation via telepathy with 3 aliens who then accompanied her back to her room. And she basicaly shrugged it off like it was no big deal.We figured she did not see any television that day even remotely referring to a space ship or aliens or anything similar. So the question is. Did it happen? Did she have an etremely vivid dream? or?...She doesn&apos;t remember a thing about this now. She&apos;s 9 and perfectly normal.At the time I tried to contact [someone] but had irratically available computer so I couldn&apos;t e-mail or search the internet for UFO sites like yours to properly report this.

At first, I thought it was just a drop of water fallind down my windshield, and that a street light had refected on it, making it look luminous. But I was definitely not. It fell at a constant speed, very slowly. It moved in a straight path, and just slightly toward the left. We were driving, South/SouthWest-ish. It was A bright white ball of light, with no tail at all. I was only able to see it for about 3 seconds or so, from the time it came into my view from inside my car, until it was obscured by some high trees that were along side the road. It looked about the size of the fingernail on my pinky finger if I hold it as far away from me as possible. And my guess would be that it was only a 5 or 6 hundred yards away from us. I wasn&apos;t going to say anything about it to my friend, who was sitting in the passenger seat next to me. But I noticed that he was looking in the same direction, and that he had seen it, also. I asked him &quot;Did you see that?&quot; And he told me he did, and had no clue what it was. It moved way too slowly to be a shooting star, and was way too bright, and too large. And it was definitely falling down from the sky, rather than towards the horizon in front of me. I heard no strange sounds.

The sky was clear after sunset. It hovered and sparkled. A red sphere flashed by going south. My neighbor came out on his balcony for a cigarette. The white light hovered. When he went in it started it&apos;s  vertical decent. It went down very slowly a bit at a time until it disappeared in the trees, at 500 p.m. It is difficult to describe the light. In the binoculars it has strobing red and other colours but white is the predominant one. It is white hot like a sparkler and hard to tell size or shape. I find it hard to believe that no one else has reported this as it is predominant in the sw sky and by the airport. It went down just before a jet landed. There is a population density around the airport and surrounding hills, and again I can&apos;t be the only one who sees this. The behavior of the light suggests that some people at a glance would view it as a star or a one spotlight plane on approach. It makes no sudden moves, as it moves in increments.

This incedent occured in my early teenage years which would be somewhere between 1984 and 1987.  It also occured during a cold month like december thru march.  I was with my Aunt and my brother.  We had just parked in the visitors section of the elderly highrise building on front street, which runs beside the susquhanna river.  We began walking toward the highrise when we noticed a large object (memory is to unclear to define shape) it was flying very low and moving at a unhurried pace.  It did not zoom or pause in mid air it simply continued very slowly across the sky.  I also remember that it was very silent, there were no load noises or roaring or humming sounds.  I do remember that there were a few lights( three or four in total) which were white and were on the outside perimeter, there were no lights in it&apos;s center.  The object flew directly over us.  It flew so low that we were worried for a few minutes it might hit the highrise building, which is fifteen stories high.  After it passed over the building it seemed to blend into the night sky and totally disapper.  My Aunt who is a huge skeptic of such things went right into my grandmas building and called local athorities to see if any other such sightings had been reported or if they knew of anything that was supposed to be flying in the area.  No other calls had been received and to there knowledge nothing had been noted as flying low in the area.  I know that I remember thinking that there was no way the object looked like a plane or a blimp.  It had been very low and not hard to determine that it was an object unlike anything we had ever seen.  To this day I still find myself wondering what we saw, explained or unexplained it was indeed a unique experience.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was a clear, beautiful, sunny day.  I felt compelled to look behind me; there was no one on the trail, but I looked up because my eye was caught by what I thought was a plane, but it didn&apos;t have the body of a plane.   It was at about 20 to 25,000 ft altitude.   The sun shone on it and there was a silver, metallic flash on the body.  I watched it gliding and in seconds it vanished into thin air, completely evaporated.  The sighting was of too short duration to determine the shape of the object. I knew I had seen an unidentified object.  I continued walking.  I subsequently counted 20 airplanes at approximately 30 to 35,000 ft altitude going towards or leaving Austin Airport.  Each one of them left contrails.   The object I saw had no contrails.    After counting the 10th plane, I saw, going in the opposite direction in a haphazard way, a tiny ball.

After the sun had fully set, I remained at the table, watching the small TV in the kitchen. At 16:25, something caught my attention from the corner of my eye. I looked back out the window and about one fists width above the horizon and a little left of where the sun had set, there was a very bright line in the sky, about the length of my thumbnail. I first though it was a contrail, but it seemed too straigth and even, to the naked eye. I used a pair of small birdwatching binoculars to get a better look and discovered that this likely was not a contrail. The front and back where completely flat and the length of the object was extremely straight. It was an absolutely perfect, highly elongated rectangle. After drawing it out to the shape I saw, I come up with a length to width ratio of about 10 to 1. I was able to keep still by placing my elbow on the table and using one of the window edges (it&apos;s a three window bay window) and the siloette of a leafless tree across the way, in order to determine if there was any movement. For the first minute or so I observed the object through the binoculars, it sisn&apos;t move at all. Then, over the next thirty seconds or so, it slowly moved about it&apos;s own length to the right, then stopped moving again. I aboserved it for another 30 seconds, then it just suddenly hanished. No fading, no perception of it zipping away, it just was gone in the blink of an eye. I&apos;m a sky watcher and we have frequent airliner traffic over the area, with plains coming and going from Logan airport. I know what contrails look like and landing lights, etc... This bright object was absolutely straight and of uniform width and the  ends were completely flat. The four corners of the elongated rectangular shape were perfect 90 degree angles. The perception was that this was something  far way and very large. I categorize the shape as cylinder, but it was impossible to determine the shape of the object&apos;s third dimension from my vantage point. The best I could tell, the object was perfectly parrallel to the horizon. The object was bright, likely that it was just reflecting light from the sun, which had already set from my perspective, possibility it was self illuminated?", "Witness has encounter with two saucers.I had a call today from a fellow who is now residing in Vernon, British Columbia.

The population of Clinton currently stands at approximately 740. As he was driving south a few kilometers out of Clinton, B.C on a straight stretch of road at dawn when he noticed something rather unusual way off in the horizon. He said he was able to observe a dot, or very small object which seemed to be floating around, still very far away at this time. As he drove, he slowed because what ever this was he was looking at was acting really strange and it started growing larger in size due to it heading in his direction. The witness told me, his Dad is a pilot, his Uncle is a pilot and his cousin is a pilot and he said he has been around aircraft all his life and knew what he was seeing was something he had never observed before. He also reports that what ever it was had no strobe lights on it, as it drew closer the object took on a metallic silver color to it. The shape was that of a saucer type craft, and as it approached it dropped in altitude to approx:1000 feet and flew straight over top of the truck he was driving, moving at an incredible rate of speed.  He also told me the object was approx: 60 feet across and the bottom of it was completely black in color. Just as the object passed over head his eye caught sight of another craft of the same kind and it to passed overhead quickly and both objects were out of sight within a second or two. The objects were traveling north to east. He said there was not a sound to be heard. He immediately pulled the truck over to the side of the road and jumped out to see if he might be able to see something in the distance, but these objects were gone.

I was just a kid from a rather conservative and religious family, who didn&apos;t give much thought or attention to things outside of the normal daily routine.  I had a friend who witnessed the event with me, my next door neighbor, ((name deleted)).  She was three years younger than myself.  We were outside in the early evening playing catch the sun had just set.  The lights from the dead end street we lived on put a soft light on her yard which was next to the field.  She threw the ball up into the air, and when I looked up to get a good position on the ball I noticed a formation of helicopters traveling in a southeastern formation.  I counted six or so, which were making fast progress, in single file.  The ball hit the ground.  I commented how strange it was to see that many helicopters traveling together and in that formation when we both heard a rather deep pulsating noise which made us both look toward the field.  I yelled, &quot;hey, ((name deleted)), common!&quot; and we both ran toward the edge of the field which was just between her house and the beginning of the first row of maple and birch trees.  There it was.  In a word, huge.  I had the impression that if it were on the ground, it would be the size of two houses.  I have often wondered how high the object was off the ground and if it were larger than that, but it sounded like it was close to us based on the volume of the thing.  The noise could be described as a vibration that came in and out of the audible range ... I could feel it in my stomach.  It had a strange echo or reverb which was peculiar to my ears.  The object was a long triangle and had absolutely no features to be distingushed apart from its lights.  I observed it as a very smooth and completely black object against a dark blue night sky.  There were no wings and I could see no jet intakes, hover vents, or anything which would explain its motion ... indeed it appeared to be floating very slowly maybe 100 ft above the treeline.  The trees it seemed to be over were not impacted or moved by the object like a helicopter or hover plane would produce.  The object appeared to be moving west, slightly to the south.  It gave me the impression of something ducking behind cover and waiting for the coast to clear.  Unless it was a sharply angled triangular blimp, it had no means by which I could determine it staying airborne.  I expect I was looking at the bottom of the object, except that the angle it was moving up and westward made me think it was the side of the object.  There were two series of lights, 5 running its length (on either side, or top and bottom depending on your perspective).  Each light in the row was a different color, but corresponded to the row of ligts on the other side.  Red, Green, Yellow, Blue, White. (not sure about the order).  I wanted to get a better view of the object, and began running to get a better position to observe before it moved out of our visual range due to our low obervation ground and all the tall objects around us (houses and trees) when it vanished.  No flash, to streak, no change in noise volume ... it just stopped being there.  It changed my worldview forever.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

This was most likely the Navy&apos;s &quot;Classic Wizard&quot; system.  You may read about it from a Russian report here: http://www.fas.org/spp/military/program/surveill/noss_andronov.htm  The brief description of the observation was excellent, leading to almost perfect confirmation of this being a White Cloud sighting.  Hope this helps. As a synopsis, the White Cloud system has been know under other names, but its salient characteristic is always three satellites moving together and visible at approximately magnitude 2.5 to 3.5 in the night sky.  The posted observation reports the satellites in triangle formation.  This should almost always be true. Due to the nature of orbital mechanics, the orbits of any two of the satellites must always intersect twice during each complete orbiting of the Earth as viewed from the ground.  The slightly elliptical orbits mean that the satellites are at slightly differing orbital altitudes during each orbital intersection.  Most of the time the White cloud formation will appear to be triangular, however it will occaisionally appear to for a very distorted triangle, or even a straight line. It is possible that other agencies or other governments have ELINT tri-satellite systems in orbit, but the US Navy is the only agency I am aware of that uses this system in an orbital characteristic to create visible triangle formations.  By looking for electromagnetic emissions on the ocean and matching the patterns and characteristics of the emissions to a database, the satellites are able to identify with a high degree of accuracy the type of surface craft and country of origin.  Each satellite can do this, but to triangulate the exact targetting of such a vessel for an over the horizon strike, three satellites are necessary. It is interesting to know this from Russian publications on the web.  If the information was not available in such a format, I would not write about it here.  Even so, I prefer to remain anonymous, as the national security laws may be misused. -Regards((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to the source of this report, who chooses to remain totally anonymous.

First I thought that is was an aeroplane, but when it did not move for minutes at a time, I decided it must be a star. At the moment, the dusk was starting to fall and the other stars were not out;it is not uncommon to see the north star at dusk. One thing was, the light was getting brighter with a brilliant white glow. I called my father to let him know about it in Roanoke; he confirmed what I was seeing. When I arrived at my house in Roanoke, I pulled out the binoculars and telescope. With the binoculars I could see a round light with a spiderweb like texture (i.e. Binoculars may cause distortion from the distance and brightness). I noticed that there was an unusual amount of aeroplane activity in the sky and around the object. I pulled out the telescope and positioned it to the ball of light. Each time I went to look through the telescope the light moved downward like it was landing. I pulled up my telescope from the back yard to the front to gain a better view and by the time I made it to the front yard, which took about 30 seconds, the light was gone. I had my scanner on and heard usual police activity in the area, but some messages confused me that come over the air; Some of which were morse code, and someone said &quot;Turn down the lights and the talking so we dont spook the horses&quot;, that meaning I have no idea. I drove to the Roanoke Regional Airport and found no activity of Military presense, and I called the security office at the airport, which they acted as if they did not know what was going on. Roanoke has been a hotbed of activity in the last several months with military presense, mostly the Army and Air Force doing practice runs and drills here.

However, when I looked again, I realized it was not attached to any pole, so I looked very closely at this object. It was suspended in the air - not moving. So immediately I began to see if it were a blimp. It was not. It was gigantic. It was a metallic dark blue on the top two thirds of it with black gigantic rectangular picture type windows on it where the narrow part of the rectangle was at the top and the long part was down the sides insetted into the craft a bit. The bottom one-third of it was a silverish-grey color with no markings. The object was shaped similar to a street lamp and tilted down slightly toward the ground. It was about a mile off the ground, but seven miles from my location. It was huge. Everyone on highway 580 must have seen it.  I drove my car to an area to so that I could view it better which was about three minutes later, I saw what appeared to be this craft &apos;shimmer&apos; for a second and disappear right there in mid air.

I stayed for a drink afterward and headed out about 12:15-12:30 AM.  While at a stoplight I looked up at the moon and saw a light, which I thought was a plane.  I did a &quot;double-take&quot; because I then noticed the light was part of a &quot;V&quot; of very faint lights, maybe 7 or 8 on each &apos;wing&apos; of the V. The V was not too wide and appeared nearly as a single line.  It was very difficult to see against the ambient city lighting.  The traffic light changed to green and I proceeded, I looked up again but could not locate the lights.  I thought it was odd but since there is a major air reserve base in the next town- which happens to be fairly active at this time of war- as well as an international airport close, I passed it off as an odd reflection or trick of the eyes.

Then the light of the UFO faded out a little as it began to move slowely about 30Mph toward the ocean away from UCI going towards Newport COast. Then for a sort moment it looked like a meteor flying with a trail on each side, but really it just had a bright orange light on the front of it and the light faded from the front to the rear of the UFO giving it the meteor affect. Suddenly it disapeared into the sky and that was the end, for a few moments the helicopter circled the hill and I flashed it once but it left just shortly after the UFO left.  Moments later about 30 minutes or so later, I looked towards UCI and ElToro base, then suddenly 5 to 6 flashes of white light flashed into the sky all in about 1 second, then just as the white lights finished flashing about 5 to 6 more flashed but in the color of electric blue, same amount of timing.

He reports watching them for approximately three minutes before they all blinked out at the same time. The witness reports that the lights were white/yellow in color. The lights did move around from side to side, up and down which the witness found very strange. He also reports that the lights moved individually, not together as one unit. Due to the distance the fellow was to the lights, which as a long ways away, he said they were fairly close together when looking from his location.

The weather was clear and cold. The light was white and steady, the size of a very large star, several times the size of Mars during its close approach to Earth in late summer, and slightly to the west of where that planet had been visible in the night sky.  In addition to the white light, it was giving off rapidly alternating flashes of blue and red.

My friend and i were smoking a cig in the parking of a church up on a huge hill about 200 feet above, 50feet inland of the 5 freeway. To the west was the ocean about 1 mile away.  Previous to the object (or light)catching my eye, I was facing the south(along the 5 freeway), My friend was facing north.  clear sky, not one cloud.  So anyway--then a bright yellow/gold light appears south of our position. I grew up in this town and it only has one freeway, so i know every inch of the 5 in SC. My best guess would place the object at first sight--about 1.5 miles south of the church.  I told my friend to look at it because it was very bright and rather unusual for a copper to be flying so low at 10pm. SC goes to sleep at 10pm-the city is dead till morrning.  SO we kept watching the light.  After 3-4 min. we agreed that the light was moving North directly toward our position up on the hill. NOW IS THE MOST INTERESTING PART---what ever this flying object was.  It took it 15 min to fly from south of MISTY RIDGE( the next huge hill south)To directly over our heads (1.5 miles away).  when the object passed over our position on the hill, the thing must have been moving less than 25mph.  It just appeared out of nowhere--cruzed at 15mph along the 5 freeway, went over our heads, and just kept on going. It made no sound--we would have known if it was a copper.  I&apos;m assuming that the craft was all black- because i could only see three gold lights in a triangle shape.   FOR REAL---IT MADE NO SOUND--not even the sound of the freeway could silence a copper flying right over our heads.  During the sighting the object was low in altitude.  i&apos;d say- 300 feet.  when the object flew over our heads it was NOT far away(we were up on a huge hill)--I&apos;m suprised that I couldn&apos;t see the body of the craft. i tried to make out the actual shape but i just  couldn&apos;t see the body (black/on black sky).  It just looked like 3 bright lights in a triangle formation. I watched t! he first 3 seasons of the X-files--so i asked my friend some questions.  We experienced no communication with the object. we felt no loss of time.  we didn&apos;t feel sick/nauscious. we saw it--it most likely saw us--it flew by.  That&apos;s my story. OH YA- SC is the southern edge of orange county--right on the border of CAMP PENALTIN and the TRW facility (trw-where the military worked on laszer guidence systems). My former highschool is located just 2 miles from the TRW facility. back in 1997-98, at night we would drive to a place where we could see the TRW plant and watch the laser fights.  NO JOKE- they were having lazer gun fights out there on the base. I saw all colors of little streeks zipping back and forth. looked like a water gun fight.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "Saw a triangular shaped craft that emmitted a beam directly at us and then followed over the top of our vehicle for a short distance.On Sunday, November 2, 2003 my husband, my fifteen year old daughter and myself were coming home from a housewarming party we had attended for a co-worker of mine who lives in St. Paul.  We left her house that evening around 5:15-5:30 PM and drove our vehicle heading north on HWY 61 from the eastside of St. Paul to our destination in Forest Lake.  We had so much fun at the party that I turned off the radio in my SUV so we could talk all the way home about the good time we had.  There was a slight chill in the air that night, so I had the heater on blowing out heat, but the skies over us were dark but very clear.  As we approached Forest Lake on HWY 61 I was driving and my husband was in the passengers seat had reached over to turn off the fan for the heater.  We just started to reach town and had driven almost 26 miles now and our vehicle was quite warm on the inside.  The only sound was our discussion and the sound of the tires on the road.  At this time my daughter had taken out her prizes she had won from playing games at the housewarming party.  She won some nice jewlery and wanted my husband and I to look at it.  I turned and took a quick coutesy glance because I was driving and my husband began to examine her prizes.  We could see because we had now started to come into the out skirts of Forest Lake and there were street lights that some what lit up the inside of the vehicle.  I turned my gaze back to the road and off into the distance and coming from the east towards the west I saw some blinking lights.  At first I thought nothing of it, it must be a plane because we have a small air field on the south edge of town.  But on further examination the lights seemed to be different somehow.  They were different colors and seemed to be blinking faster than a plane would, almost in a sequence or pattern.  This had captured my attention and I could not take my eyes off of it.  I said to my husband and daughter, &quot;look you guys, over there up in the sky,what is it?&quot;  My husband said, &quot;where! ?&quot;  I said, &quot;over to the right.&quot;  &quot;It is coming from over by the chain of lakes this way.&quot;  I slowed my speed way down as I drove because we were approaching the south end of town.  I had noticed the lights blinking in the sky as I just passed the first set of stoplights on HWY 61 coming into Forest Lake.  I said to my husband, &quot;what is it?&quot;  He said, &quot;ah,it&apos;s only a plane.&quot;  But we all continued to watch it.  As we headed up to the second set of stop lights I had notice the  blinking lights became closer but still far enough away up in the sky for the shape to be unreckonizable.  The lights no longer were moving from east to west, but were now hovering to the right of HWY 61 above the homes behind the businesses that line HWY 61.  When we reached the stop light it was red and all three of us saw the lights stop blinking but they were still lit and the object quit hovering.  It proceeded from east to west so that it was above HWY 61 and then all of a sudden went in reverse and backed up very quickly, almost like it was lining itself up for something.  At this point my husband looked down to push the button to make the power window go down because I had said to him, look it just went backwards!  He said, &quot;I saw that!&quot;  That is why he wanted the window down so he could hear the sound that propellers make if a helicopter is overhead.  I said to my husband,&quot;that is no plane!&quot;  I asked him again, &quot;what is it?&quot;  He said, it is a helicopter, but I do not hear any sound.  He was busy pushing the button to make his window go all the way down, my daughter was putting her prizes away and I was looking straight ahead as we sat at the red light at the intersection of 11th and HWY 61.  I was in the lefthand turn lane to go west on 11th towards our home.  As I pondered what this might be for that split second.  All of a sudden this so called helicopter flashed a large beam of light down directly at us.  It flashed me right in the face.  I said to my husband and daughter in the back seat that object just flashed us. &quot;WH! Y?&quot;  My husband who had his windown down by now said, &quot;that is a search light, they must be looking for someone or something.&quot;  I told him, no.  This was different.  It was a light like a camera flash but as bright as fireworks, but only aimed directly at us in a beam.  My husband at this time stuck his head out of the window to hear for the sound of a helicopter.  He said, &quot;what the heck?&quot;  &quot;I do not hear anything!&quot;  So my daughter had pushed the button to make her window go down and stuck her head out the window too and she could not hear anything either.  But the object was too far up in the sky for us to make out the shape and form.  We only seen lights and at this point they were no longer blinking.  My husband noticed in the car next to us was a family looking at the same object in the sky.  They were not in the turn lane like us, but heading north on 61 into town  He said the father was on the drivers side and mother on the passesngers side in the frontseat.  They were looking straight ahead as if frightened, but there were two teenage girls in the back and they were looking out their side windows up at the object and he thought one was rolling her window down and was sticking her head out to get a better look at this thing that just flashed us.  At this point I said to my husband and daughter maybe it is one of those experimental government planes and they are taking it out for a spin and trying it out, but it bothered me that they flashed this light down right in our faces.  Well, at this point the stoplight finally turned green,it is a long light.  We could finally go and we thought we had seen the last of this object for good.  Both my husband and my daughter still had their windows down trying to hear for some sound, any type of sound.  There was none. As I made the turn they started to make a rukus about something.  So I turned to look in the direction they were looking and what I saw out my husbands window was this object come from the sky where we could only see it as lights and it wisked ! its way down to tree level.  &quot;Oh, my God!&quot;  What is it?  My husband stuck half of his body out of the rolled down window and my daughter stuck her head out the window and I peered through the front window upward driving very very slowly.  What was now directly above us we could not believe our eyes!  We were all seeing it very clearly.  Looking upwards we could see the underneath of this object.  What we seen was a large triangular craft.  The top point of the triangle was in the front and pointing the same direction as the headlights on our  SUV as I headed west on 11th Avneue.  This tip had a light in the point, maybe a couple feet wide.  The two other points forming the back (base of triangle) of the craft had also had the same lights in the tips.  When it first hovered above us these lights were a light yellowish glow.  Glow meaning the lights did not illuminate on us or the road beneath the craft.  This triangular craft was an equal lateral triangle, all sides the same length.  The craft hovered directly above us and followed us down the road a short distance.  It was just above the tree tops as it followed us.  The craft was as wide as the road from shoulder to shoulder and was approximately a school bus and and half large.  My husband is better with measurements than I am, but I am the one filling out this report so bear with me.  As the craft slowly moved along above us, I was going about 25-30 mph it changed the color of the lights underneath located in the tips of the triangle.  The front one was now red and the other two, green and blue.  The outside edges were glowing with a yelowishgreen light all the way around the outside perimeter of the craft and also the same thing aprox. 2-3 feet inward.  The middle of the triangle was dark against the night sky, but could not see the stars through it so we knew it was solid.  My husband has good eyesight and does not wear glasses he saw the underneath with half of his body stuck out of the window.  My daughter her whole head was out of the window look! ing up.  There was absolutely no sound!  I said to my husband and daughter this is awesome, kind of like being in a movie because this is something you do not see everyday.  My daughter got scared.  She said, &quot;you guys, I think this is a UFO we are seeing and it is really scarey!&quot;  I tried to assure her, but did not know what to say.  I told her maybe it is just a government experiment we are seeing, knowing it could be something more.  My husband said, &quot;well all I know for sure is no one can tell me this is a weather balloon.&quot;  As the craft followed us a short distance it went a little faster ahead so it was right infront of us still at tree level.  At this moment I noticed that I had this trucker without a load and just his rigg behind me right on my back bumper and he was practically running me off of the road.  But I held my ground.  Then the craft shot straight up directly over us and higher than the trees so it could navigate over them. Once it was up in the air it shot very quickly south over the trees and then down again.  At this point we could only see the red light and it seemed to skim across Clear Lake and disappear.  We could no longer see it through the trees.  The trucker behind us was going hysterical all over the road.  We finally turned off of 11th and the trucker drove fast and furiously down the road toward the other side of Clear Lake.  We think he was either following it or trying to get away from it.  When we got home we were so amazed by what we saw none of us spoke about it until the next day.  When I went to work I told a co-worker who was at the housewarming party.  She knew me and I felt she would not make fun of me for sharing this expeience with her.  Later that evening my husband and I talked about it, asking each other what was the flash and could there possibly be any explanation for what we seen.  The next morning at work I spoke with the same gal and told her we could not forget what we seen because it made such an immpression on us.  That morning I got on the internet! and looked up planes to see if there were any shaped like a triangle, not really expecting to find any, but had to look none the same.  Then I thought about what my daughter had said and I typed in the acronymn UFO for &quot;unidentified flying object&quot;.  My search engine brought up this site and on the home page as I scrolled down was a rough drawing of what I had seen.  I grabbed my co-worked after she hung up the phone and brought her over to my computer to show her the drawing on the web page.  She could not believe her eyes that it was there exactly how I decribed it.  I confided in a few others as they too overheard our discussion.  They know me and can vouche for my character.  This is not something I would make up.  I spoke with my husband at lunch that day and we were concerned about the flash we received.  We wanted to find a way to get in touch with those present that night.  I called one of the local newspapers and asked the gal who answered the phone if anyone called in to report something strange or unusual in the sky over Forest Lake Sunday night.  She laughed and said &quot;no&quot;.  I then called the competition newspaper and was able to speak with a reporter who to print the story and wanted our names and possibly picures.  He said, sounds like you seen a UFO and having our names will make it seem legitamate. This way if someone saw it they could call the newspaper and get in touch with us.  I told him, not with out my husbands permission, I would call him back the next day.  When I did he never answered the phone so I left a message.  After talking with my husband he did not want our identity given out since we live in such a small community and we are active members in one of the larger churches in town.  He did not want us to suffer harassment or to be humiliated by those not believing our story.  We both however are concerned about this beam of light flashing us and are concerned about what it could do to our health.  We were wondering if others who may have had similar experiences could somehow ! get through to us through this website and contact us to let us know if there are any side effects or long term conditions that arise as a result to being exposed to this beam of light.  At his point I want to say to the readers of my report that all three of us, my husband, my daughter and myself are church attending Christians.  We live in a small, but growing community.  We are respected members of our community and church and live busy lives.  My husband and myself both are employed and hold responsible full-time positions and my daughter has been in classes for gifted children and currently in advanced classes.  My husband and I are both educated and above average intelligence.  We have no need to make a fraudulent claim and waste our time and yours reading this report.  In our busy lives up until now there has not been a lot of time to spend contemplating the existence of what we have seen.  This sighting has changed the way we view things and we will never be able to look at the night sky the same way.  If there is a logical explanation for what we saw we want to find it.  If there is not we will realize that this is probably a once in a lifetime experience.  Thank-You for reading our story and if you have any experience with being flashed with a beam of light from a triangular craft we would like to know about it.  Please contact the wonderful people who dedicate their time and energy to maitaining this site.  Hopefully they will put you in touch with us. &quot;The three of us&quot;", "Crafts with multi-color lights shift speeds and hover in place and move in different directions; flashes of light hop around theobjectsI made a report on November 30th and sure enough i saw something three days later. I was watching in the distance how this flashing light appeared in the sky accompanied by another flashing light. My first instinct was hat they were airplanes but then as i saw there irratic movement i began to think differently. I ran inside and grabbed the video camera and i watched as they jumped around the sky left, right up down.. etc. It was then i saw this object that looked like a plane as well but closer with red and green and white flashing lights but as it came in fast, it slowed down and came to a complete stop and hovered then moved left after it was going right. One after another these crafts appeared, shifting speeds and flashing different colors, still surrounded by tinier flashes. I have all of this on video tape luckily and it&apos;s undeniable what you see. Along with this the same night, i saw what looked like twinkling stars in the sky but when i zoomed in with the camera they chnaged from red to green to blue and white. I have about a hour of footage this time. The crafta moved without any sound, shifted speeds, and wobbled while hovering in place. Some of them made &quot;hopping&quot; movements in the sky while moving.((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that a twinkling star would have to be ruled out as a possibility, before we could conclude that the witness observed a UFO.  PD))", "our neighborhood had quite the show!(My son Nick, 15, Jason 20 and myself along with three neighbors...and others in other town) last night about 5:30 maybe closer to six pm, we were coming back from the store and when we arrived in our back alley way, I was staring off into the sky and noticed an object that was NOT of normality there was a thing, craft, spining, with tons of lights on it, to our excitement we called the neighbors out to witness this, well who woulda thought what was coming next!!!! there were NO planes in the sky YET.............just this thing cruising so fast and so quick across the sky and POOF outta of no where came three fighter jets and it started to chase this thing,,,,,,,,,,,then there was another thing, red orby looking and it actualy looked as if there was a lazer (red) or somethnig equal to it shooting at the other craft..............it was eerie...........then the sky filled with planes, now my lil town is not known for THIS many airplanes in the sky, so we totally assumed here that someone didn&apos;t want everyone to see this taking place.................the only thing I kept saying over and over was  OH MY GOD!! I dont think anything came out of my mouth excpet for those words.then there was large but not passenger plane that cruised over our neighborhood, and it wasn&apos;t like any commercial plane, not even close, this was kinda square very different looking, and yet it made very lill sound....then....................eventually, the craft either disappeared, or the trees were in our way, but none the less, this family will not forget this scene.It actually reminded me of something outta star wars or star treck............quite wild actually!!!  I thought it was fascinating to show others in my neighborhood what we see occassionally, and sure enough they were stunned......... my 15 year old drew a picture of what he witnessed and I dont think he will ever forget it...... Now, for a freaky twist of this scene, my older son has friends in Lucas and while we were looking and witnessing this event, his friend, from Lucas and his family were also witnessing this, as they were on the phone talking to each other about it........my son called it &quot;war fo the worlds&quot;  There were 7 witnesses just in our alley alone, and another 4 out in Lucas.........and personally this thing was not dim, it was bright, very bright and who ever saw it knew it was for real...........the was crystal clear...........and about 1/2 hour later, barely any planes, maybe one or two.......Thanks(NUFORC Note:  We presume the witness intended a date in the year 2003, and we have changed the date above accordingly.  We believe the error arises from a glitch in our Online Report Form.

Saw a bright green light about the size of a penny at arms lenght at it&apos;s largest moving in a east north east direction at a high rate of speed. Light moved in a direct line across the sky from directly above to the horizon appearing to dispappear from view, not go out. Total duration for light to travel this distance was approximately 2 seconds. Appeared too low and too slow to be a meteor, but too high and too fast to be a conventional aircraft.

While my friend was viewing through the telescope I turned back and looked toward the SW and saw what looked like the ISS (International Space Station) coming over . I told my friend to stop and lets look at the ISS since it is so bright a -0.7 MAG. Once the ISS flew over and past us we both continued  watching when we saw three very faint star like lights moving with it. One along side,and two behind the ISS. We both continued to observe the lights as long as we could. Were not sure what we saw, and wonder if anyone else saw what we saw.", "A large, white moon-like object fell out of the sky, disintegrating as it fell.This may have been some kind of military thing because we live fairly close to the Army Ranger station.  This is what we saw.  It was a very clear, starry night.  We stepped off our front porch to take a walk.  We live in the mountains, so our horizon is high.  I glanced toward the west and saw a big, very bright full moon hanging several degrees above the mountain ridge.  We were looking through a lot of bare tree branches.  I remember wondering how the moon could be setting in the west when it was fairly early evening.  I looked away and then glanced back.  The &quot;moon&quot; began to fall rapidly toward an area behind the mountain ridgeline.  It was surreal - how could the moon be moving that fast?  Then the bottom of the &quot;moon&quot; started to disintegrate into lots of white dots.  The disintgration process went from the bottom of the disc to the top, but it fell behind the ridgeline before I saw the whole thing disintegrate.  It did not break up into lots of smaller spheres like what I have heard people report.  It actually disintegrated into hundreds of tiny lights that fell as the disc fell, but they streamed below the disc toward the earth.  It was sort of like watching the sand drop from the middle of an hour glass, only the sand was coming from the rapidly disintegrating disc.  There was no explosion or any kind of sound reaching us.  That was all.", "This was very wierd (and cigarish)I was out in the back garden smoking a cigar. Made an humming noise and every few seconds the (What i presume to be) the front end glowed orange. by this time i was very startled and just stood there staring at something, of which nature i had no idea. By this point i ran to get my family, and when we returned it was flying off as if it was scared.", "Goodyear Blimp turns into UFO.Looked to the southern sky and saw Goodyear blimp approximately 100 feet away.  Very clear what it was.  Saw grid pattern of hull.  Seemed to have an aura of light about it.  As I watched it, sharp image started to get fuzzy and aura seemed to concentrate in the nose of craft which was triangle shaped.  Blimp faded away and triange shot across sky to southwest.  Moments later, two helicopters from Los Alamitos Air Force Reserve Center, circled area and moved off in same direction as object.  Contacted AFRC later and they denied any sightings.  Contacted Seal Beach Naval Weapons Station with info.  They called back and taped description of sighting.  Said that I had seen something and verified that their guys had seen it too.  Said some details were very interesting and they would be back in contact with me.  Never heard from them again.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Too fast to be a plane. it finally went behind us, I looked backed and the lights like burnt out and then it was gone. It had blue and red lights on top and bright lights at the bottom.

Hovering directly above the Wendover airport was a gorgeous gold light.  I could not tell the shape due to the brightness.  It reminded me of a golden firework...I said to my girlfriend in the passenger seat, &quot;Look at that&quot;!!, but by the time she looked it had disappeared.  The light seemed to vanish from the bottom to the top.  The Wendover airport is tiny, so I don&apos;t know if anyone there saw it. After leaving Wendover the following evening (December 17) lo and behold, at the 33 Milepost marker, 33 miles east of Wendover, at 1833 hours, I was talking to my girlfriend about how beautiful the gold light had been the night before.  At that exact second, she screamed, &quot;Look!!  Look&quot;!!  And, out of the passenger window, just south of I-80, were three beautiful gold lights!!  I mean, what are the chances of that happening?  They appeared to be quite low in the sky, and they seemed to be in formation, with the closest one being the lowest (maybe 500 feet high?) and the next farthest one a little higher, and the farthest a little higher still.  They were the exact same color of lights that the one over the Wendover airport was.  Bright gold, with a little orange tint.  Then, while we were viewing those, they went out one by one. In both cases, none of the lights were moving, they were stationary.  They were a gorgeous sight, especially the one over the airport, which was the closest to us I think. The Wendover airport is located directly on the Utah/Nevada state line, although it just barely be in Utah. I have a graduate degree in management.  My girlfriend has a graduate degree in social work.  We were not under the influence of any drug/alcohol.

It was kind of pulsating and changing its color to white and yellow.It flew toward our direction and when it was finally over us it kinda stopped and started moving in a circular/spiral motion right on top of us as if it was looking down on us until it got covered up by clouds. It wouldnt be an aircraft as it seemed to be outside the atmosphere like a big red star. And no planes can fly that fast (like a speed of a shooting star in zigzag direction).

This occurred when we were in grade school. I don&apos;t recall the exact year or month. Sometime, I think during the early 1970&apos;s, when the government decided to save fuel by having us go to school in the dark. We would walk to the school and it felt like the middle of the night. All of the stars were out and even a satelite once in a while would go across the sky, in a straight line. That is when we were surprised to be watching a satelite going straight but it turned and went different with no noticable change of pace. South to north, steady, and then make an absoulte right angle and go east. South to North and then an immeadiate right hand turn to the East. We just looked at each other and did not know any words to describe what we witnessed. We got to school and other kids were talking about the same thing. A satelite going as normal and then turning 90 degrees. Without changing speed or anything. Just going and turning and then gone when out of our range of vision.No sound. No colored lights. Just like a star in the sky, like our satelites. Moving like a satelite. But turning to a right angle just like that.We never knew what it was.

Hi there,  A week before the first article came out in the Airdrie Echo newspaper about sightings, I came home from work about 11:20 pm, and I let the dogs out side and I was also watching a few northern lights off my deck , I live on the east side of  Airdrie, the (deleted by HBCC UFO) are right behind my house. So we have a hill behind my place with a walk way on that goes towards the highway, and I looked over to my left toward the west, and I know what I saw, and it was big circle of lights twirling around and hovering on the walk way and then it just went down, not up. I grabbed my dogs and headed into the house. The next week, I read the article in the paper. HBCC UFO Report after talking with the witness. The first thing the witness said was, &quot;I know what I saw&quot; and it was really bizarre. The lady let the dogs out onto the deck of her home and then followed them out, stood there and looked to her left and just above a walk way she spotted the lights hovering. The walk way runs a good distance and eventually runs across the highway. The witness said it could not have been children twirling lights as for one thing the circle of lights was very large in size, plus she could not see anyone in the area. She also compared the size to a 10 or 12 foot old C-Band satellite dish. She explained that it looked to her as if it was a ring shaped object with a lot of white lights running all around the outside of it. She also said it appeared that there was not just one set of lights, but layers of them. As she stood and watched this strange display of lights, they started to move down over the hill which would have crossed over Highway #2 until she finally lost sight of the lights. She mentioned that it was approx: a half block away from her location and very bright. Also the lights were moving quickly, but there was no distortion, or the lights appearing to be one long string. She was able to view the individual lights and she told me there was many of them. No sound was heard and the dogs did not react in anyway to the strange lights. The witness said she wasn&apos;t frightened at what she saw, but her senses told her it was time to head back into her home. It was visible for approx: 30 seconds before it vanished. I asked if she was able to see anything in the center of the object, she said no, just a ring of lights. Thank you to the witness for the report.

It was about the size of an aspirin viewed edge-on and held at arm&apos;s length. The object appeared to be slowly changing shape, like an egg rotating on its short axis. I could not tell if there was any sound because I was inside the train. The object blended in with the background enough that if you looked away, it would take a few seconds to spot it again.

I looked out the front door wich faced west and could see a number of comunications towers (WTHI tv and radio, what was then WIIL tv,as well as three other radio antena,s).There was a craft hovering next to the top of boath the tv towers. As I watched them the one farthest away (at the WIIL tower) moved (didnt realy see it move but it did) to the next tower in the line-up I think it was thr WPFR tower. where it hovered. a moment later the one that was closest to me(at the WTHI tower) moved to the tower that the other object had just left. They proceded in this fassion untill they had paused at eash tower in my view and i would guess went to other towers in their path.

My friend ran inside to get a camera after watching it about a minute. I continued watching and all of a sudden it took off towards the sky. It moved at a rate of speed that was incredibly fast! It took off just seconds before my friend arrived with the camera. I am now 40 years old but I will never forget that experience.

About mile and a half before that &quot;Sierra National Forest&quot; sign came up I had seen this beautiful navy blue light and a saucer shaped &quot;object&quot; that came above from the mountains, flying couple feet from front my car and couple feet behind my boyfriend car. When I first saw this beatiful navy blue light, I thought it was a shooting star.  But then, instead of going straight as it suppose to go, it came so close to my car that I thought we were going to collide with eachother. When we stopped at a gas station to get gas in Madera, CA., I had asked my boyfriend if he seen this blue light too? and he said, &quot;Yes.&quot;  I told him that it was a UFO, but he insisted that it was a helicopter patroling Auberry and Shaver Lake, CA area flashing it&apos;s lights so they could see all the cars going up and down the hills of 168  hwy.  But, I didn&apos;t buy what my boyfriend had to say because where we were driving was totally dark, no lights on 168 and I didn&apos;t hear anything.  I only saw this extraodinary object.

It caught my eye because it looked like a short contrail very high up in the sky, but was really bright white.  Then as I watched, the &quot;trail&quot; became increasingly long and bright.  It was traveling from N/NW to S/SE, away from the Strait of Juan de Fuca towards the Olympic Mountains.  At this point, I pulled my car over to observe it more closely.  There were a few other cars pulled over as well, with the people inside craning their necks like I was.  By this point the &quot;tail&quot; was getting longer, and appeared to grow longer as the object made its way across the sky.  It seemed to travel like a missile, on a steady course, but with this tail behind it that was absolutely stunning.  The tail was brilliant orange by this point, and seemed to sparkle and wave, almost gossamer in appearance. This continued on for a few more minutes as it proceeded on course towards the mountains, and then disappeared from my view. When I got home to my husband and described what I had just seen, he said &quot;that must have been a solar sail.&quot;  From his description of what that is supposed to look like I agreed, but cannot find anything on the internet about a solar sail having been launched on or near that date.

I decided to have a look at the early evening sky, camcorder at ready just in case. At about 16:15, I first spotted the unknown object quite a way off in the distance (through binoculars and spotting scope). It took me around 20 minutes before I could zoom in with the camcorder to start filming. The sky was quite clear with just a few wispy clouds here and there. The distance is quite difficult to judge but I would say that the object was possibly around 10 to 15 miles away. I was on my own this time with no other witnesses and with the distance involved, I couldn&apos;t hear any sound emanating from the object.

As it approached, all the lights went out except the front single light.  Then the single front light went out and the last lights on each side lit-up, then those went out and the second to last lights lit-up, this sequence continued through the lights to the front of the object.  This sequence took place two times.  By this point the object was nearing overhead.  And it looked as though the lights started a new sequence moving from one tail end to the front then back to the other tail end.  As it came directly overhead, I saw no lights, and saw it&rsquo;s shape, which was not Triangular - but instead a five sided object.  It looked to be a dark colored object.  Gray in color.

We continued to travel along the motorway and opened the car windows for a better look. We noted other motorist looking at the same thing. The lights continued for about four or five minutes.

Halfway up, they made a sharp lateral 45 degree jag (not the usual banked turn but a true 45 degree right hand veer in their horizontal course) and immediately made a return to their original horizantal position (that is made a similar but counter 45 degree jag to the left). They then promptly changed attitudes so that their climb was about 60-70 degrees and left the area. There is a road 1 house down from ours that could have casued car tailights to reflect on the glass with a gust of wind making it appear as if they deveated from their path. However, again, the lights were orange, not red as expected on tailights or position lights of aircraft.

Family. Plus Green Lights Return.Continuing Abduction Problems For Kelowna, B.C. Family. Date: November 8th and 9th, 2003  Since July 31, 2003, after an UFO encounter, missing time and disturbing episodes which followed, one of the women has continued to have some medical problems. Cynthia continues to have a constant feeling of pressure on her head and is becoming worse as the days and weeks go by. This feeling of pressure has now moved into her neck. On November 8, 2003 Cynthia, while at her home, became cold as her body temperature dropped to 35.2 C. She immediately called the hospital and talked to a nurse who informed her that it sounded like hypothermia was setting in. The color of Cynthia&apos;s skin started to change, to become almost whitish/grey. She was freezing to the point where she felt paralyzed and had major problems moving or walking. Also her heart was beating really irregularly and she reports it was down to 44 bpm. Cynthia&apos;s daughter is also experiencing an irregular heart rate as well. HBCC UFO Research Note: The average normal temperature is 98.6&deg;F (37&deg;C). Cynthia&apos;s temperature dropped a little over 2 degrees and no explanation has been given as to what has caused this to happen. If your recorded rectal or ear temperature is less than 97&deg;F (36.11&deg;C), you have an abnormally low body temperature (hypothermia). If your rectal or ear temperature is 95&deg;F (35&deg;C) or lower, call a health professional immediately. Information on taking your heartbeat measurement. Your pulse is caused by your heart beating. As your heart beats and forces blood through your body, you can feel a throbbing sensation (the pulse) by putting your fingers over one of your arteries at any point where the artery comes close to the surface of your skin, such as your wrist, neck, or upper arm. Counting your pulse rate is a simple way to estimate how fast your heart is beating. Pulse rate measurements are often done by a health professional as part of a physical examination or in an emergency, but you can easily learn to measure your own pulse rate as well. A pulse is usually described in terms of its rate, which is the number of beats per minute (bpm). However, the rhythm and strength of the heartbeat can also be noted, as well as whether the blood vessel feels hard or soft. An irregular rhythm, a weak pulse, or a hard blood vessel may indicate a medical condition that needs further evaluation.The pulse rate is measured by counting the beats in a set period of time (at least 15 to 20 seconds) and multiplying that number to get the number of beats per minute. When you exercise, have a fever, or are under stress, your heart rate usually speeds up to meet your body&apos;s increased need for oxygen and nutrients carried in the blood. As a result, your pulse rate normally varies from minute to minute. Unless your pulse rate is being measured to check your fitness level or in an emergency situation, it is usually measured after you have rested for 10 minutes or more. This measurement is called a resting pulse rate. It is an accurate and simple assessment of the health of the heart and circulatory system. I always recommend to people if they feel there are medical problems that they seek out a health professional. On Saturday night Cynthia&apos;s daughter went to bed, after a short period of time she started having an unusual and vivid dream about being in some type of vehicle with two beings. She felt that they were there to take her somewhere. The young girl felt that where ever they were going wasn&apos;t the place to be. So in her &quot;dream&quot; she jumped from the vehicle and landed on the ground hitting her right leg and rolled along the ground for a short distance. Cynthia&apos;s daughter, who also has been a victim of these unwanted visits by beings from elsewhere, woke up Sunday morning, November 9, 2003 with extreme pain in her knee. Actually as she climbed out of her bed her leg folded up right underneath her. She was fine the night before, hadn&apos;t been involved in anything which may have caused the injury that I have reported below. Cynthia&apos;s daughter&apos;s cartilage in her right knee is ripped/torn and she has to be on crutches for a while until it heals up. The doctor asked the girl if she had took part in any sporting activities, or goofing around with friends, &quot;she replied no&quot;! After they left the doctors office and some time later the pain moved up into her thigh and is getting worse. Cynthia is taking her daughter back to the doctor, or the hospital to have her checked out again. Cynthia told me blood tests will be done in hopes of determining what caused the drop in Cynthia&apos;s body temperature, also checking to see if there are any problems developing with her daughter. She also mentioned that both her and her daughter are craving salted products and are extremely thirsty. Both mother and daughter are totally exhausted, as if the two of them hadn&apos;t slept for days. Cynthia said, how can a person who is sleeping soundly in their bed wake up in the morning with a torn cartilage in her right knee. I have to agree with her. Very strange indeed. HBCC UFO Note: I telephoned Cynthia Monday night to see how both her and her daughter were feeling. Cynthia sounded extremely tired, like she had no energy even to carry on a conversation. I must say I find this to be very upsetting for me to hear what has...... and is ....taking place with this family. I also am going to try to get down to see them if the weather holds. There is also more which has taken place, but due to this information being of a personal nature, &quot;I will not&quot; be adding this to any of my reports. Cynthia mentioned that a couple of nights before November 8, 2003 her daughter woke up at 3:00 a.m. to a loud and very strange and unusual sound coming from the orchard behind their home. And the dogs in the area were making such a noise. She was so frightened from hearing such a loud and weird sound that she pulled the covers up over her head. She couldn&apos;t even give me an example of what the noise sounded like as it was so strange.The very next night after Cynthia&apos;s daughter heard this crazy noise, Cynthia said she got woken up at 4:05 a.m. to the same sound, or at least something she could not make any sense of. Cynthia said the dogs were going crazy, the cows in the area were acting up, so she got out of bed and moved onto the balcony and looked toward the orchard. It was dark and she could see nothing but could still hear the sound. She told me she started clapping her hands, making noises herself and the strange sound eventually stopped. Although the dogs still were acting up in the area but since the sound had stopped, Cynthia decided to go back to bed. However, no sooner did she get back under the covers than the noise returned. She rolled over and tried to block out the sound until she ended up going to sleep. HBCC UFO Note: I tried to find out if abductees have even experienced hypothermia after an encounter. After searching and reading all kinds of matter I came up with nothing. So I contacted Mr. Derrel Sims and Mr. Whitley Stieber to ask if they had encountered anyone reporting hypothermia right after an event. They both were so helpful. Also I contacted other abductees but they also said they had never experienced hypothermia after an abduction. Of course this raises some questions which people were interested in. From what I was told a lot of discussion has not taken place on the idea of hypothermia after an abduction, mainly because no one has reported this phenomena as taking place. Some abductees report feeling very cold leading up to the actual abduction, also feeling very cold just after it took place. Many report a coldness when inside a craft to the point they were shaking. Some of this I am sure is due to the fear one must go through when being taken. So why is this woman reporting hypothermia ? Is it due from being in a very cold environment (on a craft), plus the fright of the whole situation. Did this occur because she was dropped off outside in a cold environment, which it was at the time of this incident. Or was the hypothermia condition caused by a medical problem no one is aware of right now. There always seems to be more questions than answers. Maybe the blood tests, etc.. will show something. We will have to wait and see and pray for some answers. I will leave this off here for now. I would like to say this is the end of this story, but I have my doubts. The good thing is I keep in contact with Cynthia on a daily basis and have told her if she just wants to chat, then call me anytime. More News That I Just Received:  I just had an email from a lady who resides in Vernon, British Columbia. She has informed me that a couple of business owners were in Kelowna, British Columbia on November 8, 2003 and watched green lights in the south west sky&apos;s over Kelowna. This event took place the very same night problems started again for the Kelowna family. I hope to have a full report on the sighting of the green lights. Also I want everyone to know, no information had been given out to anyone about what took place on November 8, 2003 with Cynthia and her daughter. So again we have green lights showing up and strange events taking place with a close friend. I can honestly say, in my opinion, there creatures that take folks from the comfort of their homes are not here to give humanity a gift, as some may suggest. They are here to experiment, degrade and frighten everyone who comes in contact with them. No one will ever convince me other wise. Take good care out there, and please if anyone who has been involved in an abduction and has ever experienced hypothermia after the incident, I would really appreciate hearing from you.

I observed both of these objects with Leitz 7x35 Trinovid Binoculars. All of the reports in the metro area are similar to what I observed. 10 to 15 glass like globes no lights moving in a triangular shape. They were not birds. Balloons, not quite filled to capacity, tethered by lose wire maybe. What throws me however, were the distances involved with some of the similar sitings. The other thing was not being able to really judge the distance, size, and altitude of both these objects. I spot airplanes, birds,satellites, all the time at night. The speed of these objects was leisurely.  I had three of the greyish globes close up in my eyes. It was very hard to estimate size, altitude and the specifics closer up. I don&apos;t know why. Before this, there was a triangle, glider, space shuttle shaped object moving at high speed from the northwest to the southeast. No lights No sound. 10 or 15 minutes before the previous sighting.

Thanks.", "Dreams or recollections of UFO abduction?In the mid-1990&apos;s, I don&apos;t remember the exact date, I was awakened one night from a dream by my own screams.  My wife, quite naturally, was awakened by my cries and frantically asked what was wrong. After calming down and bringing my heart rate down I told her that I had had a nightmare that seemed so real to me even after waking that I was shivering with fear.  It was a dream about a close encounter with a UFO. Before I go much further, let me tell you about myself.  I am a former United States Marine Corps aviator.  I flew as a ((deleted--senior crew member)) on KC-130 aircraft for ((deleted--approximately 10)) years.  I have an IQ that has been tested to be over 160, am well educated, well traveled and very well respected by my peers.  I am currently working as a field operations officer for a large multi-national, multi-billion dollar corporation and hold a great deal of responsibility in my position.  I am a practical, straightforward individual, known for my calm, reasoned, common sense approach to problem solving and crisis management.  I have an extensive knowledge of both military and civilian aircraft, their characteristics, abilities as well as appearance and am a licensed A&amp;P aircraft mechanic.  Back to my story... The dream I had just had was of me driving in a car which I recognized as a late 80&apos;s model Chevy Berretta.  In the car with me were 3 others, a female in the front passenger seat and a male-female couple in the back seat with the male behind myself.  As I recounted the dream to my wife we both assumed that the car in question was that of a friend of ours, ((name deleted)).  We both commented it strange that I would dream of driving her car as ((name deleted)) would never in a million years let anyone drive her beloved car. It also seemed strange to me that I did not recognize either of the females in the car as being ((name deleted)), or as my wife for that matter, but yet I felt some connection to the woman in the passenger seat.  I also felt as though we were driving home from the movies though it was more a feeling than any part of the dream. As the dream unfolded we were driving along a stretch of road which crossed under another hi-way, like an interstate.  After passing the interstate we approached a rise in the road.  From beyond the crest in the road there was a bright light as though a truck with its headlights on bright was approaching.  As we continued driving up the rise the light became intensely bright, so white it was tinged with blue and blocked out our vision of the surroundings, yet did not hurt the eyes. Once we crested the rise I was able to see a short valley that the road descended down into.  At the bottom of this depression there were two glowing objects.  Each was approximately 50 feet in height, cylindrical in shape with flared out conical bases.  (Very similar to the game pieces in the old game SORRY.)   The objects were sitting on either side of the road and were the source of the light, though no &quot;lights&quot; themselves could be seen.  It was as if the entire object was glowing with this intense blue-white light. When I was able to shake myself from the sight of these objects I could feel that I was no longer driving the car, we were being drawn towards them as though caught in the sci-fi classic &quot;tractor beam&quot;.  At this point I, along with my companions in the vehicle, began to scream.  It was at this point the dream ended and I awoke. (FYI: I have had goose bumps the entire time I wrote this.  I am hesitant to think about the dream very often these days.)  I had the dream only once.  I would sometimes think about it and try to place where the dream took place.  At this point it did not bother me much to think about the dream.  It was kind of a mind exercise to figure out where it had taken place.  The overwhelming feeling that I was driving ((name deleted)) Beretta home from the movies led me to believe that the dream took place in the suburbs of Chicago where I live and I imagined several likely locations, though none exactly matched the dream.  The fact that the car had a light color interior in the dream, and that ((name deleted)) car had a dark interior was another part of the dream which I could not rationalize. Over time I began to let the dream fade I rarely thought of it. About two years or so after having the dream I was in a conversation with some people talking about cars.  We were talking about the first car we ever owned and it was then that it hit me like a ton of bricks.  In the summer of 1988 I had left active duty in the USMC to go back to college and had bought a red 1988 Chevy Beretta with a light sand colored interior.  The car in the dream was mine.  Suddenly it all came back to me in a flash.  From that moment on the memory of the dream has never failed to bring on goose bumps, and occasional tears. The girl in the front seat was my girlfriend at the time, the man in the back seat her brother, and the other woman his girlfriend.  I was living in North Freedom, Wisconsin that summer of 1988 after taking a summer job in the area.  The four of us had gone to the movies at a drive-in early that evening in Madison and had returned home late.  We stopped in Wisconsin Dells and had gone skinny-dipping in the river at a place known as &quot;Bare-Assed Beach&quot;.  After getting in the car we drove back towards Baraboo to drop the three of them off before I drove on to North Freedom.  The next morning I remember waking in my bed with no recollection of the drive from the Dells back home. After my revelation I was able to place the hi-way we crossed under as I-94, though I do not know if it was the US Rte. 12 underpass or one of the ones west of there, but that is definitely the rough location of my encounter.  I have long since lost contact with my companions that night and have no idea if any of them have ever had similar dreams. As I have stated I only had the dream once. Several years later however, in the late 1990&apos;s I had a second dream more terrifying than the first. This time it all made sense from the start.  The dream took place in &quot;downtown&quot; North Freedom.  (I say downtown in quotes because it is such a small town, population 600, there is little else but a few lonely brick storefronts.)  The dream took place at night.  I was returning home from Baraboo in my 1988 Beretta and had arrived in North Freedom.  Being late at night the gas station was closed and there was nowhere to get a soda other than the Coke machine outside of one of the buildings downtown. As I got out of my car with the change for the machine in hand, I looked up into the cloudless sky and saw the millions of twinkling stars.  I just stood there and stared for a long while at them.  I had some training in celestial navigation and was trying to pick out the major constellations, planets and stars.  My stargazing over I then started walking across the main intersection in the center of town towards the pop machine.  As I walked I felt a slight tug at my jacket.  Then another tug.  Suddenly I felt myself being pulled upwards off my feet, into the air by collar of my jacket, my arms pinioned by the sleeves.  As I began to rise at a faster and faster rate I looked up again, but this time saw no stars.  Instead I saw large black circular object blocking the sky from my sight as it hovered overhead. At this point I again screamed and awoke. I guess I should also state that being a former Marine I do not scare easily and have never screamed that I can recall in my entire life.  Whether or not these are just dreams or actual encounters I do not know for sure, but I will say this, I have NEVER, EVER had such realistic dreams.  To this day I can see and feel every aspect of the dream; the colors, the smells, the fear.((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to the witness for taking the time to submit such an interesting report.

I witnessed a cluster of red blinking lights. These lights blinked on and off. And with each blink the cluster appeared to change shape. It went from a vertical zig-zag, to an upside down v, to snake like line of red lights.  The total size of the cluster was about as wide as the interstate. The size of each light was about the same as a red light on top of a tower. There was no visible shadow or background. It was a misty dark evening. The total cluster drifted from the north side of the interstate just above the tree line, to the south side, back again, then back to the south, it dipped down below the tree line, to slightly rise, to dip again.

Went to that location to see what was going on and found some kids drinking beer.  While having them dump out 10 bottle of a 12 pack one of then said hey what is that.  I was facing to the west and look towards the North-West and observed a Craft floating above the ground.  I would estimate this dark Meltalic Craft was about 2000 feet above the ground and about 1000 to 1500 feet away from my location.  The craft was transiting to the south, but at a very slow pace.  When it was in a South-Westerly position the mostly full moon reflected or lit up the craft.  I noticed it had rows of square objects on the side like windows which were all darker than the body of the craft which was a dark gray-black.  The craft had an odd shape too.  If you can imagine the top half shape of a stop sign with a cylinder attached to the longer edge of the upper stop sign centered evolving into a triangular oval tail section which was flat at the back end.  This oval-triangular rear end had three circles, with one large one in the center and two smaller ones on either side of the larger.

We watched it move to the south and about the time it was over the town of Sutherland, I called on the radio to another Officer who was in the Wallace area (22 Miles to the south on highway 25.  I advised him about what I was looking at and he said he would start heading North and see if he could catch it.  Just as I had mentioned the Craft we all noticed the three circles flash bright white ( about the same shade of white as a monitor displays when you have a bland white page on the screen.) a couple of times.  The Craft started moving faster and closed the distance between Sutherland and a position just south and west of the Gerald Gentelman Power Plant about where the correction line is in the highway.  (About 8 miles) in about 40 seconds.  The craft then veered to the south east and headed on a line of travel that would have taken it close to Dickens. seven (7) miles to the east of Wallace on Highway 23.  The officer to the south called me back a few minutes after I had talked to him and stated he could see the craft and estimated it was moving about 400 miles per hour heading off the the south east towards Dickens.  He also stated it was Eluminated be the lights from the power plant whne he spotted it and disappered into the darkness. I have no Idea if this was an Experimental Aircraft but I would have to say it was twice as long as an Airforce C5 Galaxy and 1 and a half times as wide.

The lites were 180 degrees apart. As it can almost over us we could make out the lites were circuler and pointed in the direction of travel. Just before passing over us the object slowed to a stop. There was no sound. We could not tell how far away the object was but it seemed close, 2 to 3 hundred yards. No detail could be make out on the craft, only blackness. The 2 lites turned approx. 45 degrees counter-clockwise flashed a orange/yellow color and moved slowly away to the south with the lites pointed north.

I initially thought it was a shooting star but it continued to shine brightly all the way down and did NOT disappear behind Mt Umhumnum (sp?) or the surrounding mountains.

It seemed faster than a freefall - it seemed to fall @ the same rate of speed at which a professional firework goes up before it explodes. It really looked like an emergency flare, but was falling far too fast. I have been scanning the local news channels and am trying to find more info online to explain this strange sighting.

As the light moved away it didnot dim as you would expect if the lights were on the front of a plane that is now heading away from you.  I live in Omaha,NE and have seen a lot of planes with their landing lights on comming in for a landing at Epply Airfield and you can always hear the engine and see the plane as it passes over you .  The sky was clear with no wind so we should have been able to hear it and see the body if this had been a plane.", "Spotted aluminum-colored square- shaped blinking lights which disappeared, car stopped &amp; red/orange ball followed us.In September 1980, I was driving from San Jose, CA to Denver, CO along with my son and our two dogs.  As we were approaching Elko, Nevada, I saw a sign that said Elko 18 miles straight ahead and a road that went off to the right and straight up the mountain.  I mentioned to my son that the road looked like an interesting one to explore and that we should come back later (we had planned to spend the night in Elko) and do just that. We set up camp in a park on the edge of Elko, ate and then took the dogs with us and set out to explore that curious road. It was getting dark as we headed out and was very dark by the time we got up in the mountain.  It was very quiet, very dark and very desolate up there and we decided to abandon our search and turned around and headed back down the mountain. My son was driving and I was sitting in the passenger seat and the two dogs were in the back.  Suddenly, off to my right a bright light caught my eye.  Both my son and I said at the same time &quot;did you see that?&quot;  It looked like a huge billboard type of thing with aluminum colored glowing squares that were blinking in some strange kind of pattern.  The minute we noticed it, it stopped blinking and disappeared.  I mean disappeared completely as though nothing at all had been there.  There was just an empty meadow where this thing had been.  The altimeter  ((sic.  Please see below.)) light came on in the car and the engine stopped running.  So I told my son to turn the car off and we would sit there for awhile.  Soon we heard foot steps coming toward the car which unnerved us to say the least.  But strangest of all was that the dogs did NOT bark.  I got worried and thought it was best to get out of there and told my son to start the car and let&apos;s go!  He reminded me that the car wouldn&apos;t start and I just told him to try again--it would start (I was kind of frantic). The car did start and we started down the mountain again, but by then I was regaining my composure and told him to go slow, real slow.  I turned around to look and there was an reddish-orangeish round light floating above the road (maybe 10 or l5 feet above)and it followed us down the mountain, almost to the bottom and then disappeared. When we got back to the campground it was around 2:30 in the morning so I do not know where all the time went as it didn&apos;t seem that we were up there for very long.  When we got back we were sitting outside, still in amazement over what we had seen when I looked up and there I was about 5 green lights and they were in some sort of formation that looked to me as though they were dancing to some sort of celestial music!  I know how improbable that sounds, especially after what we had just seen on the mountain, but I swear to God it is the truth.  We were not stoned, not drunk and not crazy.  Straight and totally in awe!((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))((FOLLOW-UP REPORT FROM WITNESS))correction to  12/15/03 reportOn December 15, 2003, I submitted a report in which I said &quot;the car&apos;s &apos;altimeter&apos; light came on&quot;.  What I meant to say was &apos;alternator light&apos;.((END))", "We spotted unusual bright lights and drove to investigate.  It came towards our vehicle as if it were going to hit us.A friend and I saw a bright figure from about 4 miles away and we decided to take that route on the interstate to see what it was.  When we began crossing the Grand Marsh bridge over the Missouri River, we saw this large object somewhat hovering over the river.  My cellular phone failed to function at this time. There were bright white lights completely around it and there was one green light.  The one green light made the object look almost triangular in shape, but It could have been spherical.  The top of it was slightly rounded and the bottom was flat.  As we went further across the river, the object started to come towards our vehicle.  It continued to come towards our vehicle and then the next thing we knew, it was going the opposite direction.  The only time it moved quite fast was when we began to follow it, other than that, it moved quite slow and steady.  We followed the object for about 2 minutes afterwards and lost it over a hill in Bismarck, North Dakota.", "large craft followed and observed my friend and i.it was about 11:30 pm, and a friend of mine and i was out cruising around in my new truck i had recently purchased,we were driving through my neighborhood trying to decide where we are going to go when we both noticed some odd looking lights above us i would have to say about 50 yards above us just following and i guess observing us.i imediatly stopped the truck and we got out and watched the craft while it floated completly silently directly above us. i looked around and the grass and air felt electricaly charged,we looked at each other and confirmed we both were seeing and feeling the samething.as we looked on for what seemed like a long time the craft shot out of sight so quickly that it just didnt seem possible except for the fact that it did just happen.my description of the craft is as follows,it was very long cylindrical shaped with 3 sets of two massive bright electrical lights,no other distinguishable markings or lights,the craft was siloueted by the bright lights in the front,middle and rear of the craft.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "A rectangle of lights that floated across the sky.OK. This is strange. I went outside to say goodbye to my dauther-in-law and as I was coming back inside the house, I looked up to check the sky again and I saw another unusual looking sight. OK. Now this one was really strange. There was no sound, and I could acutally see a structure. There were 2 or 3 lights off to the right of the object that looked as if they were part of the thing, but  what held my attention was that the largest part of the object was shaped like a rectangle and was covered with white lights in 4 rows of 5 or 6 lights. This thing seemed to float rather than fly as it slowly crossed the sky. I know this sounds like a case of over imagination since I just reported another sighting, but if UFO data is to do us any good I guess we just have to report what we see to the best of our ability.", "Triangle shaped, no lights, clear, like it was being cloaked, I could still make out the shape. VERY LARGE. Totally silent, very fast.I went out to my vehicle to get my wife a pack of cigarettes, it was dark, very cold and a virtually cloudless sky. As I shut the door to my vehicle I looked up and immedialtely noticed what I first thought was a piece of clear plastic or cellophane floating or blowing in the sky. There was no wind and it was very calm. As I watched it closer I noticed its form and was very shocked and exited by what I witnessed.It was way up there.  It was huge, two or three football fields wide if not larger. It was clear, I could see the stars right through it. I could see the shape of a triangle, it did not have lights on it, but I could could see the shape of what I thought was the front. The pointed end was facing in the direction it was traveling in. It was absolutely silent. No sound at all. I lost sight of it. I ran around to the other side of the house and was able to see it again. It started to move very fast-Several hundred miles an hour. As I was watching it I could tell it was some kind of craft. The sky behind it seemed to get distorted. It was what I could only discribe as it was being cloaked. I ran down the block trying to keep sight of it. The event lasted no more than half a minute.  I did not imagine this event, nor am I making it up. I was totally sober. I can not imagine this type of vehicle being of this planet.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the witness via telephone, and he seemed quite credible to us.  He reported that there were no lights on the object.  PD))", "UFO over nuclear reactor- 14 helicopters around it4 people, driving north on Route 9, saw a large rotating circle of lights, flying over the area of Indian Point Nuclear Reactor (restricted airspace) on the Hudson River. I counted 14 helicopters flying around it. Cars were stopped all along the road to watch the incident, but we didn&apos;t stop, for some reason. This definitely happened in August of 1988, but I can&apos;t remember the exact date or time (evening).((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "It was a scarey sight.I was out side getting some water for my grandmother when i looked up to look at the stars.  Six triangle-shaped crafts lowered themselves about 200 ft. above the ground. I saw a door slide open and that when I ran for the house. Inside I sat at the window to watch, but the door closed and it took off.", "Traveling east on I4 I spotted a bright white light w/ 2 flashing red lights.  The light was about 1000 feet up and the flashing red lights were about 50 ft. below the bright white light.  The craft was traveling right above I4 approx. 50-60 mph without making any noise.  The sky was quickly cluttered with planes and jets.  As one jet approached the light, the light quickly accelerated and was out of sight in a matter of seconds.", "We heard a loud noise, and noticed 2 white lights connected by a single object, moving a first slow then great speed.We were sitting in our living room watching television, when we heard a loud boom.  Either like someone hitting the wall outside the house, or a sonic boom.  But for a sonic boom, it had to be close due to it&apos;s magnitude.  Two of us went out the front door to see if maybe a car accident, but instead found only stillness.  There was however a loud sound, unlike a plane or jet.  More like the rumbling of the space shuttle on launch from a distance.  Very much the sound of a huge rocket.  Looking up, and due south, we saw what appeared to be to craft moving in tandam, turning slightly to the east/southeast.  Looking closer we could see the outline of a single craft connecting the two lights.  These lights were non blinking and visibly connected, white lights.  Now moving in a straight line away from us.  Within about 15 seconds of being able to see the outline of a single huge craft, the lights simply faded away into the distance.  They did not appear to be extinguished.  More like they were moving away a great speed.  The temp was 54 degrees, clear skies, with no street lights, on the out skirts of southeastern Hemet, less then 1/2 mile from the new Diamond Valley Water Project.", "Black Triangular shaped craft with 3 pulsating red lights.First off, I have a horrible concept of time so the day and year are estimates.  However, my memory of the encounter is clear as if it happened yesterday.  If verification is needed, proof could probably be provided by contacting one of three sources.  First, one could contact The News Enterprise since a short article was ran documenting the appearance of the object.  This article noted that two witnesses had seen the object, two policemen in fact.  I&apos;ve no idea if they filed an official report on the matter but contacting either the Kentucky State Police post in Hardin County or the Elizabethtown Police Department might yield further information on the subject. As for my encounter, I was driving home very early one morning around 0200 after playing Dungeons and Dragons with my friends at the comic book store I owned when I saw the object.  I was on Hutcherson lane, about a half mile off US1600 when I experienced a compelling urge to look up in the sky.  What I saw surprised me.  Hovering above a field, roughly 500 feet in the air (hard to tell depth due to visibility and no frame of reference) was a triangular shaped object that would have likely dwarfed a football field had it landed.  At first it was difficult to discern the shape of the object since it was black and I was viewing it at night, thankfully it was a clear night.  Due to the three orange/red lights, which seemed to pulse slowly, I was able to make out the silhouette of a triangle.  The craft just hovered there as I drove under it, making no noise at all.  As far as I know, the military does not have an aircraft with VTOL capability that can hover without noise for an extended amount of time.  The cops that viewed the object spotted it from Ring Road, as far as I know, I&apos;m the only one that got a close look at the craft. As for the article in the paper, it stated that further investigation into the matter would be handled by one of the government agencies (I forget which one they mentioned now).  A few days later after the initial article, it was determined that the &quot;craft&quot; was, in fact, reflections from the fireworks at the Heartland Festival. I assure you, what I drove under was no reflection from fireworks (fireworks that were over well before midnight by the way), nor was I high, drunk or no medication of any kind at that time.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It has been over 12 years now, but the experience is still so vivid for me.  I was on the deck at my parents house relaxing under a starlit light in their hot tub.  I was just sitting there, when suddenly the jets in the hot tub turned off.  I reached to turn them back on, when I looked up to see this huge...enormous shadow coming over the treeline.  It moved so slowly, yet so deliberately.....at about 2mph.  I stood up and stared straight at it...It sailed through the sky directly above our back yard without any kind of noise.  At the time I wasn&apos;t really afraid.  I watched as it filled most of the visible sky between the trees in the back yard.  There were bluish/whitish lights on the bottom of it, but they were not very bright.  As it left, the hot tub jets turned back on and I just sat there in disbelief.  I think that I wanted to believe that it was just some military experiment out of nearby Pease Airforce Base, so I really never talked about it to anyone other than family. Last winter I found your site and was thrilled to see that other people have had similar encounters.  I am reporting this because it is still so clear in my mind and I believe that what I saw was not from this world.", "3 discs in formation flipping into clouds and descending  out of them.I am a retired air traffic controller and this siting took place when I was 16. I was extremely interested in aviation at that time and knew just about every type of aircraft. The ceiling was approximately 1000 ft , myself and two friends saw three discs  approximately 30 ft in diameter moving in a triangle formation from North to South at the base of the cloud layer. They would flip up simultaneouly into the cloud layer and then descend out of it. They made no sound. It appeared to me that they may be reacting to the height above ground and would rise by flipping upwards to gain more height. If anyone has a similar flipping siting would they please post.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

There were 2 red lights in verticle alignment. The object was moving from SSE to NNW very slowly. Other neighbors also came out when the sound was heard. There are no airports within 15-20 miles from my house.", "Triangle carft observed by TXU Nuclear Power Plant.I was walking out to my truck to head to work. I work the night shift and its located very close to my home so that allows me to leave about 5-10 min. before 11:00 p.m. to make it there on time. Just as a habit I looked up to the night sky to gaze at the stars. Off in the distance toward the west and moving east/north east I spotted what I thought was a very low flying plane. As I continued to watch the object some things began to occur to me. On the out skirts of my home town there is a TXU Nuclear Power Plant about 5 miles out. We don&apos;t often see low flying anything because of it. As the object came closer I noticed 3 very dim lights on it. On the left was a green light and on the right was a red light. In the middle, slightly higher was another red light but it was noticeably smaller than the two on either side of it. I know that all planes have lights that display these colors but these lights weren&apos;t blinking that were on constantly and did not flash once. I was still thinking that this might be a plane but there was no sound and with how low it was flying anything moving or flying through the air would have some sort of engine noise but this thing was perfectly silent and steadily moving ahead. Not until the object passed over head did I see the true shape of it and it was a perfect triangle and looked mostly black or a dark grey. I jumped in my truck and tried to follow the flying triangle but lost sight of it behind nearby houses and trees as I made my way to the road. By the time I reached the road it was hardly visible and disappeared into the night sky. I estimate the size to be about that of a private jet or small commercial carrier and the speed at about 50 mph and the height that it was flying between 120-130 feet. I don&apos;t know or assume the object had anything to do with the nuclear power plant but I think they may have some sort of radar that could have possibly detected the object.

My first impression was that of a satellite. Suddenly the object moved in the opposite direction, toward me, and became much closer and brighter. It&apos;s movement hesitated, almost stopping, and hovered. It appeared at times to be a bright round ball of white light with two chevrons of light of equal length on one side of the round ball of light. The side chevrons appeared on one side (180 degrees of the sphere) only. For two hours I watched in amazement as the object moved erratically, in seemingly random but tight patterns. After the first half hour of my observation I awakened my wife and she also observed the object. Gradually with random, back and forth, circular movement and up and down motion, it moved in a northwest direction further and further away - but very slowly. After 1 1/2 hours I asked my wife to awaken my daughter. My daughter also observed what we saw. At times of movement the object appeared to leave a faint trailing edge of light.

Well u al guys belive me or not i dont care but let me tell u that i saw ufo just one month back in mumbai..... i dont remember the date excatly but it was just two three days before or after to last full moon night.i was sleeping and got awake for natural call , i went to bath room had my work done and came back , went to kitchen had a glass of water and checked the time it was nearly 1.30 - 2.00in night i went to my balcony and just headed towards sky to see stars (as its my hobby to watch stars) i was looking to stars and then turn around to go back to sleep when suddenly an bright star attracted my mind, saw an very bright star in sky . i never saw such bright star  (direction - towards bandraside over the sea at bandra) it was just an bright light whiote and slight yellow without any blink or flash ,i kept staring at it .first it was just a small dot but gradually there was an increase in its size ,not that big but diffenetly there was an increase in its size and within 5-10 secs i realised that as it is increasing in its size there is an very fast circular motion of that light (how if u see a ball which is burning in flames and is revolving very fast in circular motion).It remain for few more sec and then again started minimizing and then it vanished...this show was just of 15 to 20 secs.....well guys belive this or not but what i wrote is real thing...if anyone who have seen this kind of thing please confirm ..((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The day had been overcast and rainy. but at that time the sky had begun to clear and the sun had started to set. The still-heavy clouds were a brilliant array of orange, pink, purple, black and white, with some spots of clearing. I was standing facing south. preparing to go down the steps and into the parking lot when I noticed a sparkle of light emerge from one of the clouds, and pass through a clear spot of sky blue. The shape of the object was like a crystal, shining and with multiple facets from which the sun reflected. The object was spinning very fast, and it quickly passed through the clear patch of  sky and on up into another cloud. I did not see the object again after that, but felt disoriented and lightheaded, and had experienced about 10 minutes of missing time. The shining object was near Mount Cheaha in the Talladega National Forest, which is easily viewed from the back steps of the business where I am employed (a historical landmark) That same night I had an array of strange dreams about being taken up into a spacecraft.", "there were 2 ufo&apos;s they made alot of noise. they were as low as trees as 50 ft.", "Silent Lo-flying Craft with Dome and Bright White LightsThe following account is related here as told to me by my sister. The approximate coordinates of the house from which my sister observed the UFO are:  44:55:00 N   68:41:00 W   In the fall of 1989, my sister, then 16 years old, returned home after seeing a movie with a friend. It was probably between 9:30 and 10pm. She looked out of her bedroom window and saw a large, gray object with a dome top and one or more rows of white lights around the lower edge. There was one very bright light illuminating the path ahead of the object, which was flying &quot;just high enough to clear the tree tops&quot; --  (probably 50-75 feet above ground level) She estimated it to be &quot;about the size of an average house.&quot;  What struck her most was that the object made absolutely no noise, and was traveling too slowly to be an airplane. The bedroom window faces due north, and the flight path was south, toward the house. When the craft passed over the house she ran to a back window to see if she could catch another glimpse, but she saw it just for a second as it disappeared behind the tree line and disappeared. My sister was slightly shaken by the incident, but did not tell anyone about the sighting for years because she feared ridicule. She eventually told me and one or two others. I have heard many accounts of sightings.  This one is unique because I do not believe it would be possible for my sister to imagine or create what she described.  She has always been a very down-to-earth, responsible, and realistic person. She is a college graduate with a degree in Human Development, was the director of a private pre-school for several years, and is currently a Case Worker for a Social Services Agency.  She was a popular, well-behaved high school student with good grades and had no reason to seek attention. (She doesn&apos;t even like science fiction!)  The only nearby military airports are unlikely to be involved in experimental aviation. There is an ANG refueling wing at KBGR (8 miles) operating KC-135 aircraft, and a Medical unit with Huey and Bell helicopters. Brunswick Naval Air Station is nearly 100 miles away. I believe Loring AFB was still operational at the time of the sighting; it is almost 200 miles to the north. My sister provided a pencil sketch of what she saw which will be submitted.

It was brighter than the stars and traveling at what I thought would be the speed of a satelite. To my utter amazement, it came to an absolute stop. I was stunned and tried to imagine what it could be. I aligned it with the peak of the garage roof and stared at for a while, my mind whirling.

I work nights &amp; was outdoors with my dogs for a few minutes before leaving for work &amp; was admiring the stars when I saw something unusual as I&apos;ll describe in the following paragraphs  I looked at the clock as I let the dogs out, it was 11:46 pm EST. When I re-entered the house it was 11:50.  As I mentioned, I was standing on my back deck looking at the night sky, being generally thankful for a clear night for my newspaper route &amp; enjoying a last cup of coffee. I live near a naval air station, directly under the flight pattern between 2 rivers they tend to follow when getting practice air time as well as typical approaches &amp; landings. The base is a Nato base, so I&apos;m accustomed to seeing all types of aircraft &amp; have worked on several military bases, including this one, while employed by a general construction contractor.  I also am accustomed to seeing civilian aircraft over my home at a high altitude (much higher since Bosnia). What I saw last evening was entirely different from typical civilian &amp; military aircraft. It did, however seem to be following the path of the civilian craft that go over my area. It was travelling from a South-South West direction, inland direction.Brunswick, Maine is very near the coast; I am personally about a 5 minute drive from the ocean, a couple minutes from any of 3 rivers. The description:  I have heard on coasttocoast.com when you spoke descriptions of ferris wheel type sitings. This almost represented that, but I couldn&apos;t be sure if it was round or if it was just the rotation of light sequence that I was seeing. It may have been a different shape or even, of course, a civilian aircraft. The lights appeared to number several or many, some red, some green &amp; some white. The white ones lit up the bottom which gave a little definition as to its shape &amp; confused me some. With the rotation light sequence it appeared to be round, but the white lights made it appear more typical aircraft shaped. What made me feel very deeply that it wasn&apos;t a typical aircraft was the speed it travelled at. My line of vision between where I first saw it, &amp; where I lost sight of it behind pine trees was slight. I&apos;ve jsut measured it outdoors holding my hands up &amp; I would say there was, with arms extended only about 2 feet between them.  It covered a relatively large piece of sky in a very short period, I would guess I only saw it maybe even less than 15 seconds &amp; it was out of view. In this area, the military aircraft are generally very low &amp; in view quite a while &amp; civilian aircraft generally show 1 flashing red light on the bottom that I&apos;ve noticed &amp; are visible for a longer period. This was just all of a sudden &amp; view &amp; then gone. There was nothing unusual about the noise it made for an aircraft at that altitude. Just a general rumbling noise &amp; I had to actually make sure it wasn&apos;t another noise in the neighborhood, but it was definitely aircraft generated. Perhaps those that flew overhead, last weekend, I believe (that I unfortunately missed seeing, but heard of on coast to coast)were making a return trip?... I have just scrolled down to the contact info area &amp; have decided I will also call your hot line number. I&apos;ll be on a cell phone (with free nights &amp; weekends) &amp; hope this is satisfactory.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and found her to be quite credible.

We were sober, not under the influence of our previous conversation or any kind of drug i can assure you. This craft was aprox. 35 to 40 yards wide, 8 to 12 yards from top to bottom, Circular shaped. It was hovering with almost no sound right above this old abandoned house with pecan trees around it. The craft had to be right at treetop level. coming up to this craft i seen it had two visible red lights, one at each end in the center of top and bottom. upon getting closer, i realized that the red lights were revolving around the craft at some speed, only the ones at each end would be at an angle for them to be seen from any standing point. There was a great white/off white light beaming down directly from the bottom all the way to the ground, almost like it was pulsing very quickly. by this time i was only about 30 yards from the craft, and i was proceeding directly under it almost to the left side of it. i looked out my window, stopped, the light underneath it shut off, and it began slowly moving off to the north-east, I got a birds eye view of the bottom of this thing. Its very hard to explain, i could draw it better, but ill try anyway, It was! circular, but underneath, it had the shape of a spiter, six to eight large steel looking arms extending from the middle to the edges, like a star shape from the bottom of it, there was very little sound, and my car was almost directly underneath this thing, it was only probubly 30 feet in the sky above me, in these spiter like legs, they were turning at what looked like a high speed, i seen heat vapors coming from under it, like when you look on top of a hot black top road, you see the blur of the heat rising. the outside edge that held the red lights was spinning, it was night, i did not get a perfect look at the thing, but i got a real good look at the bottom of it and sides. no flying craft that i know of consist of a 40 yard wide circle, that can hover above your head at 30 feet, make no noise hardly, and drift off like that, once it moved up over the trees about 200 yards away, it was like it just vanished, no sound, no light, the moment it went over the trees out of my sight, it was like it was long gone, it must have picked up some serious speed, but i did not see it. whatever was inside had to have seen me, cause i stood out in the road with a big mag light lookin at the bottom as it passed almost directly over us. it felt as if i caught it off guard when i came around the curve, cause i was going over 90 mph, i snuck up on it, the big white light underneath cut off, and then it started movin off, and thats when i seen the bottom of it. The reason for me not telling anyone about this until years later,...well i didnt know who to tell lol. Aint never really thought of tellin my story, but i figured some people might find it useful. since ive been watching on tv, and ive seen where people drawed what they seen and it looks almost exacally what ive seen, actually i could add to their drawing the missing pieces.

I heard my Old English Sheepdog franticly barking and I veered out my window of my 3 story house and saw a red oval object hooving about 500 yards from my home over the pine forest on the back of our home estate. It  was hoovering for approximately 5 mins, then in snap propelled into the atmosphere in less than a span of time of 2 seconds.", "Cloud-like saucer shape with top and bottom domes having flashing lights moving slowly at low altitude.Craft approached from North West and then proceeded East along 10 fwy.  Craft appeared cloud-like in saucer shape outline with domes top and bottom approximately 50 to 100 feet across.  There were flashing aircraft type lights on top and bottom of opposing domes with a dark narrow slit near top dome.  Craft moved very slowly at low altitude no more than one-hundred fifty feet from my hill-top viewpoint.  During the event, I felt very calm and was not aware of any detectable noise from the craft.  This was my first encounter with a UFO sighting.", "Formation of 12 to 14 large birdlke objects going North to South over Downtown San JoseI saw the formation from a parking lot rooftop.At first glance they looked like a flock of birds,However after 4 or 5 seconds I noticed thy were NOT flapping thier wings, they were changing places very rapidly within the formation and were moving faster than birds fly.They were all the same size, 3 to 5 foot wingspan ,1.5 to 2.5 feet long,this is only a guess as for thier height I would guess around 800 or 900 feet,Note we had high clouds that morning and they were flying LOWER than the clouds&apos;so if high clouds have an average ceiling then maybe someone could get a better idea how high they were. I have had an interest in UFO&apos;s for a long time and may have seen others before, as a result I ALWAYS carry binoculars 10/40 in my car. I quickly pulled them out,As I focused on them I realized they were NOT birds but some kind of small flying wings, gray colored against dark gray clouds. they were flying with great precision and never banked but remained perfectly horizontal while at the same time changing postions quickly and sort of rhythmically. They would change positions fly for a second,change positions fly for a second or 2 and change again.They would stay very close together the whole time and the formation was not perfect like geese fly. But kind of an arc at times almost as if they were playing with each other as thy flew. I watched untill they were gone, They were going North to South right over downtown area, just east of flight path of san jose airport.I think of myself as kind of a macho guy,I dont scare easily. but when I could not rationalize what I saw I found myself left with a creepy helpless feeling that these things are just flying were ever they want and no one is stopping them."]
