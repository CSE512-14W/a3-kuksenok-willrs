It happened early enough in the evening that it was still light outside despite the surrounding hills. Most of the concert choir had gone outside the front of the school to socialize and enjoy the nice weather. Suddenly, someone noticed a fairly strong light coming up the Ohio river valley from the south. I think our initial thought was that it was a helicopter because of its altitude and its slow leisurely progress, but as it came closer someone pointed out there was no whooshing sound.  The object continued moving to the north up the river valley until it was directly overhead. It appeared to be triangular shaped, with three round lights at each corner and one larger light in the center. It seemed to be a silvery colored metal,approximately 200 feet above ground, smaller than a light plane and with no visible wings.  As it continued it passed directly overhead, giving us a clear and unobstructed view of the underside of the object.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

Upon leaving the restaurant and walking to our car we saw three dull orange lights flying in a triangular pattern in the night sky.  The craft were flying in a northern direction.  They made approximately a 130 degree turn and flew in front of the moon.  As they were in front of the moon, they could not be seen because of the moons brightness.  Once past the moon the craft continued in a southwestern direction for approximately 10 seconds.  They turned back to the northern direction they were originally headed, rotated so that they were on plan with our line of site and flew off until they could no longer be seen.  I have never seen an airplace make the turns with the speed and sharpness of these craft.  The lights were not bright pinpoints of light as is seen on an airplane, but rather dull circles of light.  The craft did not make any noise.  During this incident, which lasted for approximately 45 seconds, an airplane flew overhead in a northeastern direction  The airplane was clearly visible and could be heard easily. I believe that there were three different craft involved and not one for two reasons:  1.  The relative brightness of the lights did not change while the craft turned or rotated.  I would have expected the brightness of the lights to dim, brighten or be obscured as the relative positions of the lights on a rigid craft changed as it turned or rotated. 2.  The positions of the lights relative to each other changed, which would not happen if they were attached to a rigid body.", "Dark shape with burnt orange glow near Bristol RIAfter reading a report dated 17 Feb,2003 from Roslindale MA, I decided to submit a similar sighting I experianced.During the early morning hours on the above date I saw something very dark against the sky moving from the direction of Fallriver MA in the direction of Bristol RI (East to West)at a high rate of speed. From my vantage point it appeared to be at around 500-1000 feet in altitude. There were no navigational lights and I could not decern a shape but there appeared to be burnt orange light swirling around it. at first i thought it was a reflection from the sodium lights on a nearby building on the window of the car.  I exited the vehicle and still saw it. I could hear no sound (jet or propeller). I then removed my glasses, thinking it may be a reflection on them but could still see it. I watched it until it was out of sight. the sky that night was clear and there was very little humidity. (unusual for our area that time of year) and there was no Moon.

While the light was red, a pure beam of white light shone brightly into the night sky, tapering at the bottom, and flanging out at the top. The light went only a short distance into the sky and stopped. The light remained lit for 2 to 4 seconds, flickered shortly, and then dispersed in a random pattern.

At one time, my family had twenty-five acres of very high land in Connecticut. Behind the house, separated by some distance,  was a pool with a screened in porch. Beyond that, a very large, open meadow surrounded by woods.At thirteen, I was sitting in the screened-in porch with my younger cousins. They faced the house behind me, I faced the open meadow and woods. It was toward the end of the day, but still light out. It was then that I noticed two objects moving very slowly,traveling right to left, up above the tree line that skirted the large meadow. One was following the other. Moving slowly and silently. Then the strangest thing happened.The first traveling object just exploded. There was no reason for it. It just happened. It was a silent explosion. It just exploded into white and yellow burning light and its pieces just seemed to disintegrated as they fell. It didn&apos;t fall as a single large structure.It just broke up into chunks and each chunk- large to small burned up.  There seemed to be some smoke around each piece or chunk as it burned, but  no huge plumes.It just burned up and I saw little of it trail to the ground. It happened very fast. The strangest thing was that the disc traveling not far behind it was completely unaltered by all of this. It just kept traveling its course as if nothing had happened. Amazed, I ran inside to get the adults of which about five hurried outside with me. There we saw the surviving disc still making its way silently, slowly over the tree line until it suddenly,very abuptly, dove down sideways into the woods between two large trees. The only thing I could think of that could be of any interest there is that this is the location of a very deep, small pool of water left over from an old quarry.Yet, the disc seemed to almost instantly shoot straight back up.Changing its direction to come over the meadow and straight toward us! It went directly over our heads not any higher up than a large tree. I actually stood under it as it passed. The sun was setting in the distant valley below us, but it was still twilight with plenty of light to see. It was classic disc shape, flat bottom smallish hub on top- unified color. I seem to remember the texture of panels, but not sure. Over head it was a darkened metal color - yet as it traveled off into the valley below us and the setting sunlight hit it, I noticed it was shinning silver. When it went over my head I felt no fear, I think because there was no sound. It seemed surreal. I would say robotic! I felt no wind, no rush of air nothing. We all silently watched it sail off into the valley below us like one would watch a hot air balloon, totally unalarmed. All my aunt said was that it was a UFO and that she recently had been coming back on the New Jersey Highway with my Uncle when about thirteen UfOs appeared traveling down the road. She said people just got out of their cars and stared at them.We thought it was neat we got to see them. We didn&apos;t feel scared or threatened or that we had to call someone.I remain unfrighten by them. I feel they&apos;ve been around for so long that if they wanted to have ended us, they would have done so long ago.I feel I am luck to know something personally about the world others have to still guess about.Yet, now I am left with intense curiosity. How did the craft and explosion emitt no sound?  Why did the other disc following behind the first just keep going and remain unaltered? Why did it shoot so quickly into the woods? And most of all, why did it chose to come right over us. Did it want to see us too? I don&apos;t know, but I hope I get to see another UFO in my life time it was great!((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))", "Diamond Shape light with beams over Capital Forest in Olympia, WA across from Mud BayI live in the woods overlooking the Capital Forest past some farm land and Mud Bay in Olympia, WA  . I have lived in this house for two months. The view is spectacular, and numerous times daily I take in this view. Last night I glanced up while making bottles for my 7 month old, and there were two bright lights above the forest hills. One of the lights was much smaller than the other one. So, I walked from the kitchen and went out on our deck. Indeed something was odd! So, I went to wake up my husband who was sleeping on the couch. By the time I got back the small light had vanished. I got a much better look at the bigger light. Let me state that in all of my hill gazing in the past there are a couple houses on the upper portion of the forest, and a small pin-size light. There is (and never has been) a light like this. The light was so bright! It was a bright white light that sometimes looked red. It had huge blue green rays that came off the craft that were very defined. The light was a diamond shape, and brighter than any light (minus the sun) that I&apos;ve ever seen. My husband would not wake up! I finally got him up and he went out and looked and said &quot;yeah, I&apos;m going to bed&quot;. He was half asleep, and even though I pleaded that &quot;you know there are no lights there&quot; his overtime ridden body had taken the helm. I couldn&apos;t find our digital camera, so I woke my husband up 10 minutes later, and he said it was out in the car, but I couldn&apos;t find it. He must have left it at work. I even have a 10X zoom, so I might have been able to get a good shot. This is the part that frustrates me the most! I was amazed that I had time to call my Mom on the east coast (twice to wake her up) and talk on the phone for about 10 minutes, wake my husband up twice, look for the camera in the car and upstairs and downstairs before the light went away. My Mom and Grandma had a UFO experience when my Mom was about 4 years old in Florida.  I had only heard the story once, but they were both so adamant that it had happened that I knew my Mom would believe me! Ironically, my Grandfather had been sleeping at the time and wouldn&apos;t wake up. If only my baby were older and could share this with me (like my Mom had)!  I had expected the light to zip away as others had described, but it didn&apos;t. It turned off like a light switch. I was looking at the craft when it happened. Let me reiterate that there are NO LIGHTS on the forest top brighter than a pin light. The only thing I kept thinking was that if  this was an american aircraft why was it not moving? No helicopter could have lights like this and still fly, and no plane could hover in the same spot for 15 minutes. I searched the local paper this morning to see if anything had been reported. I didn&apos;t find anything about it. That&apos;s when I saw this website. I was tempted to phone the police last night, but what was I going to say...&quot;I saw a UFO&quot;? I haven&apos;t even told any of my friends at work. I continued to watch after the light went out, but the only thing I saw was a number of cars driving on the road at the bottom of the forest hills. It seemed like the numbers of cars traveling that road had increased significantly, but I can&apos;t be sure. I&apos;m not normally looking and counting the cars. I do usually notice 3/4 cars a night and there were atleast 10 last night. I was hoping that it was because numerous people had seen the lights and it would be reported in the paper. I was never frightened during this experience until my Mom said &quot;if you get a visit tell them whatever they want to know&quot;. This, of course, scared the crap out of me! At 10:45pm my baby started screaming and I was scared something had happened. Perhaps I had seen too much? Maybe I was lucky because I couldn&apos;t find the camera?  I think the screaming stemmed from a first tooth being born, not aliens poking and prodding my baby. I slept at the foot of my bed so that I could look out our sliding glass window in our bedroom. My protection: a pillow, a golf club, and some water. Yeah, I know, Hollywood is always right! I am totally freaked out about the whole situation, and will keep my eyes looking in that direction for quite some time. Whether I will actually tell any of my friends...will remain a mystery. I hope that others will report to this website the same sight and I can atleast share the experience with someone.", "A round aircraft with white, yellow, and red lights on it which lasted 2-3 seconds.

NUFORC was contacted by an employee of the Federal Aviation Administration, inquiring whether we had received any reports from sources in California, describing a peculiar, metallic-looking, disc-shaped object in the morning skies in the vicinity of Santa Barbara.  The employee provided us with the name and telephone number of the individual with whom the FAA had spoken, a CHP Officer, who had described to them his alleged sighting earlier in the morning.  We spoke with the officer at length (25 minutes), and he described having witnessed a very bizarre-looking, disc-shaped object in the skies above &quot;the freeway&quot; in the vicinity of Goleta, CA.  The officer that he had witnessed the object for an estimated 30 minutes, and that he had reason to believe that several of his family members had also witnessed the same object from a different location in Santa Barbara.  The officer stated that he first thought the object might be some type of kite, but then abandoned that notion, as he continued to watch it.  The object was circular in appearance, and it was &quot;tumbling, end over end.&quot;   He was facing north, and the object was moving to the north, away from his location, probably passing over the Santa Barbara beach.  He assumed that other reports might have been submitted to the Santa Barbara Police or Sheriff, although those two offices reported that, to the best of their knowledge, no reports had been submitted to them.Please see sighting report from Laguna Niguell, CA, located south of Los Angeles, for same time and date.

There is a large radio antenna in the vicinity of the craft and from its hight, it appears that the craft is about 200 feet to 300 feet off the ground.The row of 4 lights seem to be pulsating and changeing sync every few minutes. The lights of the city, that usually blink as trees and such obscure their lights, at this time appear to be almost in sync with the pulsating of the lights on the craft.The lights are a off whiteish color and they dim and brighten as the pulsating occurs.After telling my relative about the last sighting, I decided to get them to come and witness.  They saw the lights and had no idea was is causeing them.I contemplated that it may be stadium lights, but, the lights I am seeing do not occur for example, on any regular schedule as with games that would be held on weekends. The hieght of the lights is also to high from this distance to be stadium lights. The size of the lights is too big from this distance to be stadium lights. During the daytime, a telescope sighting of the area where I have seen the lights, shows no type of stadium light stands or any structure. So I have to rule this possibility out.I can not make out any shape of the object holding the lights, no outline or shape of any kind.I attempted to take three pictures of the sighting with a polariod (only camera I have). The first two came out black except for a single small fuzzy white spot that is hard to see. The third picture, I attempted with the light setting on lightest, and this picture came out totally black.", "Glowing white sphere moving rapidly west to east high rate of speed and absolutely silent. Phoenix PD confirmed sightingsGentlemen, I&apos;m trying to locate information on a sighting I had in Phoenix on Mother&apos;s day 1990 or 1991 around 10:00pm. I had even called the Phoenix PD to ask if anyone else had seen this and the dispatcher said, &quot;I don&apos;t know what you saw but I&apos;ve been getting calls from all over the place.&quot; I was living at the Tampico apartment complex(6130 N. 7th. Steet) just a block north of 7th street and Bethany Home Road. It was Mother&apos;s day (May 11th) at approx. 10 or 10:30 pm. A glowing white sphere traveling from West to East crossed overhead moving rapidly and in a perfectly straight line and went out of sight quickly. I was on the Army Parachute Team in West Germany and have jumped out of allot of aircraft in my career. I know how to judge altitude and speed fairly well. This object was about 1500 to 2000 ft. up and absolutely silent. It did not project light in front of it (like running lights on an aircraft) it simply glowed white.

As I put the phone to my ear to say hello, I could hear a young girl crying in the back ground and a women speaking to her.  I said hello...there was a short pause and the women on the other end said, &quot;Is this the UFO place?&quot; I replied, &quot;This is Oregon UFO Research mam, is there something wrong?&quot;  I could still hear the girl crying in the background and the sound in the womens voice was very sharp and semi-frantic.  I began taking notes.She said, in a very matter of fact way, &quot;Are UFOs real or not?&quot; The way she said this, rather insistent on an answer with her daughter still crying in the back ground made me think something had just happened at her home. &quot;Yes mam we at Oregon UFO Research believe there is something to the UFO phenomenon. I hear your daughter crying. Did something happen at your home this evening?&quot; There was a pause and the women began to cry herself. &quot;Yes.&quot;  I asked, &quot;Is this something you have called the police about?&quot; After another pause she said, &quot;we have no police here to call. It would mean one coming from miles away...besides, I&apos;m not sure what they could do anyway.&quot;  I asked her how she got a hold of my number and she said from a quick search on the internet for &apos;UFO Oregon&apos;. I then asked her what had happened and she explained that about 45 minutes earlier (which would have been around 1:45 am) she was awoke by a scream from her daughters room down the hall. She leaped from her bed and, running down the hall towards her daughters room, noticed a glow of light coming from under the door. As she turned the knob and opened the door the hallway was bathed in brilliant light coming from the room but originating from outside the girls window which was closed and covered by blinds. Her daughter was sitting up in her bed with her blanket up around her body and face, only her eyes showing as she screamed.I interrupted her at that point and said, &quot;someone was outside your daughters window pointing a bright light into it?&quot;  She explained that the light was from above somewhere outside and slowly dropping to window level and described the brightness as being &quot;sharp&quot; like really bright flood lights that left lines through the room as it penetrated the cracks in the closed blinds...the lines of light running from the floor upward where she stood and from the top of the window down. She said the light was so brilliant that you could make out dust particles floating in the air caught in the light. She explained that she ran to the bed and picked up her daughter and began to rush from the room when the light went out and the room went dark. They then turned on all the lights in the house and called her husband at work to come home.As I asked where exactly she was I realized that she had pulled away from the phone for a moment and was speaking to her crying daughter. When she returned she began speaking quickly and in a whisper that her husband had just pulled up and that she would talk about this with him and to please not call her back if I had the number until she had a chance to talk with him about it. She then hung up. I checked the caller ID on my phone but it only said &quot;out of area&quot; with no number available to give any indication of where this event took place. As of this posting at 9:45 am there has been no return calls but if there is and the witness is cooperative an investigation will be initiated. At this time there is nothing to validate whether this event is real or not but it is the opinion of this investigator that the phone call was either real or was the product of Oscar caliber acting on the part of both the older and younger females heard over the phone. It is my opinion that the event happened, whatever that event may have been.

We saw at the other side of a field a hovering silver cylinder slowly moving across the far end of the field. It seemed to be aware of our presence and changed direction, hovering above the bushes and heading towards us. We all ran back to our caravans and told our parents. When we returned it had gone. That same night while we were all asleep I was waken when my aunt and uncle burst into our home shaken and obviously terrifed.

I went outside to the lawn area next to the pool where our apartment manager was setting up tables for later in the day, to have a BBQ and get together. It was still early and no one was setting off their fireworks yet. We lived only 3-4 miles from Moffet NAS.  I heard a very deep rumbling sound which I knew was a sonic boom. But it was deeper and louder than I had ever heard before. We both looked up at exactly the right moment to see two or three eliptical disks swoop over very low and fast. The low one that caught my attention was dull silver on the bottom but burnished orange on the side and top from the reflected sunlight. It was only 150 feet off the ground. They may have been playing &apos;chicken&apos; to see who could fly lower. The higher one(s), were identical but I did not see any sunlight reflect off of it (them). They were a little bit bigger across than the wingspan of a P-3 Orion sub-chaser, of which I saw everyday in those years. It happened so fast I only got a good look at the lower craft. After they went by I looked at the manager and said &quot;Did you see those... I was was going to say, flying saucers, until I noticed his face was white as a sheet. So I said ...rockets&quot;. He went inside, probably to get a drink. I thought to myself &quot;Well, flying saucers yeah, their real what&apos;s the big deal?&quot; The only question I had at that time and still have whenever I see ufo&apos;s, (14 other sightings) is who does it belong to? Ours or theirs? Whoever these guys are they have a flight path that comes in low from the Pacific in a straight line from Daly City down to Sunnyvale then onward. Fun fact. Line it up on a map and it continues down to Southern Nevada. They usually come in on July 4th or close to it. Examples of other fly-ins I&apos;ve noticed, 8:30pm 7-2-87 VERY loud boom. Approx. 12:45am 7-5-91. This leads me to believe that it may be a re-supply of some kind for &quot;alien&quot; personel. As our guys usually have federal holidays off. Fair warning for &apos;03.

One of us pointed one out, when suddenly it began to turn rapidly. Then it would suddenly turn directions, very smoothly and very rapidly, far quicker than any known craft. Then we noticed another, and then another. At first we thought it was some sort of battle beween the craft, but the craft just seemed to be playing. They would pair off, then regroup. They could turn any direction they wanted, they could stop on a dime, and change color. At some point we woke up my dad, who is usually a light sleeper. He seemed TIRED. He looked up, said something, I forget what,  and then he just went back to sleep. We kept watching these little lights play in the sky for a long time, close to an hour.

Clear skies. Appearance of spheres were the same size, their being the size of a lower case &quot;o&quot; (from my viewpont)at the type-size of a &quot;10&quot; on Microsoft Word.  The spheres appeared as white but also illuminated uniformly from within--not as reflected light, no flashing light or lights.  The spheres did not glow. The two objects suddenly appeared in mid air literally out of the blue.  They did not appear from a point of origin moving from the west to the east.  Objects first appeared in the north/northeastern sky at a 2 o&apos;clock angle from Tucson International Airport, which is located between Tucson Blvd. and Campbell Ave., and moved eastwardly.  The objects were not in any formation.  One sphere was higher in the sky and to the left of the lower sphere. I was waiting for my flight, looking out the north windows and first saw an airliner about 30,000 to 35,000 feet up flying from the west to the east  The jet was at a more northeasterly point on its path when the two spheres appeared to pop out of the blue lower to and behind the airliner by two mountain peaks.  The spheres dropped down a bit, seemed to stay still for some seconds, and moving more slowly than the jet, also moved in an easterly path with the higher sphere disappearing about 30 seconds after first notice. When these objects suddenly appeared, I was surprised at their spherical shape. The shape of the jet was clearly recognizable.  These objects were not recognizable as any known aircraft. I called over to a woman in the room to come see this, and she saw the two spheres, the jet, and the one sphere disappear and the jet fly out of her sight to the east with the second object also having disappeared before the jet was out of sight.

Around it simultaneously were smaller &quot;circles of light&quot; craft, approximately 6 or so, which lit up behind clouds and were in constant motion, darting in all directions simultaneously.

The light travelled so fast that from a distance you only saw the the green appear then the red go out.

I picked up my pace but only made it about another 200yds. before the object sreaked back and stopped right over my head. I was right behind the backstop of a baseball diamond and I remember clutching the screen with both hands and swearing and threatening the thing as loud as I could scream.I thought that if I put up enough fuss &quot;THEY&quot; would leave me alone. It then began to zip around the sky at extreme speed and I turned and ran faster than I could to a friends house about 150yds. away. I hid in a hedge and sure enough it returned and cruised about slowly near where I was hidden for about 20 seconds[ which seemed like an hour ] then shot straight up till it disappeared. As terrified as I was I remember thinking I wish it would come back. I also remember saying to myself that I&apos;ll never believe this really happened so I swore to myself to remember that exact thought.What makes it harder to believe is that it was there again the next night at 17:30.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate", "3 cigar shaped green flying objects moving from south to north, no way it wasLast night it was pretty cloudy, so it&apos;s no way it was a plane or helecopter.the clouds were very low and i dont know what was it.

It&apos;s fire tail disapated and the object continued to glow that orange-yellow color. We have seen many such objects but this one appeared to be in distress. It just didn&apos;t look right.

We were in Banos, Ecuador for two nights. On the second night, my room mate (a management consultant) was on the balcony of our hotel whilst I was filling in my journal. It was night time. She banged on the window and called me out, as she couldn&apos;t believe what she could see. I went out and was amazed. There were two small balls in the sky. They were reddish/yellow - they kind of looked like balls of lava or something. They could grow and alter their brightness, but remained a sort of red colour all the time. One of them was to the left of me - it seemed to be heading towards the constellation of Orion. The second one was zipping around the sky, sometimes fast, sometimes slow, but I have never seen anything move like it before. She said that one of the balls actually came down into the valley and then went back up into the sky (but did not actually land). There is a mountain across the valley, and from behind it was a flash like sheet lightening. Then another ball rose slowly upwards. It did the same as the second ball, following the exact manouvoures that I watched the second one do. By now, the second ball had moved to the left slightly. A few minutes later, a fourth ball rose, again, preceded by a flash from the mountain. This did the same as the two balls behind it. The third ball had also moved over to the left. The three glowing balls made a triangle and stayed still in the sky. At this point I was pretty freaked out so I ran back into my room and across the hall to get some more of our tour group. Two of them came back with me (one works in a laboratory, and the other is a psychologist), and the four of us watched the lights. By now, the first light could not be seen, and balls 2 and 3 were heading over towards Orion. Ball 4 waited in the sky. There was another flash from behind the mountain and then a fifth ball rose upwards. It was bigger than the other ones, and instead of doing any manouvours, it went straight across the valley and appeared to go behind the mountain behind our hotel. The fourth ball then went off into the sky, and could be seen very faintly. I watched the whole thing for half an hour. We then had to go off for a group meal at a local restaurant. When we came out, the sky had clouded over so I could not see if they were there or not. I didn&apos;t take a photo as there was a streetlight below us and it would have flooded the picture with light. I wish I had a camcorder though!!  Even now I don&apos;t know what it is we saw.

It went behind a cloud and the trail disappeared. It came out again and the trail started forming again. Then a little white dot in the sky caught my attention. At first I didn&rsquo;t think much about it until I saw how fast it was going. It was going faster then the airplane and was lower to the horizon, too. It was pretty far behind the airplane, so I don&apos;t know if it was chasing it or not. It looked like it was spinning. It was kind of a shiny white, and was an oval disk shape. I couldn&apos;t tell if it made a sound or not because the van was making to much noise to hear. We were driving east and I was looking out the window north.

We went to sleep &lt;we all slept on a pallet in my room&gt; and I woke up around 12am because there was a bright light in my room, but I guess I fell back to sleep because I don&apos;t remember getting up to investigate....the next thing I remember is waking up and everything was pitch black...so naturally I went to sit up to figure out why...but there was this pressure on my chest keeping me from sitting up. When I put my hand out in front of me to see what it was....it scared me to death...The covers had been wrapped tightly around me including my head and I was completely UNDER my bed. I started screaming and crying of course and everyone woke up and my mom and my friends had to get me out...  explain that.  You couldn&apos;t get under my bed just by rolling underneathe it.  An average size human head won&apos;t even fit in between the floor and the bed...PLUS, if someone had jokingly put me there, I am a light sleeper usually, I think I would&apos;ve felt that.???? So, Anyway a few days later we had another spend the night party at one of the girl&apos;s houses and we had stayed up late...well I went to bed before any of them.  I probably hadn&apos;t been asleep a whole hour when they came running in their screamin &quot;Their after you!  They followed you here!&quot;  &lt;we were convinced that the previous incident was in some way connected with extraterrestrials.&gt;  I got up and went into the kitchen &lt;the live in a rural part of the county&gt;  and I saw lights flashing beyond the treeline.  It wasn&apos;t lights like the ones that blink on an airplane or helicopter.  They were much bigger and there were many of them.  I can&apos;t say exactly how many, more than one, less than 10.  They kept pulsing red and white. and at some points they seemed to come closer like they knew we were watching.  I know what I saw was not an airplane.  I couldn&apos;t make out the shape because the light was so bright, but if I had to guess I would say sphere based on the shape of the light.  They hovered and moved around the treeline for about 5 minutes and then flew up and dissappeared.  Both of the girl&apos;s begged me to go home.Both of them are very honest people and were very confused about the incident.  I don&apos;t think any of us still understand...I haven&apos;t seen anything since then nor have I had any weird things happen, I just wondered if maybe anything was reported about this as well?

I cant say that there were any colors in these lights that was out of the ordinary either. They were just white. The behavior of the lights is what caught our attention.We were outside about 10:00 and noticed what can be discribed as a very small pin of light. Just like that of an airplane very high in the sky. One at a time we noticed these lights coming out of the northern sky over top of us to the south and than breifly stopping (for less than 5 seconds) and shooting at an extemely high rate of speed directly to the east. It was definately not a normal aircraft because the acceleration was almost instantanious not to mention the the perfect 90 degree angle they were making to the east. We witnessed this about seven times in row that night all following the same exact pattern over the same exact tract in the sky. None of us are astronomers or anything but common sense leads us to know that this was not a natural thing. You could tell these were controlled and determined objects. The timing and speed of the objects were all the same in a very disciplined pattern.As this event occured, the 3 of us commented on what we thought it was. Nothing we came up with then or even to this date has satisfied me. It was not your classic UFO sighting with lots of excitement and awe.

A yellow vertical flash appeared in the SW sky at approximately 11:40 PM; and since this was the harbinger last year to the same highly atypical event, I fixed my view on this part of the sky.  At exactly 11:45 PM, two objects appeared in this dark space of sky about eight fingers wide at arms length from each other--one slightly higher than the other from my vantage point.  These two reprised the same &apos;communication&apos; as the last occurrence in that the lower flared twice and dimmed, then the other flared once and dimmed.  This activity went on for about five minutes, then desisted.  Inasmuch as I have harbored an affinity for skywatching, I am quite familiar with the wild twinkling of stars like Sirius, but this was not a persistent twinkle; it seemed like an attentive statement/question and sensible response.  After the &apos;flared conveyance&apos;, the two objects remained in a comparitvely dimmed state for another minute after which they disappeared.  Does the earth move fast enough to obscure the view of two lighted objects if they are six finger widths rotated horizontally at arms length from the horizon?  Also, let me add parenthetically that the horizon in this part of the sky is uncontaminated with ambient light. Approximately fifteen minutes later, I saw the same incident in the WNW sky--same object position relative to the horizon and each other, with the same type of &apos;flared conveyance&apos;.  After about one minute they too disappeared. I went out the following night to investigate if what I had seen were stars; but owing to the sky&apos;s overcast melingering, I went out last night when the sky conferred clarity upon me.  That same space was bereft of anything visible, to me at least. This dark space where the two objects had been two nights prior plyed my vacuous mind with questions for which, obviously, I possessed viciously inadequate answers.  More, even if the two objects were indeed stars whose presence was precluded by some atmospheric variant the last night, why do these illumined objects only appear &lt;i&gt;subsequent&lt;/i&gt; to the initiating flash?

The lights and &quot;smoke&quot; moved around, constantly shifting its shape.  The object held its position high in the eastern sky for approximately 1-2 seconds.  It quickly moved to the south a short distance, stopped and changed course several times before flying west at a incredible speed.I am a 20-year-old server at a restaraunt and he is a  college educated 31-year-old construction worker.In my opinion, the object was watching us.  When the object noticed we were watching it,it spastically moved and flew away into the night sky.This object/light was not a reflection of light on the cloud, like a beacon.

I had read in the news that the shuttle would be overhead so I went outside to my backyard a few minutes early to get adjusted to the dark. I saw the Shuttle exactly at the time that was mentioned on the news. This was the first time I had seen a Space Shuttle overhead. I yelled for my mom to come out to see. At this time I noticed another light trailing the shuttle maybe the distance of your hand if you held it straight up. This ball of light was slightly smaller than the shuttle and I forget the color. Anyway as my mom was walking out the small ball of light shot silently and instantaneously down behind the foothills. I was facing west at the time. All I saw was a beam of light somewhat similar to a bright Perseid meteor shooting behind the hills. The ball of light was gone. My mom never saw it since she was still walking outside. I&apos;ve still remembered it to this day since I&apos;m pretty skeptical of UFO reports but I don&apos;t know of any explanation for this.

I am not certain exactly when this happened.I was taking an evening walk in a rural area outside the city when I saw what I first thought was a fast moving artificial satelite (although it seemed a bit low for a satelite). Then I heard a jet. I looked and saw a fighter jet come over the hilly horizon. It was following the light in the sky (going the exact same direction as the orb of light). Then I realized that the orb of light really was quite low and small (it could not have been larger than a VW beatle based on the size of the jet following it). Both jet and orb disappeared over the hilly horizon. I wondered &quot;did I just see an ET craft?&quot;. Then I thought to myself &quot;insuffient evidence for that conclusion&quot; and a couple seconds later another identical looking light moved through the sky in exactly the same direction as the first.

She told me that they watched a number of funny colored lights (blue/red/yellow/white) traveling in their direction from the north. What made this a strange looking sight was that the lights seemed to pulsate, and only the white lights on the object grew very bright in intensity, and the other colored lights stayed at the same brightness. As the object drew closer to their location it seemed as if the lights, in a ring, surrounded a dark solid object which was in the center. From the glow off the lights they noted the dark object in the center was completely round in shape, with this ring of colored lights running around it. The object moved very quickly across the sky heading south. The approx length of the sighting lasted about 10 seconds before they lost sight of it due to the trees. She said it traveled in a straight line and up rather high in the sky, but low enough to catch a good look at it. No sound was heard coming from it and no tail was observed.

Our two horses that were being fed a hand full of surgar by a 16 year old, brayed a shrill, raised on their hind legs, and darted off away from the landing sight of the UFO. This all may sound melodramatic, but that is the way this encounter began.When all this happened, we spotted the glowing object slowly hovering about 15 feet above the densely planted mesquite, oak, and huisache trees. We heard branches break or a crackling sound as if some were being burned up on contact. When it landed about 60 yards or so from us, the light or  glow ceased. However, we heard an earthly sound that shook the ground and vibrated the concrete patio we were standing on. The noise got louder and the thumping vibrations more intense. By coincidence, another 16 year old who was asleep inside the house, woke up, came out to the porch, and said that we all looked as though we had seen a ghost.

I talked with a witness twice, but today ( May 21, 2003) I received the rest of the story on the sighting the two witnesses had which took place between April 20th and the 24th. I was very interested to see what the exact date would have been for their sighting, as I had a good report come into me of a large triangular craft which was seen approx: 2 kilometers east of Houston, B.C. on April 21, 2003. The witness I chatted with today was not completely sure of the exact date her and her husband witnessed, but it could have been on April 21, 2003. I telephoned the witness I met today ( May 21, 2003) and made arrangements to meet at their home to discuss what it was they saw. This sighting took place approx: 8 minutes west of Houston. These folks, who I can say are very credible people and have a beautiful home sitting on a large parcel of land. The view they have of the surrounding area is really something. They also have a great view of the Telkwa mountain range where so many strange lights/objects have been seen. We sat down and she proceeded to tell me the details of what was seen that night. The couple had already put their young children to bed earlier, and they were getting themselves ready for bed when the wife went to close their bedroom curtains when she saw a tight cluster of lights just sitting stationary in the sky, and not very far from their farm. The formation of lights also were not that high in the sky. She called to her husband to come and have a look with her, and he also was shocked at what he was seeing and could not figure out what the lights were. He proceeded to go and grab his binoculars and they both took turns viewing the lights. As they now had a better, and closer look at the lights, I was told that although it was dark, they could see a shape to the object. It looked like the letter &quot;C&quot;, but with lights on the outside, or the curved surface of the object. The colors of the lights went from a yellow/white, red and green. Another interesting thing about the lights were that each light took it&apos;s turn growing in brightness. This continued on for some time while the object sat in the one position. They also told me that the object did not move from it&apos;s position. The sighting lasted for approx: 20 to 30 minutes. (HBCC UFO Note: Due to the length of time the object/lights sat in the one position, I wondered if it could have been bright stars they may have been observing, but they told me that they told me whatever it was, was sitting far to low, and pretty close to their location. Both of them thought the object may have been hovering over highway #16, or at least close to it which is not far from their farm. Also other objects in the sky did move slightly (stars) and this object did not move as they had it lined up with a popular tree on their farm). They did open the window to see if any sound could be heard coming from it, but nothing. I also asked if they noticed any kind of reactions coming from the pets they have, and none was noted. Object/lights seen in the southwesterly portion of t! he night sky. After watching this for a while, they closed over the curtains and went to bed, but having this still on their mind the wife got up and peeked out the window shortly after they settled in for the night and the object was gone. She told me this really frightened her, now wondering what it was they were looking at. I am sure many or all will not remember a sighting back in August 23, 2002 of a HUGE object in which these same folks witnessed, and captured on video. Not a half hour after she shot the video, and doing the rest of the dishes, she noticed another object and again caught this on tape. And I have viewed the tapes, and have them both here with me. So these local residents are seeing some strange things here in Houston, B.C.

A friend and I had spent the day fishing and finished off with some food. I got back to my house around 1:30-2:00 AM. Upon getting out of my car I looked at the sky, as I usually do on a clear night. I was admiring how clear the sky was when I noticed a very bright light to the north. My first instinct was that it may be a satellite. I love watching the sky and am quite familiar with the appearance of satellites in orbit, and their linear patterns. This light however was not moving in a straight line and seemed to slow down and speed up randomly. It would pulsate from very bright to almost invisible. The duration of the brightness was much longer than the gradual fade. It appeared circular in shape, but had no visible edges. It proceeded south in a straight line, occasionally breaking course to either side. The movement did not seem natural. It was also quite close, compared to satellites I have seen in the night sky. No sound was emitted. The whole thing was actually quite surreal, especially since it had covered so much distance in 10-15 seconds. Shortly after it had broke from its straight course south for the 5th or 6th time, it just seemed to vanish. I&apos;m not sure what I saw. I do watch the sky constantly, for beauty and curiosity. This event stood out from anything else I have ever seen. Got me pretty excited, and a little nervous.", "possible anamolous object on TV showI recently had an incredible sighting while on vaction that I did not report and I am not reporting here. Since that time I have been even more vigilant and today I think I saw something that may be worthy of a quick investigation. I was watching The National Geographic Channel, Expedition Journal: &quot;In the cold light of day&quot;. Towards the end of the program, (I was flipping through the channels and did not watch the whole thing) a photograper who was being profiled on the show was charged by a musk ox he was photographing near the seaside. In the next scene as the narrator speaks about photographing subjects under all conditions, 2 men are shown walking down a country road. Something is moving in the sky very discreetly. It happened very quickly and I didn&apos;t tape it, so for all I know it may be an airplane or bird or cloud. But my gut tells me it may be a good UFO shot. Please let me know if I can help in any other way. As for my previous sighting, I&apos;m not sure I want to type it all out yet.((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witness observed in the program.

I asked them why they were looking at the sky (as I was laughing at them), just then a light the size of a U.S. quarter if you were holding it out as far as your arm could reach started to glow. The light was very bright and condensed,with a white and orange color. As the light went on, 3 seconds later another light(equal)came on not to far from it. As the lights glowed for about 10 seconds together, a little light the size of a airplane light dropped from both of the larger lights. The little lights flew around the larger lights until the larger lights disappered. Then the little lights flew at speeds and angles that no plane(that I know of)could possible fly toward the north and downward. The light were coming from the east when the all started. As the three of us watched the sky I asked the three people how long this was going on for and they said about 5 mins. but the little lights happened at the end when I got there.

One witness on his way to the Huckleberry Mine outside of Houston. At approx: 70 kilometers south from town he saw a multi colored object sitting in one position in the distance a head of him. He said to me that he thought it was a bright star due to it twinkling different colors. But after a second or two he thought it could not be that as it was totally over cast. The fellow said he had some extra time before he had to be at his work place, so he stopped and watched the lights for approx: 4 to 6 minutes before it dropped down suddenly behind a mountain. He also claims that the lights dropped &quot;straight&quot; down rather quickly. Because he was at a distance from it, he certainly could not hear any sounds coming from the thing. The lights/object did not make any sudden movements, it just sat in the one position before disappearing behind the mountain. In the area there are no towers, or anything else which would cause any strange lighting. The area in question is very rugged and wild. HBCC UFO Note: When the chap was telling me the story, I first thought it may have been a star also, but after hearing it was a overcast night/morning and hearing that the lights/object dropped quickly straight down behind a mountain, I kind of ruled out this sighting as being a star.

I was sitting at home, my girlfriend was at a girlfriend of hers, and she came in early with her friend. They had been sitting on the roof terras drinking and chatting as  my girlfriend looked up and saw a triangle or diamond shaped luminous object. Color was like all colors of the prisma, but subtle like a cut diamond. The objects were at least 5 a 6 times the size of the biggest stars we could see As they where looking at it they spotted a few more. She told me to come outside and see for myself. They spotted at least 6 other objects but 2 of them I have seen with my own eyes. IF you looked very concentrated it looked as if there were three light or that they where triangle. One of the objects was in front of the house and one on the other side of the house. The distance was far, but objects were subtle changes in color. In the south of the Netherlands were i live, we don&apos;t have so much light pollution and it was a clear sky, so the view was perfect. The object on the northside of the house, was there for about 2 and a half hours. In a steady position, so stars where moving, but not the object.

I asked the guy if he ever seen a ufo, his girlfriend was there too, and she thought I was joking, I got them to the window on the other side from where they live and the object was there. Clearly visible. My friend looked at me in disbelieve, but his girl was enthousiast what she seen. I ran down again and one of hour neighbours who was walking the dog late, was curious what we where looking at, when I explained she was like totally amazed. Stars dont twinkle like this object did and it was there already for at least 25 minutes. We where thinking it could have been a plane in the beginning, because we have a lot of awacs flying over.! We got Seedorf, brunssum and other american milletary basis in the neighbourhood. But when we saw a airplane fly over, we had a good reference that it wasn&apos;t an airplane. On Januari the 27 2003, we have seen the same object in another place, but relatively near the one that we were seeing on the northside (front) the 15 of april. That object was slowly descending, we had to get home, and we weren&apos;t sure, so we lost interest. Anyway, The plane crossed our viewpath of the object, so that must give you some poor reference how far it was. I can&apos;t tell you how far the object was, but it must have been at least 3 or 4 kilometers. I am not experienced observator. I talk about this stuff on message boards, but never have seen actually until I moved to the south. We have been watching for half an hour and i have been checking on it every ten minutes and it was there until a two hours later when. I am sure we will have more sightings here because I have seen three of them on two occasions, but my girlfriend has seen more as she had a better view from that roof terras. Maybe i can ask her if she can send you guy&apos;s a report, because she has seen objects coming out of objects, but that was high up in the athmosphere.

There was a slightly yellowish white &quot;spot-light&quot; at the very tip, and this was moving around, up and down and side to side.  Then ALL the lights on the crafted shut off for perhaps 4 seconds.  Whenthe lights came back on, it was moving again and it moved past me, then behind me, and out of my sight.I told my wife about it.  I don&apos;t think she really believed me.    I brought it up again with her several times over the next week.  I went to my computer 4 days after seeing it, and did the attached rendering inphotoshop to show her exactly what I saw as best I could remember.  My wife did a search on the internet several days later and said that someone else from here had also seen it and described exactly what I had described.  I wasn&apos;t around when she did this, so I have not read the account, she didn&apos;t bookmark it (she said it was on a message board) and I have been searching for it online.I have not used my real name or address on this email account, I really don&apos;t want to be ridiculed about this or have any publicity.  I&apos;ve told you pretty much everything I can think of here, but I really like to hear back from someone to see if you know who else saw this thing.&quot;", "Spliiting lightsI was in my Garden facing WSW and I noticed a white light going from my left to right.  This light increased intensity and became exceptionally bright, I thought that it was an aircraft that had turned on its landing lights, but it was curious because it was way to fast and way to high to be a commercial airliner.  After observing this light it then split into three seperate lights and disappeared, I belive I saw a small dull reddish light in the same path.  I the noticed directly behind a dull red light moving behind the first light.  The red light was moving at an exceptionally high rate of speed and appeared to fade in and out.  None of these lights had any type of stobe effect nor could I ascertain any rotating beacons or other indications that it was a conventional aircraft.  Directly after that, there was an increase in very fast moving aircraft in the same general area, I suspect them to have been military aircraft.((NUFORC Note:  Witness suggests that date is approximate, a fact that we do not understand.

At exactly high noon on 08/01/96 my son, who was 17 at the time, came running downstairs wanting to know if I wanted to see a UFO.  I said, &quot;sure, Matt&quot;, as I had never seen one before.  By the time I got into our front yard, I saw Matt pointing up in the sky due south of Sandy, Utah, a suburb located south of Salt Lake City.  Matt&apos;s eyes were bugging out, and his arm pointed up at a bright blue light.  The weather was perfectly clear without a cloud in the sky, so this extremely bright, blue light was against a blue backround, but it was so bright it was easily observable.  It was the size of a pea if you held it out at arms length, and it appeared to be extremely high, although there were no reference points so it was hard to tell.  It was hovering, completely still.  All of a sudden, it started to come down at an astonishing speed, coming down in 45 degree angles, coming down in the shape of a Christmas tree.  Try to imagine the light coming down in the shape of ZZZZ stacked vertically.  It seemed to go from what could have been an altitude of 100,000 feet to approximately ground level in under five seconds, something no plane I have ever seen could do.  After being just above the ground for several seconds, it jetted back up to an extremely high altitude at a straight 45 degree angle, and just hovered.  At that time, I was standing in our front yard pointing up with my eyes bugging out.  The blue light hovered still for about two minutes.  I was so shocked, finally I told Matt to go in and get a pair of binocs.  However, before he could come back out, the blue light started to travel south, at a leisurely pace, due south over what may have been the town of Lehi, north of Provo, Utah.  Later that evening, my son and I went to a movie, and a child three rows in front of us pointed up at the ceiling, then made motions with his ! finger, imitating EXACTLY the flight pattern of this thing to his father.  So, obviously he saw it.  Unfortunately, I did not tell his father that we had seen exactly the same thing.", "Rocket shaped object over a baseball field.While sitting on patio of 3rd floor apartment, a rocket shaped object approximatly one story tall took off from a baseball field.

The object had 2 lights on the bottom, one red and the other green.  The lights flashed one time together and then blinked every other color.  It then flew over the top of the building making a similar noise as an airplane but very subtle.Approximatly 5 minutes later in the same vicinity of the original sighting, the same or possible a different object with numerous red lights flew past the building at about 100 feet away, at the hight of the 3-story building.

They went in side to get more parts for something they were working on and I saw it alone, but the next day the neighbor boy ask me if I had seen it he had also seen it and was looking for some one to validate his siting. There was a hill in between 2 other hills about 30 miles from us and I saw a bright light there on that middle hill, then the hill slowly raised into the sky and disapeared. The neighbor boy saw exactally what I did, we asked around but most people were afraid to commit even though we could tell they had seen something strange. There has never been a hill there again.  Over the years we have seen strange red lights and orbiting formations but nothing like the 77 incident.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is precise.

It was about 7:30PM and heavily overcast with a ceiling of about 1000 feet with a strange orange color to the clouds, which I assume came from the Low Pressure Sodium lighting around the city. I happened to glance up at about a 45 degree angle and noticed a very strange shaped object just sitting there, stationary in the sky just below the cloud ceiling.  It was two equilateral triangles, connected at the tips in the shape of an hour glass.  Your choices of descriptions of the object above didn&apos;t include hourglass shape. I&apos;ve always been interested in the subject of UFO&apos;s but hadn&apos;t seen one previously and so was immediately intrigued.  I watched it for about 10 minutes and noticed that it appeared to be two FLAT equiliateral triangles made of transparent glass which seemed to either reflect the clouds around it or project the clouds behind it, through the solid-appearing object.  I ran inside and got the phone to call the city desk at the local newspaper to report it and find out if anyone else had seen it.  They said that yes, others had seen it, about 8 calls had already come in.  The guy said someone surmised that it was some kind of reflection from a petrochemical flair at the ship channel.  True, the color of the object, a strange orangish color that was very similar to the surrounding clouds, was very similar to the color of the bright orange flairs I&apos;ve seen at petrochemical plants.  However, clouds are constantly moving and changing shape and this object was not only stationary, but fixed in its shape with very sharp and straight edges so their explanation did not even come close to holding water!((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

It was reddish orange in color, and I want to say it was dim in appearance. It had almost a &quot;natural&quot; color to it, Like that of fire. In other words it didnt appear to be luminated by artificial light. Its would slow down and change directions like nothing I know of, except a helicopter but helicopters  are loud and there was no sound coming from this thing. I pulled over and it was gone. so we drove around looking for it because we thought a building or a tree could have blocked our view, when we see it appear again almost like it appeared out of knowhere. We got out of the car and observed the object and was heading in our direction, maybe about a mile north from us. I began calling family and friends but knowone could see it. I concluded from this that the object was much closer than we thought. And coiuldnt have been much bigger than an average jet. The object began dropping some sort of luminated debris over the city. The debris looked as if it was on fire or luminated as well but it appeared to go out before it hit the ground. But it was rythmically dropping debrit for the duration of at least a minute, every two seconds. This excited me! What was it dropping???? It was actually pretty scary too!! It went passed where we were and finally faded out into the sky like a campfire would go out. This object looked almost &quot;organic&quot;.

The video had no station ID on the screen. The camera was facing north, and the shuttle was approaching what looked like a jet trail, orange because of the hour.  As the shuttle dissapeared from view, I saw what looked like a &quot;rod&quot; move from the bottom right of the screen to the top and out of sight in about 3 or 4 frames. (slo-mo)  I thought it was a bird, until I saw a crow fly past the camera 4 or 5 seconds later in slo-mo, from right to left.  The bird took 10 to 15 frames to traverse the bottom of the screen.  It was no bird.  I&apos;ve seen photo&apos;s of this object before, it was definately one of those rod&apos;s.  No one else was looking at the screen at the time.  The video was shown nation wide, so it shouldnt be hard to find. A friend of mine says she saw something similar.  I dont know if was the exact same video, or another.  My description of the setting didnt match hers.((NUFORC Note:  We have received several similar reports of the black object, which moved across the screen very quickly, in 1-2 seconds.  We spoke with the photographer from the Albuquerque TV station, and he reports that when the video is slowed down, one can see a crow flying throught the field of view of the television camera.

But satellites do not stop and hover !Email report Received: March 15, 2003 Hello, I finally had a spare moment to find out who to tell about what I saw last December about a week and a half before Christmas.I live approx 17 Km north of Hazelton, B.C. And I was awakened by my dog barking by the south-facing glassdoor around 3:30am.  I took him out because he was going crazy.  I stood on the front porch and thought he had to do his duty.  Instead he stood by the bank barking into the sky.  I looked up more closely into the cold, clear, star-filled night.Then I saw a moving &quot;satellite&quot;.  It was traveling over the town of Hazelton heading west.  It was red, with a blinking white light.  The blinking light was steady at first blink, blink, blink.  Then it got irratic right over Hazelton and would skip a blink or two. I decided to grab the binoculars, and it looked too close to be a regular &quot;satellite&quot;, way up there as I have seen several times in the past.The time while I saw it throught the binoculars, it looked like a round ball or sphere and was predominantly a red glow about it.  And it appeared to have the white light blinking off to the side on the outside of the &quot;satellite&quot;.After passing over to the west of Hazelton, it then hovered above what I think was Kispiox Village just north of Hazelton.  It is just 4 Km south of my porch view.  As it is a narrow valley, it then appeared to move up along the Hazelton Mountain and north along the western side of the Kispiox Valley finally passing along the Kispiox Mountain.  Then from my view it disappeared, behind the tall pines around the house.I really thought it could be any regular &quot;satellite&quot; at the time, whether it be Canadian or US due to the security concerns of the past year.  And it could have been on its way to Alaska?

It was a nice clear morning above but off the coast to the east there was a giant thunder cloud looming.  There was a spectacular lightning show going on inside the clouds.  We watched for a few moments when I noticed a small black dot that seemed to hover just outside of the storm.  There were no visible lights coming from the craft.  I expected to see flashers if it was a plane or helicopter but there was nothing.  Just a black dot and it was far away, too far to tell what shape it was.  The black dot was slowly moving north to south with the dark grey cloud as a backdrop.  The black dot did not seem to be going away or coming toward us for it stayed constant.  Venus was very bright and just to the right of the clouds in the clear sky and served as a good refernce point for the objects direction of flight.  The object moved north to south until it appeared directly below venus then the object slowly changed direction and went straight up toward venus and then changed direction again moving from south to north in a perfect line with venus and hovering above the clouds, like it was observing the storm.  The object moved very slowly, so slow you really had to concentrate on the spot in the sky as it moved.  We watched for 15-20 minutes as the black dot moved from the backdrop of the cloud to the backdrop of the sunny sky.  If it was a plane it would have disappeared out of sight or flown over our heads, and I couldn&apos;t imagine a helicopter being much different except for its hovering ability.  this object did not get smaller or larger, but it was definately a long way away.

Best Wishes------------ ((name deleted))#2Dear Mr. ((name deleted)), Thank you for the prompt response. Based on your description of the &quot;object,&quot; combined with the new information you provide below, I suspect that you were observing a shadow cast by your aircraft, and the presumably short contrail generated behind it.  I doubt that a sub-marine &quot;UFO&quot; would track your aircraft over several hundreds of miles.   Also, you may have observed a bright spot at the head of the elongate image you saw.  Is that the case, by any chance?  Thank you for the added information.  We probably will post your report, but we will qualify the object as a probable non-UFO. Cordially, Peter Davenport((END))((RESPONSE FROM WITNESS))Dear Peter,               With reference to your reply,for which I thank you.The proposal that the U.F.O. was a shadow from the plane does not seem to me to be the likely cause.The reason being that the plane was at cruising altitude.At 30,000 feet,I would have been surprised that any shadow from the plane could have been discerned on the ground.Also,please bear in mind that the shadow or whatever it was ,appeared to be a very dark grey in colour as if the source of the shadow was quite close to the sea.There were no bright spots anywhere on the shadow.I fully accept that there may be a perfectly sensible explanation for all this,but as yet I do not believe that we have found it.If you enter this case on your notice board I would not blame you in the slightest if you qualified it as a probable non-U.F.O.

I thought that there would be a cataclysmic event when this object impacted.I truly thought that this object was going to impact in the near vicinity. it disappeared out of my line of sight behind MT Samson (approx 950ft)which was about 2 -3 kilometres away.", "Huge black triangle travels quicklyThe witness who reported the sighting had just stepped outside to have a cigarette and said he noticed this &quot;thing&quot; out of the corner of his eye. The witness said the craft was seen just above the clouds after it broke into a clearing in the night sky. He described the object as being very large, black, triangular in shape with three points of light on each of the objects tips. Also noted about the object was that it moved very fast and was totally silent and went on to say he couldn&apos;t hear a thing. (no noise coming from the object) The craft was flying roughly east to west. (HBCC UFO Note: I asked if the witness might give me some kind of idea just how high the object was off the ground). Again he said it was just above the ceiling (cloud cover). He also went on to tell me that he had checked with the weather channel to see what the ceiling would have been and was told it was at approx: 11,000 feet. The object was seen just above the ceiling as it broke into the clear sky. (HBCC UFO Note: I wanted to get some kind of idea where the witness was located at the time, as I know the Coquitlam very well as this is where I grew up. He was located around the Coquitlam side, or shadow of Burnaby Mountain and said the object was seen somewhere close, or  flying over the 401 Freeway. He told me he was so shocked at what he was seeing, plus the size of it. The fellow said one could have placed or spread three jumbo jets into the object easily. The object was witnessed for approx: 3 to 4 seconds in total.

Do you have any record of this that covers the period somewhere between 1990 to 1992. It was during the month of Sept., Oct.,or Nov..I can&apos;t recall the exact date. Well anyway, a friend and I were outside our place of work talking about the beautiful night and all the stars you could see. It was one of those cold and clear fall nights with no moon or clouds in the sky.I said to my friend, &quot;What in the hell is that?-Do you see that?&quot;. She was just as amazed as I was! I thought I was seeing things, but the objects were so defined, distinct and visibly clear. They were triangular shaped with a strange bluish color on each of its three perimeters, and dark in the interior area space.We did not hear any sound. They were seemingly at a very high altitude and moving in very random and rapid directions, with instantaneous change in directions. Almost like they were playing some sort of game or something? I have no idea what they were? I&apos;ve told several people over the years and of course they think I&apos;m nuts. That never bothered me because I would&apos;ve thought the same of someone else, if I had never experienced what I saw. So I figured its our own little secret. I&apos;m no UFO nut or anything, but every now and then I go check out some web-sites because of my curiosity. What I am seeing is more and more depictions of sightings that are very similar to what we saw that one evening.Which makes me feel better and somewhat in AWE! So I came upon your web-site today and decided to send this in to see if you have any record of other witnesses with similar reports from that time period. Or if you do not, is there any other organization or site where I could research this?((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It began to move in a straight line then veered to the left and cut back to the righ again.  Then it went in circles.  This has been observed for the two conecutive evenings as well.  Through a telescope smaller lights could be seen around the brightest.  There were also two beams of light the source was not readily identifiable.", "I was driving on a road in a wooded area just outside of Portland Maine with my girlfriend, when we both observed strange and unusual lights in the sky just of the road. The lights were on an object like I have never seen before in my life hovring in the sky. There was three bright lights with one light on each corner of what ever it was, making the shape of what appeared to look like a triangle. I pulled my vehicle over to the side of the road to observe it futher. I witnessed this for about 5 minutes the object had no sound what so ever and thought this to be very strange. I&apos;m also aware of a military base in the area and it could be possible that they were testing something. Did you receive any other reports like mine.", "The three craft where flying with very little sound,  low and slow.This observation involved 3 aircraft while walking from my car to the house. From the east and also the direction of Ft Jackson I observed 3 groupings of lights in perfect formation, flying very slow at an altitude of approx 1500 ft with only the faintest stir of jet engines.All 3 had several bright landing type lights on and were super quiet for the slow speed and altitude. Just before approaching my location all three begain a perfect 90 degree right turn. As they rolled I noticed the plane closest to me banking and its wings had the normal light formation of green-right red-left as did the plane on the far side but the craft in the middle was different. It had green lights in the front and the back with what looked like a line of white lights from nose to tail similar to an airliner with cabin lights on. I could not make out any shape but also could not percieve any roll or change of the lights as would have occured in banking and leveling from a greater than standard rate 90 degree turn.  Also, I work at an airport so I know approach speeds and all three of these were traveling amazingly slow and quiet and also away from Metro. You will probably note that this was the same time as the code orange situation.", "Three bright lights observed hovering over Skykomish River in Gold Bar, WAAt 9:50 p.m. I was sitting on the couch by the large picture window and saw 3 lights at tree top level traveling up the river in front of the house.  They were about 1000 feet down river from me.  I jumped up and went to the sliding glass doors and opened them. As the craft traveled the 1,000 feet from where I first spotted it to in front of the house, it descended from tree top level to about 50 feet above the river. When it got right in front of me, the lights disappeared.   There was no sound and I couldn&apos;t tell if the craft went under water or just turned the lights off and flew off.   The length of the craft was about 80 feet, with one light at the front, one in the middle and one at the end.  It was a long, tube or cigar shaped craft.  It was too dark to tell if there were any wings or other portions protruding from it.  A companion heard a helicopter flying overhead about an hour later, which is unusual, since we are in a very remote area.

It was too early in the evening to be a star but that&apos;s exactly what it looked like. At first I thought it was a reflection of an aircraft as it was a bright evening but it suddenly disapeared and a minute later reappeared in a slightly different location.

As I came out of the tunnel into the city I turned around to see if it had crashed, and saw instead a large triangular craft with many lights on the bottom flying very slowly and low over homes. It was flying slow for a craft of its size. I couldn&apos;t stop to get a better look, since I was on the freeway. When I turned my head again I couldn&apos;t find it anymore from the night sky.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at considerable length, and she seemed quite serious-minded, and quite credible.

The reason I noticed the star was that it was a really bright star and I had not noticed it before.  Seconds after I had pointed at the star it had turned into a saucer shaped object.  It took me a second to take in the infomation I had just seen.  It was a small flying object with lots of little colorful lights.  Within seconds fire was shooting out of the bottom of the saucer propelling it upward.  I had seen a lot of UFO television shows and I ran like hell for the house because of fear.  That was the last I had seen of the object.  My friend remained to watch it, but I cannot recall what he said.  I have seen or heard nothing of it since.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I then looked to my immediate right and saw an immense ufo hovering over the tree tops. It appeared to be about 50 yds. or more in diameter and was oval in shape. It seemed to be made of a shiny metal similiar to aluminum. The craft was very luminous. The object just sat there,no noise or any sounds. I looked for approximately five minutes and left. I looked backward to see if it was still there but it had vanished. My feelings were that they wanted me to see the craft. It was so close that I could have hit it with a rock.

While my scout platoon was in the desert at fort irwin ca on a training exercise I beleive we witnessed a ufo. Here&apos;s what I remember, about 2 am in the morning we were conducting a screen line waiting for an attack to come from the other unit that was in the box ie training area and we reported a light (helicopter) inbound about 500ft above the ground and roughly 5 miles out. we viewed this with night vision goggles. it continued in bound heading north, within a couple of minutes another scout vehicle reported contact with it. we all just kept looking at it because we thought it was a helicopter bringing in the enemy somewhere. A minute or so later another light and reported it as another helicopter was on the same path and heading in the same direction a few seconds after that we reported one more light(helicopter). so now we had three of them and at least one other scout vehicle was seeing the same thing and tracking it as well.Within a couple of minutes the lead copter went directly up in the air about  and the sky got brighter, really brighter, all this was happening about 5 miles from my position but it got so bright that you could see the change without your night vision goggles. we reported to the commander at the toc that we beleived a helo just exploded and we had a real world emergency. now all the scout vehicles could see the sky getting way brighter. I mean really bright and it was staying that way not like a firecracker but like a slow build to brightness. not daylight but definatly noticeable. We were rasing hell on the radio with the toc telling them to check with bluefor and see if they had a helicopter go down and we were looking for red stars which would signal a real world emergency. we saw none. after alot of radio chatter between the toc and us they said it was not a helicopter but they would investigate it. so for about an hr we watched the sky get really bright and the start to dim out and basically didnt do our mission any more but talked on the radio about what was going on. finally the toc told us that a missle from one of the airforce bases went awry and they had to self destruct it so thats what the lights were. about 1 hr later we saw orange lights moving in the desert floor like a fireball moving really fast. like it was racing up and down the floor in a super fast car. this also happened about 3-5 miles from my position but others saw it as well. the toc thought my entire platoon was nuts but we all saw it. finally the orange light went out and nothing else happened. after the mission ended a day or so later we all asked what was up and were told the missle story but no reference to the orange light other than special forces were supposedly in the area and may have been doing something. no special forces could have done what I saw. they had to have been driving on the desert floor 2000 miles an hr. after the first helicopter blew up or missle or whatever it was, the other lights just kept moving north and eventually went out of view. I truly believe I saw something and not what the army said it was.((NUFORC Note:  Date of event is approximate.

It took off, maybe 300-400 ft above my house and I watched it hover until i couldn&apos;t see it through the bay windows anymore.

Dancing means that this object maneuvered qucikly left and right, at one point appearing to backup.  As best I could tell there was no sound.  I called my wife outside and she witnessed a more subdued motion as the pulsating light moved over the house and continued northward.  The size of the object was not readily determined - close and small or far and large - but the strobascopic nature of the light reminded me of an episode on Discovery - a light powered disk (laser pulses for propulsion).  The craft however must have flown a considerable distance, even if it was small and close.  The movements were quciker than any plane I&apos;ve ever seen and the path was erratic and to the best of my knowledge beyonf the scope of any publicly known aircraft.  The fact that there were no military planes scrambled or pursuing this &quot;craft&quot; made me think that it was some sort of military machine.", "Caught on video, another object in the skyI videotaped, on my camcorder, an object on April 10th, and had submitted a report pertaining to this. The next day I went to the same location and videotaped another object. There was also another person with me viewing the object. I was alittle startled to see another object in the sky so when I took my eyes away to place them on the viewfinder of the camera I had difficultly relocating it. My friend was talking to me with his back to the object. I told him to look around and tell me if he sees what I was seeing. He said he did. We were looking west, towards the Pacific Ocean. I was about in the same vicinity as the one I had seen yesterday, but it looked very differant. It was a white cylindrical object in straight horizontal flight. I was traveling very slowly. We followed it for about 2 minutes until it went behind a dark cloud. I estimated the object to be about 5000 feet altitude and possibly 25-30 miles away. I estimate the distance because I can see Cucamonga Peak to the north, which is about 24 miles away. To the left I have a range of mountains which house some communication towers and I found that the peak they are situated on are about 5600 feet in altitude. When I reviewed my videotape,I didn&apos;t see the object which my friend and I were seeing. I did have the audio with descriptions of the sighting being heard. I was disappointed not having captured the object. However I reviewed the tape just recently and I was surprised to notice the object was captured for a brief moment. I see a bright object flash and then quickly dart upward and stop. This was the craft I had seen before it initiated a straight horizontal flight pattern. At this point the sighting was documented by audio means. I had seen two objects on the 10th and the 11th, at the same location, at approxiamately 7:15PM.

It looked like a searchlight. The object just hovered on one place for a while. when we passed it, it moved in a circular movement across the road behind us.

She told me that the red light was flying just over the top of China Nose Mountain. Actually a one point from her location, she watched the light fly over the tops of the mountains, but she claims that when it almost reached China Nose Mountain it rose up rather quickly to get over the peak and continued on at the same altitude after rising up to get over China Nose until she lost sight of it. This sighting lasted approx: 5 to 6 seconds. Just a dot of red light.

The Bulkley River and a lot of farm land is below in the valley. I did some quick checking and as far as I know, no flights would have been around that area at that time. If it was a small personal aircraft the person flying it would have been crazy to fly in that area, or  to be honest any other area around here at this time of night and flying so low. So what this was, is anyone&apos;s guess. Mind you I have had a number of reports just like this coming from local residents over the past years. One other comment I will make on this report. Due to the view she would have had when she first saw it, the light had to have moving at a extremly fast rate of speed. The view of the mountains she was looking toward, you can see for miles and miles from her location on the highway. I would certainly rule out a small aircraft in this case.

I walked over to where it was loudest, and it was coming from this short grove of trees in the back of my grandmothers house. I just kept walking until I heard it start to get really loud. I looked up and saw a...how should I describe it...purple like blue glow above the trees. By now I was PRETTY scared, and I started reciting a couple prayers from the bible. Then this circular craft came out of the trees, and just hovered there, and it had these purple designs around the top of the dome. They were formed in circles with lines coming out of the sides, and they were just, glowing. But they didn&apos;t glow normally, they were sort of, pulsating, like blood in our vains, purple colors. It was really wierd. The, this light sort of skimmed across the whole craft, like the sun reflecting of of metal, and when it left, the craft justtook off, slow at first, then fast. I just watched it until it wasn&apos;t visible anymore. The craft was, I&apos;m guessing, ABOUT maybe thirty feet in diameter, with the designs on the sides, and it looked like it was made of a really shiny metal, and the pulsating purple was like a design or a date or something on it.

Suddenly, there appeared this strange craft, (I swear it had the appearance of  NCG-1701 &apos;Star Trek&apos;). I say suddenly because &apos;poof&apos; - there it was where there had just been empty night sky. The ship&apos;s forward area (the round construction) was glowing a fuzzy lime green, while the rest of the ship seemed dark - that is, no lights were noticed on the periphery. I would estimate that the size of this thing was very large, in that if  I held my hand at arm&apos;s length, the object would almost have filled in the space of 4 fingers (thumb tucked). Unfortunately, the sighting lasted for less than 5 seconds because it just as suddenly disappeared -- &apos;poof&apos;-- again.The craft flew in a northerly direction (direction San Francisco) extremely fast, faster than a normal jet on approach to SFO. I would estimate that this craft was approximately 6-8 miles away, and flying between 3,000 to 5,000 feet over the baylands or Bay. I have a good feel for this as we live on the flight path into SFO, on what the controllers call the &quot;Peninsula&quot; approach. That is, jets are vectored over the Peninsula from the SW, flying over Palo Alto at between 3K-5K feet. However, after 11:00 pm, jets usually vector out over the Bay, staying away from the Peninsula area.  (See http://www.uproar.org/cached/SFChron.8.6.98.html for the whole article.) I thought later that the green I saw on the craft might have been regular starboard/port side lights, but that made no sense as the side that was facing me was the left of the craft (I assume) and therefore the light should have been red. But in any case, the fuzzy greenish light enveloped the whole front section of the craft&apos;s construction - the round part.Career wise, I am a professional secretary and hobby wise, a percussionist. I am trained to observe and memorize details. I hope that other people on the Peninsula saw this brief passing of the strange greenish glowing craft and will report it as well. No need to contact me.

I was at the balcony of a penthouse, with almost complete view of Copacabana sky, talking by phone with my girlfriend, who was at home. As we spoke, I was gazing at the sky, looking to nowhere, when my attention was caught by something I thought was a reddish planet (Mercury, I thought) or star, at aprox. 35 deg. high. It was a crystal clear night, no refraction due to polution nor clouds. About ten seconds later the star&apos;s color turned to a bright white, and I turned my full focus to it. A friend of mine was a few meters away from me and I urged him to look up and watch the scene. Few seconds later, the star began to blink at a constant rate (2 or 3 blinks per second). Immediatly another light source -- localized at a some -120 deg. angle relative to the first one and close to it (from my viewpoint, a finger width at full arm length) -- began blinking at the same rate, but kind of alternating the phases. Seconds later tiny glitters, almost invisible, appeared in the space between them. When +- 40 seconds had elapsed from the &quot;whitening&quot; of the first star, the second one suddenly disappeared, and less than 5 seconds later the first one glowed a little bit brighter and vanished. Almost all the time the two stars stood still. The two light sources were definitely no baloons nor low atmosphere gears -- we were sure they were located way far at space. If they didn&apos;t blink they would look like ordinary and common stars, just a bit brighter than the others. BTW, as I was talking to my girlfriend I told her to go to the window (she lives some 15 blocks far from where I was, and also facing Copacabana beach) and try to see what I was seeing; she confirmed, having seen about the second half of the 45 seconds show, as we talked.", "Incredibly fast green light traveling North to South, on several occasionsI witnessed a bright green light, with a short tail, transit north to south at incredible speed.

But on the rightside, looking past the mirror, through my windowshield I saw two red lights(in a horizontal line), crossing the highway from the east to the southwest. I did not think much of it at first but a second later there was a third light, which was going on and of in a white/green flash. That is when I realized the craft had a triangler shape. I shouted to my brother that there was a UFO. We got all excited and we could not believe our eyes. We thought we were kidding ourselves as we had just seen X-men 2. The craft hoovered over the highway from the east to the west. The red lights were not flashing therefore we knew it was not a helicopter. It hung over and open field for a while (a minute or so) and than sped off. I got off the highway and started following it. My brother rang my dad on the cellphone and my dad said that the camera was still in the booth of the car. I stopped the car and got the camera out. By the time my brother was recording it, it was already far away. On the recording, which is 20 seconds, you can only see one red light as a dot in the night sky. We knew it had to be a UFO because of the shape of it. It was a bit like a helicopter but it could not have been, because it was flying at such a height that a helicopter would have looked bigger, and there was no sound coming from the aircraft.

It flew straight in my direction and it flew very fast. I could see that it was grayish white in color with no discernable apparatus on the craft itself as it was very smooth, almost luminous. I heard no sound coming from the object. It flew east to west direction, coming from the direction of the water to the direction of the land. It flew either so fast I could not follow it&apos;s full trajectory and/or I also had a sense that it may have simply appeared (from where?), flew over me, then disappered (to where?). I know that what I saw was not a plane (no visable tail, wings or nose present on object), nor did I see a bird (it was close enough to me that i could discern that). Since it was a daylight sighting, I can state that it did move so, it was not a planet or a star. I thought maybe a satellite but talking with a friend, we decided probably not.

I noticed an object about the size of a small car floating in the air over the river &ndash; I&rsquo;m not sure of the altitude, but it was a little less than twice as high as the bridge, at least from my perspective. It was moving to the left, in the direction of the wind, as I could tell from the flag in front of the courthouse across the street.  Although the wind was stiff, the object moved slowly in a controlled and deliberate manner, without the vagrant, flapping, unstable motion of, say, a plastic bag. Apparently, it made no sound. However, this hotel has windows that can&apos;t be opened, so that may not be verifiable. It was black and roughly triangular in shape. It was either changing shape in motion or rolling somehow.  I thought it was a kite or a paraglider someone was flying off the back of a boat, as it was following the course of the river. That theory was shattered when it continued over the bridge. Shortly afterwards, it deviated away from the river, and me, and dwindled away to an invisible speck in the distance. I&rsquo;m not claiming this was an aircraft or anything else, BTW. It was an UFO at least as far as I&rsquo;m concerned, if only for the simple fact that I could&rsquo;nt identify it. Perhaps there were other witnesses or an explanation of some kind.

When I saw 2 glowing, amber-colored lights out over the ocean. I pointed them out to my friends but they all just dismissed them as being planes. UNTIL...they started to get closer.One stayed behind, and the other started approaching the shore, where I was standing. It seemed to just glide right to me. I was so excited that I said to my friends, &quot;this is definately a ufo&quot;. After I had said this they all took notice and became very scared. It did not take long for the four of them to take off running towards the pier. The craft was about 500 ft offshore when it sent down some kind of light beam that lit up a boat that was anchored right in front of me. I was not the least bit worried for some reason.Once the light beam went off, the entire craft was no longer lit the orange-reddish glow that it was before. It looked as if it was reflecting it&apos;s surroundings.I could see the water and the sky&apos;s reflection on the craft. It hovered above me and I remember feeling as if I was reporting to headquarters, so to speak. My head was tilted back all the way I was looking up at this object telling whoever everything about myself. I have no idea why I was doing this. I was mesmerized. Then I felt like I was given a telepathic message or picture of them.It was 2 beings that were facing each other. They were very tall and dark. My memory of this picture is not very clear. I know I thought they seemed to be some kind of reptilian creature. I really can&apos;t say for sure if they were dark green or black, if they had scales or what. But I do know they had just introduced themselves to me. This introduction must have taken some time. My friends had already reached the pier which was very far from where I was. It was about a half an hour to walk that distance. After the encounter ended the craft just headed over the neighborhood, with no sound at all, it was lurking over certain houses, and I decided I needed to follow it. I ran back to where my friends were. There were Clearwater Police Officers at the pier who had also seen the object. They were all discussing what it could be when I showed up. I convinced a friend to come with me, and we followed this thing from Clearwater all the way to Tampa. It was so bizarre. When we were leaving the beach, watching this thing in the sky, was very eerie. It was as if time had stopped for me, like everything changed. My whole world had changed forever. There was not a cloud in the sky and we both followed it to the Courtney Campbell Causeway. Once we were side by side, it started to created a cloud or fog around it, so it became impossible to see it. After about 10 minutes the entire sky was just fog. So we ended the chase.Even though I wanted to try to find it still. I have had several more encounters with EBE crafts. Two years ago I went to Sedona, Arizona and I saw many in the sky at night. Also in Gulf Breeze and Panama City we have seen interesting lights that hover around like bugs? Buzzing back and forth. I do not want to be afraid of these things. But I really would really like to know what they are. This type of thing, people do not want to talk about. They will either think you are crazy for talking about it, or they just don&apos;t believe you.

It was a cloudless night with no wind. We were sitting on a concrete foundation connected to a warehouse just off the road about 60 or 70 feet from the railroad crossing watching cars slowly go across the double rail lines. We were hoping for a slow moving train to come by so we could throw rocks at the rail cars and see the sparks fly.

I had to point in the direction and he saw what I was talking about. We just watched as it approached about 30 degrees above the horizon and that was when we realized it was a moving solid object. It had no lights at all and actually was darker than the moonless sky. I remember saying to my cousin at that point, &quot;what is that&quot;? He said &quot;I don&apos;t know&quot;.

At this point it was only dimly lit but when it reached an altitude of what i guess would be about one thousand feet it became extremely bright white, almost silver in color, and hovered for a few seconds, then shot straight up into the sky.  I cannot even guess its&apos; speed or altitude at that point.  It then traveled in an arc, heading almost due south until i lost sight of it.  I waited and watched for several minutes, and to my surprise i saw it again, but this time it traveled south to north.  Again, i am unable to estimate its altitude or speed, but it only took the object about 5 seconds to travel from horizon to horizon.  The second sighting i had was almost exactly the same in detail as the first, but it took place on April 23rd and at roughly the same time and place.Tonight i was out sky watching when this sighting took place.  It was 9:45 PM (EST) in the evening.  The object was circular in shape, and brightly illuminated in white to silver.  When i first saw it i thought it was just an extremely bright star.  It was just above the tree line.  It slowly started moving higher up and across the sky.  This time it was traveling from south to north.  I ran in and got my binoculars and by the time i got back outside the object was near the center of the sky.  It&apos;s travel was erratic to say the least.  It would start out with a zigzag motion then pause a second, then resume it&apos;s flight in a slight arc.  When i had the object in focus i could see that it was changing color and shape.  It would shift from silver white to orange then to blue and back to silver white.  What i was able to make out quite clearly was the fact that every time it shifted color it would also shift from a circular shape to an oval shape and then back.  It must have taken about 3 minutes to traverse the sky.  When it reached the tree line something appeared to separate from it and speed back across the sky in the opposite direction it had just traveled.  The object appeared to originate near the area of the nuclear Site.I have witnessed other sightings in the area, but these are the most significant.I can only speculate as to what they are.I am an engineer and am familiar with conventional aircraft, these are in no way conventional.Unfortunately the photographic equipment i have is rather limited.  I have attempted to get pictures of some of the objects using my digital but am unable to capture any useable images to date.  I have some short bits of footage on the camcorder but it too is not of a quality that would be of any use.", "appeared in one spot for 5 secs, then went away fast My Mum and me could see  far away since it was a clearIt was just a pure bright light and it sort of stayed in one spot for 5 seconds then speed off fairly fast. i couldn&apos;t make out a clear shape since the light inhibited that.

It was a clear, cloudless afternoon, when my mate noticed a single bright, cigar-shaped object in the sky.  It was dark grey in colour, with a bright white light (possible a reflection) along it&apos;s western side and made no audible noise.  As we are located in remote Western Australia, we don&apos;t get a lot of aircraft overhead, (besides our own planes that are easily recognisible) so we were quite bewildered.  The object appeared almost stationary, only just moving East across the sky for several minutes.  My mate went and got the digital camera, came back outside and took a photo of the object.  Shortly afterwards it just disappeared.", "I seen a bright, circle like object in the air, that disapeared as if it was getting higher.I was talking to my daughter, while talking on the phone, and i looked up and saw this bright light.

The object followed a near straight path from South to North about 1,000 ft. up and just off the Pacific coast.

I then yelled for my fiancee to look because he was looking to his right out the window. By time he had noticed it was about 75 feet ahead of us but drifting down with the hillside. There was no noise and it was moving at a very slow steady pace just right above the tree lines.It was a very very dark night the shape was hard to depict but we got the impression of a triangle shaped craft that was inspecting our vehicle from above. Just as the sighting in Carlise Pa, this craft appeared to have it&apos;s lights dimmed but one light look as if it was slightly dimmer, it wasn&apos;t the frontal light, it was the back right light. We watched it roll over the hill line and follow the trees/road. As it rolled down the hillside was when we could depict it&apos;s shape a little better, A very dark flat triangular shaped craft with 3 lights on the very bottom indented within in the material and dim as if behind a VERY thick glass. It didn&apos;t give off the impression as light from a light bulb, but of a sort of light like a butane lighter. There was another car that was about 200 yards ahead of us but as I slowed down they got further ahead, I am assuming this car had seen it also because the craft had followed the road. I tried to keep up with it but when the trees down at the bottom of the hill got fuller we lost it in the night.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Clear skies. Appearance of spheres were the same size, their being the size of a lower case &quot;o&quot; (from my viewpont)at the type-size of a &quot;10&quot; on Microsoft Word.  The spheres appeared as white but also illuminated uniformly from within--not as reflected light, no flashing light or lights.  The spheres did not glow. The two objects suddenly appeared in mid air literally out of the blue.  They did not appear from a point of origin moving from the west to the east.  Objects first appeared in the north/northeastern sky at a 2 o&apos;clock angle from Tucson International Airport, between Tucson Blvd. and Campbell Ave., and moved eastwardly.  The objects were not in any formation.  One sphere was higher in the sky and to the left of the lower sphere. I was waiting for my flight, looking out the north windows and saw an airliner about 30,000 to 35,000 feet up flying from the west to the east  The jet was at a more northeasterly point on its path when the two spheres appeared to pop out of the blue lower to and behind the airliner by two mountain peaks.  The spheres dropped down a bit, seemed to stay still for some seconds, and moving more slowly than the jet, also moved in an easterly path with the higher sphere disappearing about 30 seconds after fist notice. When these objects suddenly appeared, I was surprised at their spherical shape. The shape of the jet was clearly recognizable.  These objects were not recognizable as any known aircraft. I called over to a woman in the room to come see this, and she saw the two spheres, the jet, and the one sphere disappear and the jet fly out of her sight to the east with the second object also having disappeared before the jet was out of sight. This observer has lived in Tucson for 44 years and is familiar with the military and civilian aircraft in the skies, with clear skies the rule for Tucson, cloudy skies rare. These objects are the first unidentifiable flying objects or crafts that the observer has ever seen.((NUFORC Note:  The witness who submitted this report is well known to us, she has had considerable exposure to the subject of ufology, and we consider her to be unusually reliable.

It was about 40 feet from my balcony.  I&apos;m sorry guys.((NUFORC Note:  NUFORC has received several reports about the objects in the vicinity of Burbank, and many claims as to what they are.

These objects were seen in the area of the Limerick/Pottstown airport, but did not look like conventional aircraft, balloons, etc.  There was a round object, with small round formations attached to the bottom of it.  Surrounding the bottom area of this object were smaller, round black &quot;dots&quot; (like bees around a hive). All seemed to be moving slowly, and in unison, across the sky. By the time I ran over to my daughter(age 13) to get her attention, the group of objects seemed to disappear, leaving only one craft.  It was primarily black, but with a yellow corona around the bottom.  My daughter saw only one object, which she said looked silver to her, with a yellow glow.  The one object slowly continued across the sky, than hovered for a brief time (roughly 20 seconds).  It then disappeared completely.", "Northern British Columbia Glowing Sphere In 3 Communities witnessed by 5 people.Houston, Quick &amp; Telkwa  Date: April 24, 2003 Time: (starting at 10:55 p.m.) Local &amp; Toll Free UFO Hotline Witnesses - 5  A little background on a sighting from July 29, 2002 first. The reason I brought up this shortened report again is, why so many sightings being seen around these areas. Military or government testing?, or a natural phenomena, or something else ! (Unknown). And there is certainly something taking place around here. Last year over the Houston, Quick and Telkwa skies we had a rather large sighting which still has me baffled. As I and the Smithers Interior newspaper reported on the sighting after it happened, I soon found out that the story was growing by the day. The week after the sighting on July 29, 2002 if seems &quot;dozens, upon dozens&quot; of northern resident here in Houston, Telkwa and Smithers were witnessing military vehicles which were traveling highway #16 and on the back roads throughout the areas. Also I found it more than strange to find out a large amount of fixed winged aircraft and helicopters were flying so very low all around these communities, and keeping their flights at a very low level. Even I witnessed large transport aircraft flying back and forth from the north to the south. After a night out for dinner at a close friends home, I arrived home to find two messages on my answer machine informing me that there was a great deal of aircraft activity taking place some 80 kilometers out the Morice River Road. (in the middle of no where). I was to meet up with one of the fellows who contacted me. So at 3:00 a.m. I took a trip in his logging truck so he could show me what he was talking about. Sure enough, just after 4:00 a.m. and still dark out, unknown lights were seen flying freely and low across the sky. In the opposite direction an aircraft was flying towards a light. After the two passed each other the &quot;aircraft&quot; made it&apos;s turn to follow the strange light. A full week, and longer, two different logging contracting crews who were working in two separate areas. (or cut blocks) had observed numerous aircraft flying low up the Morice Valley, and low over the mountain peaks. (just so you know this would be dangerous to say the least due to the rugged terrain, but there they were looking for something, so witnesses said. Or at least in their opinion, that&apos;s what they all thought was going on. Reports on the above sighting can be found at my website under British Columbia Sighting Reports. Houston, B.C. (just west of)   Now on April 24, 2003, starting at 10:55 p.m. two witnesses here in Houston, B.C. caught sight of a really interesting and strange light/object. At approx: 2 kilometers west of the town of Houston, just past the railway and highway #16 bridges these two folks saw in front of them a small glowing sphere shaped object almost sitting on highway #16 at the top of the hill they were about to head up. (HBCC UFO Note): To give you an better of where the witnesses were sitting when they spotted it. After traveling through Houston heading west, it is pretty flat ground with the Bulkley River winding along side the highway. At about 2 kms you would come to a blue bridge which crosses the Bulkley River, as one leaves the other end of the bridge you then start climbing a short, but steep hill heading in the direction of Quick, Telkwa and Smithers, B.C. The witness had just crossed the bridge when they caught sight of this light.)  As they headed up the hill, or approx; half ways up, the light disappeared from their line of sight. Once they arrived at the crest of the hill, again they noted the light moving north (away from them), and flying almost straight, following highway 16 at a low altitude. They told me that it was not much more than 80 to 100 feet off the road. The witnesses were at the time traveling at a speed of approx: 80 to 90 k&apos;s per hour and the object was slowly pulling a head of them. They lost sight of it once again just before the Irrigation Lake turn off. (or close). The only reason the object disappeared from their vision was due to the tree line. (Plus curves and hills in their view). It was the last time they saw the object. The total time that they observed the event was approx: 20 to 30 seconds. The description that was given of the object, was that it appeared to be completely round, glowing, or for maybe a better word - pulsating. It was about the size of a small digital satellite dish from the distance they had to view it. The object made no sudden movements, such as to the right or left, it stayed on a straight flight path. They also said because of the distance they were from the light, they said there was no sound heard coming from it. Also at one point the object seemed to light up the center roadway markings. (solid white reflective center lines). Thank you to the Houston residents for their welcomed report. Quick, B.C. (Woodmere Road just off Highway #16)  Date: April 24, 2003 Time: approx: 11:20 p.m. On April 24, 2003 a farmer and his son out tending their cattle on a dairy farm at Quick, British Columbia. Both also witnessed the same object, or it seems to be. The son was hauling out manure from the barn with their tractor when he gave out a yell for his Dad to come out and look. When the Dad came out his son was pointing toward the western edge of their farm, and sitting at a dead stop just over top a group of evergreen and poplar trees, was a bright ball of white/yellowish light. They said no sound could be heard from it. HBCC UFO asked for an approx: size to this object. The reply was that is may have been close to the size of a full pick-up truck. Or as close as the witnesses could estimate. The object/light was closer to the Quick residents than the people driving just outside of Houston, B.C. which would have given them a closer view of the object, and this is why it looked larger. (in my estimation)  The sighting lasted for approx: 10 to 15 seconds, before it started moving north towards the Telkwa/Smithers area. Both of these Quick residents lost sight of the light/object after it rose up slightly to get over a small hill in the distance. They said what ever it was seemed to take it&apos;s time and flew in a straight line to the west, but at a very low level before having to gain a little in altitude to make it over top a hill. ( I asked if any of the farm animals reacted to this event, both said no). Telkwa, B.C. (Object observed over Tyhee Lake)  Date: April 24, 2003 Time: approx: 11:45 p.m. A fellow who resides in the Telkwa area was on his way home, he left highway #16 and drove along the Telkwa High Road. Just has he was adjacent with Tyhee Lake Provincial Park he observed a ball of light flying &quot;erratically&quot; low over the lake. The witness said the light/object was moving quite quickly and reminded him if it was out of control when it first caught his attention. He stopped his vehicle to watch, and wondered what he was looking at. It was low enough that it did cast it&apos;s light onto the lake below it. The man said he heard no sound, but I was told he did remain in his vehicle as the &quot;thing&quot; flew up the lake, moving from side to side, up and down, until it reached almost half way up the lake, then it veered off to the northeast towards the Babine Lake Provincial Park (or towards  Granisle area) at a high rate of speed. (and clearing the mountain on the other side of the lake). He said is was so weird and all happened so fast, approx: 10 to 15 seconds at his guess. His estimation of the size of it was close to the size of a small car. The object was bright, and a off white in color.The witness said if it wasn&apos;t for his wife telling him to call me, he would not have known who to contact, or if he would as it was so strange and he thought, who would believe me anyway ??  HBCC UFO Note: When I did my weekly radio UFO update show this past Thursday I asked area residents to call or write if anyone else had seen this event. Also I keep getting asked, why are there so many reports of unknown sightings coming from the pacific northwest here in British Columbia. Of course my reply is, I really do not know !!! I know with all the media attention I do get here, UFOs are a topic of discussion in the Saw Mill lunch rooms, area businesses and private homes. So when something is seen flying through the skies in northwest British Columbia, there is a good chance I will receive a call or email. But I do know, just in Houston, B.C. where I live, there have been a great number of UFO sightings gone unreported as I hear about one darn near once a week through a second hand party. I do not report on any of these as I have not talked with the witnesses who actually seen the unusual sight. One more item I should also mention while I am here. I reported to you folks, and so did the media a while back on a major sighting which took place at Terrace, British Columbia, over Lake Elselake. Triangles had been seen flying low over, or around the lake. Finally I had a bit of a break through on this case and hope to have a full report on this soon. To be honest, I thought this may have been a hoax, but it is looking as if something really did take place over that area. What, well that is another question. PS - If any more information on the above Houston/Quick/Telkwa sightings come in, I will certainly post all new information on this case. Plus I will be adding maps and photos to this case when I upload the reports to my website.(There are no photos of the object in question, but rather area photos of the places the object was seen).

There is a nearby house closer to the base of the mountain, approximately a quarter mile from my mother&apos;s home. Other than that, the nearest house is about one mile away. The only access to this area is via one road, which passes by an abandoned quarry. We were hiking throughout the day, and as early evening approched we made a campfire at the end of the quarry, where the heavily wooded area begins, roughly two-thirds of a mile from the nearest paved road. We stayed there until it was all but completely dark, and headed back to my mother&apos;s home where my Jeep was parked. The road we walked on splits in two at this area, the left road going to the lower neighbor&apos;s house (a summer home for a married couple who are teachers) and the right fork leading to my moher&apos;s home. As we travelled to my mother&apos;s home one of us spotted a bright light moving through the trees near the house below us. It moved very erratically, swooping up and down, left and right, etc. We all began to look at the light and talk about what it could be, all the while moving closer to my mother&apos;s home. As we neared the house the light turned its attention towards us. It looked like a set of car headlights, only they were very bright and emitted no beam. The light was intensely bright but was easy on the eyes. The light maintained an elevation equal to ours, and the distance the light was off the ground is about thirty feet or so. This ruled out most things we could name it as being, and the fact that it made no noise and created no wind was beginning to intriugue us. We approched the house and stood in front of it, the light following and &quot;watching&quot; us the entire time. When we stood still, we noticed a second set of lights that appeared to the right of the first. At this time I noticed a third set of lights above the trees to my right, moving up and down the mountainside, appearing occasionally. Our attention was most! ly focus ed on the two sets of lights in front of us, &quot;inside&quot; a cluster of trees, about thirty feet ahead of us, if not closer. The lights hovered in place, but moved in an erratic pattern staying about two to three feet in one spot. It looked like it was peering from person to person, checking us out. We all had the feeling that this was unusually strange. The lights had a mesh-like covering. It was like looking at a huge set of diamonds that glowed brightly, mostly with a yellowish-white color. The lights began to move between the trees and appeared to be moving closer, bobbing left and right, but they were moving closer so slowly that you wouldn&apos;y notice them getting closer unless you stared at them. At this time we decided to move up to the deck surrounding the house, and I went into the house to check what time it was. It was 9PM. I went outside onto the deck and joined my friends, who were still watching the lights intently. We continued to watch the lights for about fifteen minutes. All of a sudden, the set of lights on the right shut off, as quick as a light switch. About a second later the set on the left shut off, but they shut off in two stages. This first stage decreased the brightness to about half, then they shut off completely. They also made a sound, they only sound they made that we heard, a sound similar to shutting off a circuit breaker switch. Before shutting off the left side lights angled slightly, the right-most lens being higher than the left. At that moment I said, &quot;If anyone wants to leave, just say the word&quot;. Two of my friends said yes, and I agreed. We walked quickly to the rear of the house, got into the Jeep, and as I put the key into the ignition I thought about people not being able to start a vehilce when nearby to something like this. Thankfully, it started and I turned on the lights, checked the time, which was 9:20PM, and began to drive slowly out the road. We all peered around the corner of the house, and one of us saw a set of lights streak into the sky straight up, at an in! credible rate of speed. I drove to the nearest public place, which was a retaraunt about two miles away. We got out, looked around at the tree line in the distance, and decided that we were going home to discuss it further. The following day one of my friends and I returned with cameras in hand, but found no trace of what we saw. The trees looked unharmed, there was no disturbance to the forest floor, and everything looked as it should. There isn&apos;t a day that goes by that I don&apos;t think about what I saw. We were all pretty freaked out about it at first, but I plan to spend more time this spring and summer up there...I hope to get some answers. My viewpoint on life and reality itself is now changed, and I need closure of some kind. I know that at least two of us will search for answers. Wish us luck.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "My brother and I were watching the stars when I noticed that there was something wrong. What looked to be a three stars in a triangular formation was moving across the sky at about the same pace as a satelite. They were very spread out...probably miles apart, but were moving the exact same speed. The space in between them was clear and we could see stars through it, so I know that there were three individual craft, not one craft with three lights. Also, we could tell that they were out of the earth&apos;s atmosphere because the sun was reflecting off of them, like it does on satelites. It seemed that they weren&apos;t shining their own lightsource. My brother and I had never seen anything like this before. We spotted them when they were about half way across the sky, and they were off of the horizon in about a minute.

Now after listening to what the witness had was reporting, I started thinking back to 2002 when I received a similar report from Terrace, B.C. Two witnesses, just about a 1/2 of a kilometer west of Terrace watched and extremely large object fly very low over the Skeena River. They said it was overcast that night when they saw this &quot;thing&quot;. What they reported seeing was a huge dark colored object in the shape of a cross. The witness I chatted with said the body of the object was certainly longer than, say the wing span. It moved very slowly, no sound what so ever coming from it and on the bottom of the object it looked as if there were panels of colored lights on these panels. These panels number some 6 in total. The witness also mentioned that they could not see how high, or  the thickness would have been to the body of this object. Just to dark, and with the colored lights being so bright on the bottom of it, it obscured the view to some degree. This sighting lasted approx: 8 to 9 seconds before they lost sight of it due to the tree line blocking their view. (HBCC UFO Note: I asked if he could give me an approx: size of this craft, he thought about it for a bit and said it might have been the size of a 737 jet airliner. I also asked if any of these colored lights on the object were flashing, he said no.  I don&apos;t know what to make of this one, but after going back reading a report from 2002 I received, it sounds like it may be close to what was reported to me last year. I haven&apos;t been able to talk to the second witness as of yet. I hope to, but no luck so far. Thank you to the witness for their report.((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Brian Vike, Director of the Houston, British Columbia, Canada UFO Research organization, for sharing this report.

It looked like it was a few hundred yards to the north of the highway we were driving on.  The shapes were a light yellow in color and didn&apos;t seem to move much, except that every time we lost sight of them whenever they reappeared, it seemed like they had moved with the car.

Sunnybrook Rd. area, but could be seen for miles.I was not the witness, but many of my close freinds were.  It was apparently over Sunnybrook Rd. when 2 seperate cars, each with 3-4 inhabitants, spotted a huge object moving across the sky.  The kights, as far as I can remember, were said to be light green.  The object itself was barely visible, its size was only known by the portion of the sky it blocked.  One car tried to follow the object, but sunnybrook ends by the interstate and they could only go so far.  At the same time, on the same day, 2 kids were skateboarding at the bank on Main Street in Hurricane when they saw the same object.  They described what they saw, and it was in the same area.  There was no realation between the two groups of people.  I am not sure of the exact date or time, and the people who did see it were either too hysterical or too embarrassed to report anything.  The one thing that was most commonly used to dismiss this sighting was that it occurred on the night of a meteor shower, however, the object was around for too long, contained multiple lights, and was absolutely enourmous.

At this point we were probably no more than 7 or 8 miles away from it.  The object did not appear to move the entire distance we were watching it. As we got closer to the object it appeared to have several white lights and not just one anymore, which were extremely bright.  When we came right up beside it or what would be parallel to it, the object seemed to be hovering over a field and had what looked like a faint light protruding off one side of the object that resembled a spot light.  As we passed the object we turned to view it from our back window a bright red light flashed on the top of the object and one on the bottom, then after a minute or so the lights began to flash all around the bottom of the craft, which made it appear to be spinning.  We continued to watch when all the sudden the craft quickly crossed the highway to what would be the passengers side of the vehicle, and caught up with us instantly.  After a couple minutes the craft disappeared behind the trees no longer in our sight, after doing so there was a glow of light beyond the area it disappeared.Thats what we saw!", "In the winter months of 1958 on a clear winter night while looking at the southern cross, a star formation I now know is called the Crux I saw a small light no bigger than the pointy end of a pin travelling from half way between star Alpha Crux and Beta Crux, I lost sight of the light for about 20 to 30 seconds when it entered the star light of Beta Crux and caught sight of the light again when it reappeared. however the direction had changed and was now heading to Gemma Crux again as the light entered the starlight of Gemma Crux I lost sight of it for about 20 to 30 seconds when it did reappear it was now heading to Delta Crux as it entered the starlight of Delta Crux I again lost sight for about 20 to 30 seconds and again when the light reappeared it had changed direction once again the light was now going in a straight line to Epsilon Crux the same thing happened again as had happened before when the light entered the starlight of Epsilon Crux and when it reappeared it was heading to the centre of the star formation known as The Southern Cross (The Crux) the light got to a location approximately in a line from Alpha crux and Epsilon crux and then the light just went out. I am now 53 years old, I know what I saw as a child infact I reported this to the Sydney papers and for my trouble about two weeks later received a cheque in the mail for 1 Pound which in those days was a lot of money.I was also told at the time that other people had phoned in to report this event.I now know that the distance from earth to the stars and starting from the bottom Alpha Crux 321 light years Beta Crux 353 Light years Gamma Crux 88 light years Delta Crux 364 light years Epsilon Crux 228 light years  I would not blame you for sending this straight to the wast bin as I have in the past told people about this and been laughed at, and even today with age and logic even I can&apos;t comprehend the speed that this object must have been travailing at.The time taken for this event was around 45 minutes Kind   Regards ((name deleted)).Dear Mr. ((name deleted)),Thank you very much for the very interesting report.  We will post it  sometime in the near future.I would like to point out that just because the object appeared to be  traveling between the stars you cite, I don&apos;t think we can conclude that it was actually outside the Earth&apos;s atmosphere.  I readily admit that it would be unusual for an object in the atmosphere, or in proximity of our planet to coincide exactly with those stars, but I find it difficult to believe that the object was actually traveling between the stars you cite, and that it was also visible.Thank you very much for sharing the information with our Center!Cordially,  Peter Davenport((END CORRESPONDENCE))((RESPONSE FROM WITNESS))Peter, I fully understand your reasoning, at the time that I saw this light there had been 1,2 or 3, I think man made objects put into space I had seen these.This was not like that, the light was as bright as a star and as I said no bigger than the point of a pin. With age and knowing the distance of these stars from earth even I find it hard to believe.However I know what I saw, in the finish I was laying on my back watching this display.

Followed by weather phenomenon.My friends and I were vacationing in a farm in the state of S&atilde;o Paulo Brazil. The farm was located in a valley between two hills that were approximately 3 miles apart. The hills were covered with tall grass, shrubbery and a few scattered trees.the closest town was 15 miles away and the closest large city about 100 miles away.It was a clear, moonless night with very bright stars. We had a small pit fire burning and the a light in the living room inside the house. Otherwise there was no other light pollution. I was appreciating the clear sky and the quantity and clearness of the stars when I noticed a &quot;yo-yo&quot; shaped object appear from behind the hill to my right.I say &quot;yo-yo&quot; becuse it was disk shaped and I could see an indentation (as where the string in a yo-yo would go) mid-ship. The edge of the indentation and the edges of the disk were smooth (no right angles). I do not know how deep the indentation went because of the darkeness. The starlight accentuated the edges and flat surfaces of the craft. The bottom side of the craft had a depression (seen as a darker area from the rest of the craft, about 80% of the total size of the circumference). In this depression there were 3 red half-globes. These globes emitted a soft red glow (not like an incandescent lamp, but more like a soft phosphorescent luminesence). They light half-globes were not spinning or blinking. The top of the craft (I cannot say if it was placed in a similar depression as the red half-globes) had a single, larger milky white luminescent dome (it flattened, not a half-globe). This dome was evenly lit just like the red half-globes. There were no other markings or characteristics to be seen. The whole craft was about 30 feet across and about 10 high (not considering the white dome on top. The red lights did not sem to extend past the depression where they were placed). The craft was smooth and the best explanation as to its texture would be that of brushed aluminum, but without the bright shine. It was dark grey (if it was colored).The craft came from behind the hill on my right. That was about 100 to 200 feet high. It traversed the Valley in about 5 minutes and, at the closest point, it was about 2 football fields away from our position. There was no wind and it flew a straight path at an even pace. There was no noise or any other type of disturbance. Had we not seen it, it could have flown by wihtout any of us noticing it. Unlike in the movies, we did not loose any power in the house or experienced any kind of strange sensations.The only extraordinary phenomena (besides the sighting) was the fog that followed the craft after its passage. The craft took about 5 minutes to travel the distance between the two hills. About 2 minutes after it had disappeared a &quot;wave&quot; of fog came from the hill were the craft had originally come from. The fog covered the valley within 10 minutes. Although the conditions seem to be right for that kind of weather (cool, clear nights after sunny warm days), that was the only time in our 4-day stay when we had fog.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It seemed to be internally illuminated with segments of red, yellow and green light which were spinning slowly clockwise. I estimated its size as about forty feet. As I watched, it suddenly turned bright white and simultaneously shot off to the North at a speed of around 600 knots.

We heard no more that night. The next morning I went back to the base to file a report, as we were required to in those days. No one ever contacted me about the report. Then I read an item in that day&apos;s Washington Post about a false report of a crash.

Minutes after the report, 28 state police cruisers, an additional 11 Park Police units and dozens of fire and rescue squads from eight counties joined in the search. The report originated with a caretaker at the Womens&apos; Reformatory at Jessup.

I was simply incredulous! It was such a beautiful and graceful display! They were too perfect and perhaps coordinated to seem anything but choreographed. I did not hear a thing. It never occurred to me to stop. I just kept on driving and eventually they were &quot;just gone.&quot; To this day, no one has taken me seriously. I know what I saw though.

It was clearly not a type of craft ever seen by either of us before.", "Two bright reddish lights appearing horizontally in the night sky off the coast of Gran Canaria repaced 2 or 3 times by similar objectsLooking westward from Playa Del Cura, 2 reddish lights were hanging at the same level above the sea.(Too high to be lights on the mast of a ship )These were illuminating the sea below to such an extent that we could see the horizon.These lights stayed as they were for 5-10 minutes, then another light appeared in a random position above them, then another, and these replaced the existing lights as the other 2 faded from sight.This happened 2 -3 times over the next 20-30 minutes then completely disappeared not to be seen again during the duration of our holiday.I am a designer and my wife is a university secretary.

It made no noise. I tried to grab it and it moved so fast to avoid me you couldn&apos;t see it. Then it hovered again seeemingly just watching us. So I tried a couple more times to catch it and it kept moving away then it would stop and hover as if it was a game. Then after about 5 minutes it took off straight up and out of our sight.

Please see their website at http://www.mufonga.org/   PD)) Investigation of multiple unknown objects by MUFON of GeorgiaThis case was investigated by MUFON of Georgia beginning on 10Sept01, culminating with on-site interviews on 15Sept01, and with subsequent witness contacts thereafter. The investigative team consisted of this writer, Tom Sheets, State Director for MUFON of Georgia and retired Chief of Police, and MUFONGA&apos;s George Lainhart, a Police SWAT Rifle Marksman, who served with this writer during past years in law enforcement. INVESTIGATION  On 8Sept01, this writer received a call from a former witness and reliable source of information located in Murray County (north) Georgia.  The source indicated that a friend of his family living in central Georgia had phoned a mutual acquaintance and described an unusual event experienced by his family during mid-June. Apparently the witness wanted to vent the experience, but was unsure of what group might be available for such action. This writer obtained the ID information and established contact with the witness that evening, scheduling an interview and event site inspection for 15Sept01.  Two evenings later, and several days before the planned sit-down, the Primary Witness (PW), contacted this writer and stated that he thought that the unknown objects had returned, but were much further away, and that he was trying to watch them through binoculars. This writer proceeded to the PW&apos;s home, about a 1+ hour journey.  Upon arrival, the PW stated that the objects had departed before my arrival.  A surveillance of the area was conducted until 3AM with negative results. (Event Location------500+ acre tract of land consisting of woods and fields with the Chattahoochee River as the eastern boundry. Home of PW is a former antebellum plantation house in excellent condition, sitting up on a prominent rise overlooking the tract to the N, NE, and E. The PW is the resident care taker of this property for a well known Georgia political/business family.)  The interview(s) took place on 15Sept in the PW&apos;s home. PW indicated that on or about 15June01 at about 10:30PM, his 18YOA son came into the bedroom and stated that something was going on, that there was a strange craft over the property that had lit up the house and surrounding area. (Clear, mild weather).  The PW said he went outside into the front yard and observed what appeared to be a glowing oblong object off to the NE hovering just over the trees near the river at what he thought was about 500 yards distant.  (Due to what happened later, PW described this initial location as the 2 o&apos;clock position). He stated that he got his binoculars and looked and rather than seeing just a glowing object, he observed what appeared to be a ring of red and white lights around a center line, the white lights VERY BRIGHT, with the red lights blinking in sequence around the object. The PW stated that at this &quot;2 o&apos;clock&quot; position, the object seemed to be about 1/2 inch long at arms&apos;s length, and it appeared to illuminate the tree tops in that vicinity. At that point, the other family members came outside. PW then took his large high candlepower spotlight used for night fishing on the river and shined the beam toward the object, receiving a dramatic reaction.  PW said that the object immediately flew SW (more or less toward them at an angle) at an incredible speed and stopped to hover over a large lone tree in the front pasture or field. PW described this second location as the &quot;10 o&apos;clock&quot; position, indicating (when asked) that it appeared to be about 2 inches long at arm&apos;s length at that time. (Estimations were made using a ruler provided by this FI).  At this closer location, the PW stated he was able to determine that there was apparently some solid structure behind the lights, appearing to be a dull gray as near as he could make out, like one of the old DeLorean sports cars or a Greyhound bus.  Shortly thereafter, six additional similar craft appeared with the first and began flying and zipping around the LARGE tract of land, faster, then slower, but never again with ! the incredible speed first noticed. PW added that at one time, three objects were stacked up in a hover, one above the other.  This display continued with no sound and at relatively low altitude for about 30 minutes, then suddenly all of the craft simultaneously vanished. Interviews were conducted with the 18YOA son, 14YOA son, and the wife of the PW.  The fifth witness, the daughter-in-law, was not available. Their statements were similar to the account of the PW, with only enough difference to indicate that the secondary witnesses were being spontaneous i.e. seemingly NOT having &quot;cooked up&quot; their accounts. Example;  18YOA witness noticing that four of the objects were side by side before vanishing; 14YOA witness disagreeing, stating that the red lights his father had observed on that night looked orange to him;  Wife of PW stated that she was more aware/fascinated of the mid-line lights, and that she became VERY upset about the episode, something totally outside of her experience......further indicating that she was very tired the next day, perhaps from being up late. (Side bar.......Several weeks before the events described herein, the PW stated that one of his friends, an advertsing exec and private pilot, had come for a visit. He camped out down by the river to check out potential fishing and deer hunting. The next morning as he packed up to leave, he laughingly accused the PW of sneaking down during the night and shining the big spotlight onto his tent to scare him.  The PW was sort of perplexed at that time, as he had done no such thing.  After the events of mid-June, the PW was no longer perplexed about that statement). Description of unknown objects;  Appearing oblong in more distant profile, but sort of lens shaped profile close up; dominating BRIGHT white lights, with less bright sequencing red lights, all along a mid-line; fuselage structure barely glimpsed behind the lights, dull gray;  apparent size appearing 1/2&quot; to 2&quot; at arms length due to changing distances from PW. MUFONGA&apos;s George Lainhart conducted an inspection of the land tract and noticed nothing out of the ordinary.  Lainhart also brought along his laser range finder used in his SWAT Marksman duties. George zeroed the trees near the river, the trees indicated by the PW as being 500 yards away (initial 2 o&apos;clock position of object), and found them to be 336 yards distant. He then zeroed the lone tree in the front pasture (the later 10 o&apos;clock position of object) and found it to be only 74 yards away from where the witnesses were standing. Using the mathematical process of computing the appx. length/width of an object AAL, measuring length of arm, hand from eye, distance to object and applying these measurements, the approximate size of the object at the 2 o&apos;clock position (336 yards) is estimated to be 18.66 feet long; from the 10 o&apos;clock position (74 yards) to be 16.44 feet.  A variance of 2.22 feet.  Of course, estimates by the PW were used to calculate this, and the body measurements could not be exact as if done in a lab, but we consider the resulting sizes to be in the right ball park.  During the interview, the PW had no time to calculate correct changing ratios of size from the object&apos;s two different positions/distances and the 2.22 foot difference is not out of line for estimations, and in this writer&apos;s opinion, indicates credibility. During detailed conversation, the PW was found to have grown up in the South Fulton County/South Metro Atlanta area where this writer served as a homicide detective and later Chief of Police.  It was discovered that this writer, while not knowing the PW personally, was acquainted with his other immediate family.  This writer recalls nothing that would indicate the PW was of a negative character or anything other than a hard working citizen, husband and father. These investigators later checked with the local &quot;beat cops&quot; and Sheriff&apos;s deputies in that area and found no citizen reports to law enforcement regarding similar recent events.  The FAA was not approached due to their 15 day recorded data process being exceeded.  There is a LARGE (!) power generating facility within one mile of this tract of land, and this type of facility MAY play an important part in some of the more dramatic UFO experiences reported by witnesses all around the country. Unfortunately, this plant was under HIGH LEVEL SECURITY LOCKDOWN due to the 11Sept01 terrorist attacks of four days previous.  This writer was not allowed access to the plant, being turned away.  Later calls to the facility security office were unsuccessful in developing further information. One further note regarding the PW.  His position as an employee of a Georgia political/business family of VIPs would be in extreme jeapardy if any unusual attention was drawn to that family holding.  This writer knows that family, and the matter was discussed with the PW, as he was concerned about the same thing.  I mention this as another reason I feel that he and his family were relating the truth in this matter.  The PW witness has not recontacted MUFONGA, and conversations in the weeks after the field investigation revealed no further activity in the area. This case report was originally posted to MUFON&apos;s World UFO Database (WUFOD).  MUFON of Georgia wishes to thank Peter Davenport, Director of the National UFO Reporting Center, for allowing us to share this investigation with the large number of researchers and citizens who depend on NUFORC for up to date information. Regards to all,  Tom Sheets, SD MUFONGA", "morphing object emitting pulsating lightsMy family and I were coming home from church late Friday night when my wife asked me what the light was in the sky.  We frequently see things in the sky around our home, so we stopped and watched it as we drove into the driveway.  It appeared as a bright star (larger than other stars in the sky), and it was emitting multicolored bursts of light (blue, green, red, and yellow).  It also appeared to be rotating.  We decided to go inside and get the binoculars and the digital camcorder.  The binoculars were no good, but the camcorder proved to be amazing.  I was able to zoom in on the object to get a better view.  Originally, it appeared as a bright light with a pulsating pink light in the center which would occasionally emit bursts of light in various directions.  For some reason, I got the idea to turn on the &quot;nightshot&quot; on the camera (which allows you to see in the dark).  When I did, the bright light changed, and I could see more detail.  It appeared as a rotating disk at first, and then it morphed into what appeard to be a jack (like you would see in a game of ball and jacks).  After morphing into the jack, the arms of the jack came together to make a sphere.  I got some very vivid video of the image((NUFORC Note:  We will invite the witness to forward some stills from the video, but we are suspicious that the witnesses may have been looking at the star, Sirius.

I saw what I ridiculously thought was a flock of geese flying in perfect formation but quickly realized that was not possible as it was night and the &quot;geese&quot; were actually white lights in a V or boomerang formation. There were maybe 25 lights in rows, like pave&apos; diamonds. (Possibly four rows.) The lights were white, no color, not pulsing or twinkling and no beams coming from them. They did not seem to be part of a large object and there was no discernible structure behind them. There is a huge supermarket below this spot and a lot of reflected light coming up in the sky and I think I could have seen a solid structure around it.

It was a block or two away, and it was up a bit higher than the treetops.       I stared at it believing it must be tethered to a used car lot or something, but it looked way stranger than anything like that; it actually looked like a fat flying saucer - almost like a little, tiny Saturn - however, it wasn&apos;t silver, it was covered with very bright lights, a light gold color.  The &quot;ring&quot; around it was also lit up and much smaller than anything in the old sci-fi movies of the fifties.

During the next several seconds while I&apos;d lost sight of it, I wondered whether maybe a blimp could have &quot;dressed up&quot; as a flying saucer for some kind of promotional.  When I saw it again, it was about a mile or two away traveling south.  There was no way a blimp moves that fast or has the shape that I saw.  It was perfectly round with a small ring around it and clearly was not tied to any structure.  Still riding in my car after a few foiled attempts to pull over, I lost sight of it completely.

Moves slow &amp; quiet.I realize this is almost twenty years later, but I was not aware of this database till now. I was driving home from a friends house in Patterson NY, and by the time I was coming down route 22 in to Brewster, I saw what looked like a long line of white &quot;Christmas lights&quot; in the sky, which took on more of an enormous &quot;V&quot; shape as I got closer to, and more underneath it. I pulled in to a supermarket parking lot to view it better, and to my amazement it was moving or &quot;drifting&quot; at maybe 1000 feet off the ground, with an amazing span that nearly crossed the sky North to South. It was moving (drifting) West to East, and made almost no sound. It was moving much slower than any conventional aircraft, and seemed to &quot;fade off&quot; behind the treeline at a certain point, at which the lights that had been small and piercing white became orange, then red as it got behind the trees. The altitude may have been less than I first thought on account of how quickly it became obscured in the trees at such a slow speed...almost &quot;setting&quot; into the forest line. I jumped in the car and followed it for a few miles to a resevoir where it eventually faded off behing the surrounding hills. I had nobody with me at the time, but in the parking lot I was going to point it out to others who were there, only to notice them already standing around and pointing to it. I didn&apos;t talk to them, as I thought it would be more interesting to &quot;chase&quot; it. Months later, I saw a similar phenomenon near Lake Peekskill, NY while driving, but it was further away. The second one had two small airplanes chasing after it. This one, too disappeared (floated) behind trees and hills. There was an article in the local paper around that time explaining that many had seen it; and they left a phone number for reports.

While we were returning from the chow hall after the evening meal was served we noticed bright orange glowing lights off to our left (towards the east near the arizona -california border) they seemed to just hover there.  My first thought was that they were helicopters but to my knowledge choppers can&apos;t stay on station that long and to just hover there seemingly motionless.  Even helicopters on station will move laterally to some degree these did not we heard no noises either. Due to the proximity to the Yuma weapons testing ground and other military installations in that area we assumed it was some type of new flares or something along those lines. but To my understanding flares don&apos;t stay up in the sky that long. I&apos;m not sure exactly about the exact month of this sighting.  Also if they were helicopters they would have been to close together in formation to just hover it would seem that their rotor blades would have colided with one another.  It was strange indeed and there were alot of us prisoners that saw this incident. We were not allowed to stay out side and watch them as long as we wanted to as we were being herded back into our buildings/cells but we witnessed them for at least 10 minutes or so and heard reports from other inmates as they returned back to the building so they had to have been out there for some time.

Sphere was a bright golden/yellow color, with the light source appearing to be from the object itself and not reflective light from the sun.

We were driving From Longview, WA to Sandpoint, ID on a snowboard trip and I was the passenger in the car.  I noticed a blurry blue/white object holding a position at high noon (high in the eastern sky).  I assume it had moved into that position rapidly, as I was startled into staring skyward suddenly.  I moved my head up and down and side to side rapidly to make sure that I was not seeing a reflection on the inside of the car&apos;s windshield.  I became startled and awed as the the object, a slightly pulsating butterfly/sphere held it&apos;s position for approximately 1.5 seconds.The driver, noticing my head movements, looked skyward at the object and said, &quot;Do you see that?&quot;  I resonded, &quot;Yes.&quot;  The objects size appeared to be massive.  It was about one-half the size of the moon.  It was behind a whispy cloud, and an electric blue light was visibly pulsating, much like the model atom I have seen with two electrons rapidly rotating around the nucleus.  The object appeared to be creating its own black cloud to shield the light I was seeing.I was deeply awed and scared at this point.The object spastically moved five degrees to the south, then northeast, then up to create a tight triangle type movement.  It then shaked spastically once again and flew away rapidly directly (west) over our heads.  I have never seen anything move like that.  I assume it should be impossible.I felt a keen sense that this object was observing me as I observed it.The moment I panicked and my heart jumped into my throat, was the same moment the object spastically moved and flew away.In order for that object, which moved away rapidly later, to hold its position it is safe to assume it was observing our car.  It was the only thing visibly moving at 3:50 am on a country highway.Both the driver and I have never witnessed anything like this object, ever.

It moved very slowly  while overhead and appeared to hover, although that could be its appearance as it moved directly away from us.  The feature was a large bright red light.  It approached from the west and moved slowly over head.  When it got farther east it appeared to hover, then move slightly north and then quickly move away and disappear. It diminished  like a fading red star.  IT was significantly larger to the human eye than Jupiter appeared  that night and while it was directly overhead, the red light was about the size of [an airliner at about 4000 feet altitude].  It was not possible to estimate the altitude of the object.  It was just smaller than the size of the moon that evening (about 1/2 full size moon).  The only discernable shape was the round red light.Unlike an airplane or helicopter to which you can tell a light is attached.We noticed that it made no sound.  There was no other sound or moving aircraft in the sky at the time.   There was no other air traffic in the sky until about 2230 hrs.

They also told me they both spent sometime trying to make up their minds if they should actually call me over what they saw.The first thing one of the fellows said to me was, &quot;my buddy and I saw something very weird the other day, and are still questioning ourselves over what we saw&quot;. He went on to say there was himself and his friend in his truck travelling along highway #16 just east from Houston, B.C. Since it is getting lighter earlier these days, the fellows witnesses this object in the daylight.Just before they got to Perow, there is a large farmers field which runs for a long way, and also runs along side the highway with a buffer of trees between the field and the highway. His friend was the passenger in the truck and first noticed a large object paralleling them along the highway. The driver looked at the speed they were travelling and said he was doing approx: 50 kilometers an hour. The distance between the witnesses and the object would have been approx: 300 to 400 feet. So they both had a very close up look at it. (keep in mind there were the trees in between the truck and object which did hinder the view at times). Also the field drops down somewhat below the highway, so the forestry workers did not get a good look at the bottom of this craft.They both described the object as looking like an &quot;Air Stream Trailer&quot;, and the size was close to the a Greyhound Bus. It was metallic in color, and no other features could be seen on it. No lights, windows, nothing !! The object stayed straight across from their truck as they drove along, as I mentioned above. It paced their veicle !! The passenger had rolled down the window to see if he was able to hear any sound coming from this object, but none was heard, it was silent. After approx: 3/4 quarters of a kilometer the craft turned slowly away from the highway, wobbled slightly, sped up, wobbled once again and then shot off out of sight very quickly.HBCC UFO Note: Since the object was so low, and on the other side of the standing trees, I asked if they had observed any moment in the trees. Such as any disturbance which would have moved the tress in anyway. None was noticed. Something else I should add. When the witnesses mentioned that is wobbled, one of the fellows said it was like looking through a heat wave, which gave it a look as if it was slightly wobbling. Also both of the man made comments to one another, saying it was so strange and not a normal aircraft as it had no wings on it&apos;s body. He also mentioned due to the type of work he is involved with he had made many trips on different aircraft, and what he and his friend saw was &quot;no&quot; aircraft they know of.  I am also going out tomorrow to grab some pictures of the area where the sighting took place. I hope to have some drawings and more information after I sit down and chat with the two witnesses over the weekend.

The front of the object was pointing downward. The object started to slowly propel from the left to the right. At times it would stop and just hover.

I observed 3 objects in the west I couldn&apos;t tell their size so I really couldn&apos;t tell how high they were.They were oval or round dificult to tell at the hight they were. I observed them till they left. It was like they were putting on an air show.They were in a triangle formation, the top one stayed still most the time. The left one moved the most. The right and left did all the different moves. After each one would get done w/ thier moves they would go right back into formation in the triangle. Once they were inthe triangle before they would move I could see they would rotate and lights would blink fast red , yellow, blue then it would move but once they were in motion they didn&apos;t do this. THEIR MOVEMENTS--- st. up/ st. down / change directions w/out stopping / circles / figure 8 / sideways R or L / stop abruptly then sit still. There was no noise. The speed was unreal we don&apos;t have anything today that can come close to the speed these had 17 yrs. ago or the movability. The area they covered was huge.The R one went out of site toward the west 1st then the L did the same while the top stayed, the top one never did any of the manuveres.

I was facing directly due East with the half to almost 3/4 moon brilliantly shining at an angle between 1 o&apos;clock and 2 o&apos;clock in the sky, and looking due south, the moon was brilliantly shining at an angle slightly beyond 12 o&apos;clock.  While looking directly due east, I noticed a large star like object between 22 degrees to 30 degrees above the eastern horizon, and the object appeared to be located near Navare or Fort Walton.  It was flickering like a star changing to different colors of red, green, and blue.  My first thoughts was UFO because the lights were changing in a timely color pattern.  I was wondering if I was the only person out of about a hundred people who were fishing on the bridge that night who may have seen what I saw, so I decided to briefly of less than one second to shined my flood spot light directly towards the object so people might notice the flood beam and gazes towards the direction I saw the object in the sky.  The floodlight&apos;s beam could not reach the object I saw in the sky.  Since the object didn&apos;t move and it appeared to be stationary, I decided that the object I was seeing was just a large star or planet since some stars or planets do flicker and shine similar in ways of the object I saw.  But the object just described is not the main reason why I wrote this account.  It is what happened briefly two to three minutes after shining the flood light at the object (star).  Still facing directly east, I notice another object coming directly from either the north or northeast at an angle of 45 degrees above the eastern horizon heading south.  This object appeared to be only 3 miles or less away from my position or 1/8 the distant from the fishing bridge to the midway bridge.  This object was also moving at the speed of a satellite and as bright as of the brightest of all satellites, bu! t this object seem very low in orbit for I seen satellite traversing the skies in the past.  But still this is not the main reason why I wrote this account.  What really caught my attention was the fact while I was watching what I thought was a satellite traversing the sky, the object&apos;s (satellite?) light just turned off like somebody flick the light switch to the off position once it past my two o&apos;clock angle.  The object&apos;s light just didn&apos;t dim and fade away like other satellites I seen in my past.  Just about 1 mile before entering Gulf Breeze area, this object just instantly stopped shining its lights.  I seen meteorite&apos;s in my past, and those meteorites had always  left behind what I call a trailing light.  The second object I saw didn&apos;t have this trailing light for like I said, it originally look like a satellite.  What occurred about 5 to 10 minutes after that event seems interesting too.  I saw three aircraft in the sky.  One aircraft was a passenger airliner landing at Pensacola&apos;s airport which seem to have zillions of lights on it.  The other two aircraft might have been military, and I know they were aircrafts because they had their identification lights flicking off and on.  Those two other aircrafts were zigzagging all over the skies as thou searching for something, but they never ventured into the area where I saw that second object where it just disappear in a blink of an eye after viewing it for at least 30 second to a minute.  Is it possible for satellites just to blink out or what I saw that night was truly a UFO cloaked as a satellite?  I don&apos;t look for UFO&apos;s, and I am somewhat skeptical about UFO&apos;s and of most reports of them, but the night I saw this event got me somewhat thinking of what type of object it was that I saw traversing the night skies.  Was it just a fluke incident of nature?  I guess I&apos;ll never know, and what I wrote is exactly what I saw on the night of April 12, 2003.", "Object in sky over Clermont, FLI am a dorm parent at a boarding school.  I had just gotten the girls down to bed and went outside to smoke a cig.  Looked up and had to look again, this light was stationary and had blinking lights on it.  Looked like red/orange, blue and white.  I went and got 2 of my students to make sure I wasn&apos;t seeing things.  They saw the same thing I did.  I got my camera, mount it on the trypod and took a few shots.  I have not gotten them developed yet. I&apos;m not sure how clear they are.  I took several shots with different time lapses.  The craft only moved slightly everyonce in a while, but kept blinking the whole time.  I unfortunately had to go into bed.

As we came up one of the main roads towards the motorway, I looked up into the sky and saw what looked like a blurred circle that seemed to be stationary. To avoid the traffic of the motorway, the driver decided to take the backroads, as we turned on to one of the backroads the blurred circle dissapeared from my view, I thought nothing of it. Around 10 minutes later I looked up at the sky again and saw not one blurred circle but now 2, they seemed to almost be &apos;dancing&apos; in the night sky. A couple of minutes later another blurred circle seemed to appear out of no where. Thinking that I was seeing things I called to the passanger in the front passanger seat (which is on the left side for the UK. I was seated in the left rear passanger seat) and told them to look out of their window. They looked out and they too saw the 3 circles moving in an almost figure 8 pattern in the night sky (all in a line, like follow the leader). We sat and watched them for a couple more minutes, then we told the other passanger and the driver. The other passanger leaned across and saw the circles as well.

We sat there watching them (except the driver, who was standing outside the car) for about another 10 minutes, then 1 of the 3 blurred circles (the one that was leading the figure 8 &apos;dance&apos;) dropped a smaller object that seemed to be &apos;sharper&apos; and brighter than the blurred circles (its shape was hard to tell from our distance, but I would say it looked cylinderical). Then suddenly out of no where a much larger blurred circle appeared, the 3 smaller blurred circles then appeared to &apos;enter&apos; the larger one, the larger blurred circle then dissapeared again.

When the helecopter vacated the area in a NE direction, the light disappeared at vast speed in a SE direction and disappeared. It not only stopped and observed helecopter, it made circular sweeps and right angled sweeps. It was impossible for it to be an aeroplane as the object was stationary when it was observing, and 2 it couldnt have been a helecopter as the right angled movements it made would not have been possible for this type of aircraft.This is the first time I have ever seen something like this , and to be honest it was a wierd experience. I genuinely hope it was &quot;something&quot; because it was facinating to watch it perform.A motor vehicle approached behind me down a well lit street and also looked up into the sky but did not stop. The car had 2 occupants in it, possible witnesses?? Dunno. When it vacated the air space, I can only describe it as &quot;bloody fast&quot; and silent. The light faded when it was a distance away.

Observers:   Me, ((name deleted)) &amp; my friend, ((name deleted)):  In Saturday evening around 9:00pm, March 22, 2003, my friend ((deleted)) and I went out to have a walk along the Southwest of Lake Alice. Because the sky was very clear in that evening and there were only a few lights around, it was perfect for watching the stars. Around 10:00pm, I happened to look into the sky, there was suddenly an ellipse-shaped dim object flying from Northwest to Southeast with very high speed along an almost straight line. I immediately told my friend ((name deleted)), so she saw the same thing flied to and disappeared in the further Southeast too. The total time for the object&rsquo;s appearance was about 5 seconds. Only two or three seconds later, when we were still looking at the sky and wondering what we had seen, another ellipse-shaped dim object was seen flying from West to East with about the same speed and same straight line, which made an angle of 25-30 degree across the line the first one made. Both of us saw both of the objects clearly and surely. Although they looked gray, bright, outstanding in the dark sky, there were no flashes from these two objects, and they seemed much higher and flied much faster than normal planes. So they should not be planes or helicopters. We suspected that these objects were UFOs based on our analysis.

Our house had a chain link fence in the back yard and a road that ran along the fence with woods on the other side of the road. At the time of my sighting I was playing kick ball in the back yard with my brother and sisters. It was in the evening time probably around 6:00 and there was still plenty of light out, since it stays light later in the summer. I was 12 years old at the time and my younger sister, by 3 years, was the first to point to the sky and say, &quot;What&apos;s that?&quot;.When we all looked up to the sky, where she was pointing, I couldn&apos;t believe what I was seeing. It was a disk shaped flying saucer of a tremendous size. It seemed much larger than any airplane, but didn&apos;t make any noise at all. If I was to put my arms straight out in front of me, pointing my fingers straight out also, that is how much of the horizon this saucer was taking up in the sky. It was very slowly coming down for a landing. We stared in total awe at what we were seeing. My mother at this time was talking to the lady next door standing between the two houses. I ran to get her to come and witness this with us but she wouldn&apos;t come so I went back to watch it coming down with my brother and sisters. It was saucer shaped and it had an underside that seemed to have three colored spinning layers. The colors were like orange, blue and green or something like that. Each layer was spinning in the opposite direction from the layer next to it. It looked like each layer was spinning at the same speed though. Above the spinning layers was the main body of the craft that wasn&apos;t spinning. This area was much bigger than the three smaller spinning layers below. The size of this thing was amazing and it was coming straight down keeping perfectly level as it slowly came toward the earth. I listened very hard for any sound and couldn&apos;t hear anything. What amazed me was how large it was and that it didn&apos;t seem to be concerned about people seeing it. Yes, it was still light out and it was coming down for a landing very close to the Great Lakes Naval Training Facility. I was sure that other people must have witnessed what we were witnessing. It came down close enough from where I was that I could have gone over the fence and crossed the street to go through the woods and see where it landed. I was afraid to though. For some reason I had this feeling like I might not be coming back if I was to go over to look more closely at it. Looking back now I wish I had though. I also wish I had grabbed my mothers arm and insisted t! hat she come with me to see what we were seeing. All of these years she has acted like it was my young imagination. I&apos;ll never forget what I saw though. I have a theory about the spinning colored lower sections of the saucer. It looked like three gyros spinning in opposite directions on a single axis. It would be neat to be able to do an experiment with three gyros set up like that and see if it effects gravity in any way. Just a thought. I must say that this was the neatest thing that I ever witnessed in my life and I feel very lucky to have been able to see it. If anyone has any questions about what I saw, I will do my best to try to answer them for you. I would also love to hear from anyone else who was living in the Great Lakes area at that time and witnessed the same thing.((NUFORC Note:  We have requested that the witness have the other witnesses to the event submit reports, as well.

It was as bright, if not brighter than the north star, but it was overhead, slightly to the east.  I stopped my friend and asked him what star it was, and he didn&apos;t know.  We looked at it a while, and were about to walk on.  But then, four other smaller stars came out of the bright star, and seemed to revolve around it.  It was extremely high and far away, but was clear enough to make out.  The large star stayed stationary, as the other stars moved in and out and around erraticaly.  No idea what it could have been.

I happened to look at the western sky which was towards Minneapolis and St. Paul and I saw 3 unusual lights coming towards us. I told friend to look as they were flying in a tight formation and at a speed that appeared to be at least 4 to 5 times that of airlines. We both watched as they flew from west to east in a tight formation. How could I know their altitude? I would guess 30 to 40 thousand feet. When they got near above us they changed places and revolved. They appeared triangular. They maneuvered in a precise manner. I have seen planes do stunts but nothing this precise at such a speed. They went back to a straight formation but a few seconds later maneuvered again. It was amazing and we needed to share this but unfortunately we had no camera.There was no sound nor contrails. They disappeared to our eyes but that was probably due to the thin layer of clouds and the distance.It appeared to me that what I saw was 3 individual lights but they moved as one. I have seen satellites, planes, meteors, and some other things I couldn&apos;t explain. But this was special.

It was middle of March 2003 between 7:30 PM and 8:00 PM, I was out in my backyard in the 4700 Block Tuck Ave.  I was looking up in the sky around Eby Street and 4800 Block Tuck Ave.  I saw this bright  light glowing object moving around in  a fast downward movement.  This object was falling down fast and moving around.  The object was falling down between the backyards of either the 4800 Block Tuck Ave. or 4800 Block McConnell Ave.  I am not kidding it was falling down fast.  I thought it was a shooting star or a meteor.  I knew it couldn&apos;t have been.  I was waiting to hear an explosion when it fell.  I didn&apos;t hear anything and I didn&apos;t see it again. When I read the article about a UFO sighting in the Terrace Standard Paper, I knew I saw something that night. I am not kidding it was moving downward very fast and it was down low and it was glowing.  Did I see a UFO?  I hope this helps your research.  Let me know if I saw a UFO or not.Thanks.

We saw an unnaturally bright light about 300 meters from our cabin. The light came from a dense forest where there are no other cabins or roads of any kind. We couldn&apos;t know what it was because the forest was so dense that we couldn&apos;t use our old binoculars. We were too frightened to go and see for ourselves. It was there for about ten minutes. We wen&apos;t inside to get our brand new binoculars but by the time we got back to the yard, the light phenomenon was gone.

It must have been about the size of a large oval pool.  i think that is what shocked us the most.  that what we thought was a plane was so small and so quietand that while it was  hovering it was sort of dipping from side to side kind of like a small boat on choppy water, not like it was going to flip over or anything i don&apos;t think.  just like choppy water movement.  my friend and i looked at each other again for what seemed like an hour,  and ran in different directions.  we finally caught up with each other, and made it to her house. no one believed us.  even now, today no one believes me.  i don&apos;t speak to that particular girl very much anymore we both went different ways in life.  but any time i see her we both end up talking about it.  we know what we saw.((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the two witnesses might have observed the object allegedly seen by dozens of witnesses from the Staten Island Ferry at 22:08 hrs. on Friday, September 15, 1995.

There were four of them.  I told darren to pull off the side of the road so he could see.

We asked them if we saw anything and they replied nope.  We told them that we were going to eat and then we&apos;d be right back.  So we started down my road.. about 1-2 minutes later [we were driving quite slow, still looking]  I saw this big orange light to the right of me.  It was MUCH closer than any of the ones I&apos;ve ever seen.  I had Darren stop and we jumped out. This light was just sitting there, military was circling the area.  My sister saw it too and drove down to where we were.  Just around then we see these little tiny orange lights break apart for the the bigger one.  A ton of these lights spilt off.. then they all faded away.  I asked if everyone had saw this, and pretty much the same thing coming out of all their mouths was, &quot;Wow.&quot;  We were all kinda stunned.. it was like watching a movie.  We looked for another minute before deciding we better eat so we can come back out.  We were home eating and you could just hear all the jets in the area.  It was apparent they were either chasing the object or it was one of theirs [though I do not see how it could&apos;ve been a manned object].  We got back out at 9:30 and it was pretty quiet.

I have been doing so for a long time now.- Yesterday, traveling from Toledo Ohio to DTW (Detroit Metro Airport) the weather was foggy.  I was driving cautiously, taking my time to arrive safely.  I was going from street lamp to street lamp just trying to stay awake.  Fog to light, fog to light.  All of a sudden the fog seemed visible, it was still there I just could see clearly.  I was in the center lane of a three lane road.  I looked for the source of the light, it was a shock to me, going from dark and fog to what seemed to be afternoon sun and fog.  On my right, hovering was a bright light.  I saw one light in the center and several in a circle around the center light.  It was so weird, I began thinking what did I see, what is that.  Then I was out of sight of it.  I saw tail lights in the fog braking ahead of me before I came to that area.  I did not brake, but I began driving faster.  I am not a believer of these things.  I have read and been told that these objects are sighted before and during wars and near nuclear power plants.  Both are true when and where I was at that time.  I was also thinking that street lamp was out of place, not the same time driving from one light to another.  I am an Electrical Engineer (Controls Engineer, PLC&apos;s), so thinking logically comes naturally to me.  I had my cruise control &quot;on&quot;.  I do so in fog because I know that when a person drives in fog they want to continouslly accel.  I prefer to drive safe.  Anyways, I saw something that did not belong there.  I am submitting this because I hope any other persons driving that day, on I-75, that saw the same thing I did also submit something.  I need closure.

It looked to fly directly over our campus, west to east, but it was fairly impossible to tell just how large or how high up it was.  It really freaked me out though...  There were about 10 other people within 100 yards of me on campus that noticed it too, and I heard loud yells of astonishment coming out of the windows of the dorms on campus near me (apparently they saw it too...).  Unfourtunatley, I had a limited field of view because of the surrounding buildings, but started to run to try and get a clearer view once it went behind a building, but couldn&apos;t get a clear view.  I later heard on the radio that the object had been seen around town, and was being explained away by local authorities as &quot;space debris&quot; on the radio.  It was a very big, very dramatic fireball, the likes of would never have imagined.  Later that night, I went with a friend to an observatory on top of one of the classroom buildings to try and see some of the Leonid Meteor action that was supposed to be taking place that night.  After being there for about a half hour, we were standing next to two older couples who were up there for the same reason.  One of the ladies suddenly said loudly, &quot;what is that?!&quot;  I looked up and after searching for an instant, I saw to my utter amazement a trianguler shaped object with no lights move silently overhead.  The clear night was disturbed by only a few very wispy and insignificant clouds at what looked to be about 2,000 plus feet, and the object just happened to catch my eye because of its movement, but my friend, and the other three older people couldn&apos;t spot it.  It was relatively the same shade as the night sky, and again, had no lights on it.  Well I felt like Iw as frozen, I was so surprised by the whole e! xperienc e.  I watched the object for a good 15 seconds before it disappeared above some of the low-level clouds that I mentioned, and was heading from north to nearly due south.  It the single most shocking-awe inspiring thing I have ever witnessed in my life.  To describe the craft in more detail, again, it was triangular in shape, and moving point-forward.  It had molding or cross-beams underneath that met in the center, and extended straight out to each of the three triangle points.  I am extremely familiar with military and civilian aircraft, and wasn&apos;t anything I&apos;ve ever seen or even heard of.  It was completely foreign.  And, again, possibly the wierdest and most disturbing thing was the fact that it had no lights, and flew SILENTLY directly overheadat what appeared to be no more than 4,000-5,000 feet i&apos;d estimate.  I know this sounds nuts, but I swear that it&apos;s absolutely true.  TO the say the least, it was one interesting evening.  First, the unbelievable fireball object, and then the UFO that I saw at the observatory.  And the fact that I wasn&apos;t even the first one to see the UFO helps me to be able to assure myself that, yeah, this really happened.  I will remember it for the rest of my life.((NUFORC Note:  We have amended the date shown above to November 16, 1999.  Please see many other sightings for the same time and date.  Mid-November is the time when the Leonid Meteor shower occurs.  PD))", "April 16th, 2003  After the first few years of being on the receiving end of skeptical facial expressions as well as accusations of &quot;making it up,&quot; or being told I did not see what I thought I saw- I decided to keep it to myself. Now, after almost fifteen years, I will tell this story as I can assume that the only others who will be reading this are for the most part those who believe in this stuff. My story is hardly the fodder from which films are made of, I was not abducted, nor did I have any implants or anything of that sort.But I will tell this anyways.It feels good to do so...  It was the summer of 1987. This was the year I graduated High School. I do not recall the exact date. This takes place in Missouri, about an hour and a half South East of Kansas City (+/-). Whiteman Air Force Base, now the home of the B-2 bomber, was at the time a missile base. It is about 30 to 45 minutes away from where this happened. To this day there are countless old missile silos scattered throughout this countryside, though they have been dismantled as far as I know. A friend of mine, as well as one of my uncles decided to go to a place outside of our hometown of Windsor, known as &quot;Windsor Crossing.&quot; Windsor Crossing is about fifteen minutes from Windsor, at the edge of Truman Lake, which in reality is the outer edge of the Ozarks. It is a much larger drink of water than what the word &quot;lake&quot; implies. At Windsor Crossing is a campground, as well as a dock to put boats out onto the lake, and a &quot;beach.&quot; Our plan for the evening was to go to the beach and go for a late night swim. Given the humid summers that Missouri experiences, this seemed like a great idea at the time. My two companions rode along with me, and I parked my car away from the beach as it was forbidden (dare I say &quot;Illegal&quot;) to go swimming there after dark-for our own safety of course. After our swim, all three of us went up onto the beach and lay down on the sand. The night was cool as I remember it. The sky was clear and dark blue, punctured by the pinhole-sized stars that littered the night too numerous to count. It was a very beautiful evening.As the three of us laid there on that beach talking, the conversation ultimately resolved itself to silence. Several moments passed. Then as always seems to be the case, when it is a beautiful night, the stars out, etc, somebody has to speak up about space, parallel universes, and things of that ilk. The guy that came along with my uncle and I was saddled with the nickname &quot;C((name deleted)).&quot; The reason behind this is simply because of his haircut. I won&rsquo;t bore you with the details. Anyway, ((nickname deleted)) was the one guilty of breaking the silence with &quot;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be cool if we saw a UFO?&quot; This was immediately greeted with a reprimand by none other than myself. I sat up in the sand and forcefully declared that no such thing existed, and that it was downright stupid for him to even bring it up. It was a beautiful, clear summer night. That was the reality of the moment. It seemed ridiculous to contaminate such a nice midnight swim with silly speculations of another race from outer space.C((nickname deleted)) snorted something under his breath that vaguely resembled an apology. After several minutes, we all toweled the sand off of ourselves, got dressed and made way to my Toyota Celica (1978 GT. Moon roof.  Damn fine car. And I don&rsquo;t like Japanese cars.) Windsor crossing is on Y highway between Windsor and a little speck of a town called &quot;Tightwad. Tightwad is only two minutes up the road past Windsor Crossing. This is significant as my girlfriend all during high school lived there. This meant I spent a great deal of time on that highway, naturally. So I was very familiar with all the details of that road. Where all the houses where. Where all of the lights where.And where lights should not be. As we were moving down Y towards Windsor, we came to the only stop on that highway. A stop sign at a 4-way in the middle of nowhere. We passed it. As our conversation continued (to this day I have no recollection what it was about), I noticed way out in the distance what looked like an amber light over a field (there are lots of fields in Missouri.). It did not register with me as I was immersed in a conversation of so much importance that I cannot recollect what in the heck it was about. So I filed the light waaaaaay in the back of my mental Rolodex.Our conversation continued.As we drew closer to the light, at this point it was still about a mile or so away, it demanded my attention again. It had suddenly dawned on me that there was no house in that area, save for one farm on the other side of Y highway. It could not be a lamppost; I would have seen it from all of my excursions to my girlfriend&rsquo;s house in Tightwad. Cows of course, have no need for a lamppost out in the middle of a field.The light now had my attention. I interrupted the conversation between my uncle T((name deleted)) and C((name deleted)) and drew their attention to the light.As best I can remember, from that point on we were silent till we drew closer to the light. I pulled my car over to the right side of the road and all three of us got out to take a look at what was over the field.This is what happened to the best of my recollection:  An amber light hung suspended over the field not quite two stories high. To give you an idea of what the light looked like to me, imagine looking at a streetlight through a foggy windshield. It had streaks that came out from the main source, but not sharply, they were not long streaks, just stationary. The light made no sound. Behind it was a single row of trees. I will describe the setting to give you an idea of the distance as best as I can recall it. Y highway is a lone country road out in the middle of nowhere. It is mostly used by the few that live down that road, and the summer traffic going to the lake. At well past midnight, we were the only ones on this road. This small road has no streetlights. So it is dark, save for the house light in the distance, or the occasional traffic lights.From where we were parked at the side of this two-way road, you could walk across it, cross a ditch and come to a fence. You could easily climb the four or five foot fence, take about thirty steps past it, and you would be beneath this thing. You could throw a rock and easily hit it.The three of us stood there and said nothing. We just looked at this light. It made no sound. It moved not an inch. It just hung there. An amber light with soft streaks emanating from it.This is the part that I struggle to understand, much less explain to others: I do not know how this happened, nor do I recall seeing it happen at all. One second I/we were looking at this light floating over a field, and the next thing I know is that the light is no longer there, but what rested in it&rsquo;s place was what we all know as that familiar cigar shape. Its outline could easily be made out against the clear blue night sky, punctured with millions of stars.This cigar shape seemed to me to be about the length of two or three full-sized cars. Around it was blocks of colors. Green, yellow and blue. These colors did not move. The cigar shape did not move.At this point, I tried to gather information about what I was seeing.It was near a row of tall trees, yet the leaves on the trees rustled only when a soft summer breeze passed. It made no sound. Not a hum that I could hear. Nothing. I could make out the blades of grass in the moonlight. They rustled not a bit.I looked over at T((name deleted)), and he was silent. I looked over at my friend C((name deleted)), and he was silent too. My attention turned back to the cigar shape that hovered silently, effortlessly, over this field.I have no idea of how long we stood there and looked at it. I was not scared, quite to the contrary, I felt very peaceful. If I felt anything, it was the urge to run across the road, jump the fence, and run up and try to touch it. But I did not. As the tree of us stood there, I recall us saying things to one another, yet I cannot remember what it was. After several minutes, the cigar shape slowly rose up, over the treetops and lowered itself behind them, as if it was trying to hide from us! It was only one row of trees, so we could still easily make out the lights on its side, as well as the cigar shape. After what seemed like a short amount of time there, it again lifted up over the trees and went away from us. We jumped into my Celica (Damn fine car.), and sped down the highway following it. Ultimately, it stopped over a field. We parked the car on a curve that ran along side a hill that looked down on this field. At this point I was convinced that what we were seeing was indeed not a helicopter, or some kind of airplane. From beneath this (what I will now call a-) UFO shone a bright, concentrated white light. The light&rsquo;s edges softened outward from its center. This light swept over the filed in patterns I did not recognize or find any logic to. It looked very random to me. After a few moments of this, at the blink of an eye, it was very high up in the sky and way out in the distance (and without even the slightest sound). Those lights around it now seemed to be rotating around it. Eventually, it was over the horizon. It would dip below the tree line, and then would pop back up again. It did this a couple of more times before it disappeared, never to be seen by us again. The conversation back to Windsor was dominated naturally, by what the three of us had become witnesses to. I dropped off my Uncle and my friend, but did not go home. Instead, I found myself driving around my hometown of 3,000 people just trying to process what was going around in my head. I eventually came to the parking lot of a grocery I worked at during high school and came across one of my co-workers there. I pulled up to his car. His window was rolled down and I could see his face. It was an expressionless mask, his eyes were hollow, and his skin as white as a sheet of paper. The first thing out of my mouth was-&quot;D((name deleted)), you won&rsquo;t believe what I just saw!&quot;  D((name deleted)) interrupted me and said, &quot;I know what you just saw. It was a UFO.&quot;  His voice trembled, and there was very much a tone of concern to it. He had tried but failed to hide his fright. While we were on that hill on Y highway watching this thing bounce above and below the horizon&hellip;as it turns out, it was over another small town that is called Calhoun. D((name deleted)) girlfriend lived there. According to him, he and his girlfriend were sitting on the porch of her house, which has an awning over it, when he said he felt what amounted to a low rumble. A strong low hum. This caught my interest, as I did not hear any noise whatsoever from the UFO when I saw it.The two of them sat there and from over her house this thing gently sailed over. They watched this, every bit of it as it stopped over her front yard, right in front of them. Then it went up high, above the tree line, and then back down, and then back up. According to D((name deleted)), it did this a few times before it ultimately shot up into the air and disappeared. This seems to match what we had witnessed on that highway, watching this thing go above the horizon, within our view, and then dip below our view a few times before ultimately disappearing. The UFO was described to me by D((name deleted)) as being saucer shaped, and metallic silver. This was all I could get out of him. He was visibly shaken and went home. I rode around town for several more minutes and did not see him again. I went home and looked at the clock and saw that it was about 3 am. I do not believe I lost any time as I can honestly believe that the incidents, including the time I spent driving aimlessly around town, realistically could have burned a couple of hours. The next time I ran into D((name deleted)), he was able to chat about it briefly, but he made it obvious that he wanted to put the whole experience behind him. In a small farming community, you could be the laughingstock of the whole town if you went around proclaiming to have seen a UFO.  Well there you go. All 2,206 words of it.I never believed in anything if I could not reach out and touch it. This rule especially applied to UFO&rsquo;s. My companions and I were not drunk, nor where we on any kind of drugs. We were just three guys on our way home from a swim.  That night, fifteen years ago, I saw something that I know with every fiber of my existence, answered my question of &quot;Is there life out there?&quot; Well I am now here to tell you that I believe that there is. And now that I have thought about it for years, and finally shared it with you. I am now saddled with an even bigger question: Why are they here?((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Hwy 41, thinking it might be nearer. We traveled north on this road and had passed through Warm Springs , Ga. and the community of Harris City,shortly after 9PM , we entered an isolated stretch of country road, when suddenly there appeared inside our vehicle, numerous red lights which seemed to be dancing around and moving erratically and very fast. I was sitting in the back seat on the passenger side of the vehicle. At first, I thought it might be the police, and asked my brother in law to pull over. My husband said it was not the police, their lights were blue. In the floor board of the vehicle where I was sitting, I could see a reflection or beams from the light spots. I looked up and the red lights were all over my husband and brother-in-law. They were there from about fifteen to twenty-five seconds and suddenly and instantly they isappeared.

I was laying back with sunglasses on at the pool with my husband when he said &quot;Do you see that?&quot; Just a few moments before I had noticed something and was trying to figure out what it was just as he said that, so I knew exactly what he was referring to. I said &quot;Are you seeing what I am seeing?&quot; He said &quot;Yes.&quot; We were laying on our backs looking up into a perfectly blue California sky, the sun to our west we were able to look straight up through our sunglasses and see what appeared to be 3 totally still triangular shaped objects that were just barely visible. The looked as if they were attempting to be invisible. The shape was easy to make out the edges seemed to shimmer from the sunlight but the color was almost mirroring the sky. They stood there very still just above us thousands of feet, I am not sure how far but far enough so that they seemed small to us, but not so high that they were hard to see. We both laid back discussing what we were seeing, they were not a kite, or any such thing, they were too perfectly still. At first we only saw 3 of them, but then another one seemed to just appear. They were all together like in a formation, two side by side, one in front, one behind.After about 5 minutes one of them went off slowly to the left then stopped, not moving at all, just as still as could be, and then went back again into same spot in formation. Then one of the other ones completely just dissappeared. We never even saw it move. Then just soon after that it seemed as if they all just dissolved very slowly, as if all they had to do was tilt so that we couldn&apos;t see them anymore, as if the material they were made of could be so mirror like to just absorb the colors of the sky and blend in. Just when we thought they were gone we saw two of them come into view again and at this point a very faint teal color seperated it from the blue of the sky and when this happened one of the craft moved quickly out of view to the left and the other just dissappeared again.We laid there at the pool staring up for another 20 minutes or so talking excitedly. There was no one else out at the pool with us so we had no one else to share this with. The thing that amazed us most is how almost invisible they were, and how still. We were not scared in the least they were too far up to scare us, and we just didn&apos;t think these objects were aware that we could see them.I have always been optimistic about ufo&apos;s being real, but I have never known anyone who has seen them, and I have never really investigated them. I was sitting here tonight ( I am in Washington State now ) watching a channel on UFO&apos;s and it donned on me that I never told anyone about that day, except for a few neighbors, but never officially reported it. My (now) ex-husband who is living in Utah now can totally back up this story, and tell you it is true.Notes: We saw no lights on these objects, but then it was in broad daylight. I do believe these objects could have been there for a long time before we even noticed them as they were very difficult to see without starting straight at them, had I looked away and tried to find them again, it would have been pretty difficult.

Aroung 6:30 PM I caught a glint of light from the sky and looked up. In the distance I saw a usual jet liner leaving a normal contrail, traveling west to east.But looking to the left I saw that the light that attracted me was setting sun relecting off what appeared to be a large cylindrical craft with no visible wings or tail, and leaving no contrail or sound. It was very high and I couldn&apos;t see windows or markings, and it moved north to south. Not knowing the scale of the craft I can&apos;t say how high it was, but it seemed to move faster than the jet liner. I called out to my friend and he described exactly what I was seeing. He remarked that it looked like another cylinder shaped that he and I together had spotted first near Rogers, AR about 8-9 years ago and then later that same day over Eureka Springs, moving south to north. We watched the recent sighting for about five minutes and talked about it briefly, then returned to the project at hand. About an hour later I felt a strong urge to look up and again saw a craft, this time a disc, moving silently along the same north south path as the cylinder and at about the same speed. My friend confirmed my sighting and we watched it for about 5 minutes.Because I felt that this pair of sightings was important, especially with a witness, I filed an e-mail report soon after to the coordinator and producer of the annual Ozark UFO Confernce held each year in Eureka Springs.I had to leave briefly and when I returned at around sunset, my friend said that he had just spotted another disc moving along the same path as the previous one, but there were no other witnesses. He said he was in the house when he had a very strong urge to go outside, looked directly at the disc and watched it for about 5 minutes.", "Four saucer shaped black and shiny UFOs flying in a straight line formation from south-east to north-west seen in Dublin.Four saucer shaped black and shiny UFOs flying in a straight line formation from south-east to north-west have been observed for several minutes in the northern part of Dublin not far from the airport. They attracted my attention because of some pulsating effect as I was bird watching on this sunny and clear sky afternoon in my garden. I ran to grab binoculars (Nicon 10x/50mm) and et voila they were really well visible flying saucers to my total astonishment. Then I&apos;ve concentrated on one as they were about to hide below the roof and sun glare. It had an asymmteric bulge rotating with about approx. 1-2 times a sec thus producing an oscillating effect as the material is pitch matte black but extremely shiny (like metallic) at certain angle to the sun. No portholes, no signs, no trail, no sound, speed was that of an aircrat roughly, but nothing like an aircraft I&apos;ve ever seen! It flew ignoring the usual airport air traffic, but there happened to be no craft flying at the time I was watching them with the binoculars. Total calm, no track or exhaust visible. The propulsion system, steady majestic way of flying and perfect formation were astounding. I wish I had my camera loaded with film and tele lense attached, but there was no time for that. Very similar to the description from London close to that date I&apos;ve seen on this site, but brown possibly because of the sunset.

(I was waiting for my husband to come home from work, and after that, he was going to stop at the grocery store. He worked until 11:00 PM.)I saw something move in the sky.(Which was not too unusual, there seemed to be a lot of what must have been satellites moving around everywhere, last night.) I saw what looked to be one craft, high in the sky, moving down directly South. It appeared to be three white lights formed in a triangle, moving together perfectly. It moved really fast, faster than the airplanes that I see coming in from a far distance, and the lights stayed steady, no blinking or changing colors. I heard no sound, but it was pretty far away. (We are about a mile away from the airport, and see a lot of planes coming and going.) My dog was outside with me, and did not act any different than usual. It slowed down a lot when it came down further from the sky, and started heading North-East. I was not looking through a telescope or binoculars or anything, I just had my glasses on. It seemed at one point, that maybe there were actually three lights, as one or more would move a little, but it was very hard to tell. I have no idea what this was, but it was so different from the lights I normally see. If it was indeed one craft, it must have been pretty big. I was still watching when my husband came home, and was knocking at the front door. (I was on the back steps, with the back door open.) I had to leave to go open and un-lock the front door for him, and when I came back, I could not find them. I just kept thinking about them (Or it..) today, and thought maybe I should report it in case someone else saw what I did. I saw a jet today, and thought of how slow it was moving compared to what I saw last night. I asked my husband how fast he thought it was going,(The jet today.) and he said about 600 MPH.( I think that is what he said.)  ---&gt; (If you publish my report, please do not post this next part, thanks.)I have sent you a report before, and never sent you the picture, as the picture showed nothing of significance, sorry, and I felt foolish at that point.

The only other witness I know of is a guy from Walla Walla, WA. who I met in the campground we were staying, but they left before we woke up the next morning, so any actual confirmation would be from someone I never met before or saw after. You&apos;re the only ones I&apos;ve ever submitted this to, although I&apos;ve told many over the years.After having dinner on the beach this guy and I went around a pile of driftwood to do some stargazing (nothing else!).

We continued to watch until it started to arc again and met another similar light which traveled straight in the opposite direction.(probably a satellite)   We watched it straight above for about a 20 min, looked away for about 5 min, watched again for 10 min before it started its 1 min arc to about 10:00 in the sky, where it stayed for 10 min and we looked away again for 5 min then back for 2 min until it moved to intercept the other northerly arcing light. We left after they were straight above us, it got way to weird.Just to point out the important parts again. It was star like and was constantly moving in a sharp erratic pattern around and past fixed stars and in and out of light range indicating depth in space. We watched it for an hour or more.

It was flashing consistently and sitting in one spot. I told my mother to stop the car as we were on a back road that had little traffic. I rolled down my window and looked the red light. We noticed that it would move south horizontally in little spurts, but mostly stayed in one spot. We drove home and I walked out into the road to see if we could see it from there. I could just see it over the roof of a house, and my mom was standing a bit farther over and she was watching it as well with no obstruction. I noticed the light drop down a bit, beyond my view, and I thought I had slouched or something, so I stood up a bit straighter, but the light dropped down again. I moved over to where my mom was standing, and we observed it clearly. It was staying in one place again. My mother went to go unlock the door of the house, so I was left alone to watch it. Suddenly a bright flash of light came from about the same place I&apos;d initially seen the red light when we were driving. My mom had noticed the flash, and she said it looked like a plane, but it didn&apos;t happen again until a few seconds later, closer to the (then)current location of the red light. The white flash didn&apos;t happen again while I was observing the sky. I looked back at the red light and I saw that it had faded a bit, and the flashing wasn&apos;t as brilliant.

The time I recorded reflects that change. I recently purchased new binoculars (20X60) and that day had found a tripod adapter for them. A few minutes prior, I had finished focusing the binoculars on one of the brightest stars. I took a break for a few minutes to let my eyes adjust after having been looking at the brightness. After that, I had spent a while enjoying the magnification power of the binoculars, realizing how much of the night sky I&apos;d been missing before. I would find an area of the sky to view, lock the tripod and binoculars into place, view for a while, then move to a different spot, and do the same thing. Once while doing this, after locking into place, I looked through the binoculars and saw that three &quot;stars&quot; were moving horizontally, simultaneously, across the viewing field. After they moved out of view I looked without the binoculars and realized they were quite visible with the naked eyes. To get a closer look, I unlocked the binoculars so that they remained on the tripod, but I was able to pan across the sky while looking through them. I realized then, that I could actually see a dark silhouette of a triangular craft. I watched it moving for about three minutes until the silhouette began to be difficult to discern, then the movement stopped. It was then that I noticed the outline of a HUGE circle. Like the triangle, the darker, black image was visible (only through the binoculars) against the background of an already pretty dark night sky. Without binoculars, the perimeter of the object was indicated by a circular (nonmoving) formation of lights, with one very bright light in the center and an average star-like intensity light down and left of the center light. Also visible without binoculars, was a circle of lights inside the larger circle. The front light of the triangle seemed to be a part of that circle, while the two rear lights of the triangle made up two of the ten lights of the perimeter of the circle. It was as if the tri! angle had moved into the pie shape, filling in one of the wedges. As I stood there, trying to make sense of it all, clouds moved in, obscuring all the stars.As I type this I feel like readers will find it laughable, but I swear I&apos;m not crazy!

Once we got out of the town we drove another 5 to 10 min when I saw 2 Very large gold lights with an orange hugh to them. As soon as my wife looked at them they both disappeared at the exact same time. she tryed to tell me they were most likely planes that had turned from us but there were at least 6 planes in the air that we could see all of them had blinking lights and were only 1/5 the size of the strange lights we had just seen and the planes were no where near as bright.

It came toward our car before it stopped (about 1/2 mile away).  It then got very bright and separated into 3 fireballs (all looked like flares - all hovered).  One of the lights began to slowly descend toward the ground, one began to slowly go higher into the air, and one of the fireballs stayed in the same spot.  I decided to go toward it so we could get a closer look.  As I headed down the road, the light that was higher than the other two shot up into the sky and disappeared, the one that was hovering and not moving quickly blinked out, and the other one descending rapidly descended to the ground and disappeared.  My son got scared, so we stopped and looked a little longer.  We saw no evidence of anything, so we went home.((NUFORC Note:  The witness has offered to forward a VHS copy of his tape.

This was sometime in July or August 1961. It was during the summer vacation.  It was about 6:30 when I chanced to look up. I saw a large bright silver, cylinder or oval shaped craft I immediately took for a jet or passenger plane.  I thought it might be from the Skead (Falconbridge Airforce base). I was used to seeing planes from there, but only during the Air Show. The base is just south of Falconbridge, the  nickel mining town I lived in. The craft made no noise but it was on west to east and certainly a crash trajectory. I dropped everything and went to see where it crashed. It was headed into a horseshoe shaped hole in the ground about three hundred meters long and 200 meters wide. The east side of the pothole (this is what we called it) rose to about 25-30 meters high and the walls declined to about ground level with the rest of the town, the west end being level.  There was nothing there so I went to the east side up on top of the hill and looked to the east into the mines and saw nothing also.  I then went home totally perplexed and very hungry. When I arrived home, my mother asked me where I had been all day and I tried to tell her that I wanted to have breakfast but she said that I had missed breakfast and lunch but made me a sandwich. I suffered no trauma what so ever but I am completely baffled about the situation.  For one, I had heard nothing or knew anything about UFO&rsquo;s.  I also have a bullet shaped mark on my left shin. When I was about 14 or 15 years old, I showed it to my doctor and he said that it had to be made by a deep puncture. I remember nothing about any puncture, nor do my siblings and parents know about something like that. The doctor said it was large enough to have had to have stitches. I remember no such event. There are many other mysteries to this event that have occurred at later dates.  But just the sighting and the lost time are enough.  Please e-mail me or call as this has been inside of me for a long time and I have told no one other than my brother about this. Should I pursue this?  What do I do next?  Who do I talk to?

The orange ball was just slightly larger than the security light but much further away.  It appeared to be over the middle of the bay.  I watched it for about five minutes during which time it did not move.  It was much larger than a planet or star but not nearly as large as a full moon would have appeared that close to the horizon.

As we moved forward about 30 yards, we lost the lights in the trees.  When we cleared the trees, and as my wife was preparing to turn left, I saw only one light in the same place.  It was a much larger light, about 20% as large as the moon.  It hovered for an instant and then took off across the sky as fast as a meteor.  There were clouds in the north and I assume it went behind those clouds.  I also assumed that the lights had merged when I caught sight of the light after clearing the trees although I did not see that take place.

Luckily, I was able to sweep the telescope across the sky so as to follow this group for several minutes until it moved into trees to the east. At the time, I was using a wide-field, low power ocular [25 X, approx. two degree field of view] on a telescope with an altazimuth mounting, so it was realtively easy to observe and track the object(s) as they moved across the sky.  I live in an urban location (Jacksonville) with a good bit of background sky glow.  In addition, this evening there was a waxing crescent moon in the sky, and some light haze and clouds, so that there is no chance that I would have noticed this phenomenon had I not been using a telescope. What I observed appeared to be three, point-like lights, perhaps no brighter than fourth magnitude stars, moving together in a tight pattern that resembled a foreshortened isosceles triangle.  The long axis of the group was approximatley three quarters of a degree.  While watching the grouping of lights move across the sky in the telescope, I was impressed by the fact they seemed to move in perfect fromation, keeping the same visual aspect and reminding me of nothing so much as the three illuminated corners (running lights) of a solid, trinagualr object seen from an oblique perspective. Curiously, as I followed this group of three lights in the telescope, there was no observed occultation of stars as it passed in front of them, despite the very strong visual impression (illusion?) that I was watching a dark, solid object move across the sky.  As for direction and duration, the group was moving from west to east, and traversed the distance from Cancer to the vicinity of Ursa Major (obscured by trees) in less than two minutes.  [These are actual compass directions; in a telescope&apos;s star diagonal, east and west are, of course, reversed.]  If I had to guess, I&apos;d say that I was observing a cluster (?) of satellites.  I an pretty well used to seeing individual satellites in binoculars and -- ocasionally -- in a telescope, and these objects had all of the characteristis of such.  Also, depending on their height (if they were indeed satellites), the timing of their passage relative to the location of the day-night line for my location seems to indicate that they should have been visible.  Pretty darned impressive, whatever they were!((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness may have witnessed the three U. S. Navy NOSS satellites, but we have not been able to confirm that fact, yet.

Base shut down in 1979I was standing Guard duty one night on a top secret base on the Island of Eleuthera in the Bahamas. I had very low level, but very slow moving craft come down island, turn and make an approach towards the gate shack that i was in. It was slow moving and was only at a tree top height. It stopped directly above me and I filed a report to the Officer Of the day, but he would not believe me that it was there. I logged my report in at 2:15 am and stepped outside the shack, and looked up at it which seemed like a couple of minutes, but when I went back in the shack to sign this craft out it was 2:30. I was not sure as to what to make of this, so I mentened this to several people on the base. A couple of days later, I was talking about this, and an Officers wife heard me talking, and she said that she saw it sitting over the shack I was in, but instead of wakeing up her husband, she got afraid and went to bed.I asked everyone who was on watch to look for anything unusual relating to this, and when I went on watch again it came back, but this time I had about 5 people there with me. It came down island again, as it did before and turned towards me at tree top high and approched me, but stopped about 100 yards away, and turned down island again out of sight. This happened 5 times, but only on my duty. It always stopped about 100 yards away and turned down island.I guess the thing that bothers me the most is that I had 16 section duty, which means that, every 16th day I would stand duty, and it showed up (only) on my duty. Well, after the 5th time it did not come back until. I was sitting in the shack, and the hair on the back of my neck stood up, like someone was behind me, or watching me,so I walked to the top of the hill where I could see the other side or the island,and there it was crusing along the island at a high rate of speed, about what looked like about a couple of feet off the water.I have had dreans on occasion of a green beam, and I feel I an all knowing feeling knowledge of how this craft is powered.

Beltway, March 8, 2003Strange Sightings Within The Washington, D.C. Beltway, March 8, 2003   I would have reported this earlier, but when, on the night of the observations reported below, I phoned _______ of the Fund For UFO Research, he told me that I should not report it on UFO UpDates, when I mentioned the possibility. I didn&apos;t ask ((name deleted)) why he said that, but since it has been so long and I&apos;ve seen no reports of this, I can&apos;t imagine how this late-reporting could create a serious &apos;reporting noise&apos; problem (if that&apos;s what ((name deleted)) was concerned about), so here goes. My apology for reporting late..... At 8:15 (20:15 hours) on Saturday evening, March 8, my wife and I were preparing to leave our home near Greenbelt, Maryland, when a strange wing-like (No aircraft body visible and we had ground light off overcast clouds that should have clearly revealed any body.) Thing - herein-after &apos;AAO&apos;, meaning anomalous aerial object - was seen to emerge into view travelling on a twenty-degrees-east of a true north course passing almost overhead, from having been eclipsed by our front porch roof. The &apos;Wing&apos; spanned a _full_ two degrees (120 ARC minutes) as contrasted with the half-degree (about 30 arc minute) crescent moon, off to my left during the observation for immediate and good comparison of angular size. The &apos;AAO&apos; was perceived by binocular disparity (visual parallax due to eye separation) as being 600 to a maximum of 1,200 feet overhead, and at the time its actual maximum possible distance was constrained by a thin layer of clouds overhead. Officially, that cloud layer had been broken at 24,000 feet at 19:51, was OVERCAST at 23,000 feet at 20:51, scattered by 21:51 same altitude, and clear by 22:51. (Thanks to __________ for the cloud data.)  Most disturbing was the _total_ silence of the nearby object. A bright, continuously white &apos;sphere&apos;-looking thing was visible on the tip of each &apos;wing&apos; (Color illustration available to anyone who requests it.). Each white &apos;sphere&apos; had a very sharp edge quite different from the lights on ordinary aircraft, and of a much purer white color. A much smaller (than the white &apos;spheres&apos;) pure red light looked possibly more &apos;point-source&apos; and was located in the &apos;middle&apos; (vertex of the &apos;wing&apos;).  It was brightening and dimming, but at times it seemed more of a flicker, and at other times more of a pulse, if memory serves me. The &apos;wing&apos;, per se, was quite strange. Although it was visible by the cloud back-lighting, it was rather vague because subtle light around it seemed to vibrate or flicker at maybe ten hertz! - all along and across the &apos;wing&apos;. There was _no_ sign of any aircraft type body! Since the sight was quite &apos;spooky&apos;, maybe one could call them &apos;disembodied wings&apos;. :)  We live a few blocks north of the little College Park Airport which is presently closed down to non-government air traffic due to security concerns, but this &apos;AAO&apos; seemed so very low that my &apos;gut&apos; reaction was that it had taken off from there, despite the fact that the thing seemed to be on a very flat course (neither climbing nor descending). Subsequent inquiry to the airport revealed that there had been no take-off around the 20:15 time of the first observation, and the airport had closed at 22:30, fifteen minutes before the second identical observation to be described below. Roughly fifty (50) minutes after the first observation, an airliner type aircraft came over, possibly having taken off from Andrews AFB just east of D.C. It was on a slightly more westward bearing and considerably higher up. We could see the aircraft&apos;s body, wings, and tail structure very clearly and hear it very distinctly. By contrast, the &apos;AAO&apos; had NO BODY VISIBLE, but only that weird wing-like structure that remained vague, SEEMING TO SHIMMER or something - It&apos;s really hard to describe. That&apos;s why I have illustrated it in the way that I did in the image anyone may ask me to send. Yet, the most striking thing of all was the absolute silence! There was a bizarre silence, &apos;stillness&apos;,and &apos;smoothness&apos; that is hard to explain or even put into adequately descriptive words. After the object had disappeared beyond our north-northeastern horizon (taking roughly 30 seconds time to go from near zenith across the northern horizon), I ran up to the third floor where my Extreme Low-Frequency (ELF) magnetometer is located and noted a low-level, continuous magnetic pulse in roughly the 2-hertz range, accompanied by a few very strong &apos;spike&apos; type pulses, one of which may have &apos;pegged&apos; the needle. These were not normal background magnetics. Coming upon 22:45 hours (10:46 PM), I was again upstairs with the magnetometer checking for any anomalous activity, when similar magnetic phenomena began to again be seen by the action of the needle display and heard on the analog, frequency modulated audio output (just as before). Watching and listening to that, I SUDDENLY heard a roar (seemingly directly overhead) that vaguely resembled a loud jet but was distinctly different, somehow. Then after a maybe 4 to 5 second duration, that roar SUDDENLY subsided - taking about 0.5 second to go from loud to nothing. Because of the odd magnetic activity and the surprising sound, at cessation of the sound I rushed downstairs and onto the front porch, from which I was surprised to see an exactly identical &apos;AAO&apos; (as compared to the 20:15 observation) on _exactly_ the _same_ course!  As with the earlier &apos;AAO&apos;, I watched the object from almost directly overhead as it moved in spookily total silence to across the exact spot on the north-northeastern horizon into which the first object had headed and disappeared. During the first observation, the sky above the thing was overcast, but in the second sighting it was totally clear, with all stars and planets visible. Still, I could see no &apos;body&apos; on the object, but only the &apos;wing&apos;. This time, too, the &apos;wing&apos; seemed to shimmer in a light-distorting way that made it much less clear than had the very clear wings, body, and tail section of the jet aircraft when it was watched at about 22:05 for comparison to the 20:15 &apos;AAO&apos;. In both observations of the identical &apos;AAO&apos;, when overhead the angular distance from white globe of light to white globe of light (&apos;wingtip&apos;-to-&apos;wingtip&apos;) was about 120 minutes or arc (2 degrees), and I had a ready comparison because the crescent moon (about 28 to 30 arc minutes) was still in the north-west (although nearer its horizon) during that second and identical observation. Clouds above an aircraft seem to amplify aircraft sounds to a ground observer, but although it was overcast during the 20:15 observation, even then not a sound of any kind could be heard! I found that really a bit spooky because both things (or two events with the same single thing) were clearly under power, moving steadily and unwaveringly along precisely the same course in both observations. It was as if both had traveled upon the very same invisible track in the sky!  Let me be clear in saying that I suspect this twice-seen object of being some type of stealthy black-project aircraft (manned or unmanned) that is somehow propelled silently, but wonder at the wisdom of operating such a vehicle over this highly populated area within the Washington, D.C. Beltway. Oddly, _everything_ seemed so still and quiet during the two passages of the object(s) that I am reminded of reports of a similar phenomenon (&quot;the OZ factor&quot;) reported by certain observers of &apos;UFOs&apos; at close range, but would be cautious in saying it was the UFO-related &quot;OZ&quot; phenomenon because I must consider the possibility that I had &apos;perceptually isolated&apos; myself in listening for a non-existent sound from each &apos;AAO&apos; to the exclusion of not noticing other ambient sounds. Angular velocity of both &apos;AAO?&apos;s is roughly averaged at three degrees per second, if the observation time in each case was 30 seconds. If 45 seconds, then it might have been two degrees per second. If there are any questions about the observations, do not hesitate to ask.((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Mr. Ray Stanford, noted UFO investigator and author, for sharing this report with NUFORC.

Joined after brief time by another- from thin air! Then both moved away and vanished!My daughter and I were on our way to visit my parents in Centerpoint, TX from San Antonio. We had just left Comfort, (a small hill-country town) when the lady in the car ahead of us applied her brakes quite suddenly and swerved off the road, looking up in the air. Thinking something was wrong, I slowed and stopped and my natural urge was to look up as well. About that time my daughter (who was 3 at the time, almost 4) said, &quot;Look Daddy, an airplane!&quot;. Looking at the object that hovered there in the clear sky (there were no clouds), I saw immediately that it wasn&apos;t an airplane. What I/we saw was a cylindrical (spelling?) object that looked like it was made from a highly reflective silver metal. It was a cylinder &apos;standing slightly on end&apos; almost like a silvery beer can about to start to tip over. It just stayed there, not moving. I could see the sunlight reflecting off of it. I looked at the lady ahead of me and she looked back at about the same time. She pointed in the air and made a &apos;questioning&apos; guesture by shrugging her shoulders and pointing up. I shrugged back. Neither of us got out of our vehicles. Looking back at the object, it was still there. I felt remarkably calm though I knew it was some kind of object that couldn&apos;t be easily identified. I felt kind of &apos;dreamlike&apos; or in a slightly drugged state. I turned on the radio to see if there were any more anywhere else (don&apos;t know; thought it might be a wave of them or something... I know it sounds wierd but it was one of my first reactions- probably too much Independence Day movie or something). The radio worked fine. I looked back at the object just as my daughter said &quot;Look Daddy, a falling star!&quot; and pointed. There was a sudden shower of &apos;sparks&apos; above and to the left of the object (from my vantage point) and suddenly there was ANOTHER object, an exact copy of the original in the area where the sparks appeared. This object was &apos;cantered&apos; at the same angle. The were identical in every aspect that I could determine. Then suddenly they both quickly receded to nothing but pinpoints, as if they moved directly away from us at extremely high speeds or as if they suddenly shrunk to nothing. There were no trails, no sparks, nothing... They both receded at exactly the same rate. I started my truck quickly and sped up the road &apos;after&apos; them; the road roughly paralleled the path they took. I barely glanced at the woman on the way by but she looked remarkably calm as well; not really shaken. As I drove after them (in the same direction I would be heading to go to my parent&apos;s), I turned the events over in my mind. It finally started to &apos;sink in&apos; what I had seen. I look all over the sky as I drove but I never saw them again. Driving the few miles left to my parents house, I said my &quot;hello&apos;s&quot; and then grabbed my dad&apos;s binoculars from his gun cabinet.

I would have to say about the height of a satellite or higher(If you have ever seen a passing satellite, you would know what I mean).  I pointed it out to my friends and they quickly saw it too.  At that point I started to get a little scared because I was actually thinking &quot;yea right, a UFO&quot;.

I thought it was just me shaking the binos till I saw it better with my eyes and noticed it was infact going up and down :-). Now I thought this would be weird for any object I&apos;ve ever seen. The other factor was the NO SOUND that came from it. A brief second after I spotted it, I looked up and saw a jet flying HIGH up, over 30,000 that made a loud noise but this object I was staring at..made NO SOUND. So I thought it was odd, So I just followed it for a while till it almost dissappeared over a concrete wall but then it stopped for a moment, so I continued to stare at it, then it stareted to hover up a bit and travel some more ( What was odd about it..was it stopped when it was almost out of my view twice, as if it didn&apos;t want me to not miss it!)

Earlier in the night, we&apos;d left the sliding glass doors open to let in fresh cool air because I was always complaining that I was too warm.  I recall that I awoke in the night and instinctively walked into the den, almost as if I were sleep walking, and indeed I believed that I was doing so at the time.  The entire room was bathed in light, coming from the back yard, and it was so bright that I could not see anything in the yard clearly - not the pool ten feet from the sliding glass doors, nor even the patio furniture directly outside.  I could see that there were forty or fifty large moths on the ceiling of the den, and their shadows were long from the light.  At this point I felt a deep dread and blacked out.The next morning I awoke in the guest bedroom with dirty feet.  I went immediately into the den to wake my sister, and shrunk back when I saw the moths on the ceiling.  They were not there the night before when I&apos;d gone to bed, and seemed to me to be evidence of the event.

I stobe light flash caught my attention, when I looked North West I saw a whitish shape hovering above the Suffolk County Minumum Security facility.  I watched it until the trees obsctructed my view.  There were no visible lights, other than the initial flash that attracted my attention. Once I reached my destination (on the same road), I watched the general area for about 5 minutes, but there was no further sign of the object.  But an airplane did fly near the same location about 5 minutes after my sighting.((NUFORC Note:  Witness is a member of law enforcement.

This is a rural area, so there are not too many aircraft to be seen. The object I saw was a tapered curved cylindrical object with a sphere on the narrow end. The object appeared to be metallic. I immediately stopped the minike and shut off the engine to observe the craft move to the west in a slow but steady manner and without making a sound. The distance and size of the object were hard to determine, but I&apos;d guess it was at 3 to 5 thousand feet and approximately 50 feet long. I immediately rushed home approx a quarter mile and tried to locate the object with a telescope but it already disappeared.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "lights were, yellow, blue and red and zipping around.A fellow stopped me while I was heading out the door of our local grocery store here in Houston, B.C. today (April 14, 2003). He said to me that he had his first UFO sighting the other night. There were four witnesses to this sighting. On April 11, 2003 at 8:00 p.m., which was a Friday evening 4 witnesses were just west of Houston in an area called the Houston Estates. There are a number of homes in the area. One of the witnesses saw something funny and told everyone else to look. Looking south towards the Morice River, from the Houston Estates they noticed the strangest set of lights. It was very low in altitude, and sitting above the Morice Valley Road. I was told the only  thing which could be seen on it were the three colored lights. The witness said it was as if the object was rotating, as the lights kept changing position. The color of the lights were, yellow, blue and red. The strange thing about this sighting is that I was told that the object was witnessed for approx: 10 minutes. Also if one would picture someone making a drawing of a Christmas Tree, (just a simple sketch) this would have been how this object moved. So starting say from the top of a tree, it zipped down and out to it&apos;s left, then moved quickly straight back in. ( say  towards the trunk of the tree). Then dropped a bit and continued doing this until in was noted to have dropped a good distance in height. He told me whatever it was moved extremely fast, then would come to a complete stop. Then once again continuing to move at a high rate of speed making the same maneuvers over and over again. The object would have been approx: 2 miles away from the peoples location. Binoculars were brought out so they could get a better look at it,  I was told all that could be seen was the lights, no shape or body to the object. The object/lights vanished instantly after the 10 minutes of viewing. Anyway how, this is a raw report and I am in the works of contacting the other three witnesses to gather more information on this sighting.((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Brian Vike, Director of the Houston, British Columbia, Canada UFO Research organization, for sharing this report.

It was very narrow and very high in the sky, but was very bright (silver in color).  The sky was very blue and there were some small puffy clouds that passed in front of the object which remained stationary for about five minutes.  It then moved in the direction the clouds were moving for about 5 degrees and stopped.  After a minute or so, it then moved in a direction opposite of the travel of the clouds.  By this time, most of the neighbors in the neighborhood that were home were outside, watching and commenting on the event.After a few minutes of remaining stationary again, it then simply shot off (apparently upward) and was out of sight almost immediately.  No noise was made and no other objects were visible.  As a neighborhood, we all commented on this, went back to our homes and afternoon activities, and really never commented on this event again.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I stopped my car and kept looking, it wasn&apos;t too far and it was moving slowly not too high above in the sky.  I was scared because I had never seen something like this so I headed home (I was approximately one minute away).  When I got home I told my boyfriend, he could tell that I was shocked because my eyes were watery but he didn&apos;t really seem to believe me.  He said &quot;let&apos;s go upstairs to see if you see it again&quot;.   I headed up before him and started looking towards the direction that I originally saw it (towards my left) and didn&apos;t see anything.  Then I looked towards my right and there it was.  My boyfriend saw it at that time and agreed with me that we&apos;ve never seen nothing like this.  It was huge.  We then went outside to see if we can still see it and we still saw it but we had a better view from upstairs so we headed upstairs again and kept looking until it disappeared into some tress in the area.

The disc was hovering over a small island directly across the cove from our cottage.  It was as big as the island about 60 - 80 ft., it was saucer shaped, flat on top and red and green lights underneath.

No location in Illinois is indicated by the witness.  We question whether this is a serious report, but include it here, nevertheless, hoping other potential witnesses might submit reports.  PD))I need and explanation?I am actually writing this on behalf of my sister.  I almost feel somewhat stupid repeating this story.  I was surfing the web trying to research what my sister and her friends described they saw to me.  That is how I came across this website.  O.k. well a couple of nights ago, my sister&apos;s friend had a bonfire party out at her house out in the country.  There were approximately 15-20 kids there.  They set up the bonfire in between the house and an adjacent field.  The party winded down at around 2:45 in the morning.  My sister who is 17, her friend E who is 17 also, and E&apos;s older sister A, who is 19, started to clean up.  They drove their mom&apos;s van down to the fire, and loaded some chairs into it and brought it up to the shed.  They unloaded those, and shortly before getting into the van, my sister looked up toward the house and saw a figure standing  a little off the drive-way by the house.  She motioned to E to look at it.  E asked my sister if that was Justin? a kid that had been at the party?  They knew they were the only three left, so they got creeped out and hopped into the van.  Once in the van, they looked back up towards the house, and the figure was gone.  My sister described it as appearing to look like maybe it was a man, and it had lighter colored, or white clothing on.  Once the van was started, they all convinced eachother, that the figure or person, was probably E&apos;s dad just checking up on them.  They then headed back down towards the fire to resume cleaning.  By this time it is approximatley 3:20 a.m.  They headed up over the drive-way and into the grass, and down the hill towards the fire, which was still burning.  E had her brights on and my sister was somewhat looking at the floor, when she heard A say, What the Hell is that?  My sister looked up and saw what she describes as &quot;frozen things.&quot;  Figures or creatures or something in two seperate rows.  She says maybe fifteen in each row, and 30 in all.  She said they were approximately three feet to four feet tall.  And! she said they were about fifteen feet away from them, directly in front of the car.  She describes them as having a Christmas light head, and that the heads were connected to the body but she couldn&apos;t see how.  She says their arms were up, but she couldn&apos;t see hands.  She says they were stick like.  Stick people she says, dark grey or brown in color.  They didn&apos;t move.  Not at all she says.  She says they were just frozen in these two seperate rows.  (Crazy, this is what I would lable this freekin story) My sister immediatley began to cry, and then both girls screamed for E to get the car moving.  She peeled out and they headed to town.  Now what they did next doesn&apos;t really matter.  I kind of wish they would have come got me, but instead they drove around trying to think of things that the &quot;things&quot; could have been.  Deer, Trees, Goats, Sheep, Bushes, but they knew that those weren&apos;t it.  The girls drove around for a little over two hours until they finally got enough courage to go back.  Mostly because the sun started to come out.  They went back to the spot where they saw them, and there was nothing there.  My sister came home that morning and told us the story.  Now, I honestly don&apos;t believe in this ((deleted)).  I don&apos;t believe in ghosts, I don&apos;t believe in aliens, or hell, or anything that can&apos;t be proven.  So, I am looking for some logical answers.  She is telling the truth.  She hasn&apos;t been able to sleep, or eat, and when she told us what happened she could barley finsh the story because she was fighting back tears.  To say that she was shaken up is an understatement.  I am fucking pissed that this has happened to her, because she has finals over the next three weeks, and she can&apos;t sleep let alone concentrate.  Does this make any sense, what I am saying.  Like I said, I am looking for logical answers.  I am not leaving my name, or her name, or any ones name.  Because I don&apos;t want her labled as that &quot;crazy girl.&quot; It seems like the only people that ever see these things are the crazy redneck familys that ! live in a trailor park, and are ((deleted)) uneducated and just plain retarded.  So I guess that is why I don&apos;t want her name to be in this.  I don&apos;t know how to end this novel that I have written, but I guess I would like your oppinion on what we have here.  Please get back to me.  Have I described something that has been seen before?  Has there been other reports of anything like this in Illinois?  Please let me know.

He may not recall this as he was only eight years old at the time. This report relates to the Sighting Report filed by the Police Captain and occurred within the Mansfield, Ohio city limits just south of the west end of Cook Road. After an early dinner our son went out to ride his bicycle while his mother and I finished our meal. It was a clear, sunny and beautiful early evening. Our son ran into the house, out of breath and said that a space ship just chased him on his bicycle and he ran into the house. Our son was NOT prone to exaggeration but after a casual glance outside on our part, we dismissed the subject and idea. His description of the craft was that it was shaped like a cigar and had red, blue and green flashing lights. He said that it got &quot;real close&quot; to him but I don&apos;t know what the distance might have been. No mention was made of any noise comming from the craft and he did not say what happened to it. Parents learn lessons the hard way sometime. That evening on the news out of Cleveland, 65 miles to the north east of Mansfield, it was reported that a military helicopter on a flight from Wright-Patterson AFB in Dayton, Ohio on it&apos;s way to Cleveland had to take evasive action to avoid a collision with a cigar shaped UFO with red, blue and green flashing lights. The encounter occurred over Mansfield, Ohio in the same time frame as our son&apos;s experience. The pilot was interviewed along with his co-pilot and both men were highly respected by the military and were considered honest. I had heard, years later, that this was one of the best documented and most reliable accounts on record. Also, years after the experience, there was a notice in the Mansfield News Journal newspaper that research was being done on this very incident. Witnesses were being sought and the intent was to interview them and get their consent to undergo hypnosis for in depth acquisition of data. I responded to this notice in writing and my letter was returned, unopened, several weeks later claiming that no such address existed in Columbus, Ohio. Needless to say, neither his mother nor I ever dismissed his inputs to us thereafter.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

From about a hundred feet apart, all of us saw it until it disappeared into the horizon.", "A dozen or more lights in a &quot;V&quot; formation moving quickly and silently.I was taking my dog out, and while I waited for him I was looking at the night sky.  It was clear at the moment and as I looked at the stars directly overhead I saw a &quot;V&quot; shaped formation of approximatly 12 to 15 lights traveling northwest. They were traveling very quickly, and silently, and in a few seconds were out of sight.  The individual lights though staying in formation seemed to flit around.  It made me think of a group of clear spheres flying in formation with a single firefly darting around in each one; if you can imagine that.", "Hundreds of spheres moving West to East.I was out walking on a secluded beach between Mukilteo and Edmonds , Washington State. Late in the evening as I some times do. On this night I was admiring the full moon which was almost straight up a little south and a little east. There was a few fluffy small clouds out and as I was looking at the moon one formed a tunnel around the moon. I was thinking that this was really cool looking and watched this for a while as there was little wind and the formation stayed that way for a while.After a while I started to look around at the stars in the sky, looking for the familiar formations like &quot;The Big Dipper&quot;, &quot;Orion&quot;, &quot;Cassiopeia&quot;, and such. I caught a glimpse of what at first I thought was a satellite. I then noticed that there was more than one point of light. I was looking to the north and just slightly to the west. What I witnessed was astounding as there was at least a couple of hundred points of light moving  across the sky in a row a bout 30 or so wide and 75 to 80 long. When I say long I mean they were moving from the west to the east and lined up north/south. As they moved I noticed that as a row move forward the ones in front would stop then the next row would pass the front row and become the row in front. Then after it moved about 10 widths of their selves(the points of light)they would stop and the next row would follow in the same fashion. Then when a row that had stopped was behind all the rest it would start moving again until it was in the front of the procession. Then it would stop again. This gave the whole cloud of objects the look of a sparkling translucent tube rolling through the heavens. When I say that the sphere were lined up, I want to be clear here, that they were not organized straight lines. It was more like a heard of animals like cows moving a cross a field of grass. the ones in front stop to eat and the rest move pasted and as they get to the front they stop to eat the fresh grass. Then as the heard moves along the ones that were in front that stop to eat are passed the start moving to keep up with the heard. Anyway the hill finally blocked the view after about 4 or five minutes. It was cool but I thought no one would believe me, or care about little light, and they where not even fly saucers. But I recently viewed &quot;The Secret NASA Tapes&quot;,&quot;The Smoking Gun Evidence.&quot; and thought hey that&rsquo;s what I saw only years before.((NUFORC Note:  Time and date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

As we were looking in the sky and doing some small talk, a person behind me said, &quot;Hey, what&apos;s that?&quot;.  I looked up directly overhead and saw a very dark, probably dark grey or black triangular craft, flying at about 300 feet overhead with a dull non-blinking white light on each tip of the triangle. The craft was noiseless and flying pretty slow, maybe at about 30-60 miles/hour. If someone hadn&apos;t pointed it out, I probably would not have noticed it.  It was big though, probably around 60-100 feet wide.  It passed over our heads in a straight line towards the eclipsed moon and looked as if it veered to the right before disappearing into the haze. Total sighting time was about 5 seconds.  It was very eery and strange.  I have a hard time believing that we have the technology for something to fly like this.  The other two witnesses saw exactly the same thing as myself, but my friend convinced himself it was a flock of birds after hearing what we saw.

That justified the approximate height. Rough calculations indicate the streak was moving about 12,000 to 15,000 miles an hour,with no concern about hitting anything.

It had sparks shooting out all the way around it in a circular fashion.  It rotated clockwise.  It would stay stationary most of the time, but occasionally shooting in different directions.  I have stayed up late on numerous occasions since then, and have seen the exact same thing anywhere from 11:30 p.m. on, lasting all night as far as I know.

My piano teacher commented on how clear the sky was and started talking about the constellations. He asked which one was the Plough (Ursa Major), and I replied that I couldn&apos;t see it but that was the Orion and another constellation was the Pleiades. He did see where I was pointing but as I was doing so, an object, very high up in the atmosphere, (I could tell this because it was not luminous but had light dimly reflected off it, but it was 20:00 so it was dark in Colchester) moved at great speed across the sky. I exclaimed, &quot;Shooting star!&quot; but as the object reached the end of its travel, it swerved in a S shaped path, still moving at the same speed.The object appeared to be falling but that was a trick of perspective and in fact the object was travelling across the sky and into the distance. I have seen shooting stars on many occasions and I have also seen satelites in orbit as they pass overhead at dusk. This was moving extremely quickly and I know that in order for it alter its course it must be acted upon by a force. I am not saying it was aliens or anything but it was certainly something that was very strange and that I cannot attribute to aircraft, satelites or shooting stars. I was very excited and I was disappointed that my piano teacher did not see it.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was fire orange with no distinctness about it.  I thought it was quite strange but I figured it was a flash from a boat.  It stayed there  for a few seconds and slowly went away.

We were about in Berlin MA when my eyes started to drift and then became fixed on an object that was off in the distance, I stayed with the confersation that my friend and I were having when I knoticed that the object was comming closer to the high- way at a very strange angle and speed.  It was going very slow and very low.  It got so close that I finally became unable to talk, my friend noticed what I was looking at and both of us were in complete awe.

We lived in a quiet suburb in massachusettts.  While driving home one evening with my dad driving and mom in front, we all saw a UFO.  It happened that whihle mom n dad talked away in front, I noticed first off that my lil brother looked &quot;stupid&quot;. I would have automatically thought he was making that face on purpose as we always joked around as kids do, but my immediate instinct (and i get goosebumps now at 39) was something is very wrong! All in a second it seemed..I grabbed his arm and shook him yelling his name, my mom turned around of course and is when she swore and yelled to my father to &quot;step on it&quot;! I looked behind us and there indeed was a hughe circular ufo with lights all around it..hovering behind us. I was screaming to my brother who seemed to be in a trance like, and I knew intuitively to not &quot;let them get em&quot;, and kept shaking him. This I now beleive is what others refer to as electomagnetic.. My dad did step on it, but I never realized to now, I don&apos;t remember the rest of the ride home. This thing was huge! It didn&apos;t make a sound. My brother was ok and &quot;woke up&quot; at home..and we&apos;ve never forgotten that. My mom phone Logan International Airport to report this..she was a complete wreck, and turned out many many ppl did report the same, from the same area.  I am a beleiver...for sure.  Turns out a few weeks after that I&apos;d gonen to a sleep over at a girlfriends house and we all decided to go outdoors and as late around 1pm i think. We laid on the grass in her yard, and talked away bout things in young girls lives.  Out of nowhere above us, were many, I would have to say eight ufo&apos;s..dangling..jetting very fast and rapidly appearing and disappearing, but above us.  When we noticed this we all were shocked and ran as fast as we could inside screaming. I don&apos;t know or recall if anyone reported that from that evening, but was shortly after my fist sighting. I couldnt h! elp wonder and still do sometimes, if it was directly related to me for having been witness to the earlier sighting, and I was being &quot;followed&quot;.

His thoughts were that whatever it was, was a meteor as he said he sees a number of them while working in so many darkened hours.

The sighting lasted approx: no more than 3 to 4 seconds. At arms length he said the light may have been the size of a pea.

I jumped into the car and drove the 2 kilometers east from Houston to his home, where they have a large farm. When I arrived I was greeted by the fellow who asked if I would come in and listen to a story of a strange event that took place April 21, 2003, at 11:45 p.m.. We sat down and he explained that he was walking home from his bothers place, (which runs along highway #16). As he got to where their driveway meets the highway, he saw a large blackened object (craft) flying very low over top the tree line and across the highway heading in an easterly direction coming from the west (?). He told me what caught his attention to the object was that being a completely clear night and gazing up at the stars there was a large part of the sky in which no stars were visible, but only the outline of something huge and dark in color. As we watched it a number of rolls of lights came on, which scared him darn near out of his pants. He told me he ran the short distance to their home and yelled to his mother to come out and look at what he was watching. Both of them stood looking at this massive object &quot;slowly&quot; fly by. All of a sudden the lights that were visible which had just came on, went out. Due to the farm having a great deal of trees around it, they soon started to lose sight of what ever it was that was flying by. (HBCC UFO Note: I asked if they could give me a rough idea what the shape of this object looked like. Both said it looked as if it might have been triangular in shape. How they came to this idea was due to the lights which came on. The witnesses said the rolls of lights on the underside of the craft seemed to sweep back from a point on an angle. (direction the craft was heading - so the front of it) Or to give a better idea may be if one was looking at a flight of geese in a V formation. The main colors of the lights were white, with some green/red also in the mix. They also reported that it looked as if there were three large rolls of the lights on the underside. I also asked if they could tell me the rough size of it. They both said it was &quot;massive&quot;, then looked at one another hoping, I guess one would come up with a better description of just how big this was. They said it had to have been close to the size of a large jet airliner, or a bit larger. The sighting lasted approx: for 10 to 12 seconds before they lost sighting of it, after looking around the area where they live I figured that would have been a long time to view this due to so many trees which would have started to block their view of the object. &quot;No&quot; sound was heard what so ever. They also have a large dog in which seemed to be disturbed as the craft flew on by so they said. The fellow said the object  was approximately 400 to 500 feet above the tree tops, which was pretty darn low. (HBCC UFO Note: I wondered if the object had made some kind of change in it&apos;s flight path before the witness caught sight of it. These folks live right below Mount Harry Davis, so if it came from over top the mountain it would have had to drop approx: 1500 feet to arrive at the height the people reported seeing it at. Or I wondered if  the object had flown from the south, which would have taken it over, or close to the town of Houston, B.C. and then made it&apos;s turn easterly. Another strange thing they mentioned. (a little sketchy here), but their impression of it was that it had a large body  to it. Meaning it wasn&apos;t so much flat, but more raised at the top of it. ( Bulging at the top, but curved if one had blown up a balloon - They could not be completely sure of this, but as I mentioned, it was their impression of how they saw it). The Mom said she hardly slept that night just thinking about it, the fellow didn&apos;t seem to have a problem with it after it was all done and over with. But I could certainly hear the excitmentment in their voices when they spoke about this event. (HBCC UFO Note: Last year for all of 2002, as many of you know I dealt with a large amount of reported sightings. But I did not have many, or any come to think of it, these triangle sighting. This year, 2003 I have had a number of reports of these types of objects flying around my area here in the north, plus sightings from the lower mainland. I am starting to scratch what hair I have left on this bald head wondering what the heck is going on up here. I still am getting reported sightings from local residents, from Houston, Telkwa and Smithers of military vehicles which were running around the area after the July 29, 2002 sighting. Actually the first week in August 2002 when everything started showing up. Also what is interesting is, that more folks are coming forward telling me of all the flights that took place in the first week of August 2002 around these areas. Unmarked aircraft, both fixed wing and helicopters. And folks I can confirm a lot of this as I saw many of these aircraft myself. And they all were flying right over the tree tops, just as if they were looking for something. If that the case or not, I don&apos;t really know. But I have no doubt in my mind something major has, and still is taking place around the pacific northwest here in British Columbia.The witnesses, or most of them I can say are good reliable folks. Matter of fact even a few of the reports have come from people in positions of authority of different kinds. I also know I am only receiving a small fraction of the reports, as every week I hear of another sighting coming from a second or third party member. I don&apos;t bother to report these as I want the actual witness to step forward to give their account of what they saw. But there are still so many who are not wanting to come forward. There has been a few other strange things that have taken place along Highway #16 throughout all the communities and I am working on an article on this as well. Why this area is anyone&apos;s guess. I know one thing for sure, there has been a &quot;ton&quot; of lights/objects seen flying south up over and through the Morice River Valley (or road). Now this may be reaching for the stars, but I am trying to think of everything I can to give me a clue to why so many sightings. Why so many being seen heading in the Morice area. Someone brought up an idea to me, saying that the government had closed a part of the Telkwa mountain range down because they transplanted some Caribou a few years ago to the area. Made me &quot;think&quot;. It may be just that, not wanting the snowmobiles frightening the animals which I certainly can understand, but then again is there possibly another reason.

It was moving slowly(extremely)and being in the passing lane,I crossed over to pull off on the burm to watch it. It was just there moving ever so slightly and it just dissapeared. It was very large,silver and although The  LORD has blessed me to see many UFO&apos;s I&apos;ve never seen any that looked like this. Several days later, my daughter and I were at a food drive-thru in putnam,co and we were waiting for our order when she said,mom is that a star? I said,no, that&apos;s a ufo.It wasn&apos;t until many days later when I was telling a friend about the experience we realized the ufo we were looking at during the drive-thru, were two different ufo&apos;s because the one I saw was red and the one she saw was white(these looked like little circles and did not last long-maybe a minute). I was trying to find the CIA-UFO information to give a report of something from the past that is present now that has to do with our &quot;visitors&quot;.

I&apos;m talking about this experience here for the first time officially. I did not know such a thing as your center existed before today, when I accidentally ended on your page. Well, so I was saying that I went out to watch the starts with my Mom, when -after 20 minutes of observing the sky- we both saw at the same time a sort of light, more intense than this of the stars, but not very neatly. My Mom asked me if I could have an idea on what it could be, but I couldn&apos;t answer, as I was realizing that this light we had just seen seemed to be getting closer and to move in a strange way, like no other planes or helicopters do -- and I know what I&apos;m talking about, as I used to live next to an airport. My Mom&apos;s eyes and mine were stuck on the light, which gradually became a sort of oval-like ship. We also quickly realized that it was shortly followed by 2 others, smaller, but with the same radiance and the same abnormal movement. The whole phenomenon lasted for less than a minute, however I will never forget it. I couldn&apos; believe it, but I had my Mom next who coul tell me that it really happened. We often talk about this speial night together, but only when we are the 2 of us - even my Dad don&apos;t want to hear about it.

They were putting on a show it seemed.  They took off in three different directions, then two of them came back in an arc and passed each other head on. I called out my neighbor, a bell telephone engineer, (&apos;m an Industrial Engineer) to watch, or witness. He was as amazed as I was.

He told us to look up into the sky, the was a bright orange circular object flying in the left hand side of the sky. it was the color of fire. this thing wasn&apos;t flying like any plane or hellicopter i have ever seen, it was almost hovering, then it would move a bit, kind of like a real slow leaf. We reversed out of the parking lot, we wanted to get away from the buildings so that we could get a better look at this thing. as we were backing up it faded then dissapeared. We drove down the road next to the parking lot hoping to see something more. We drove all the way to the end of the  dead end road and turned around all of us staring at the sky. there were buildings on both sides of us but still we had a better view of the sky than just a few minutes before. So we drove slowley back  taword the main Street when all of a sudden  i see the ufo again, i could see it in between the  buildings as we were driving. So V the driver stops and backs up fast, We all see this thing again, he puts the car in park and we all jump out. The thing looked to me that it re-appeared a little more to the left of the sky, i was thinking that no plane could fly that far so quik then just stop and hover.Then the object slowley started flying towards the right hand side of the sky, all of us were trippen out. My friend V pulled out his phone and began calling a few friends. He was talking Loud and fast telling them &quot;Oh My God, Dude go outside and look at the sky, we are looking at a ufo right now&quot; I tryed to get ahold of anyone at my Parents house but nobody was Picking up there phones. So i  then called My girl Friend who lives  Four hours away from me, i told her what i was seeing, she could hear My friends in the background freaking out.All of a sudden i noticed something falling from the ufo, i said to my friends &quot; oh my god! look, its dropping something&quot;,  It started dropping  big bright orange flame looking things from the bottom of it. It looked to me almost like Sparks from a camp fire but real big. it would drop 4 to 6 of these spark looking things at a time then stop for a second and then continue on dropping things, The Sparks were almost the same size as the ufo. I thought to myself &quot;would if its appart of the war going on right now?&quot; i started freaking myself out in my head. The Ufo kept flying and dropping things from it, all the way untill it got to the right hand side of the sky.it then began to fade or dissapear, almost like it flew away so fast it just kinda faded, then a few short second past and it re- appeard, this time it wasnt as bright i dont think, i saw it out of the corner of my left eye, while my eyes were focused about two inches to the right, while i saw that by the corner of my eyes i was focused on another light that appeared, that new light looked just like a star just brighter, it dropped one white shimmering star looking thing, it shot toward the ground and then faded.

Just two flashes of amber light at a very high altitude. The thing that makes this strange--to me and my father anyway--is that we live within 1 mile of an airport, and commonly see planes fly right over our house, and have grown used to it, but these happened one at a time.

Nothing on this airport can go that fast or has that color of light. Like I said almost amber. Plus my dad can fly and work on planes.

I have done an MS Paint document of his recollection of the wing that I am attaching. Again, it is my re-draw of a small sketch he made as he was running out the door. I recall big, round lights, while he recalls trapezium-shaped lights and wings. I recall the round lights, as I said, and drew the wings as round, although I&apos;m not sure they too were. They were definitely not pointed, we both recall (the corners were blunt or rounded).There were no lights on the aircraft other than the three point lights.We think the aircraft was black, but the sky was very dark. We could see the outline of the aircraft clearly. It appeared to be much lower than cruising altitude and appeared large compared to the stars, but not noticeably larger than any aircraft I am aware of (in other words, its size did not stand out). We live close to Boeing field and somewhat near the approach to SeaTac, so we have become accustomed to the altitudes planes are typically at as they pass by our home, whether taking off or landing.  Thank you. -((name deleted))((ADDENDUM #2 FROM WITNESS))Regarding the lights, they were not blinking. They were a dim orange. The stars were white and extremely bright compared to the three lights on the aircraft. They were noticeably dimmer and more matte, if that word makes sense in this context. It was kind of a glow, but without illumination.((END ADDENDA))", "Possible contact with Visitor as a childWhen I was 2 to 4 years old (1968-1970), my mother wrote down in a journal that I had a &quot;pretend friend&quot; whose name was Arjid.

It turned up in one language only, called Manx, meaning &quot;Highness.&quot;  I had no idea what Manx was or where it was spoken. I did some research and found out it is an extinct Gaelic language once spoken on the Isle of Mann off the coast of England. In one of Whitley Strieber&apos;s books, Transformation, that there was a possible connection mentioned between the Gaelic languages and the Visitors. I suspect that maybe I was &quot;visited&quot; at a very young age in Greensburg. There was one other incident, maybe around 1970 or 1971, where I thought I saw a purplish silhouette of a man (or something) standing outside my second story window. He (or it) would have been standing on our sun parlor roof. Anyway, it scared the shit out of me.

It was still twilight at the time.  When it reached a certain portion of the sky in the east, the lights moved into a straight line.  My friend and ran inside to grab our husbands, and over the next 45 minutes we watched 11 more objects with different numbered lights (3- 25), move overhead west to east.  All started in different locations (we didn&apos;t see where, they just appeared out of what seemed nowhere).  But the &quot;tail&quot; lights would start moving back and forth at a certain point of the sky.  I have never seen a UFO before in my life, and neither had anyone else there.  Two of them are lawyers and hardcore skeptics.  But after the sixth craft, there were convinced that it wasn&apos;t any sort of military craft (due to the fact it made no sound and the lights didn&apos;t blink at all). That Sunday I saw one more, but that was it.  It was truly amazing.", "Odd Light in the night sky in mid-MichiganIf you ever see anything remotely unusual in the sky drop whatever you&rsquo;re doing, stop, and take a damn good look! My girlfriend and I were traveling south on Bray road. We were heading home from a late dinner. We crossed Birch Run Road and as we traveled south I noticed a solid bright light in the distant south east sky (possibly 4-6 miles away). The dome shaped light looked to be in the general direction of a cell phone tower which is located on Lewis road just south of Vienna road. At first, because the light was stationary, I thought maybe new lights were added to the tower for some reason (I had never seen the light before). However, the dome shaped light seemed to be something I can only describe as &quot;the typical UFO photo or video&quot;, so I told my girlfriend to slow down. As we moved into a tree line which partially blocked our view I realized the intensity of the light because of the way it broke through the trees. As the tree line thickened it became difficult to see the light. The tree line got very thick and we could no longer see the light ,I told my girlfriend to speed up. The light was gone when we could see the sky again. We decided to retrace the route immediately to see if the light was still in the sky. We drove the same route again, we did not see the same light, it disappeared from where we had seen it.", "Never saw anything like it - If it&apos;s military (ours) is decades ahead of &quot;known&quot; technology!I went outside to take the dog to the bathroom. As Max ran over to &quot;go&quot; I put my hands in my sweatpants pocket and looked up at the sky. It had rained hard last night so I was admiring how nice it was with light clouds spotting the sky and how pretty the stars were. There wasn&apos;t a breeze or any noice other than the dogs collar from walking around. It smelled very fresh out. I noticed out of the corner of my eye what I thought was a bird flying overhead. I looked directly at the object and thought that&apos;s not a bird...&quot;How the heck is that guy hang-gliding around here?&quot; I thought it was a hangglider because of it&apos;s altitude, shape, and lack of noise. Then I said,&quot; Oh my God, what the heck is that?&quot;  I watched the object, perfectly focused for about 6 seconds before it flew into some sparse clouds. I was dumbfounded. I followed the path of the object hoping it would hold it&apos;s course and come out the other end. It didn&apos;t...I thought I saw it circle tightly and turn towards the East. When then all heck broke loose. 4 planes came out of no where and converged on some mountains East of my house; where the object headed. Not sure what kind of planes they were. Then what I thought were two jets (F-16?) off in the north headed over towrds my direction in a sort of glide speed. They made very little noise, but I could still hear the jets. I ran in to tell my wife what had just happened. Grabbed the binoculars and ran back outside, she came outside for a second to look, but went back in because it was cold for her. I watched the sky intensly for awhile (1 to 2 minutes) and watched for the craft. , ran into the garage, grabbed the ladder and climbed onto the roof. There were alot of aircraft over new the mountain range. Two passenger jets went over head slightly west of me (their flight for SFO) Another jet (F-16?) came into view, southwest of where the object first glided over head. He headed into the clouds the object went into which had now blowed over the mountain range and disappeared. I then head a helicopter over in the area...it held it&apos;s course thorugh the clouds heading North toward the Oakland airport. All of this was amazing!!! i still cannot believe it, but I swear I saw this object and I have NEVER seen anything like it in all of the military programs I have seen on cable stations. I had one beer while I bar-b-q&apos;ed salmon and finished the same one with dinner. I do not use drugs!  I called Coast to Coast a.m. and got on the air with George and told most of my story....up until I got onto the roof.

UFO&apos;s to me, are fascinating, they do &quot;exactly what they say on the tin&quot; - THEY ARE OBJECTS THAT FLY (OR LAND) THAT CAN BE SEEN, AND ARE UNIDENTIFIED AS ANY KNOWN CRAFT.Well thats-that out of my system, I am actually posting this due to my experience this evening.Its currently 2.27am here in Loanhead (near Edinburgh Scotland)and is testiment to the fact that something DID appear in the sky near my home earlier tonight.  As it happened I was visiting my mum (Its was Mothers Day 30/03 here in the UK, my mum lives 5 mins from my house).  Me and my mum were chatting and she decided to show me a room in her house she had recently decorated, while upstairs we looked out of the rear window overlooking the Moorfoot Hills looking towards Gorebridge when we noticed what I thought was a firework fairly high in the not so distant sky.  We both looked at it, and I soon realised that the &quot;firework&quot;; was more like a flare, as the extremely bright pink glow did not fade at all; as it stayed stationary in the sky approx 1 mile away. Slowly, but still glowing bright pink, the object floated slowly to the ground and passed behind the dark horizon of our line of sight(there are fields and a valley, all of which were in complete darkness at that time of the evening).  I sat and spoke to my mum for a few minutes about it and then what appeared to be a very bright blue flashing light - like the type on a police car - roughly in the same direction. I must point out that to me the blue light did not seem all that unusual, it did really just seem like a blue &quot;earthly light&quot; flashing brighty in the distance.  But the previous Pink light was far from that, we originally thought it may have been a helicopter but we realised that it was completely silent.

It flew toward us then hovered about 100 ft (I don&apos;t judge distance well but it was close) over us.  It was almost as if it was watching us or wanted us to see it.  Then it suddenly flew away in the opposite direction.  I can&apos;t remember because it was so long ago but it had lights inside that either dimmed when it hovered or dimmed when it flew away.  We were teenagers and I never told my parents as I thought they&apos;d think I was crazy, but one of the other witnesses told her mother.  Her mother said she&apos;d listened to a police scanner the night we saw it and heard a beach deputy come on the radio and state that he had also seen something.  She said he made a comment about not believing what he saw so it was obvious that it was something very unusual.((NUFORC Note:  We have assigned an arbitrary time and date.

However, I can remember EVERY second of the actual event.Reading is appx 50 miles west of London, and was on the flight path for Concorde coming into Heathrow.  As it was so close to landing at the time it went overhead, it was very low in the sky, and extremely loud.  Our windows would shake, and phone conversations were impossible for the 20-30 seconds that Concorde was passing overhead.This particular day was warm, bright blue skies, with a little wispy broken white cloud.  Very clear, very bright.  Myself and appx 5-8 other children were watching Concorde go over, as we always did.Someone called out:  &quot;What&apos;s that?  Is that a helicopter?&quot; Someone else: &quot;Thats NOT a helicopter!&quot; It was in fact a classic silver disc.  It was flying alongside Concorde (elevations are impossible to judge, but that was the impression).  It flew alongside Concorde, matching it perfectly, for about 30-40 seconds.It then flew off (flew is the wrong term - it shot off like a bullet!) at a right-angle to it&apos;s previous direction of flight.  It flew away and up until it vanished into the clouds.My brother and I have since independently remembered TWO further events (one while we were at dinner with Budd Hopkins at the Leeds UFO conference funnily enough!).  One was a traingle of white lights hovering over the car, and the other was a bright blue sphere hovering over some woods visible from our (shared) bedroom window at 4.01 am in the morning.  Both of these events were since forgotten, and we independently remembered particular details which agreed.  The concorde sighting has always been crystal clear in my memory.A couple of years ago I was remembering the Concorde event.  Shortly afterwards I returned to Reading to visit relatives.  I bumped into a friend who I hadn&apos;t seen in about 12 years - but I remembered him being there in that playground.  Before we could talk about anything else, I said &quot;This&apos;ll sound weird - do you remember back at Westwood Farm (the school) looking up at Concorde and seeing something?&quot; He instantly said &quot;Yeah - a silver disc that shot off&quot; I replied &quot;Thank you, I didn&apos;t imagine it!&quot;((FOLLOW-UP CORRESPONDENCE WITH WITNESS))Peter,Thanks very much for coming back to me - I have submitted this report to various places before, but never had a single response!  Thanks.I will try my best with your questions:1)  &quot;At the time of your sighting, which side of the Concorde were you viewing, the right, or left?&quot;- I was on the ground looking straight up at it as it passed overhead.  EG if I was facing West, it was flying west, and therefore would have been travelling from &apos;behind&apos; us, overhead, and away in front of us into the distance.2) &quot;Also, where was the disc, relative to the Concorde, e.g. &quot;above&quot; or &quot;below&quot; the aircraft, as you faced it, or ahead or behind it?&quot;- It&apos;s hard to judge relative vertical distances from the ground looking straight up.  But the impression that we all had was that it was flying right alongside.  If that was the case, I don&apos;t see how passengers could have missed it!3) &quot;In addition, can you provide a detailed description of how the disc moved, relative to the aircraft, i.e. from what direction did it approach; if it hovered close to the aircraft, where was it located; where did the disc go, relative to the flight path of the aircraft?&quot;- We didn&apos;t see it approach unfortunately.  When we all looked up at the concorde it was already there.  Someone spotted it and said &quot;What&apos;s that? Is that a helicopter?&quot;  Once it had been pointed out it was glaringly obvious, as it was shiny silver.  It flew right alongside the plane, matching it&apos;s speed perfectly, and then flew off very fast at a right angle to it&apos;s previous flight direction.  It may also have been going up at this point, as it disappeared into some clouds.4) &quot;Also, what was the relative size of the disc, compared, for example to the diameter of the fuselage of the aircraft?&quot;- I have attached a (very poor - forgive me!) picture which should indicate the relative sizes.  It was considerably smaller than the plane, but still large enough to be clearly seen.I have heard you ask people on the Jeff Rense show to do the arms&apos; length description?  I have tried this, and would estimate that at arm&apos;s length Concorde would have been appx as long as my thumb at the height it was.  It used to go over pretty low!  The picture (sorry again!) shows the size relative to that.  The dotted line is the departure angle it took.I hope this helps you to get a picture of the event.  I know how hard it is to picture it without seeing it, as it&apos;s so clear to me!The other witness I have mentioned isn&apos;t really a friend, just someone I was at school with.  Apart from that chance encounter a few years back we&apos;ve never spoken since school.  He was pretty taken aback when this was the first thing I asked him about!  However, I will try my best to find out where he is now and ask him to submit a report.Best regards,  ((name deleted))((END))((NUFORC Note:  We have seen some dramatic video footage of a disc flying beside the Concorde on its maiden flight, although we believe it was taken sometime during July 1976.

It was Triangular in shape with three large round lights in each corner of the craft were rounded.   I watched as it silently  glided across the sky for approximately 30 seconds as it headed South.  I believe that there was most like several crafts  that I saw enter our atmosphere however, I only viewed one close up.   Definitely no mistake about this, the craft was to low to mistake it for anything other than what it was a UFO.  I could not take my eyes off the one I was looking at.

After i had been out there for about 10 minutes i began to hear the horses at the other end. It sounded like they were kicking the sheet metal and squealing loudly. I stood up to see if i could look down to the end of the pasture to see what was causing the horses trouble. I could also hear dogs barking in the distance, it sounded like hundreds of them. Just as i was straining to see the horse shelter at the other end, horse and dogs quieted and became silent, no movement, sounds, or anything. It was more quiet than before all the commotion. I started to get a scared burning feeling in my chest and felt the hairs on the back of my neck tingle. after maybe a few seconds of the erie quiet i heard a whirring sound,it was real low and deep, and not loud. I stepped off the porch and i saw a light flash on the ground in the middle of the pasture. i looked up and about a hundred feet off the ground was a black craft hovering and shooting flashes of light at the ground from a pod on the right end of the craft. The craft had a multicolored mist or hot looking gas on the bottom of it. on the left side of the craft was what looked to be a rectangular red window. I thought it was a window because i thought i saw movement inside of it. After i saw movement i began to feel sick.

There is also an airport in Old Town for local flyers. The three of us observed there was no sound at all.

It was travelling right up the street at approximately 100 MPH. There was a 1000 foot overcast and it was about 200 feet below that. I estimated it to be 40 feet in diameter. I could see no propellor, control surfaces or landing gear. As it was passing overhead, the noise got so loud that I put my hands over my ears, but it did not help at all! I can now compare the noise to an unending stream of fifty-caliber rounds passing close by. At the time, I was fourteen years old and had just started flying lessons.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

But suddenly that one bright light became to less bright lights, and they were fast moving troughout the sky, they made a cirle-kind shape. suddenly they stopped and the light vanished. we could see them clearly now. It were two very smooth airlined silver aircrafts, and i mean silver,shiny metal. you could see the light of town ond the bellow of the ships. and then as suddenly as they appeared, they disappeared with a bright trail, probably the engines.

I turned to the left adjacent to the laundry room and saw this craft.  I was stunned and also quite surprised.  I was scared and walked down the hallway into my family room.  The drone craft moved silently toward the spot where I was just standing. I began to observe the motion of this craft.  It was spinning silently counterclockwise.  I said to myself, it looks like an old-fashioned top.  It had a long grayish, granite looking cylinder at the bottom with notches at the end.  The color of the drone craft was a burnt brown color, almost like an amber color.  There were gold tones with light glowing from inside.  Each rib on the top had a formation of what appeared to be hexagon or honeycomb shape.  The very top had a grayish or charcoal surface. Since I was in the family room, I panicked and realized I was trapped.  The funny thing was I walked back into the hallway and got down low to go under this drone craft and it moved out of the way. The drone craft appeared to be looking inside my house.  Looking in the living room, the bathroom and then into the family room.  I went to look for a camera, but when I came back.  It was gone.

The object was moving to fast to be a civilian plane or a commercial plane at the altitude that I was looking at. I would have seen some type of wings, the rate at which the object was flying was extremely fast which is what got my attention other wise I would have just dismissed it as a plane that was going to land at the airport given the time of day.  The object came across the sky and then stop for about 5 seconds from the angle that I was view the object would have put it just south of the Lancaster airport but still in the airspace of the airport. The object was stationary for about five seconds then started to move east again slowly and then just took off out of my view to fast for my eyes to follow. When I first spotted the object it was a silver dot and as it moved closer the object started to take shape I could see that it was an sphere and the object was silver in color. It was definitely not an airplane. There were no lights that I could see.

We live out of the city, in a more rural, mountainous area.  The overseas flights from Bangor International Airport fly overhead and from my home we see/hear them passing above daily.  My first thought was that this was a late, redeye flight but the plane moved too quickly across the sky. I was about 1+ mile from the Hatcase Pond Road (formerly the South Road).  As I ascended the crest of a steep hill in the road this plane went zooming overhead.  I sped the car up trying to see out the front and passenger window in the direction that it was heading and I didn&apos;t see anything.  I then drove faster to the next field/clearing on the right (about a quarter to .5 miles further)to see it and instead of being far away it was slowly flying over the field.  This scared me so I drove faster towards home, still looking to the right above the tree line and was shocked to see that the UFO was hovering above the clearing at the end of the South Road (another .5 mile or so away).  I slammed on the brakes and was mesmerized by the shape and lights.  I could see it completely as I leaned over the passenger seat of my car and looked out the window.  It was triangular shaped and appeared black against the night sky except for blue circular lights which seemed to line the edge of the ship.

The lights were steady glowing and very bright.  I slowed to try to determine whether or not they were moving and found they were definately moving from east to west very slowly.  I could&apos;nt tell if it was just one object or five separate ones until I stopped my car and got out.  It did appear to be one solid object. It also appeared to be very large.  I would estimate at least a quarter mile wide at the back part.  I continued to observe the object as I drove into the city limits of Smithland.

We arrived at the beach shortly before midnight. The water was strange that night. If you placed your hand under the surface and churned the water it would glow a light green. Treading the water with our feet caused the same effect. I felt like I was witnessing a miracle. Shortly before dawn(about 5am)all of us simulataneously looked to the sky and noticed what looked like a falling star. It descended into the atmosphere and headed straight towards the bulkhead of the thunderstorms hovering over the Gulf that had been threatening to rain us out.  The three of us watched quitely as this object pulsed and spun at an amazing rate of speed, flashing colors of red, blue, purple, white. This object then began to &quot;play&quot; with the storm, circling the bulkhead. I told my husband it appeared to be drawing energy from the bulkhead as it would grow brighter when it would approach the storm. Several times it disappered into the storm. After about 20 minutes we noticed a second object hovering near the storm. It never approached the storm, but was the same size, pulsing with the same colors as the first object. We watched these objects for about an hour. When sun&apos;s light began to fill the sky all of the stars disappeared, but these two objects remained faintly visible. We continued to watch them until even they were no longer visible. On the ride home we all agreed that it felt as if they knew we were there and had allowed us to witness this event.((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION WITH WITNESS))Dear Mrs. ((name deleted)), Thank you very much for your interesting report! The illumination coming from the water probably was due to a phenomenon called, &quot;phospho-luminescence.&quot;  It is caused when micro-organisms in the water are disturbed at night...they give off a soft, whitish-blue or greenish light, and it is beautiful.  If you ever take a cruise on a large ocean vessel in waters where luminescence is present, for a beautiful view of the phenomenon, I suggest you stand on the fantail and look at the wake behind the ship.  It is beautiful!!  With regard to the streaking light, it may have been a meteorite, although we will never know for sure. The hovering bright lights may have been celestial bodies...stars or planets.  There are some very bright, quite colorful &quot;twinkling&quot; stars in the morning sky during the fall, so that may be the explanation for those objects you saw.  Generally, a genuine UFO does not hang around for an hour, or so, although there are exceptions to that statement that we know about. Thank you very much for sharing the information with our Center! Cordially, Peter Davenport((END))((RESPONSE FROM WITNESS))Thank you very much for your response to my report, however I have witnessed at least five meteorites enter our atmosphere, throwing off a bright florescent green tails behind them as they came.  One of them was only 500 yards above our heads and fell into a Ryder Truck parking lot, a chain link fence topped with razor wire being the only thing that kept us from retrieving it.  The &quot;falling star&quot; I spoke of had no tail  At first it was the size of the stars, moving in an arch across the sky, but it soon descended into Earth&apos;s atmosphere and headed straight towards the thunderstorm.  A planet or &quot;celestial body&quot; does not whirl about in space, pulsing and appearing to grow larger/brighter as it approached the bulkhead.  If Mars would be the size of a grain of sand, what we saw was approximately the size of a lintel/pea held at arms length.  We distinctly saw the oval shape of the object and that it appeared to spin on an axis and pulsate between and oval shape and a circle, flashing colors of purple, blue, red, and white.  I hadn&apos;t browsed through sightings listed on your website before I filed my report, and now that I have I realize that what we witnessed doesn&apos;t even compare to most sightings, and due to your response to my report I fear you won&apos;t post it on your sightings page.  Which is why I would like to revise a few sentences in my report if possible, adding that the &quot;falling star&quot; had no tail and I said &quot;star&quot; because when we noticed it, it was the size of the stars, but grew larger as it entered our atmosphere.  I would like to thank you for clearing up our questions about the water that night, this phenomenon being the second most beautiful thing I&apos;ve witnessed during my life.  Please respond and let me know if I can revise a few of my statements or re-file the report with the statements I&apos;ve added here.  I would hate to think one of the few people in the world who would believe in what we saw would discredit our report due to my inability to express the moment as clearly as possible.Thank you very much for your time and patience.

The hole in the center was 3-5 feet in diameter.  About 100 feet in the air, it traveled Eastward approxmately 25 mph on it&apos;s edge and then made an amazing 90 degree turn moving away from me.  It then appeared to be 2-3 feet thick.  It traveled about 2-3 seconds and then again made a 90 degree turn; resuming it&apos;s original course.  I looked around briefly to see if anyone else was around me and of course, no one was.  I looked at it again and it began to make a slight parabolic turn and disappeared behind some hills in the park. The object made no noise during the entire incident. I told no one of this incident.  About 60 days later, I was going to Seattle (from McChord AFB) with my boss who began to recant a story when she and her family went to Seattle Lake for the 4th of July.  She began to explain that she saw something in the air.  Before she could finish, I described the object to her.  We were both amazed that we saw the same thing.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that it was &quot;dusk&quot; at &quot;17:30 hrs..&quot;  However, it should still be light at that time of day, so we will attempt to clarify that apparent discrepancy with him.

My wife (the other witness) on the other hand is a staunch, hardcore disbeliever in anything of the sort.  This event has shaken her belief system.My wife and I were lying in bed when she noticed strange red lights outside our bedroom. There were 12-15 red lights.  She describes them as being in a straight line - I saw them as slightly staggered.  The lights moved across our field of vision (south to north) at what seemed like a very slow pace.  The lights seems to be fixed relative to one another - although I thought I might have noticed them moving up and down slightly (could have been my eyes playing tricks on me).  The lights were VERY low on the horizon - so low that they were hidden from view when they moved behind the house across the street.  There was no sound accompanying the lights.  It took ~ 2 minutes for the lights to disappear from view.  They seemed to move at a more or less constant speed throughout the event.After a few seconds of &quot;what the hell is that&quot; conversation - I ran to get my video camera and went on the front porch to see if I could capture anything on film.  I pointed the camera at the lights and filmed the last 15 seconds - but unfortunatly I can see anything on the film when I view it.I called the local new stations to see if they knew anything.  The woman in the newsroom at WNYT informed me that she had had other reports of strange lights near the Albany airport (~5 miles south of where I saw them).  Called back again in the morning and was told that they had made a few calls (meterologists, police, airport etc.) but could not provide an explanation.The only explanation I can think of for this event is that we saw navigation lights from a formation of planes way off on the horizon.  Some problems that I see w/ this explanation: -  That&apos;s just not what it looked like.  My wife and I discussed and dismissed this possibility as we were viewing the event.-  Why didn&apos;t the folks at WNYT validate this explanation when they investigated? -  There was no sound.", "one was v shaped then cloaked,the other one was round orange and hugeI myself did not see this event but eye witness accounts say that their snowmachines stopped running when they spotted this craft.Other people were saying that it was a orange fireball ( comet) that crashed in the area known as shabaqua corners.Just outside of Thunderbay this area is known for strange events such as 6 to 7 plane crashes in the last 10 years.

It looked like it was flying due west.  There was no sound.  Then it made an L-shaped turn north where it looked like it slowed around Kispiox Village ( for maybe 30 seconds ) at which time I was seeing it through the binoculars. It was not that high up. And still no sound.  As soon as it was exactly west of me I watched with the eyes until it was behind the trees.  This was all within about 3-4 minutes total at the most.We have the jets going to Alaska around 11:30 am which are very high up. Also they come from the southeast and go right over the house here and leave the Kispiox Valley heading in a northwestern straight line.So that is why I thought maybe a satellite because of its unusual flight pattern, almost as thought it was going to Terrace, then decided to head up the Kispiox Valley on the western side of the valley.I appreciate your interest in this matter.

It was a beautiful day, I was laying on the beach with my head on my girlfriends lap.  She was sitting up so her shadow was covering my face which allowed me to remove my sunglasses and marvel at the blue, cloudless sky without having to squint my eyes.  I noticed a line of smoke form, not unlike the exhaust of a jet plane but much lower as I could see the billows forming at the front and being left behind as the trail continued to grow.  It took me only one second to realize that there was no plane in front to cause this and as my stomach tightened to sit up, out of the front shot a black triangle spinning clockwise.  It spun two-thirds of the way around and stopped dead.

PD))", "Crash Rocks Little MenstrieAt around 9 o clock GMT on the 31 March 2003 a UFO crashed in the Ochil Hills near Stirling (Scotland).  The crash took place in the small town of Menstrie where the emergence services were present.

I was 15 years old at the time. Below are the details of the sighting. One evening in 1974, during the first week of September, myself and two friends were sitting up on the roof of my Mom and Dad&apos;s house (we would go up there for a cigarette every now and again - typical kids). It would have been about 8:30 to 9:00 PM at night - the sky was extremely clear that night. I had both my hands behind my head and was resting my head against the shingles on the roof (the roof is at angle of approx. 35 - 40 degrees). I saw a UFO - it was a perfect triangle with a white light on each point of the triangle. There were trails coming off the back two points of the triangle. The triangle was pitch black and blocked out the stars above it as it flew over top of me - it would have been about as high in the sky as a jetliner. I remember trying to convince myself at that time that maybe it was a meteor or a group of meteors of some sort (or even some sort of reflection) but I kept reminding myself that it actually blocked out the stars above me as it flew over top of me. It COULDN&apos;T have been a meteor or a reflection. It was definitely NOT a plane. I was a smart enough kid back then to know the difference. The triangle flew in a southwesterly direction, from northeast to southwest very, very quickly - much faster than a jetliner but slow enough to see some details. Definitely slower than any meteorite I have ever seen. I can still picture it as clear as day when I think of the sighting some 30 years later. I jumped down off the roof and went flying into the house yelling to my Mom and Dad &apos;I just saw a UFO!&apos;. It was so significant to me at that time that I actually wrote down what I saw and even drew a picture of it in one of my notebooks. I remember my Mom and Dad and I calling the Saskatoon Airport that night but the airport indicated that they had received no other reports. This was something I had never seen before and have never seen since. Having been interested in UFO&apos;s ever since that time, I recently obtained a copy of Timothy Good&apos;s book, Above Top Secret. Amazingly (which is why I am reporting this to you now, this many years later) - in Chapter 8 (Canada), I came across these two incidents in Good&apos;s book:  Page 200 &quot;...in July 1974 a Scandinavian airlines captain flying 35 to 40 miles southeast of Quebec City reported a triangular shaped object moving in a southwesterly direction...&quot;  Page 200 - 201 &quot;...on 10 October 1974, John Breen, a Canadian armed forces pilot, was paced by a UFO over Newfoundland, en route from Deer Lake to Gander. A passenger flying with him noticed a strange light following the plane when they were about 50 miles from Gander. Every time Breen looked at the light, it seemed to turn off but finally he got a better view of it. It seemed to be a sort of triangle - or delta shaped, luminescent greenish light following us...&quot;  Date-wise, my sighting falls in between the two above sightings. The triangle I saw was moving fast enough that it could very well have been in Quebec or in Newfoundland a few minutes beforehand (although the date of 10 October 1974 in Good&apos;s book is approx. 4 weeks after my sighting occurred). I drew a GIF animation of what I saw and will attach it to an e-mail using the address you&apos;ve given below.", "my camera caught this, not me.took a random picture off the balcony of my friends&apos; apartment in san diego.  to capture the view.    took the picture on a digital camera.  unknown &quot;blob&quot; on the screen.  does not fit with other smog/smoke clouds.  bright sunshine, which means fast shutter speed.  the object must have been traveling at a high speed to appear blurry in the photo.  give me an address to email my photo to.((NUFORC Note:  We have provided an address to the witness.

I know what different planes sound like and i can pretty much guarantee it wasn&apos;t commercial or civialian. I didn&apos;t see lights that stood out on any of the corners, just what looked more like about 7-11 objects with a shadowy kinda light moving at high speed in a southerly direction at high altitude, and they didn&apos;t make any discernable noise  So it could be one object with only its leading edge lit up or maybe it was several", "sliver bulletIt looked like a bullet....it was really really wide and i looked at it then blinked and it was gone..((NUFORC Note:  No other information provided by witness.

I was too young (about 7 1/2 years old at the time) to remember the exact month however, I know that it was warm because my parents took my sister and I to the local drive-in movie theater.  This theater was located in the town of Bridge Hampton.    Bridgehampton is located to the east of Brookhaven National Laboratory.  The orientation of the screen was so that the patrons of the theater were facing west towards Brookhaven. The night was clear and warm with a spattering of stars in the sky.  The contrast between the screen and the night sky was stark.  The sky over the screen was jet black except for the stars.  I really don&apos;t have an idea of what time that it was however, I would have to say that it was probably between 9:30 and 10:00pm.  The object was only observed for less then a second however, it appeared as a Bright yellow white light (about as bright as the planet saturn).  The object moved straight down at a high rate of speed until it disappeared.  It was in a dive of about 170 degrees.  The object oscillated or zig-zagged down behind the movie screen.  The sighting was swift yet did give a clear image of the light and its rapidly zig-zagging movement.  The reason that I associate this sighting with Brookhaven is because it was definitely in the direction of Brookhaven or West Hampton that had a mmilitary airbase that is still in use.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was very obvious that there were three triangular lights hovering above.  Why the two girls in my car could not see it I have no idea.  The lights stayed in one spot and I kept driving and they did not follow.  I wasn&apos;t sure what to think.  I was not on any drugs nor was I drinking.

It was July 1988, the 2nd to last wednesday of that month.  Around 6:30 pm, I was putting a full teapot of water on my stove when I looked up, out the window that faced Rt. 17M.  I lived next to a white victorian home across from the cemetary, in a little rental bungalow.  It had been raining and as I looked out the window, above the telephone and electrical wires was a slow moving triangular shaped object with yellow, green and white lights in each corner of the object.  I dropped the teapot, tore open the kitchen door and ran out in my socks across the front lawn.  The object disappeared behind the victorian house and in the few seconds it took me to race to the edge of the shoulder of the road, the object disappeared.  My fiance at the time, had come outdoors behind me, questioning what I had been doing....and I told him.  About a minute later, to the east of us (towards Middletown, NY) there was a bright flash of light that seemed to have come from the behind the mountain to our right...a few miles down Rt. 17M.   There was not a sound around, everything was silent, not the sound of crickets or anything and the air felt strange, almost electrified.I ran inside the house, and called the Middletown State Police Barracks, Troop F and reported the siting.  The officer who answered the telephone explained that he had already received several phone calls reporting the same siting.The next morning, as I went to work at George&apos;s Deli (now VEO mart) in Bullville, I opened the store as the a.m. opening shift, at 5:30 am.  The Times Herald Record, for Thursday morning, had a front page article on the siting, stating that a little over 250 telephone calls had come in the previous night, reporting the siting.  Stuart Airport was said to have sent out a flight test mission of 7 fighter planes practicing, yet it was not accurate, because Stuart Airport was known, for years, to have done test missions on the last Thursday of the month.  This was just one object that was reported and for a government airplane, which makes a great deal of noise, it was not of our making, that I am sure.  ( I had seen a triangular shaped object 2 years prior, while hanging out with a friend at cowhill in Chester/Sugarloaf, NY about a 30 minute drive east of Middletown).  My friend and I watched this object from the mountain top for 15 minutes, it did not move when suddenly it just shot off in an upward direction and disappeared.  We chalked it up to an LSD flashback from our partying days as we had both watched it but thought we had both seen something that did not exist.The second incident that I would like to report, occurred in Sussex, NJ on July 15, 1995.  I had been heading towards Newton, NJ, to attend classes at Sussex County Community College.  I was driving my vehicle on Rt. 23, about 1/4 mile passed the Sussex County Airport.  The time was about 5:15 p.m.  To my right, above the trees was a triangular shaped object moving a bit faster than my speed of 45 m.p.h.  It was a dark colored object, dull in texture.  There was no sound coming from the object as it stayed approximately 2 car lengths ahead of me to the right.  I sped up to try to get even with it, but to no avail, I could not.  When I reached the intersection that led to Space Farms, to my right (I have been out of NJ now since September, 1996 and I do not remember the name of that road), the object suddenly took off at a speed I had witnessed before in Chester/Sugarloaf, NY.  In a blink of an eye, it disappeared, in the direction of Newton, NJ (it passed over the Sussex County Fair Grounds where I noticed a similar report had been made regarding the witnesses at the rodeo) and was gone.  Amazed, I stopped at a friend&apos;s place in Newton, a block before the community college to tell her and her husband about it (her husband is retired Air force officer), she told me she too saw the same object only moments before I arrived, and that it too had disappeared...she explained, over the college towards Port Jervis, NY direction.I have had other unexplainable incidents in my childhood, yet as an adult, I have also seen many, sometimes alone and other times, with witnesses.  I would like to explain the other details of other events, if you are interested, please contact me at email address provided in form and I would be more than happy to divulge the information, times, dates and accounts as well as witnesses.((NUFORC Note:  We will encourage the witness to resubmit her reports, using one Online Report Form per incident, so that they sort according to their respective dates.

I was staring at the sky for satelites with my Girlfriend and her brother, lying in the grass. It is common to see non-geostationary satelites in the sky at night when the sun reflects on their panels and they move rather quickly in the sky as little dots. We saw some 10 satelites that night but one of them is to remain in our memories. We don&apos;t know how or why nor whether it was an optical illusion, but all of a sudden, looking at one of these satelites, it changed direction from a 90 degrees angle and drew a square and several other polygones before changing direction for a last time and moving towards the horizon to dissapear in the light of the nearby city. We never told anyone about this strange satelite until a few days ago when I heard a similar story from a friend of mine living in Vendee (France) and who is a professional astronomer. I thought he would have an answer to that phenomenon, since he is the kind of guy who can point randomly to a star and name it and since he knows a lot about astrophysics and space exploration, but he couldn&apos;t say what it was exactly. We are quiet sure it wasn&apos;t a plane since it was moving to quickly into the sky and was too high to be one. The only possible explanation we have found is that some satelites we never heard of can very quickly modify their trajectory through the sky. If this is not the case, then it is still an Unidentified Flying Object to us and, without being a strong believer of extra terrestrial phenomenon, I have some doubt whether this object in the sky was human made.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It caught his attention for several minutes, but being a confirmed skeptic, he laughingly thought of what it could possibly be.  Suddenly he was distracted by a rustling in the bushes nearest to him from the field.  He soon found out that the rustling was just birds getting up.  So he tried to to watch the sphere again, but it had moved more to south.  But when had finally found it again, it was standing still.

It appeared to have a scalloped texture to it, and was quite large-I was viewing it from about a mile away, and it was as large as the sun.  This object was obscured by clouds that were slowly moving north, while it was moving gradually south at a slow pace, as if it was a cloud and not a giant boomerang made of light.  I was 16 when I saw this object, and had quite a nice view three stories up from a panoramic window in a public library.  There was one other person around sitting by the window, but she never looked up from her book.  There were also cloud formations near this object that were very strange.  To the north of the UFO was a perfectly circular hole in a very large cloud that hung over the northwestern part of the downtown area, and in the center of the hole it looked like a rocket had taken off and flown through the direct center of the hole and left a trail of emissions from behind.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "At work, approx 5:00am (still dark out) I was smoking a cigarette outback with a co-worker when I saw a large bright circular light moving in the (northern) sky. It suddenly grew dimmer as it moved away at a high rate of speed. About 30 seconds after I spoke to the person with me about what I had just seen, it appeared again and I was able to point it out in time for my co-worker to see it, just as it sped away growing dimmer. The dimming effect I&apos;m assuming was caused by it moving away at a rapid rate of speed.", "Three moving, turning lightnings going to one direction who than suddenly dissapearedI&apos;m 18 years old now, when I had the experience, I was 11 years old. I live at the border of the city Antwerp, Belgium. I was in the garden in front of our house. It was allmost midnight and was giving water to the flowers at the front-door. I had my face to the door, as my brains suddenly &quot;noticed&quot; that there was something to see at my left side, because there was light shining in my left-eye. So I directly looked at the left, and I still don&apos;t know what I saw... There were three lights, in the formation of a triangle, they did NOT chance their colours, and there was NO light in the middle of those three other lights. When I looked at those lights, it was like th u.f.o. &quot;noticed&quot; that, because the three lights were turning like a circle and was moving slow to the right. After let&apos;s say 2-3 seconds they slowly dissapeared, I don&apos;t know the Enlgish word for that: they were just suddenly gone, like a candle that goes out... It was really weird, because it seemed like the lights just strted to move as I looked, and even mor weird is, suppose that that is the fact, the lights were approximately 30 - 40 houses further... I remember that I slept with a knife in bed for several weeks... I was really scared at the beginning, but now not anymore, if it really was extraterrestial life that&apos;s intelligent, then they wanted that they were spot... That&apos;s what I think... I know it&apos;s a long time ago for me, but I know what I saw, I&apos;m not the person that reads a lot of u.f.o. books and stuff and I&apos;ve got a normal life...

While watching two eagles soaring overhead my wife noticed a silver object shining in the sky directly overhead. She pointed it out to me and asked what I thought it was. At first I thought it was sunlight reflecting off a geostationery satelite, although I had never seen this type of phenomena before. The altitude of the shining disc was estimated to be that of a satelite which is normaly seen in the night sky. We both viewed the stationery object for a few minutes before sighting it through a pair of binoculars. There was very little to add to the above explanation except that what I considered to be reflected light was seen to be closer due to the magnification. After about 15 minutes with absolutly no movement of the object I decided to capture it on video. I fitted a telephoto lens to the camera but battled to sight the object through the viewfinder. I had been out camping in the area for two weeks taking footage of the trip. It was at this moment when I needed the camera that the battery went flat, hence no video. It would not have been of much use anyway as all it would have shown was a dab of silver light against a blue background. We both continued to rick our necks looking directly above us at this object. Having seen all these spy movies on TV I then thought it was big brother looking in, so I pulled a couple of zap signs at it. My wife went into the tent for a few moments and when she came back out, asked if I could still see it. I was using the binoculars and could see it clearly. The next instant it started moving in a westerly direction picking up speed as it went. My wife asked me where to look. I did not take my eyes off the accelerating light, but said just follow the binoculars. The object moved through a 90&deg; arc in approximatly 15 seconds where I lost sight of it behind some bushes at the back of our tent. I estimated its speed to be at least ten times faster than the satelites I have seen in the night sky. I d! on&apos;t kno w if we have anything on our planet than can hover at great altitude for the 30 minutes that I observed it and then accelerate to a guesstamate speed of some 270 000 km/p/h. I have always thought there might be ET&apos;s out there and if you cannot give some form of sane explanation to this one then I am convinced I saw a UFO.", "Broad daylight, very close object with a pink light , manta? flaps.When I was digging the vegetable plot n object about the size of a car i.e. approx.8-12ft wide came out from behind roof of houses across the road from myself and partner.  I yelled &quot;UFO&quot; and got my partner to watch it as I ran for my camera.  The object was about 100-13-feet away.  It looked oval with an underneath part which revolved and had a pink/red flashing light.   It looked tatty, black, and the two ends of the oval almost flapped like the fins of a manta ray would move.  It was a clumsy looking object though and just seemed to float. I went out my front door with the camera but the object was a dot in the sky by then, I started clicking anyway. For that couple of minutes there was no traffic and the street seemed quiet.  I ran across to the neighbours house and watched it with two more people.   One of them said it was a kid&apos;s balloon because he could see the string.   He&apos;d only been watching it for a minute and had rushed outside for a look when he saw me running with my camera.

We were outside (Me,my friend and his friend) and we had opened up a camper and got power going to it so we could listen to the radio and turn the lights on,they did that while i built a fire. We had been standing outside for about 30 min when i saw something in the sky about 3 miles away. When i saw it the craft seemed to be comeing down and was glowing bright red as if it were hot. My friend told me that it was common to see such things in the sky about that time and that it was &quot;Nothing New&quot; to them. At that point my friends friend which to be blunt was a retard decided to pick up a spot light connected to the campers power supply and flash the thing four or five times. After he did that the craft stoped glowing and looked JUST like a star,he flashed it again a few times. At that point the craft started to move over to where we were with great speed. The first thought that came into my mind wasent a good one and what my friends friend had done was a very bad thing. Being 17 and them 12 left me in control to take some kind of action and ideas for escape or hideing started to flow into my mind. One thought was that maybe their tracking systems (Advanced of course) used heat,not the fact we had a huge fire going.As the object got closer i moved us to a tree were we hid around it as the craft approached. This was from the idea that maybe trees take in body heat and that it was rather cold outside. So here we are huddled up around a tree trying to hide from this thing. As it came right over us the dogs nearby stoped barking and the radio staion changed along with the lights blinking. What i heard on the radio scared me the most. It sounded like talking but not anything we know on our planet. The thing as i said was right over us and almost appeared to be confused(like it was looking for us). it moved around the tree about mile or so above it and we moved with it to try to stay out of its sight. I could see ! it very clearly. It was triangle shaped with 3 lights on the edges of it. it hovered over us for about 15 min before the sounds comeing in on the radio changed and sounded like ones you would hear from a Air Force dispatch. It was hard to make out as it sounded like the person talking was rushing. At that time (and this is what got my eye) the craft seemed to tilt up a little and three blue like rings went over the surface and it shot out to space at a a VERY fast speed. A few mins later jets and bigger planes littered the sky. Call me crazy but i get &quot;Feelings&quot; about things. things i read or see and i got a spine chilling one from that craft as if it were comeing to get us.when we went back in the camper the radio which was not digital (old turn knobs)staion had been changed and the knob was clear across the dial.

We had observed vultures and small birds soaring earlier when we noticed a distant object overhead inland. A short time later we noticed it made a reflection from the sun that made us curious.  From a distance it was speculated to be a glider, balloon, helicopter, or bird with shiny black feathers.  Curiousity caused us to bet a pair of small 10 X 25 binoculars, and then determined it was a disclike craft &quot;soaring&quot; in the morning sky slowy floating toward the ocean from inland in a general Northward path. We all took turns looking, and it slowly drifted over our location. As it swooped and floated much like a bird in a thermal, we could determine the top was a dark refective shiny surface, much like a lense in a refective pair of sungalsses. As it turned, it was very thin, almost flat, becoming almost invisible from the side. the bottom side looked a lot like the turbine blades in a jet engine, but they were moving slow enough to see. The underbelly was either translucent, or reflected the light from the ground on the surface beyond the &quot;turbine like&quot; blades appearing on the underside. I was able to get several shots with a digital camera but at that distance the quality was less than marginal. We attempted to get a video but the camera had a low battery and by the time we got it charged the object was out of sight. It was difficult to determine the size. As a lay person I felt it could be some unknown kind of domestic unmanned survielance craft. We are visiting friends here and will return to N. Carolina on 05/16/03.

Around 23:00 I observed a flash of light that lit up everything for miles around.  It was like someone shot off a giant flash strobe from a very high altitude.  The entire landscape lit up like daylight.Around midnight another controller that was off duty came up to the tower with his girlfriend.  I started to tell him about the flash and he couldn&apos;t belive they saw the same thing at the same time.  However they were coming home from Cloudcroft and at the time of the flash they were below the caprock.  The caprock is a shelf of land about 30 miles west of the tower.

There were approx 150 people in the park and perhaps another 150 outside the park or on nearby beaches. It is a popular area. My friend and I observed a metalic object coming straight towards us from accross the bay. It appeared to be about 50 feet across, and it was disc shaped. We assumed from it&apos;s relative slow speed, size, and lack of sound, it was probably the Fuji ballon craft, or something like it. There was a very bright light on the bottom of the craft. It was just beginning to get dark in the area and this was the only moving object in the area. It hovered directly overhead, about 50 feet off the ground, and somehow we knew it was not a balloon craft. It was shaped wrong and it was too metallic. There were no jets or propellers. I joking told my room mate, it was probably &quot;swamp gas&quot;. He wasn&apos;t laughing. We were scared and the hair was sticking up on my neck. I looked around and it seemed like everyone was watching this thing. I saw no portholes, anteneas, or any protrusions at all. As it got darker, the light seemed brighter and stronger. It was like a floodlight, but it did not have a directed &quot;beam&quot; of light. It was just bright.After hovering 25 minutes or so, it began ascending and moving away from us in an upwards arc. It suddenly rapidly accellerated and was out of sight in seconds. I have seem anything that could accellerate that fast. It was like zero to 1000 MPH in about 2 seconds. It started moving north and curved around to accellerate to the south and almost straight up. The next day, we looked in the paper to see if anyone reported it, but it was not in the paper.

I carve and paint birds from wood and do most of my finishing outside as was the case on a beautiful afternoon in October of 2000. On this particular day there were a multitude of jet planes coming from the northeast flying at a very high altitude over head and on to the south or southwest. I could barely make out their shapes,(of course the contrails were very visible)and since a friend had given me a new pair of binoculars I became curious and went in the house to get them. I watched the jets for a while until my neck started to strain from looking straight up and so I was about to continue with my work when I looked over towards the northheast horizon and noticed a dark dot in the blue sky. I walked toward it about 20 feet and put the binoculars on the object and watched it come toward me. It started to veer to my left and I had a perfect side view as it crossed the western sky. It looked grayish silver and was oblong in shape about the size of a small jet plane to the naked eye. It made no discernable noise and had no wings or tail but when I put the binoculars on it as it crossed before me I could see that it had a protrusion above and also below that made it look like a symmetrical top. I watched it until I could see it no more.

Our campsite was on the eastern bank of the river approximately 150-200 yards north of the Taboose Creek river crossing.  At around 8 P.M., we watched the Independence firework display (approximately 30 miles south), as well as the occasional displays over Bishop (approximately 25-30 miles north).  At around 9 o&apos;clock, when most of the fireworks had stopped, my girlfriend sighted a strange object in the sky east of our camp.  By my reckoning, the object was about 3 miles east and between 500 and 800 feet in the air.  It hovered just above the top of a peak in the White Mountain Range.  From our vantage point, near the easternmost side of the valley, the object appeared to be about the size of a dime, and had a three-layered disk shape (the top and bottom sides more narrow than the center layer, similar to a hamburger shape).  Around the middle of the object were a series of revolving lights. They turned in sequence...  YELLOW-ORANGE-PINK-RED-WHITE etc., etc. Thge object hovered over the mountains for about 30 minutes, in which time it sporactically darted from place to place, excelerating rapidly then gliding to a stop in diagnol, horizontal, and vertical movements.  At one point, the object came closer to our campsite, growing to about the size of a quarter.  From it, several beams of white lit up the mountain side and base.  The pattern appeared very clearly on the ground, consisting of about 20 to 30 white circles spaced out and forming a hexagon in it&apos;s entirety.  This light moved over the ground and the side of the mountain like a search light, and at one point actually lit up the tree just above where we were sitting in the bed of my truck.  I think it is important to note here that my rottweiler Tank was also aware of the object at this time.  He sat at the tail gate of my truck in a guard position and watched the desert around us to the east.  He did this! fully alert for some hours.  It may be equally important to note that at this time we were yelling back and forth to some other campers about 100 yeard up river to our north who were all watching the same event.  Sometime after the the white lights stopped, the object retreated back towards the mountain, at which time it emitted a second series of lights which included a red horizontal beam which hit the mountain side at regular intervuls.  This sequence was always followed by a series of vertical lights which scanned over the same area.  It appeared to me like a grid.  It was during this time (about 1 hour), that my girlfriend noticed another light go up from the mountain.  It appeared to have the same shape and spinning lights at as the first, but was much smaller in comparison (if it had indeed taken off from the mountain top, then it would have been a few miles behind the original object.  It is very likely that they were actually the same size).  Shortly after the second object started to gain alttitude, a third object took off from the mountain from the same area as the first.  It was also the same shape as the other two with the same lights, and was the same size as the smaller of the two others.  This object drifted straight up while the one that had gone up before it drifted diagnally to the right (or south).  The time between the two take-offs was somewhere between 2 and 3 minutes, at which time the grid-like lights from the first object had ceased and it darted upwards to a great height at great speed. The lowest of the objects (the last to &quot;take off&quot;), stopped climbing for about a minute.  It was at this time that we saw a red beam flash beneath it to the mountain top, followed a second later by a strange rushing sound.  After this, the three drifted upwards in unison for a few more minutes, then one by one, the revolving lights of each stopped turning and the objects became solid white lights against the black night.  It occured to me at this point that they looked remarkably like stars.  W! ith the exception of the largest object, they were almost indistinguishable from other stars, almost.  They drifted straight upwards in a triangular pattern which they held for hours.  The only way I could keep my eyes on them (my eyes were beginning to become confused by the abundance of stars that night and focusing on just one or two lights became increasingly more difficult), was by comparing their drifting movements to that of other stars (the three moved significantly faster than other constellations).  I watched them drift upwards until early morning, in which the light of the sun made them impossible to see.  I did, however, catch a glimpse of the a metallic reflection high above before the sun broke fully into my eyes.  It might be important to note that in the morning, I could see the area where the two had taken off from, and there seemed to be a trail of smoke or vapor which started at the top of the mountain.  I fell asleep sometime early in the morning, but was awakened by the sound of two jets (F-16s by the look of them) flying low through the valley and circling the mountain top where we had seen the objects just hours before.  The fighters left and came back many times during the day (assuming that they were the same planes), until it started raining around 5 in the afternoon and after that they never returned.  It was a very strange 4th of July for me and one that my girlfriend and I will never forget.", "3 unidentified flying objects dancing in the sky making loud shreiking noisesme and my collegues were  on our way home from a business conference in london when we pulled in at the service staition to get some more fuel and some supplies.we all got out of the minni bus as we had been in there for quite a while and our legs needed stretching.it was when we were comming out of the service station ,(going back to the bus) when we heard a deafening noise and saw three objects speeding across the sky,they were light up with bright lights adn each one had 3 red lights  in a circular shape, near the centre of the bottom of each object.the objects seemed to dance in the sky making sheriking sounds.then within a second they were gona and there was this erie feeling, like there was a storm about to happen.we couldnt beleive what we had seen, we all were amazed.we stayed in the mini bus for a while before we left.((NUFORC Note:  Note discrepancy in date of alleged event.

This is the account of the event to the best of my memory and through my preceptions.At the &quot;blink of an eye&quot;and without in audio - visual or other sensory warning, a hoard of bright red lights manifested inside my SUV.  I panic initially for a second or two, then began slowing my speed  to around 30 miles/hour. I, at least felt some sense of security as I had 2 passengers with me.  MY sister-in-law yelled out to me calling my name, &quot;pull over, are those police lights?&quot;  I looked into the rear-view mirror and there was no police car and no other activity that I could see.  I looked at the clock in the car, it was 9:15 PM.  I could not count the lights as they were many, extremely eradic, strobbing, all apeared to be relatively small, I noticed some had short laser-like beam qualities as might be seen in some high-end disco club,  in short; they were ever where inside the car, except the trunk (I will comment on this very shortly).   By this time all three of us had vocally announced to one another that we were experiencing this event.  I felt totally out of control and knew that I would not have a say-so as to the outcome of this event.  In awe, I knew what was happening was not of this World!!  I looked in the re-view mirror to check on my sisiter-in-law and saw her in a panaroma of bright red lights .  I turned my head briefly (as the car was still moving) to look at her and I noticed that there was none of these eradic, red lights in the trunk area of my SUV.  The red lights seem to be  focused on the front and back seats.  As my head was turned looking at her I noticed the same lights at her feet and legs, the floor board was a hue of red probably from the reflection from the briliant  display.  I noticed the same type pattern of red lights and activity ongoing with my brother as well. The floor board again was red hue as it was in the back seat.  I looked out the window and over the dash board onto the hood and did not see any activity as was being awesomely and eradically displayed in the front and back seat.  This event lasted about 15 - 25 seconds to long.  The event ceased, as quick as the onset, when a car or  motorcycle appeared in the distance approaching the opposite direction.I asked my brother, as he knows the demographics of that area very well, where exactly was our location.  He replyed in slang type verbage the name of the general area,  that was know to him and others in his small community.In closing,  police lights are not red!!   How does red-strobbing and some laser-like lights travel with you in a moving car?  How could they be inside and not outside?  Could this all be a gimmick or circus trick??  I don&apos;t think so!!~~~~~I know what the red lights were doing!!((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at considerable length, and we found him to be an exceptional witness.  We have spoken with one of the other two witnesses to this event, and she, too, sounded to us to be both sober-minded and eloquent, in her description of the event.

The aircraft appeared to be flying somewhat low and relatively slow.  Also, it made no sound as it flew over our apartment complex.  At first the outline of the aircraft wasn&apos;t completely visible.  It was the lights that first drew our attention.  As it got closer we began to see the outline of the craft more clearly.

I was restless, I always look out the window. The moon was the biggest that i had ever remembered, it looked as if there was a red spot on it, I got my binoculars but couldn&apos;t make out the spot. Anyway, dawn was approaching, the rays of the sun were visible, thought I was going to see the moon and the sun in the same frame. As i was watching the rays of the sun come up, a cigar shaped thing, moving extremely fast, came up from either a stationary position or a hovering position, and flew right across the face of the moon at a 45 degree angle.

It was triangular in shape and had what appeared to be a spotlight on the front. It seemed to be made in a gridwork fashion and had smaller lights on the corners. What caught my attention was the fact that it seemed to hover and then move at a slow rate of speed. I got out of my car and watched the object for about 5 minutes.

Walton Beach1st sighting of the night: -------------------------- 9/12/02, on a work-related trip, I spent much of the evening relaxing on my hotel room&apos;s ocean-side balcony.  Mostly just relaxing, watching the stars at other times.Approx. 9:30 pm, I noticed an unusually bright light in the sky (to the East).I then noticed that it was moving, and rather oddly at that.  Slowly, a second faded into view above the first.  The first dimmed, extinguished, then another light faded into view above the second. This occurred several times, slowly.  After a while the two lights stopped the vertical motions, and began moving around very slowly (independently) but still staying close together.  No fast motions, but they would move, stop abruptly and pause, move somewhere else, then stop...This went on for about 5-10 minutes.  My view was not extremely close, but they seemed to be much closer than high-flying commercial aircraft, and they were further out horizontally from my view than vertically.Description of lights: . Each was triangular.. Entire triangle was red (no other external lights).. Color was very deep red, deeper than lights on large tv/radio antenna.. Lights slowly pulsated in intensity (brighter-dimmer, ~2-3 second period).. Lights did not seem to be directional.  No matter which way they moved, the lights did not stop showing (as plane lights would as the plane turned).. Motion was not fast, but not extremely slow either.2nd sighting of the night: -------------------------- I was so edhilerated/excited/scared/blown away by the first sighting that I was not about to go back in the room if I could catch another glimpse of these things.  My patience paid off at ~10:15pm local time.  Again, two of the pulsating red triangles came into view - this time from my left.  They went back out to approx. the same spot they were in last time.  Their motions were the same as the first time, short and straight paths, abrupt stops, nothing too fast about any of it.  Moving independently, but staying relatively close to each other.  After 10-15 minutes of this, they began a slow steady path to my left with no abrupt stops.That was the last I saw of them for the trip.Other details: -------------- . I was staying at a hotel on the 6th floor which allowed me to see over some of the haze that was coming in from storm Hanna.. Ft. Walton Beach is located between 2 U.S. Air Force bases - Eglin and Hurlburt.I was doing some work for my company  at one of them.  I wanted so badly to ask people at the base the next day about experimental aircraft in the area, but I was representing my company and could not go around asking about glowing red pulsating triangles flying about.. I watched the skies every evening for the rest of the trip (when not working).I saw airplanes and helicopters fly over at other times.  Each of them was clearly a helicopter or airplane no matter how far away it was.  I am absolutely certain that the red triangles were not planes or helicopters.The characteristics of their lighting and motion were not even close.. I am providing a sketch of the scene since I did not have a camera. The sketch is not perfect, but I believe it depicts the important aspects of the scene.

Since my childhood I&apos;ve read just about every kind of UFO book made since the early 70&apos;s. Yet, I&apos;ve never seen a UFO until today and I&apos;m excited. We have a back deck here and I sit on it to watch satellites and aircraft going across the sky at dusk for 2-3 hours from time to time.  It&apos;s my quiet time to reflect on my life, the economy, ect... Tonight I noticed several satellites, I guess about 7, and 3 or 4 commercial aircraft flying across the sky.  Commercial aircraft are pretty bright and have beacon lights.  Sometimes you can see the glow from the windows down one side of a big jet cruising at 35,000 feet pretty easy.  You can also hear the jet engine noise pretty easy from out here in the country.  Satellites are different!  They don&apos;t glow as bright as aircraft get,, yet they can move across the sky nearly as fast as aircraft can.  A satellite moves much faster than an airplane yet at their altitude out in space, it gives the appearance of the relative speed of an airplane.  In 20+ years of randomly watching satellites and aircraft, I will testify that they will appear and dis-appear into the distance usually within 2-3 minutes.  Satellites will disappear quicker than aircraft as they rely on the setting sunlight to be seen!  But, once a satellite crosses the sunset line in space, over your location, it disappears as satellites don&apos;t generate their own light like commerical aircraft do.((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness may have observed what are thought to be the U. S. Navy &quot;NOSS&quot; satellites, three of which fly in formation.  NUFORC has received many such reports.  PD)) Sitting in my chair, at precisely 10:20 PM, 5-28-2003, I noticed directly overhead three very dimly glowing lights amongst the stars.  These lights were dimmer than the reflection of the last satellite I was which was only 5 minutes earlier.  I would approximate 1/2 the light value of any satellite I&apos;ve seen.  And Satellites are dimmer than aircraft.  These lights were moving VERY, VERY slow also!  They were moving from due west to east.  These lights direction and speed caused some concern within me as I have never seen anything move that slowly and further from west to east!  Most satellites move in polar orbits around here or they are moving south west to north east or south east to north west...  Never east west!  NEVER!  I&apos;ve been a ham for 20 years and have communicated thru some of our OSCAR satellites in the past!  Have even seen them travel across the sky, south to north, upon occassion!  So direction and speed were very interesting!  Very SLOW!  Very DIM!  And moving west to east. At first, I thougth I was fortunate enought to see one of these moving triangles they have been talking about!  Like the triangle spotted over Phoenix!  But you could see stars thru this triangle!  So it wasn&apos;t solid.  It was three lights which were just moving together across the sky, going very slow, being very dim, and traveling from west to east!  So I felt that my space junk, or what ever it was would dis-appear, at the usual spot in the sky where the last satellite did as it would see earth&apos;s sunset and the glow would go away as these objects entered darkeness. I waited and waited and waited.  They got to the place in the sky they should have dis-appeared and they did not.  I assumed that because of their dim lights they must really be very far out in space so I waited some more.  But the lights didn&apos;t go out in 15 minutes of watching them.  They dis-appeared into the eastern sky at around 25 degrees above the horizon!  SO!  So they must have been making their own light and this was an actual UFO I just saw, OR, I just witnessed 3 very large asteroids which nearly hit planet earth!  It could be either!  I&apos;m not sure. An Asteroid would be far enough out that it would be plausable that it would not be affected by the setting sun AND it would explain the very dim glow and slow movement across the sky. The other thing about the siting I wanted to say was the pattern these 3 lights made which caused me to believe it was a triangle of some kind.  In the reports of phoenix, I believe witnesses said the nose of the triangle had a light and each tail peice both starboard and port side of the craft had a light.  It&apos;s merely my opinion but because of the pointyness formed by the three lights my mind had the impression this triangle was moving from west to east going sideways.  The nose was pointed ruffly North/North-East and the other distant tail lights, IF YOU WILL, were south of the nose.  I watched the distance of these lights and noticed that by the time they reached the horizon to the east before I lost them, it appeared the distance between all three lights had been reduced. I&apos;m thinking this must have been 3 asteroids because every account I ever read about a UFO leaves me with the impression that the witness saw bright lights or glowing colors!  COLORS!  There were no colors to these lights!  These lights had the same color of a dim star!  Just a faint white glow.  All three were about the same dim appearance, the imagined NOSE of my triangle being the brightest. I would have probably missed all three had I been looking anywhere else.  They were going so slow that you have to star at them to see the movement!  Very, very slow. 15 minutes for a straight over head to eastern setting is an extremely long time for a Satellite!  It&apos;s UNHEARD OF!  Why if a satellite were really moving that slow it would re-enter the earths atmosphere!

Anyway, I&apos;m pleased to have posted my very first UFO encounter here on this website and I hope that before my life is over I get the opportunity to see at least one more. If anyone reading this report from the government has data about a near earth collision of 3 asteroids, I would like to hear about this.  I&apos;m really thinking that&apos;s what I just saw and it frightens me a little either way.  What ever those three dim lights were, at that distance it would have to be HUGE to be natural. On the other hand, perhaps I did see some kind of UFO, craft of some kind.

As I mentioned earlier it was very late at night and we were traveling along some lonley dark stretches of highway, way off the beaten path as you might say..My wife was asleep in her seat across from me and I was listening to the radio with my window rolled part part way down so I wouldn&apos;t get sleepy...As I was driving I began to hear what sounded like a high pitched humming sound..I thought maybe I had a tire going flat so I slowed my speed down to about 45mph to see if the sound would degrade accordingly, but it didn&apos;t...regardless of my speed the sound remained constant in pitch and intensity...After a few minutes of hearing this sound I decided to pull my car over to the side of the road and do a visual check of my tires to be certain they were ok...With the car stopped and engine turned off I got out with a flashlight to have a look..my wife had woken up during this time and I had told her what I was doing..It was pitch black outside and the only light were my headlights and the stars above..The sound was still there and I asked my wife to get out of the car and see if we could determine where the sound was coming from, because it sounded like it was coming from everywhere...I decided to look up and this was when I noticed that some of the stars were being blocked out by something moving and the size of the leading edge of whatever this thing was , was un-believeable! Accordingly the stars were being blocked out to the east and west as far as we could see in either direction as the object moved to the north...The object had to be over a mile in width and length and low to the ground... After 10 minutes of watching this thing  the object finally completed moving over us, because we were finally able to see the stars re-appearing to the back of the craft. We continuously watched this black craft until we could no longer see! its out line in the stars or hear it.  The craft was moving very slow according to our perspective on the ground since the speed the stars were disappearing in front of the craft and re-appearing at the back of the craft was somewhat slow...At first we thought it was a blimp flying close to the ground but there were no lights at all on the craft, so we decided it wasn&apos;t a blimp..Having just gotten out of the Air Force after 4 years of service, I was pretty familiar with most of our military and civil aircraft at the time, but I had never seen anything like this before and believe me I had seen alot of weird things in and around the many air bases I was stationed at..((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We were cleaning fish that we had caught earlier in the day and suddenly we heard a low rummbling noise and we heard something scraping through the trees. It made quite a mess and initially I thought perhaps an air plane had crashed into the copse when suddenly at tree top level a vehicle emerged from the pines. It looked like a large cruise missle except it was wider and it had a black glass cab. It was blunt in the front and honestly it put in the mind of the space ships on the TV series Battle Star Galactica. Right down to the dirty white color of the fuselodge this craft with it&apos;s stunted wings and snub nose and its glistening black glass, hung in the air hovering, just over a palme tree that sat in my cousins side yard, in just the way that cruise missles don&apos;t.

I was driving south on S. Hardy Drive towards Baseline.  The day was sunny, the sky was blue, and there was no haze or clouds in the sky. Just as I was coming up to the Hwy 60 overpass I glanced up and saw what I first thought was a jet airplane.  It was right above the center of my steering wheel moving slowly to the right within the frame of my windshield.  Unfortunately, the &quot;sighting&quot; didn&apos;t appear out of the ordinary at first and occurred so quickly that I didn&apos;t think to try and take a measurement.  However, from my position in the driver&apos;s seat, I would estimate that if I pointed my thumb up, with my arm straight out in front resting on the steering wheel, the aircraft would have been as wide as my thumb.  As I continued to drive, I switched my gaze back &amp; forth being mindful of the road while checking out the object as well.  It appeared to be elongated like a passenger jet would be, but I couldn&apos;t make out the specific features due to the bright, silvery glint that was reflecting off of it.  My first thought was that the sun was reflecting off the aircraft at just the right angle for it to create such a glare.  As I continued to look up at it I noticed that the glare began to diminish, and along with it, the aircraft slowly faded from view.  Completely.  I kind of shook my head and thought if the glare slowly faded because the angle had changed due to the forward movement of the aircraft, shouldn&apos;t I have had a clearer view of it rather than no view of it?  I searched the sky briefly in the direction it had been flying, but there was nothing there.  Then from the view on the right side of my windshield, traveling to the left, I could see the narrow contrail of another jet (but not the jet itself) high in the sky, as one normally sees contrails when a jet flys high over a city.  (30,000 feet perhaps?)  At that point I realized that the craft I first saw must have been flying much lower because I could definitely see that it was some! type of aircraft, long and shining brightly, however it did not have a contrail&hellip;and it dissolved away from view.", "BRIGHT LIGHT MOVING ACROSS SKY, SLIGHTLY ZIG ZAGGING, MET 2 OTHER FAINT LIGHTS...GONEOn the night in question, a friend and I went outside to look at the stars. After a few mintues I looked to the southwest sky and it looked like a really bright satellite moving across like they normally would. after a few seconds I noticed that it really didn&apos;t have a geo-synchronous orbit like a Satellite. For about 10 seconds it went behind the clouds, at which point I thought I had lost it but my friend pointed it out when it came out from behind the clouds. As it came out from behind the clouds, it started to drop in the sky, somewhat zig-zagging and moved toward the horizon at which point it was moving too fast and was too bright to be a satellite. Just as it was due south fairly high above the horizon,  we noticed two very faint lights moving towards the main big light at the same time. Right after they started to move together the lights suddenly disappeared, sort of like a fading effect. Didn&apos;t see anything else after that.", "On May 1, 2003 at approximately 2303 hours, in the northwest sky, I noticed what appeared to be a slow moving egg shaped star. It was moving in a southwest direction. As it reached the middle of the sky, it turned on a bright white light, which illuminated for miles. The light approximately lasted for 10 seconds, and it was instantly shut off. At this time, the craft started it&apos;s ascent at a very high rate of speed and disappeared among the stars in the sky.

Last summer while out for an afternoon walk, I glanced at the sky and saw a group of at least 50 silver spheres slowly moving across the valley from the southeast toward the northwest. At first I thought they were birds but they were spread out in strings and groupings. Some would break away and then circle back. I watched until I could no longer see them and decided they must be mylar balloons that had broken loose and were floating on the air current. Two weeks ago at work near College of the Desert, I looked up and saw the same objects - maybe 20 or 30 traveling in the same direction as before. I watched as they slowly moved across the sky and observed that some seemed to be tethered together in a line which would make a circle and then open up again. They were all in a group but very stretched out. Today while getting my mail, I looked up and saw them again. At first only one, then briefly a very small group clustered together. This group turned in unison, flashed in the sun, and disappeared. Birds, I thought. Just then a commercial jet which had just taken off proceeded from west to east. A single small, very silver orb paced the plane at exactly the same speed at what seemed to be 100 yards distance from the right wing. Definitely not a bird. I watched as it paced the plane for approximately one minute. The plane headed northeast and the sphere then went east and I lost it. I looked again before entering my house and spotted it due east about 30 degrees above the horizon. It was still and looked like a bright star. I watched it for another minute and then went inside.

I remember the time as we were concerned about getting to the office to obtain a campsite pass and the office was to close at 9:30PM. This was a quiet evening with good conditions, clear weather and skies. The expansive 500-site State campground was sparsely populated on that last night of the season, with maybe a dozen campsites taken in the entire park and forest. The object approached from the ten o&apos;clock position, sweeping down to the right through the upper reach of my headlight beams, proceeding over the road immediately in front of and above our vehicle, then rising abruptly on our right side to a verticle climb up between the heavy branches of broadleaf forest which lined either side of approach road. My observation of the object lasted only 2-4 seconds. My relative in the passenger seat saw more of both approach and egress, totalling for her possibly 8 seconds. A description:  the object could be said to have had a rounded-chevron shape, maybe 18 inches across side-to-side. My own impression was that it had the general shape and the grace, of a manta. We both had an extremely clear and close view of the object and agreed that it did not appear to be mechanical in any sense, but rather living material or possibly a living form itself. For what it&apos;s worth, both of us felt we were in the presence of a highly aware and seemingly social object.   We agreed that there was no possibility that the small thing was any known sort of flying animal. It  did, however, have some attributes of deep-sea animals, including, along with its shape and graceful movement, a circular area near the rear centerline which radiated a distinct and clearly visible internal glow. There was clear structure evident internally in this central area (a subtle pattern of radiating lines) and its glow extended out to give pale illumination to the entire internal structure of the object. Again, the thing was very close to us under good conditions. My passenger reported to me that the object had moved directly upward rapidly after making its pass. She also noticed that there was a recurve to the rounded wingtips. I had not noticed this from my vantage point. For those interested, I&apos;ll mention that my background has been mainly as an electronics engineering tech. Hobbies have included optics, amateur astronomy  and amateur radio.

I work the evening shift because I&apos;m in the medical technology program at Central Missouri State University and go to school during the day.  I was coming home from work after midnight like I have done for the last 4 years.  I was headed south, and from the east, I saw 2 lights approaching.   The 2 lights where up in the sky, but not too high.  So my first response was that it was lifeflight (the helicopter used to fly critically ill patients from accident scenes), but then the thing got close enough for me to see that it was not a helicopter or a plane.  This thing was really weird; So I reached for my cell phone and called my supervisor back at the hospital because I knew she would be awake and I could talk to her.  I kept thinking no way!  But this thing was right there.  It was round, but it had edges kinda like an octagon, but I could not count how many sides it had.  It was pretty big. The thing stopped on top of the high way (13), but a little to the right, so I was not directly under it, but could see it perfectly.  Now I could see that it had 4 yellow light on the outside of the body and one big red one in the middle.  The one in the middle had a beam of light coming down, but the beam was not red, it was yellow. When I say yellow, I do not mean yellow like a banana, I mean yellow like a regular light.  I slowed my car down, but I did not stop, I was scared.  My supervisor, who I was describing this to, asked me if it made any sound, and I could not hear any sound, even after rolling the window down. Then, the thing started rocking back and forth and the beam appeared to be sweapping from side to side over the highway.  It did this 5 times, then, it was still again, and it took off in the same direction that it came, first slowly, then it totally disappered.  I described the whole thing to my supervisor, we both were laughing, and I kept thinking, no way!  But it did happen.  I was not the only person wh! o saw it, there was also a car driving north, and I saw them stop too, but I did not talk to them. I kept driving home, and forgot about what I had seen.  This is what keeps freaking me out.  I forgot to tell anybody about the experience until I talked to my supervisor and she reminded me.  I think the experience was just too traumatic for me to remember.  After I was reminded, however, I remember the whole thing, I just wish I had pictures or something because I know how unbelievable my story sound.  I am an honest person, actually, I am the most honest person I know, and anyone that I have told my story to believe me because anyone who knows me knows that I would not want to be perceived as a psycho.

I sat back down to continue watching the tv, again out of the corner of my eye the same strobing light released an orange sphere of light which resembled the so called &quot;flare&quot; of the massive ufo sighting that occured in Phoenix&apos;s past, which disappeared behind the initial blue strobing light i was seeing after about 5 seconds, Followed by more white streaking spark-like in the sky, about a 1000 foot tail id imagine. After doing various maneuvers, &quot;S&quot; shapes, and dive&apos;s,  which were highlighted by the white spark streak, the ufo which i was seeing dropped several &quot;midair-bombs&quot; which resembled a high altitude fireworks mortar explosion, the colors of the sparks comming off the explosions, 2 different colors, one was solid purple, and one was solid green. The purest of these two colors i have ever seen. I was in complete awe, when i then raced to get the attention of my brothers girlfriends mom. She was also fascinated by the encounter.

I was tired and went in to lay down for a little bit before supper. I don&apos;t know if I fell asleep or not? I don&apos;t think I did. I opened my eyes and looked out the window. There hovering above the trees was what I only knew of as a flying saucer. The only way I knew what it was, was from what I had seen on buggs and roadrunner cartoons. By the way we only got 2 tv channels back then. I jumped up and went to the window. Then I went tearing out of the house to see it, while screaming for my Grandmother to come look. I still remember my exact words(Grandma! Grandma! you got to come see this), I ran out from under the trees to get a better look. It was just hovering there at the tree tops not making a sound. Then just as if someone was standing right by my side I heard a voice say to me (you are not supposed to see this). I never felt so much fear in my young life. Then as my Grandma exited the house and was coming toward me it just raised up about 50 feet and shot off like a bullet. I will never forget telling her that I knew she would not beleive me. But to my suprise she said she did, because she had herself several years before that. This has haunted me for years and changed my life forever. I could no longer beleive in the biblical things my Grandmother had always taught me. At age 25 I tried hypno therapy. I went 8 times but could never get pasted what I could remember already.

I asked my partner if he was watching it and he said yes.  The lights were all of a greater relative magnitude than Sirius -- perhaps equalling or greater than Venus in brightness.  After about 5 to 10 seconds, the lights began to move eastward, accelerating rapidly and fading from view simultaneously (may have been receding?).  No aircraft in my experience has ever accelerated so quickly.  We believe it was one object -- though no details could be made out between the lights -- else the three separate objects would have had to have been maintaining a precise formation during acceleration.  Each of the observers have been flying aircraft for over 15 years, and neither of us had ever seen anything like this.", "The vehicle looked like a &quot;flying car&quot; with three large bright headlights flew slowly without sound and at tree top level.At 2 AM I took my dog out.  To the east I saw bright lights.  I thought they were my neighbor&apos;s flood lights but realized they were too high.  I thought it was the moon coming up but at 2 AM the moon would have been more to the west. It looked like this vehicle was stopped about 1/4 mile down the hill at tree top level.  As I watched, staying at tree top level, it slowly made it&apos;s way up the hill towards my house.  I thought it was a helicopter but I did not hear any noise.  The vehicle looked like a &quot;flying car&quot; with three huge bright white light headlights. It was very close to my house and I was getting uneasy.  I went up the stairs to wake my husband to see this flying vehicle.  About one minute went by and when we went out to look again the vehicle was no where to be seen.  At the speed it was traveling it should still have been in the area.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the witness, and we found her to be exceptionally eloquent, and seemingly quite credible.

I hope to give some evidence that this type of sighting is not unique. It was when I was still a child (in other words before using perception changing substances) with a few of my friends that we noticed a light high in the sky whilst sleeping outside and mindlessly looking for satelites. I&apos;m not sure how many of us noticed the light but I do know that we were at least 4 to have seen it. The light was, I suspect, very far off. At first we thought that it was another satelite, but as we gazed at it started  moving in a zigzagg motion at a very quick pace. After a number of seconds, the star-like light stopped zigzagging and continued to move in a straight line. This was already a great surprise to us, but that wasn&apos;t it. In the path of the light there was a star, which the light did a semi circle around and then resumed its course until it was no longer visible as it faded. I know it sounds ridiculous that the light went around the star, since the star was probably nowhere close to the light, but thats what I saw and so did my friends.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I had not had any previous surgeries of any kind yet my ovary and fallopian tube were surgically removed. They said they know it was surgically removed because if i had been born without them there would not have been a space where they once were.

A shape I at first thought had wings and flashing a frontal row of extremely bright red, blue, green, and white lights flew into my binocular&apos;s field of view.  All the colored lights flashed on simultaneously and in three quick pulses that repeated after a beat.  The object steadily moved southwest from northeast at about 150 to 200 miles an hour. It had passed near the moon, which was then in mid-eclipse, and I tracked it with the binoculars for about four seconds.  Then I watched it move along without the glasses.  At first I thought it was an airplane.  It was low because it passed in front of me from left to right and then disappeared behind the housetops and trees. But the strangest thing about it was that it made absolutely no sound, none, nothing.  Not a hum, not a buzz, not a whine, roar or whistle, not anything.  It was perfectly silent. I judge it to have been traveling at a 15 to 20 degree slant from me and about 1/2-mile distant at an altitude of 500 to 800 feet.  As it passed, the colored lights flashing on it were powerful enough to be diffused by the moisture saturated air and also dimly reflected off the pavement and houses.  It was low because it moved in a straight line away from me and disappeared behind roof tops and trees in the west.  It had one small, steady, white light showing on its receding form.  As it moved away from me, I could see it was a silvery oval, cigar, or wing shaped object that seemed to dimly reflect a pale silver-blue color from the city lights below it.

Mais ce que j&apos;ai vu &eacute;tait quand m&ecirc;me bizarre.Je vous envoie le mail tant que je l&apos;ai envoi&eacute; &agrave; la NASA.Dear Sir, Sorry to bother you with this question.On sunday, July 21th at about 02am, I saw above the ardennes in Belgium 02 lights moving in different directions (cannot tell you if north to south or ...). They both were high in the sky, moving at tremendous speed.I&apos;ve worked for more than 04 years at Brussels Int. Airport, night and day, so I know for sure that they were not airplanes.On airplanes, even at 30.000 feet, you can see lights blinking, what was not the case that day. At that moment I saw an airplane crossing the sky, at (I think) about maximum height : I saw the blinking lights and it didn&apos;t move by far as fast as the 02 lights I saw that night. The light was pretty clear, a bit of a yellow-orange colour and moved both in a straight line.Now I don&apos;t believe in ufo&apos;s, so I think I saw (a friend of mine saw it aswell) 02 satelites passing by who were reflecting sunlight.Is this possible? Can you see from earth with the bare eye a satelite flying by? If not, what could it be?

At dusk, it came towards me with a constant speed and altitude of ten meters and multiple lights flashing with absolute silence.

At first glance it looked like a star but it looked to be changing colours from a green/blue to red.(similar to a jetliner&apos;s lights) At this point I assumed it was a planet. Then I noticed that it was moving in a sporadic fashion (dipping and moving right and left) something I&apos;ve never seen. I thought I was hallucinating so I woke up my girlfriend who also observed it&apos;s bizarre movements in the sky. The speed it was moving was tremendous as it dipped and moved left to right. We watched it for about 40 minutes and then it started dimming until it was gone. Oddly enough this is the 2nd time in 3 months that I&apos;ve seen the exact same thing.

I believe it was 1996 but don&apos;t remember the month or day all I know is that that night there was a full moon and that my window faced the west. My bedroom was located on a second floor and my window faced the moon at about 10:00 pm. I used to stare at the moon during the full moon stages through my window. On the night of the event, I was looking at the moon when suddenly I saw a sphere shaped object of small size, almost a dot. It was traveling from North to South and was of a very bright neon blue color.The object traveled in a straight line across the moon at a very fast speed. I observed the object for about five seconds until it was out of sight. At first I didn&apos;t know what it was but it really cought my attention. Afterwards I tried to identify what it was and thought it could vave been a plane. The thing is that the object was obviously very far away and at the speed that it traveled at that distance away it could not have possibly been a plane or jet of any sort. Also, as it went across the moon, it was clearly visible as a sphere shaped object and still very bright although the full moon served as a background.((NUFORC Note:  Date is 1996 is approximate.

I backed up watching it as much as possible ruling out everything I could think of that flew around that area. Nothing matched. I looked down for maybe 3 seconds and when I looked up it was gone. I don&apos;t know if it was a ufo but it was something. It was so black that if you weren&apos;t really watching the sky you would have missed it.

It was 8:00 p.m., clear skies (daylight) and he saw a silver, round shaped object traveling at an extremely high rate of speed coming from the west heading east. The sighting took approx: 4 seconds before it disappeared from his line of sight. He also mentioned that it took him totally by surprise to see something move so quickly. No sound was heard due to the distance from the object. He said it was no &quot;darn&quot; aircraft we have, as to the speed the object was traveling. I asked if he might be able to give some details to what the object looked like, but he said it happened so fast he could not get a proper look at it. Thank you to the witness for his report.   A witness reported seeing a strange object sitting stationary over the mountains to the north. He was traveling on Highway #16, just crossing the bridge over the Kalum River. He pulled over to the side of the highway to get a better look at it. He said the object moved from side to side, and up and down ever so slightly. (HBCC UFO Note: At this point of the conversation I was thinking what the gentleman had witnessed was nothing more that a star, until he gave me the rest of the story). He watched the object stay in a stationary position for approx: 5 minutes before it exploded/or flashed brightly. He said at this point it stared to move downwards  and ended up losing sight of it when it dropped behind one of the local mountains. He described the color of it as being neon green in color, with a whiteish aura surrounding the object. He also noted seeing a neon green and blue twinkling lights at the bottom of the object. He also said he believed there were a number of white flashing lights that were more to the center of the object. The witness said he did make a report to the authorities.

We lived right across the street from Nellis AFB and we could hear planes taking off. We thought they were just going out to the range but instead they headed twords the mountain. We thought ,ok they were just flares even though they were not over the range and this is when the lights faded to very pale blue lights and were much smaller in size, almost too small to even see unless you knew they were there. I dont think the objects got smaller. I think it was just the intnsity of the lights was far less. But anyway, as the jets, F-16&apos;s I&apos;m pretty sure, got closer towards the lights, the lights went from hovering to heading left twords downtown Las Vegas at a high rate of speed.

It hovered for a few seconds and then darted behind a mountain at a steep angle.  It was definitely too large to be an aircraft.  I would say it was about the size of a football field.

While visiting Fallon, NV a small group had been looking for satellites and had seen a couple earlier in the evening.  At 23:15 on July 5, 2003 four observers noted three faint white lights towards the North traveling from West to East in a triangle formation.  The point of the isoceles triangle was in the lead and the two remaining lights, making up the base, were evenly spaced and followed the first point of light. They were closely spaced and traveling at the same speed.  The speed was similar to the speed of other satellites we had observed.  With arm extended they were less than a half of a thumb in seperation.  When they were about 30 degrees East (0 degrees being directly above) the white lights faded out together.

I am a former U.S. Infantry officer, and 3,000 hour commercial pilot.  We are in the habit of sitting on our roof at night talking and looking at the sky- it&apos;s cooler &amp; breezier up there, and less buggy. About 3 months ago we had an interesting experience that I&apos;d like you to comment on, if possible. At about 11 p.m. on a clear night, we both became aware, simultaneously, of 3 ruby-red lights, bright and distinctly visible, like car tail-lights or red aircraft nav lights, approaching us from south to north, right to left as we viewed them, in a symmetric V formation, one leading and two trailing. After 3 seconds of this motion, the 3 lights diverged, the lead light continuing straight, each of the trailing lights turning 90 degrees away from the original direction of motion. The lights passed more or less overhead as they made this divergence, then they didn&apos;t fade away into the distance but simply vanished out of sight in about  2 seconds. Literally, like poof, they&apos;re gone. It was stunning!  It was a clear night with no other air traffic. The experience lasted 5 seconds, and we both subsequently agreed that we had observed exactly the same phenomenon. There was absolutely no sound, and no other lights visible. There was no way of judging altitude of the lights, but we had the &quot;impression&quot; that they were several thousand feet above sea level, and that the rate of movement must have been extremely rapid. I have seen    F-4s fly directly overhead, and have observed a very large number of other aircraft movement over the years, and I can tell you without hesitation that those 3 lights were moving significantly faster than any aircraft in my experience, and in complete silence. If you care to comment, I&apos;m curious if this account sounds familiar to you, which is to ask, have other people witnessed anything similar? And what do you suppose those bright red lights were attached to??  Thanks, and cheers! (HBCC UFO has deleted the witnesses personal information)  I would like to thank this witness for the report.

In any case, the object was zig-zagging overhead as it moved in the direction indicated.  I know it was not commercial aircraft or any aircraft I am familiar with.  It could not have been a planet or star, and it was not dark enough to see satellites as they move in their orbits.  The object looked as if maybe sunlight was reflecting off of it, so I suppose you would call it silver in color. It appears the object was extremely high as it was about the size of a dull pencil point held at arms length.  Of course, there was no noise.

(Apache County is very close to the New Mexico border). Three other people were staying at my rural home near Concho.  I arrived home at about 10 in the evening (the joys of self-employment) and as usual, the three of us sat at the kitchen table, catching up on our respective days.  One of my guests, who faced the window, exclaimed &quot;Holy *fill-in-the-blank*! Did you see that!&quot;  He and one other, a woman, had seen a UFO streak by, apparently crashing.  They said there was fire in the object&apos;s wake.  I thought at first that they were talking about the comet, but they insisted that it was a craft of some sort. We jumped in my Suzuki (resembling a white jeep), with me at the helm, still wearing high heels and skirt, and raced off in search of the crashed object.  We crossed State Highway 61 for a wild ride along an old cattle trail.  At the highway, an elderly couple had parked their white travel van and were standing at the highway, staring off into the field.  They asked if we had seen the UFO crash and I told them that we were going to try to find the crash site.  They had been driving westerly along Highway 61 toward Show Low when they saw the object streak by and appear to crash, and also described the &quot;fire tail&quot; that my guests had reported.  They were very exicted about this, and if I had more room in the jeep, I think they would have come with.  They pointed to us where they thought the object crashed. This area has few trees -- some scattered cedar and junipers -- and a lot of rock and canyons.  I drove about 30-40 miles an hour down the cattle trail and across the rocky fields.  Periodically, we would slow down so that my passengers could move rocks out of the way.  Driving through these conditions at that speed, with the greenish glow of the comet overhead, was both nerve-wracking and surrealistic.  I was quite concerned that I&apos;d roll the Suzuki and kill all of us, but the two who had seen the crash insisted that we keep going on. After about an hour of this, we arrived at a very deep canyon and could drive no further.  Deep in this canyon (approximately half a mile down, at the bottom) was the crashed UFO. It was an oblong, egg-shape.  The color was strange -- it was the color of a caucasion&apos;s skin with a fading tan, and it faintly glowed. The glow was sufficient enough to illuminate the bottom of the canyon. There were two &quot;pillars&apos; for lack of a better word at the &quot;front&quot; of this object (I call it the front because that was the portion that was visible to us).  These pillars may have been posted on either side of a door -- although a doorway was not visible.  It was about the size of a barn typically seen on a small dairy farm in the midwest.  Oddly, there was a helicopter down there and a black pickup truck.  We were baffled how that truck could have gotten down the remote canyon so quickly, unless there was some road that we did not know about. In any event, we watched this for awhile and then left. By this time, I had put in a 16 hour work day, hadn&apos;t eaten and was simply exhausted.  Nothing seemed to be happening; we did not see any people or any activity. Unfortunately, in our haste to find the crash site, we failed to bring a camera along.  We were so far out in rough country that we got lost and it took approximately 3 hours to get back home. Later, I went to a local meeting about UFO sightings and sat next to an amiable woman who turned out to be the editor of a magazine that used to circulate here called &quot;White Mountain Sightings.&quot;  We engaged in small talk while waiting for the meeting to start.  She told me she was desperately trying to find a woman who drove a white jeep, who chased after a UFO a few weeks earlier.  I told her that would be me, and gave her the same story I just reported here. The elderly couple we had seen at the highway had filed a report with this editor.  If this is something worth more information or follow-up, I can try to locate the witnesses and the magazine editor.  Most everyone has moved from this area, but I believe that this report can be verified.  The witnesses would include the three guests at my home, the elderly couple, and myself. This is not the first UFO I have seen, and I&apos;ve seen quite a few odd things in Apache County.  However, it is the only crash that I have seen and this is the only sighting in which I have had other witnesses.((NUFORC Note:  We have sent an e-message to the witness, requesting more information on this case.

We observed it for about 5-10 minutes, then it seemed to just fade away. We are both students, 16 and 17 years old. I beleve in UFO&apos;s, but my friend is a bit more skeptic.

It looked as if it was a star, but with very sudden, swift movements. At first I thought that it was my &quot;tired eyes&quot; playing a trick on me, so I blinked a couple of times and rubbed them. I looked again, and the object was still moving in a straight line but I noticed some jerking motions, like it went forward then went backward. I thought I was just imagining it, so I closed my blinds. I then, out of curiousity, opened the blinds again. And I saw the same object, maybe a different one, I can&apos;t be sure, traveling in and upward direction.

I hadn&apos;t been there but a couple of minutes when I saw what looked like the most amazing meteor entering the atmosphere. It was very bright and distinct and traveled from east to west almost traversing the entire sky. When it got to the far western region of the sky it began to dim and then it did something I wasn&apos;t ready for, it stopped cold. At first I thought I had lost it behind a bright star or that my eyes had picked up a star instead. And then the &quot;star&quot; moved again. From an absolute stopped point, it streaked from it&apos;s resting point in the west to a point up and behind my head in the south (I was sitting facing due north). At this point I had to sit up and had turned my head to follow this &quot;Star&quot; as I had not been prepared for this event.Amazingly, right after stopping for about a count of 3 to 5 seconds, the &quot;star&quot; moved very abruptly from it&apos;s position in the south to one to the far north eastern sky and stopped again. At this point I remember thinking that this wasn&apos;t right. Stars don&apos;t do this. It was new to me to ever see anything like this and I don&apos;t think I was aware yet that I was seeing a UFO as it were, I just was so blown away.After a few moments where it was, the &quot;star&quot; shot off to the south again aand was gone. I was so blown away that I just sort of slumped back down and lay there stunned. I actually remember feeling very scared and felt like I wasn&apos;t supposed to have seen that or something. People always say that they want to see a UFO and it had never occurred to me that it would scare the crap out of me. I was so scared, lying there exposed on that rooftop, that I remember I couldn&apos;t move for what seemed like a long time. It may have just been minutes, but it seemed like a very long time. A deer in the headlights effect I guess. I finally got my wits together and left the roof very rapidly and went inside to tell my friends what I saw. The most frustrating thing about it was that I had been alone and that every single person looked at me with this very condescending smile that made me very angry. I wish anybody else could have seen this amazing thing. I don&apos;t now what I saw but I do know that it wasn&apos;t birds in the night lights, or a jet, or anything I have ever seen before or since. It moved very fast and in a way that made no sense. It went from absolute still to absolute motion across the sky in a moment, and stopped just as fast. Whatever it was, either we have very amazing machines in thhis world that no one knows about or it was something else. But it was something and it was real.In some ways I hope I never see anything like it again. It makes one feel very small.

PD))Close Encounter With Aliens and a UFOWhat I am about to tell you will sound amazing but what i will tell you is total true.  When I was about 6 years old I went on a capming trip with my Dad to the Yosemite Forest in the summer.  On the last night of our stay I was outside eating while my dad was asleep when i heard a nose like no animal coulds have made.  It was a loud humming sound.  I thought it was a car engine but it didn&apos;t stop.  I then took my flash light and went out to find the sound, being the little dectivce I was back then.  It took me about 25 to 30 minutes to arrive at the source of the sound.  I was looking over the side of a hill and saw it about 30 feet below me, a egg shaped UFO.  Needless to say I was shocked!  It seem to be about 40 feet wide and 60 feet long.  It had strange colored lights coming out of what seemed to be windows and a opened door of some sort?  There was a odd mist coming from below  it that was yellow in color and the sound seemed to be coming from that area, I suposes it was the vent from the engine of the UFO and the source of the sounds I was hearing.  I then looked over the object and then was able to see to my astonishement 3 Greys!  They where about 3 feet tall, very skiny bodies, oval heads with black eyes, 3 very long fingers on there hands.  I was one of them, that I now believe must hav been he leader ativate some sort of silver sphere in its hand.  The sphere then lifted off the grey&apos;s hand and hovered near a dead Ox and then shots out a red ray and started to cut the Ox open.  I then started to get very scared and back away as I did a rock feel off the hill and hit the top of the ship leaving no dent, but the 3 greys look at me.  I will never forget how dark they eyes are, it seemed like the where looking right into my soul.  I then ran as fast as I could away.  I got lost in the woods and as I stopped to take a rest I heard foot steps!  I then his inside a hollowed out red wood tree.  I cryed and prayed whatever was out there would just leave me alone.

When i switched the radio on, it started to break up. We went out side to see that the Disks passed right over our house. We had trouble sleeping that night.", "Vacationing in Steamboat Springs, sitting in hottub, and noticed 5 or 6 lights in day sky.  The lights were visible for only a second or two, would fade out, and reappear in roughly the same location in the sky, but had moved in relation to one another.  I watched this for three minutes or so, ran to get my camera, and tried to get some shots.  After a few more minutes the lights disappeared.  My camera was on auto focus and I don&apos;t think my pictures will turn out.  I&apos;ll be ready if they come again this week.  I&apos;m a huge skeptic but these lights truly have me confused.", "Object only visible as a streak of light at very high altitude traveled from horizon to horizon in a few seconds for a total of 6 timesIn the summer of 1961, when I was 15 years old myself along with two of my friends had just laid down to go to sleep on the lawn of Mount Hope Junior High School very late in the evening, possibly around midnight.  We had told our parents we were camping out in the woods, but had just spent the evening running around town and having fun, planning to return to our houses around dawn.  We were laying on the north side of the lawn that faced City Hall.  Myself and one of the other boys had almost gone to sleep, but the other one was just laying there watching the stars.  After a few minutes he excitedly yelled, &quot;did you see that&quot; along with some other phrases that I don&apos;t remember, but he was very excited. We were a little agitated because we were almost asleep and this guy was known for his pranks, but to humor him we watched for a few minutes and didn&apos;t see anything so we tried to go back to sleep.  What he had seen was a streak of light that had gone across the sky at a very high altitude and lasted only for several seconds but had traveled from horizon to horizon in that brief time.  After about 15 or 20 minutes he yelled that he had seen the same thing again, so this time myself and the other friend decided to wait it out to see if he was pulling our leg.  Sure enough, after 20 minutes or so we all three saw a little steak of light go across the sky at a tremendous speed.  I think if we had blinked we would have missed it.  We watched this happen at least 6 times, including the 2 times observed by the first friend.  Each time it happened the streak of light was a few degrees farther north until on the last sighting it was barely visible toward the city of Oak Hill, West Virginia. We even theorized that maybe the object was going all the way around the Earth and we were seeing the same object instead of 6 individual ones.  The boy who had first seen the light stayed awake practically all night, but myself and the other friend eventually went to sleep.  This incident has always been on m! y mind and stirred my intrest in UFOs, especially when sightings are reported in this area of southern West Virginia.  As usually is the case, this is a story that we just kept to ourselves because we didn&apos;t want to be ridiculed.  But what we saw was real and I&apos;ve always wanted to tell this story.((NUFORC Note:  Date in July 1961 is approximate.

His words were something like  take a look at that! That aint no @#$# plane. We looked up into a clear blue sky to see a stationary object at about a 55&deg; angle, south southwest from our location. The object appeared to give off a &quot;silvery&quot; reflective light. The object looked like it was undulating or rotating in an irregular fashion because of the variations in light emissions. My first thought was that it was a typical small helium balloon that had been let go and was rotating and reflecting light as it climbed. But as we watched this thing it became apparent to us that it was not. This thing appeared to be very high. Its really difficult to say without any references, but I would take a guess at 50,00 ft. A lot of planes are coming and going at PDX and they all appeared to be way below this thing and it didn&rsquo;t seem to be moving. It was breezy on the ground and I suppose it would be windy up there also, but this thing seem to stay in place with no apparent movement from wind, (as with a balloon) or slow movement by rotation (as with a planet or star) We finally had to move on, as we had golfers behind us. I watched the object in between golf shots as we played for a little while. About an hour and fifteen minutes later as we neared the last hole, Chris again brought the object to our attention, It appeared to be in the same area of the sky, but was even smaller (or higher) than before. I took my eyes off of it for a second, when Chris said it just saw it move to the right about eight inches (at arms length) and is now quickly climbing away. He tried to point to its location in the sky as it climbed, but it was too small for me to pick up. I would have loved to have some binoculars right then. This thing was very puzzling. Could it have been a weather balloon or an atmospherically distorted viewing of a! planet? Many other people had to observe this object as it was CLEARLY visible for at least an hour and fifteen minutes.", "Light blue diskshape with a blinking red light on bottom above east river.My dad was on the roof of our building and he saw a weird object flying on the sky, he used his cell to call me and told me to go up to the roof.

Prior to the exercise, following lecture the sun had already settled and it was quite dark.  The cadre got us ready to go and yelling gung-ho style, then surprised us recruits with a sudden firing of 3, 30-caliber machine guns.  The tracers flew from right-to-left over the range where we were shortly to crawl over.  During that live fire, I noticed the track of the tracer rounds as they hit into the rocks to our left.  Some of the rounds richocheted up and away from our location where I could discern what appeared to be the ridge line, estimating 60-100 feet up and 1000 yards away. Suddenly, the machine-gun fire stopped, and each of us recruits became silent in awe of what we had seen, and extremely scared at what we knew were to undergo. The lecture, to a now quiet audience, continued.  A few minutes, later, my eyes returned back to where the tracer rounds had been landing.  I noticed the stars over and behind what I thought was the ridge of a hill no higher than 100 feet, but still about a thousand yards away. This is when I noticed the first light come over the ridge; no noise, nothing to overcome the voice of the person presenting instruction.  I had expected to hear a helicopter but heard no noise.  The light slowly drifted above the ridge line, I believe amber in color.  When the second light appeared, I still expected to hear a helicopter but there was no noise but the voice of the lecture.  If was about the time that the final light of the triangle made it over the ridge.  It should have been a helicopter!  But no, it began to &quot;turn&quot;, more of a slow rotation, as it might have been &quot;peeking&quot; over the ridge.  The &quot;craft&quot; was at an estimated &quot;pitch&quot; of 40-50 degrees as if it had followed some contour up to and over the ridge.  If I was to estimate its size based on its distance from me, I would say 60 feet on a side, and not quite equilateral; The angle between the two &quot;forward wing edges&quot; might have been about 50-60 degrees. I do not know what was over, or what it looked like over the ridge. Shortly after the entire &quot;craft&quot; broke the ridge line, was when I noticed its triangurlar shape as a black triangle blocking of the stars in the background.  It continued to quietly rotate/turn back and down behind the ridge.  None of the approximately 100 recruits I was with made any sign of having seen the same.

Two shooting stars had been spotted already when an object about the size of the moon came into view at a rapid rate of speed. The witness writes...&quot;I saw what looked to be a football shaped object with a neon-purple shield fly across the sky. In the center of the craft there were 5 or 6 lights that looked like they weren&apos;t set up in any order. From the distance that I was, it looked like the lights probably had a diameter of 6-10 feet.&quot;  The first contact was made by the mother through the OUFOR hotline the following night. Investigator Bill Coones was contacted and visited with the witness and his mother at their home picking up a few more details. Bill noted that the craft had a black body surrounded by a purple glow. The light was not reflected light in the witness estimation but glowing on its own. There were lights randomly spaced within the surrounding purple glow. The object went right overhead. It did not turn or change direction. There was no sound. Bills compass said the initial view was to the north and it went in a straight line and behind the trees to the south. The object was first sighted approximately 35 degrees (as by his angle finder) above level. It crossed directly overhead and was last seen at about 30 degrees to the south before the trees hid the view which was shown to him by the witness on the street. Investigator Coones had some conversation about the UFO phenomenon with the witness and his mother and got the impression that the field was almost brand new to them as they were amazed at some matter of fact things he told them about things in this field of study.

Our backyard was actually 80 acres of grass field, former farmland left unfarmed for mamy years.  There was an old two-track road which extended from our driveway out into the &quot;back 80&quot;... past the barn and out into the grass field.  It was a warm early-summer evening, the skies were clear, and we were inside watching TV. Our foster-daughter burst into the back door.  &quot;Come Look!  Quick!  There is SOMETHING in the SKY out in the back field!&quot;  We kind of laughed at her, thinking she was being melodromatic, or attempting an attention-getting move or perhaps even hoaxing us... but when she repeated what she had said, the second time more insistant than the first... well, we saw something in her eyes that said there might be something wrong... if you are a parent, you know the feeling!  (It seems that she and her boyfriend were unknown to us at the time, &quot;parking&quot; on the two-track dirt road which ran through the grass field behind our house.  The radio went out on their car as soon as they saw the object... then they both made it back to the house to let us know about the UFO...thats when she ran in the door!). So we went out the backdoor and into the yard, listening to our foster-daughter babble about, &quot;it went down this way and then up twice as far this way, like a pattern...&quot;  when I looked up and saw the object, hovering, over the field behind our house.  I estimate it was no farther than 250 yards away from me, hovering about 200 to 300 feet in the air.  It was metallic and disk-shaped...and all along the rim it exhibited colors changing from red-orange-white-blue (there were four of us there in all, 2 people also saw a greenish tint).  But, what made me stand there slack-jawed was the SOUND the darn thing was making... it was a loud-vibrating-humming low pitched tone... and it vibrated into and through everything!  I was standing adjacent to an old out-building in the backyard, and the siding on the building was actually rattling/humming from the noise!  I reached out my hand and touched the building and it literally was vibrating!  (I have since estimated the &quot;humming/vibrating&quot; to have been very near 39 to 40 Hertz). And, as unbelievable as this sounds, and it makes me realize why there aren&apos;t more good-quality pictures/videos taken of UFOs... I had a brand new Nikon F camera in my house and didn&apos;t even THINK of going in and getting it.  The four of us stood there, slack-jawed... me, my wife, my foster-daughter, and her boyfriend... and none of us said a word for 10 minutes.  We just stared, transfixed at this &quot;thing&quot; in the backyard that just sat there humming.  It finally, about 10 minutes later very slowly (maybe 20 MPH?) drifted off to the southeast, toward a very sparsely populated rural area of our county.  I lost sight of it in the street lights when it went across the sky.  We all went inside and recounted to each other what we saw, felt, and heard.  And I really think that is when we all just shut up about it and none of us has said a word to anyone (except very good friends) until now. The time has come for an explanation from someone... from our government, or whoever the powers-that-be are in this country.  What the hell did we see in the sky behind my house?  I have had several college-level astronomy courses.  I know the difference between an anomaly and an ordinary occurence.  I did not see &quot;Venus, Swamp Gas, or a Weather Balloon&quot;.  I used to be a UFO skeptic... and I have purposefully left the term &quot;extraterrestrial&quot; out of the account as I saw no evidence of &quot;life&quot; or &quot;intelligent maneuvering of the object&quot;. BUT, I can say with 100% assuredness that there was something &quot;unexplained&quot; in the skies over Mancelona, Michigan in the summer of 1978.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witness also provides a graphic image of what the alleged saucer looked like.   Please see the report from the wife, for the same date and location.  PD))", "On a warm summer night, we saw a saucer shaped UFO that hummed very loudly.Back in June of 1978, my boyfriend ((name deleted)) and I were in the back field sitting in the front seat of his car (65 Chevy Impala).  There was a breeze coming in the side window of the car.  The radio was on, the key was in the accessory position.  I think the Steve Miller Band was on the radio at the time.  I was sitting back with my feet on the dash, so I had a good view of the sky.   The car was facing west, on the two track road behind the house in the field.  I saw a light that looked like a bright star, far off toward the northwest.  The light got brighter, as it zig-zagged downward in a pattern.  It stopped every few seconds and just froze there for a second or two before moving again.  It got larger as it came down, and I said, &quot;((name deleted)), what the hell is that?&quot;.  I sat up straight in the seat and by then the UFO was directly in front of the car to the west.  The windows were down on the car, and I heard a very loud deep humming noise that I still remember to this day. I will never forget that sound!   I would guess it was about 300 yards in front of us and about 200 feet in the air (?).  At that time the radio went dead.  I could see colors rotating around the UFO around the very edge of the craft.  I saw greenish, blue and white colors.  I began to get scared, and told ((name deleted)), &quot;Lets go back to the house and get ((name deleted--witness #3))!&quot;  ((name deleted)) tried to start the car, and it only clicked when he turned the key on.  It was the first time that car ever didn&apos;t start!!  We opened both doors and RAN back to the house, scared to death!  We went in the back door and started to tell ((name deleted--witness #3/male)) and ((name deleted--witness #4/female)) to come outside quick!  I said, &quot;Something is bizarre outside in the sky!!&quot;  We all went outside, and stood near the little shed in the backyard.  ((name deleted--witness #4)) stood on the step of the shed, and ((name deleted--witness #3)) told us, &quot;Feel the building!  There is vibration going through it!&quot;  The sound was so loud that we could feel the vibration inside our bodies.  We just stood there, and I remember saying something about, &quot;We should tell ((name deleted--individual #5)) about this&quot;.  (He was a man in Central Lake who studied UFOs and had a large antenna in his yard).  The UFO was shaped like a pie-plate.  It stayed there and hummed for about 10 minutes and then slowly drifted off toward the southwest.  I remember all the crickets and grasshoppers quit making any sound.  It was totally silent after the UFO left.  We stood there at least another five minutes and ((name deleted)) and I were too scared to go and get the car.  We left it in the field all night, and when we went back the next morning, it started right up!  All of the details were kiind of like a faded dream even right after that.  I wish someone would figure this out and let us know what we saw. Thank you for being interested in my story.", "it traveled on a angle,we always travel this hwy,and had never seen anything like this.we were enroute to work,which we do everyday,and i noticed this object ahead,it was like a upside down bowl,withj a shiny metallic bottom,i said to my husband  what is that,it went to the north and finally then m,y husband  and son seen it. then it dissappeared.", "I was in clifton just leaving my sisters place when a bright light in the sky cuaght my attention.

As I looked up at the moon, I noticed a small bright light over the left hand side of the moon. I didn&apos;t think much of it at first as it could be anything. Five minutes later I looked up to see if the object was still there and surely it was. I was still on the phone at this point but from then on I kept my eyes on the object. 20 minutes into the call the object was still in the exact spot as before. Throughout the timeframe I was outside, I was under the impression the object was moving slighty-much like hovering. Once I was off the phone, about 23 minutes later, I went inside, got my digital camera, and took some photos. At the time my cameras settings were locked so I could not zoom in to magnify the photograph. As I revised the images I noticed the dot of light was not visible unless you zoomed into the image. It then blended in with the moon&apos;s light halo.((NUFORC Note:  Possibly Mars, but that planet should have been to the right of the Moon by July 16th, we believe.  We do not know what the witness observed.  PD))", "SEATTLE sighting. During daytime same day of the phoenix lightsI saw a round silver craft from my former work location which sets on a hill west of Boeing air field. From my vantage point I look east over the airport. I was sitting in my truck during my lunch brake. I was watching a small plane making an approach towards boeing field. It was a split second later that a spherical craft passed the plane in the opposite direction. This craft was moving at a very high rate of speed. I did not take my eyes from it, I thought it would dissappear at any moment. To my disbelief the craft made a sudden turn west towards my location. The day was sunny and mostly clear with some clouds. When this thing came over, once again I thought it was going to be gone. It was very quick and the craft started to dance in the sky. It litterally stopped to change directions and went east to west up and down (diagonally). I would guess the average travel distance was about one half mile per each direction change. Each traveled distance was done a second or so. It actually would at times pause in and out of the single cloud that was in that area. It went in the cloud, and when I thought it was gone it would pop out somewhere else. The craft finally left. I am surprised not to see any other reports in my area, but I am convinced that I would not have even been aware of this if I had not been focused on the aircraft that it intersected. I would like to talk to anyone who also experienced a local sighting that day.", "Large triangle stopped abruptly in the air and hovered.I&apos;m from Regina, I&apos;m a (deleted by HBCC UFO) year old female.  My grandfather was celebrating his (deleted by HBCC UFO) so we decided to get the whole family (mostly from Ontario) to come visit and have a little party.  We rented a hall and booked a near-by hotel in the small town.  The party began at 2 in the afternoon and we had a nice day.  It was getting later, it was around 6 or 7 at night on April 19, 2003 and the sun was starting to set.  I had thrown my hip out of joint the day before and it was starting to hurt so I thought I would go back to the hotel room and lay down for a while.  I was walking down a back alley toward the setting sun when I saw something zooming across the sky at an unbelievable pace.  (I remember squinting my eyes to try and get a better look).  As it continued it&apos;s path out of the sunlight, I could see that it was a very large triangle (at first I thought it may be a stealth plane) but that&apos;s when it stopped abruptly in the air and hovered for what seemed like a very long time.  I don&apos;t think stealth planes can do that, can they?  Anyway, it zigged and zagged up into the sky (again at a jaw-dropping speed) never to be seen again.  Now I know a stealth plane can&apos;t do that! I went back to the hotel and pondered if I had really seen what I had just seen.  Things got very weird after that.

An object caught my eye. The object was too high to see details. Sunlight reflected off the object. The object was north of us (me and my 14-year old son). We had seen an object &apos;hanging&apos; in the sky several weeks ago, and wondered whether this was the same or similar object. It looked similar. We watched this object for a couple of minutes, waiting to see if it was perhaps a small plane that was far off and heading toward us. There were no contrails around the object. And no clouds whatsoever. We watched it for a couple of minutes, then I said, &quot;Let&apos;s note the time.&quot; It was 13:57 Mountain Daylight Time. The object moved slowly toward the south. We looked at about 45 degrees to the horizon to first see it. In approximately ten minutes it had moved so that we were looking at about 85 degrees, not quite straight up. Watching the object was easier with polarized sun glasses. Without the polarized sun glasses, the object was hard to see. I told my son to go to the car to get the other sunglasses. When he came back, the object was closely to straight overhead, and I said, &quot;I&apos;ve lost it.&quot; My son said, &quot;I see it.&quot; I asked, &quot;Where?&quot; He said, &quot;There&quot;, but he was pointing to the 45-degree location. It had to be a second object in about the same spot as we had first seen the first object. Unless the first object zipped back down. I think there were two objects. We watched that object for a number of minutes. It was just hanging there. I said, &quot;What would happen if I tried to contact them?&quot; I stepped out into the open and waved at the object. I waved with both hands scissoring over my head. The object immediately faded from sight. We started walking back to the car. We noted the time. It was 14:17.((NUFORC Note:  Witness describes self as a person with a great deal of technical training and experience.  We suspect that he is an excellent witness.

Motion of both objects is clear and they are very distinct from the darker planes of the Blue Angels and the other aircraft visible on the ground and flying by.((NUFORC Note:  We believe that the first possibility to be ruled out would be blimps, perhaps blimps operated by the U.

The largest of the circles measure about 50 yards in diameter. It showed up overnight on Saturday in a field at the corner Suisun Valley and Rockville roads, and the onlookers showed up nearly as fast. Many of the visitors say they believe the circles carry mystical powers. Some had other theories. &quot;We were thinking that our friends did it, but we could just tell ... like ... it&apos;s too elaborate for someone to think of something and just do it,&quot; a visitor said. One woman traveled from Ukiah to lie in the field, hoping the circles&apos; power could bring relief to her bad back. Crop circles began showing up in English fields about 30 years ago. Most authorities say they are the work of scamps, dragging ropes and boards to flatten the crops. First and foremost among the nonbelievers is Larry Balestra, the man who owns the wheat field. He thinks the circles are the work of someone with too much time on their hands. But, Balestra says he plans to enjoy his newly styled fields because &quot;everyone else seems to be.&quot;", "A red blazing light from South to NorthWell, I haven&apos;t seen a space craft, but I saw a red light over the line of the horizont.

I was sitting in the playground in front of my apartment about 3:00 one August afternoon, while two of my children played with several neighbor children on the playground. Several adults were there, including the supervisor of the apartment complex and a contractor, who were working on plans for redesigning the playground. I called the children&apos;s attention to what I thought were parachuters coming down. The adults heard me and also watched the objects. This event was unusual in itself because there was no airport nearby and the terrain was a river valley surrounded by wooded hills. There were 4 white shapes moving in a downward, irregular, floating pattern. There were several jets passing by very high in the sky at the time. We lived in a busy flight path area, with jets passing overhead very high, very frequently.  At the time I thought that these &quot;parachuters&quot; had come from one of these very high jets. Another thing that struck me as very unusual, because I thought parachuters leapt from airplanes, not jets. The jets were too high to see clearly, but the jet trails were clearly visible. As we watched for several minutes, waiting to see where they might land, I thought that the behavior of these &quot;parachuters&quot; was unusual. First, the area I lived in was heavily forested and sparsely populated, so nearby landing areas were not numerous. But then as we continued to watch, some of the objects stopped descending. This in itself could have been explained by the use of what I refer to as &quot;half parachutes&quot;, the type used for stunt skydiving, but they seemed to hang in the air longer than you would expect, even of those types of parachutes. The kids lost interest after a few minutes and went back to playing. I kept observing the objects, because I was struck by what I saw as inconsistencies in the behavior of these things. As I observed the objects seemed to change shape. When they were higher up, it seemed the motion was of a &quot;half parachute&quot; with someone swinging on the end of the ropes and causing the parachute to move in irregular motion. As the objects descended lower, they looked more like huge white balloon type objects, changing shape, and moving as though tumbling end over end as we watched. As though they were not completely filled and something was moving about inside the objects.  At first all the objects could be seen together, but as they descended, they spread out to different areas of the sky.  When I saw that these objects were clearly not parachutes, I though they might be balloons. But the &quot;balloons&quot; changed shape and were too big for regular helium balloons. And they did not act like you would expect from balloons that everyone has seen let loose by kids and soaring off out of sight. These &quot;balloony things&quot; clearly did not act like that. First they came down from very high and then stopped and some started moving up. One  drifted over under one of the puffy low clouds, and one went behind one and disappeared, then reappeared drifting off to the north, another went near a different cloud and stayed under it as the cloud slowly drifted to the south.  The last object drifted off to the south. By this time I thought we were seeing some kind of UFO and called the attention of the adults and children to look up in the sky at the &quot;UFO&apos;s&quot;. As I was watching them, I saw about 25 white dots that came out of an area of the sky high above us radiating out in straight lines from a center area and I yelled out, look there&apos;s more! Several people looked up as these objects then started disappearing and moving erratically back up into the sky, but I was convinced we were seeing something unusual. All of these that had appeared later soon! could no longer be seen. I watched one of the lower ones that had been there before the appearance of the others, drift over the top of the roof of the apartment, so I went in the backyard to see where it went.  It was just a round sort of shiny looking balloon like thing hanging in the air and moving slowly to the south. I called one of my children outside to look at it.  As it slowly drifted further away, it started looking more like a star,  shining brightly in the daytime and we both watched it until it moved out of our view over the treetops. The whole duration of this &quot;sighting&quot; was about twenty minutes or more by numerous adults and children. Nothing was reported on the local news that day of anything unusual.((NUFORC Note:  We are grateful for the nice report from this witness.  We will invite her to contact the other witnesses and have reports submitted by the others who observed the evnet.

The object was white.  It travelled from right to left across highway approximately at the horizon, just above the treeline.  The left-most side of the object was slanted downwards and the right-most side was slanted upwards.  The angle was about 15-20 degrees. I remarked to my wife (sitting next to me) what I saw and if she saw it too.  She did not see it.  I lost sight of it as it continued on it&apos;s course behind the trees.  I did not see it again, but continued to look for it.  I&apos;m not sure how far down the road it was from our car but it had to be at least 10km (about 6 miles).  It did not look like a plane, balloon or anything else I have seen in the sky.  It had to be quite large.  I say this because I watched it cross the road in clear view and from my position and it&apos;s entire length was visible between the trees on either side of the road!

The speed is estimated to be about 5mph.  There was a slight breeze which made me think that this object was under some kind of power or it would have wavered in the wind.

All of a sudden the object started moving in a direction which from my perspective was toward 2 O&apos;clock in relation to the moon. It moved much to slowly to be a satellite. It was not possible to tell if it moved in front of or behind the moon as it passed the top 1/5 of the moon. In 5 minutes it moved a little more than the width of a hand at arms length. The whole time the brightness of the object was about what the star Sirius would appear like at that time of day and it did not waver. My wife went in and got a pair of 12x50 binoculars about 2 minutes into this sighting, in the binoculars the object was no more visible than it was without them. Then as we were talking about it the object at some point disappeared, but no one actually saw it when it did finally disappeared. I did manage one digital photograph of the object with my Olympus 5 megapixel C-5050, I am sending it to you although it does not look like much. The photo shows both the object and the moon. We can only figure it was one of two things. A balloon which very coincidentally did an apparent hover right at the point that it was resting on the very edge of the moon on the dark side and then proceeded to apparently move on and finally dissapear. The other is that it was a huge spacecraft near the moon which decided to leave while we were looking. It was certainly not a star, planet, or satellite, and it was not an airplane or jet or space shuttle. If this was a spacecraft near the moon you most certainly will have other reports of it, as it was difficult to miss.", "I have already sent this report in but I for got to say if you want to you can e-mail me at ((e-address deleted)).

Staring at it for a few seconds, we noticed an undulating heat wavelike emanating from it.  One second, it would have appeared to be straight but then began to enter the wavelike stage.  Then a soccer ball flew between our heads and I ran to pick it up.  Then, after only about five seconds of not looking at it, I turned my head toward the same place and it was gone.  No military aircraft or device of this earth could have been traveling so slowly and then accelerated to a speed so quickly that it could have disappeared from the heavens.", "I have never seen such an object in my life , movies and TV.I want you to be sure about the correctness of what I report. I am a married Turkish citizen having 3 children. I was 44 years old when I saw the strange object. We were at a summer resort by the sea, about 45 kilometers on the west of Antalya.Just after dinner, without any alcohol and walked to the sea shore about 75 feet away from our bungalow and our dinning table. Lit a cigarette and seatted on one of the woodden strechs and started to look to the sky. Time was some minutes after 21.00 hours. I noticed the signal lights of an airplane,one red and the other green. The body of object had a color like aluminium but little darker. I did not pay any attention as I thought it was an airplane leading to the airport about 30 miles away. I kept smoking and noticed that the airplane / object was at the same position. I said how come an airplane stays at the same point. Started to look more carefully. At that time the object started to generate powerful red, green and yellow lights. As if the lights were generating from speedy propellers. With the effect of these new lights the body of the object became more visible. The shape was regtangular. The power of the lights were not the same. It seemed as if the power of lights were increasing with the increasing speed of the propellers. Red light got powerful , then the green light got more powerful than the red one. They were like the fancy lights of Las Vegas. Iwas shocked with what I have observed. Called my wife a few times to make her my witness but she did not attend as she was washing the dishes. Light generation kept on some time then they became weaker and the object went straight up with an unbelieveable speed.((NUFORC Note:  The date of the incident may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD)) I am not very much interested with UFO s. The sky was very clear when Isaw this object. Same object has been reported 3 months later by the captain of Turkish Airlines on his flight from Sofia / Bulgaria to Istanbul Turkey.", "I was walking home from a friend&apos;s house at around 4:30 AM after a night of playing board games.  By the time I was about a 1/4 of a block away from house, it was around 4:45 AM.  The side street I was on lacked artificial light or any sort and for some reason (probably the lack unusually clear night)  I was compelled to look into the night sky.  Right then and there I saw twin streaks of green light appear from somewhere above my head or behind me and streak across the sky (faster than anything that&apos;s not powered by a rocket motor) heading towards the East and dissappearing behind the trees of someone&apos;s yard.  As far as I could tell, the object or objects were fairly high up.  I couldn&apos;t see the source of the streaks, but they were wider at the leading side and trailed off like a jet contrail, only with faster dispersion. Now some may assumet that this was some sort of pyrotechnic, but that&apos;s out of the question since I waited several minutes for any resultant explosion.  In addition to that, how many professional flying pyrotechnics would shoot 2 green trails and not make any sound what so ever?  As for a meteorite, every one I&apos;ve ever seen tends not to leave twin trails in perfect parallel sync&apos; and also tend to leave white streaks.  Others may assume that it was a military jet since Moffett field is under 5 miles away, however this couldn&apos;t be the case since Moffett should not be used for fighterjet aircraft due to its decommissioning about 5 years ago.  In addition, the streaks were green and what sort of plane burns a fuel mixture or uses technology that leaves not red, not orange, not yellow, not blue, but green streaks?  The fact that there wasn&apos;t even a sound also bothered me.  If this isn&apos;t a U.F.O., the military is using the Moffett/N.A.S.A. Ames facility for a fighter landing strip or some sort of testing/staging area.", "Craft with whight, blue, and red lights seen in the skyMy sister and I were headed west on M59 just north of the town.  We saw an object hovering over the Golden Triangle apartment complex.  It seemed long, and on the bottome of the craft there were 2 lights.  In what we guessed was the front, was a steady blue light, and on the other end there was a steady red light.  Above the bottom lights, there were whight flashing lights.  We turned onto Byron Road, and the craft, or whatever it was, was still visible.  However, when we turned down another road, and into the apartments, it was gone, in a matter of seconds, it disappeared.  We rolled down the windows, but couldn&apos;t hear anything.  We drove around a few more minutes, hoping to see it again, but it was gone.  There was a very clear sky that night, and the stars were very visible.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

While we were there (for 1 week) we met a group of people who would take us to different places and show us around town. One night in particular, at 11:00pm, we (myself and three others) decided to go look at this old &quot;haunted&quot; house in the middle of a cornfield which was about 35 minutes away by car. The thing is when we left the place to return home (at around 12:00am) to my aunts place we all saw this really bright light. All I can remember is waking up out of this day dream like state still in the car and seeing the 3 other passengers still in a day-dream/trance like state. When I finally snapped all of them out of it, I looked at the time and noticed it was almost 4:00am. All of us in the car shared the same story, yet neither of us knew what happened especially since we were missing about 3hours of time! I&apos;m a beleiver of UFO&apos;s but not so much in abductions although I simply cannot explain what happened that night.", "i was walking home from the movies and i was with my friend and these big lights were flashing and moving around in a triangular pattern very fast. They were making a low buzzing noise. they stayed for about 20 seconds then they just shot off like a bullet leaving a big trail of light like.", "My friends and I were out real late on a counrty rode, drinking and celebrating the 4th of July. Now, don&apos;t take this the wrong way, I had a liitle to drink earlier in day at my dad&apos;s bbq, but by this time I was solber with a bit of a head ache.  We lit a few fire workers, my head started to really hurt, kinda like a sinus head-ache, it just keep intensifing. Well, I just thought it might be the humidity or the load popping noise from the fire works. So, I sat in the car for a bit to regroup, then I saw it, it was at a distance approx. 2 miles at first I thought it may be a helicopter, or a plane. then the object split into 3 different lights, one was a teal green, the other a purplish blue, and a flash light color(really bright) just like a helicopter spot light. It was coming up on us like a roaring semi-truck, at a height of about 150 yds above the ground. I really thought it was a Sheriff helicopter. Within 1/2 mile distance my friends, who were still funning and carring-on, stop and took notice. Then all of a sudden, it was as quiet as a whisper, nothing.....then a boom the lights split into 6 different lighted objects, the size was breath taking. We stood in ah, no one said anything, just with dum expressions. The light just hovered there for 5-6 minutes and POW the took-off in 7 different directions. One of them came right at us, passing overhead, I ((was frightened.))  I have never been that scared before in my life. So, we hopped into the car and speed out back into town. I haven&apos;t sleep in two days. My dad and I went back out there today and investigated, all we found was our tire marks and a half of mile in front of where we parked was a 4 foot diameter burn mark.", "((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the three satellites, which are frequently seen flying in formation, are part of what is thought to be the U. S. Navy &quot;NOSS&quot; satellite program.  Satellites disappear when they fly into the Earth&apos;s shadow.  PD))A black triangle was seen flying over Sedona, AZ the evening of July 5, 2003 by six eyewitnessesAt 11:15pm on July 5, 2003, I and five of my coworkers were chatting on the balcony of a house our company is renting. I, being a stargazer and a former member of Arizona MUFON, was watching the sky when I saw a tiny orange-ish light moving in a southeasterly direction.  I called my colleagues&apos; attention to it, thinking it was a satellite.  A female member of our group brought my attention to two more lights following the one I saw.  All were identically small and illuminated.  There were no conventional anti-collision lights strobing, only a faint but steady light from each.  I thought initially that it could not possibly be three satellites in a parallel formation moving at identical velocities.  Then the realization that we were having a bona fide UFO sighting occurred to me.The shape the lights formed were an elongated isoceles triangle - I would guess the three angles of the object were 30 degrees at the bow and 75 degrees for the two rear angles.  The object occluded the stars as it passed, leading me to believe it was a solid triangle, not a &quot;boomerang&quot;-shape.  There was no sound from it.  I would guess the object may have been moving at an altitude of at least 100,000 ft. and would have been over 1/2-mile in length.I ran upstairs to get my binoculars.  This took less than 30 seconds.  When I&apos;d returned, the object was gone.  The manner in which it vanished, according to one of my fellow eyewitnesses, was it seemed to &quot;fish-tail&quot; like a car upon hitting a slick surface. The &quot;bow&quot; light then disappeared, followed by the other two lights.  It was described to me as it had gone through a rift or gateway in the sky. This is quite different than those objects that appear to suddenly vanish in a supposed &quot;hyper-jump.&quot; The object moved silently at what must have been supersonic speed to cover the distance it did in only a couple of minutes at great altitude, from initial sighting at almost 90 degrees directly overhead to 50 degrees to the southeast within two minutes.All of the witnesses, myself included, are in the performing arts, working with a Shakespeare company in Sedona.  Our ages range from 17 to 42. Four of the witnesses were male, two female. Myself and only one other witness in our group have any background or interest in such phenomena.  All in our group acknowledged, however, that the object was not a formation of airplanes, nor satellites.", "Bright starlike object  near hovered horizon  than ascended very fast.I was invited by a friend to stay at a beach house about seven miles south of Half Moon Bay, California, early summer 1975. It was my first trip to california from the East Coast and I enjoyed watching the evening sunsets. The coast had been foggy for a couple of nights so on this particular night i sat on the beach with field glasses enjoying the ocean and approaching sunset. As the sun began to set i noticed a bright starlike object hovering near the horizon close to where the sun was setting. I took a look through the field glasses and noticed that the object seemed to be flikering much like a star but the center was dark. The object hovered for a time than suddenly began to ascend very fast. In short time it was out of view. The atmosphere seemed electric.

But the details I will never forget. When you see something so unusual, it stays with you. When I was a teenager, my friend and I were out in the evening when we noticed low in the sky about 20-30 degrees above the horizon,a set of five orange glowing spheres or circular shapes. It was more like a glow than a bright light, but with dstinct round edges, not fuzzy. The spheres were in a line, with the edges touching each other, so as to form one object. The center sphere was the largest, about half the size of a full moon. The next adjacent two were smaller, and the outer two were the smallest, about half the size of the center sphere. We stood there for a few minutes staring at it in amazement. There were no sounds, movement, blinking or rays of light coming from it. Just completely still and glowing orange.  My house was at the edge of a subdivision, and the direction was east over a wooded undeveloped area.  It was very dark, so there were no street lights or ground lights to confuse it with something else.  The spheres were much bigger than any aircraft lights. We ran down the street to get another friend to come out and see it, but a few minutes later it was gone. A few days later, as I recall, there was a short newspaper article that various people in Savannah had seen orange glowing lights in the night sky.  I assume it was the same object that we had seen.  Whoever they interviewed explained that it was migrating ducks flying in a &quot;v&quot; formation and their bellies glowed orange from reflected light. Yeah, right! Duck bellies are not perfectly round and are extremely tiny in the sky! I have never seen anything like that since.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

There was only a strip of sky exposed due to tree crown cover in place on his property. When I looked up I did see one high altitude object of white-grayish color traveling from the southwest to the northeast. I would say at least 10 Km up. The sky was clear and no cloud was around. I told (name deleted by HBCC UFO), who had his own UFO experiences The second object was following the visible one across the sky in a short distance..but remained invisible throughout the whole time means 50+ seconds. Interestingly enough, the area of sky visible was very limited due to the tree crowns and it almost seems to me that &quot; they &quot; choose this direction to be seen like the one I saw months ago which came closer within a small break in the tree cover on my property to the east. This flight path is actually situated roughly 40 Km&apos;s to the southwest. The two objects were followed by a third one which flew in the same direction 2 minutes later.

The first of the 2 with the flash seemed to show an object.  I have no idea what it is, but I was hoping someone with a more experience could tell me.  It looks like a reflection of light off of an object.  Given the distance, I doubt that my camera could pick up a reflection.  I zoomed in on it as much as I could on my computer, but that did not make it any more identifiable.

It was Sunday, April 1952 when my family and I were looking at new homes just outside of Chicago Ill. The sighting we had took place at approx: 1:00 p.m. or 2:00 p.m. in the after noon. It was a daytime sighting which lasted approx: 45 minutes at least.This is off a U.S. air force UFO form ftd 164. My parents went into a home and left us three kids in car, brother, sister, and me. We were playing in the car jumping over the seats as there is lots of room in a 1950 Pontiac. It was my brother, now dead that looked up and out the window. He said &apos;&apos;WHAT IS THAT&apos;&apos; !  It was large, about the size of a running track and was a metallic, silver round or saucer shape object. From our angle it did not let us see the top of it.  No speed involved as it was just standing in air, kind of revolving on its own axis at about 60 degrees and it made no sound. The object would often catch the sun and reflect light at us, blinding us momentarily. My father came out to the car and we asked what it was. He looked and said its probably army stuff because their was a radar sight a few miles away.  He finished checking on us and went back into the house he was looking at. My brother did not say any thing until my father left. My brother then told us kids, this was important, this is the time of prop planes. But this thing is standing still and defying gravity. As kids are, after such a long time watching it we began to play again. After a while my sister said, were did it go ? &quot;It was gone and none of us seen it leave&quot;.

We headed up to Grizzy Mountain where I&apos;ve previously hunted since a teenager.  It was late when we got there and I set up our tent and started a fire.  While we sat there enjoying the great outdoors I began to feel very uncomfortable.  That feeling you get as if someone&apos;s watching you or your not alone.  I told my wife how I felt and she shrugged it off saying I&apos;m probably just tired.  I agreed and went and sat in the front seat of our car to look for a something I could use as a weapon so I could make myself feel as comfortable as she was feeling.  While sitting in the front seat I noticed a light to the left of a tree top.  I thought it was just a star but then the light moved to the right of the tree top and I began to rationalize it as the rotation of the earth or something or wind blowing the tree tops, yet I felt no breeze and none of the tree tops seemed to be swaying.  I watched the light for awhile as it kept moving from one side of the tree top to the other, until I finally heard my wife call my name and ask what I was doing.  I told her to come sit in the car next to me and watch what I thought I was seeing.  She was quite annoyed by it and felt like I was trying to play a prank or something which she didnt find funny at all because she was pregnant and wasnt in the mood for it.  When she sat in the car I asked her to watch the star/ light and tell me what she thought of it.  After a few minutes she got real close to me and said she wasnt feeling very comfortable up here in the mountains anymore.  She told me she things the light keeps moving from left to right of the tree top and then back again.  That settled it for me.  I knew I wasnt just seeing things then.  Then I felt a boldness and got out of the car and started yelling up at the light saying come on down we&apos;re friendly and we mean you no harm.  I want to see what you look like ! and stuff like that.  Truely I was completely scared but by doing this it kept my nerves steady.  Then the wind began to blow real bad and I thought I sensed a movement on the ground it the surrounding trees but I couldnt tell.  The light of the fire was making it too hard to see the surroundings.  I put the fire out real quick and waited a bit so my eyes could adjust to the dark so I could try and see if I noticed any movement.  A few moments later my wife freaked out saying she felt weird and was scared for her unborn baby and ranted about other things I dont remember now.  Then I heard alot of movement in the trees about 30 yards away and it freaked me out.  I jumped in the car with her and told her screw this we&apos;re getting out of dodge. I tried to start the car and the freaken car wouldnt start.  We were both really stressin out then.  We were parked facing up hill where are camp was and my car was a stick shift, so I put it in neutral and let it roll back to pop the clutch.  It worked and the car fired up and we took off down the way we came, sky ranch road.  On our way up the road was really clear, but as we sped off back down the mountain trees started falling over next to us and branches were falling off of trees and I couldnt make any sense of where I was at.  I knew those roads like the back of my hand and due to panic or who knows what else, I felt a bit lost.  Then my wife said stop the car, we just passed that same spot awhile ago and I think we just went in a big circle.  I stopped the car and we got out of the car and we started calming each other down trying to reason all this out.  Then I became stressed out again because I knew that there was no way we could have went in a circle.  There was only one way back down that mountain , sure there were plenty of off roads to go elsewhere, but none of those roads would have took us in a circle based on where we stopped.  I couldnt make sense of any of it.  For some reason we both looked up about the same time and we both saw a blue glowing ligh! t with an ovalish/ coccoon shaped object spinning within it.  I was in awe.  It was so pretty yet so weird looking.  My wife jumped back in the car and said drive damn it.  I jumped back in the car and told her we arent going any further.  My instincts told me that when your panicing its best to just stay put and calm down regardless of the situation.  Think things out.  I checked by watch and I knew it was almost morning time and we could just wait it out.  Whatever it was it was sure to leave when the sun came up.  While waiting we both faded in and out of sleep until  I noticed things were getting alot lighter.  Thank God the sun was coming up.  When the sun came up we just sat there in the car holding each other.  I asked her if we just both had the craziest dream or what?  She said theres no way we could have had the same crazy dream and she wanted to leave.  My stubborness wouldnt let me just leave though.  I wanted to go back to camp and get my tent and belongings.  She said forget them, we can get more, but I wanted my stuff and my curiousity was killing me.  I wanted to troll around the camp in the woods and see if I found anything strange.  We got back to camp and packed things up and walked around a bit and noticed a large burnt area up aways from were we camped.  We felt real creepy again and both agreed to leave.  We told my Mom about it and my Step Dad when we got back.  My Mom was way curious because she knew I never was a story teller and never made things up.  My step Dad was probably thinking just the opposite after hearing what we just them.  We never told anyone else though.  Thought people would laugh or make fun of us.  A few months later though my Mom talked her husband into taking them up to the same spot to camp.  He knew exactly where it was at.  Hes been hunting up there for years.  The next day we went by there home and they told us they went up there to camp, but they didnt stay.  They both told us that they felt really uncomfortable at that camp spot and felt like they were ! being watched or something.  They came off the mountain the same night and came home.

It feels real good to be able to talk about it again.   Thanks((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  We will attempt to confirm the date.  PD))", "I saw into disc with clear openings under it, chased by police at tree top level, then hesitating directly above my home.I was preparing for bed with no lights on in the room I shared with my younger brother one night, and while pulling my sweatshirt up over my head, I felt a sudden surge of what I can only describe as something like an electric current run through my body starting at my scalp and flowing down all the way to my feet. As I quickly removed the shirt, I noticed flashing red lights reflecting off the upermost branches of the fruit trees outside the high open window at the top of the bedroom wall. I could see the bottom of the eaves, and they were in shadow just above the top of the window. As I was wondering what angle the red light was coming from, the rounded leading edge of what I would see later was a saucer shaped craft slowly came into view from the north, directly above the house, moving away from me very slowly to the south, blocking out the stars as it went. At that point I was less than 30 feet from the bottom of the saucer, about 8 to 10 feet to the west of it&apos;s center. At several poimts around the rim of the vehicle were bright bluish-white lights that blinked slowly on and off. When the lights were on, they were a solid field of light with no filaments or bulbs visible,even as close as I was. When they went off, there was nothing in that spot, as if the skin of the ship had instantly covered them over.It made absolutely no sound, but my German Shepherd was throwing a fit in the back yard, as it was moving directly toward him. As I realized this was something out of the ordinary, to say the least, I began to notice details on the bottom edge and body of the craft. It was moving so slowly that it took 3 or 4 seconds to move about 15 feet. That was when I first saw the detailed edge of a strangely shaped window in the underbody of the craft. It took perhaps another second or so before I could actually see into the interior. All this time, I was frozen in my tracks, unable to move. I was so frightened by what I was seeing, that I wanted to run and warn my Mother of what was happening.! But the harder I tried to move, the more I realized that I couldn&apos;t. The craft moved very smoothly and steadily, not wobbling in the least, and the flashig red lights reflected off it&apos;s surface as if it were made of polished chrome. When it reached a point directly above the dog, he suddenly became quiet. I could see at that time that it was perhaps 30 feet or so across. Within a second or so it was no longer right above me, and I found I could finally move, so I began screaming at the top of my lungs. I remember my brother waking up at that point, and I ran out of the room without saying anything to him. I met my Mother in the hall, and told her what had happened. She said that the lights were from a police car she had seen stop in front of the house. I finally convinced her that there was more to it than that, and she went to look out the back door. I was so shaken up that I couldn&apos;t go with her. She returned and told me that she had seen the craft moving slowly away to the south, when it quickly accelerated away faster than a jet, and disappeared to the south. The police report appeared in the local newspaper the next day, saying the officers had chased a flying disc down our road to a point directly in front of our house, where it suddenly slowed and turned southward, flying exactly over our home, then sped off in a southerly direction at incredible speed. As we lived quite close to Selfridge Air Force Base, both my family and the officers were well aquainted with the different types and speed of military aircraft at the time, so when they say incredible speed, they mean it. That incident so traumatized me, and my Mother, that I blocked it out of my mind for years afterward, and even now, I can&apos;t bring my mind to recall certain details of what I saw. Slowly over the years, I&apos;ve been able to remember a little more, and a little more, but not enough to satisfy my curiosity. I want to remember who or what I saw inside that ship, and I know there were certain details about the edges of the windows that ! absolutly astounded me for some reason, but my memory will not yet allow me to know these things. I truly hope that someday I will. This was my first of several related incidents, and by far the most documented, what with police officers as additional witnesses, so I decided to report it on this website. After keeping it to myself all this time, it feels good just to know it has finally been reported.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

A man reported to me that he and his wife were just heading out for a couple of days fishing trip at Prince Rupert, British Columbia. They were just outside of Terrace, B.C.  driving on highway #16 along the Skeena River heading west when the man&apos;s wife gave out a yell for him to look up and towards the south. The gentleman said it took a couple of seconds before his brain kicked in, thinking what he was looking at was very unusual. He pulled the vehicle over to the side of the road and both watched an egg shaped object hovering over the south side of the river at approx: 1000 feet. They mentioned it was approx: the size of a pick-up truck, shiny silver in color. It was completely smooth, or no seams on the object were visible. &quot;Witness expressed: it looked like an egg&quot;!! (he laughed and said they must grow large chickens in Canada). They did not hear any sounds coming from it. The sighting lasted for approx: 10 to 15 seconds before it sped off at an incredible rate of speed south. He also said that since it wasn&apos;t that early in the morning there were other vehicles passing them on the highway, and a couple of vehicles had slowed way down and they could been seen looking in the direction of the object. The witness said I know what normal aircraft look like, and this thing was not anything that I have ever seen before. HBCC UFO Note: Of course I am looking for any others who were traveling the highway that morning in hopes they may have seen the same thing.

It seemed to me that the hight was about 10 meters. The formation floated over the trees at the right site of the street. There was no sound. There was no wind that night. It was about 17 degrees Celcius. The formation was made of completely round balls in two circles. The balls in the inner circle were bigger as the balls in the outer circle. They were &apos;made of&apos; white smoke or clouds (misty?). When I reached my house and stopped, the formation also stopped mooving and I watched it for quite some time. The inner circle rotated slowly in the opposite direction as the outer circle. I looked around if one of the neighbours was still awake, in order to ask somebody if I was imagining this event, but I saw no lights burning. I had to feed my pats and so I entered the house. In the backgarden I tried to find the formation in the sky, but couldn&apos;t find it. When I left my house again, the formation was gone. I felt uncomfortable. I cycled back to the centre of town to meet my husband and friends and told them what I saw. I could not give an explanation and realised that I had seen a UFO. One friend told about lasershows, projecting light on clowds, but I was sure I had not seen something like that. A few months later I saw a show like that and this was something completely different. About a year back I saw a picture on Discovery Channel of a UFO that was seen in (if I remember well) Australia, simular to what I had seen.

We live about ten blocks from the Atlantic Ocean.  The sky was clear.  In a couple of minutes my husband said, &quot;Do you see that, look!&quot; We were facing south-southwest and above in the sky I saw two sphere-shaped objects, slightly star-like, not as bright, but a hazy light grey color.  They were very round yet there was not a glow but a slight haze around them. They were moving at maybe a 45 degree angle from the ground from west to east in a southeast direction.  In other words, they appeared to be descending.  They were parallel to one another and moving faster than a plane, very smoothly, totally silent, down towards the tree line.  They were fairly large, larger than an average star, maybe about a quarter of the size of a full moon high in the sky. My husband thinks they were smaller, more star sized. In relation to an aircraft normally seen around this area, they were fairly low.  Their flight pattern was very unusual.  They were very close to one other, as I said, parallel, then at one point the object to the right crossed over to the left of the other&apos;s path. They continued to head south in a parallel formation till we could no longer see them as there were trees and buildings blocking the view. We ran into the house and my husband checked the time, it was 4:14AM. Neither of us have even seen anything like this.  We were up late but totally sober. We frequently look at the sky.  We watch shuttle launches and shooting stars.  I even saw a flaming meteor a few months ago streak from east to west in the same sky.  These objects were totally unlike anything we have ever experienced.  I looked on the Internet at UFO pictures and the closest thing to them are the so-called &quot;Phoenix lights&quot;, or the round shapes that someone photographed during the recent lunar eclipse, which, by the way, we also watched.  Yet the objects we saw were more defined in their spherical shape and were not stationary.", "At 14:15 P.M. over Ford City, PA, 40 miles NE of Pittsburgh, I saw a pale object moving at a rapid pace from the NW to the SE.On Saturday, July 19th, 2003, at approximately 14:15 EST, I witnessed an object high in the sky, going from northwest to the southeast in the skies over Ford City, PA. Ford City is approximately 40 miles northeast of Pittsburgh along the Allegheny River. At first, I thought it was nothing more than a plastic bag, or balloon caught in a stream of wind. However, as I kept looking I noticed the object was moving much too fast of a pace to be a balloon, or a plastic bag. Also, the object moved in a consistent, smooth, straight line. To the best of my knowledge, plastic bags and balloons wouldn&apos;t behave in such a manner. I can&apos;t determine how high the object was, but I know that I had to strain my eyes to see it, suggesting that it was pretty high. Also, I wasn&apos;t able to determine its size. I saw no beams or lights being emitted from the object. The object was very light, whitish in color. I tried to make out the shape, but it seemed to shift in shape, from box-shaped, to triangular, hence I thought it may be a plastic bag. At the time of the sighting, the weather is absolutely perfect. Crystal-clear, blue skies, with very few clouds and low humidity. There was no sound or contrail, so I know it wasn&apos;t any kind of jet or helicopter. Furthermore, the object covered about 130 degrees of sky in about 15 seconds. I&apos;d be very interested in knowing if anyone else in either Allegheny, Armstrong, Westmoreland, or Indiana counties observed this event as well.

I told my mother what I was seeing and got off the phone to pay attention. I saw a very bright light in the sky, that was alternating white to gold, with a bit of red and then mostly white light, that I thought was a planet, and I looked again and saw it was an aircraft of some sort.  The location was directly above Paine Field, the Boeing plant in Everett Washington.  There was a LOT of aircraft activity in the sky, some very fast moving jets were flying around.  It was easy for me to tell after a few moments, that this object was hovering and it was not a regular plane or coptor. All of a sudden, out of the blue, another one appeared.  This one was in a direct line to the right and made a perfect angle.  They both sat there glowing for about 3-5 mins. I called the local television station and told them what I was seeing.  As I continued to look, the top object, the larger brighter one moved in a dirct line up then moved to the right, the lights dimmed and I was able to see a shape.  As best as I can describe it, it was like a cylinder, and it had a metallic look like nothing I have ever seen before.  Then it completely disappeared.  It kind of like, dimmed, and then it was absolutely gone!  Then the other one did the same thing, and I turned my back for an instant, looked back and there was absolutely no sign of it.

There was a small open field to my left. Just then I had a strange feeling come over me, something said look up and there it was, about 100 feet or so in the sky was a plane or so I thought. It was over my right shoulder, I stopped for a second then rode my bike under the ship. It moved real slow, I was not scared at the time. I was not peddling either, just coasting along, and it floated like a balloon would. The color red sticks out in my mind and I don&apos;t know why. It was triangle shaped, more like a V or wing. Not really big, about the size of a jet fighter (plane). I saw lights underneath the craft. It happened so long ago I don&apos;t remember the details such as markings, engines, or glass. I know what I saw was real. The ship was so close to me I could have hit it with a rock. It finally dawned on me that there was no sound, no engine noise. All I remember hearing was a muffling sound.

We contiued to watch it for a few minutes and it came closer and closer.  We couldn&apos;t hear anything but we were pretty sure it was a helicopter with its landing lights on or somthing.  As it came even closer the light shut off, and all we could see were a few green lights. We both just stood and watched in amazment as it came right over us probably only about 100 ft up in the air.  We could feel the air around us moving and a wind picked up, but still hardly ANY SOUND. All we could hear was a chopping sound like a helicopter would make but only faintly.

It then speeded up and shot out of sight going north east I&apos;d say at about 1,000 mph.", "The object has been seen by both my husband and me two times, at night.  The object is a glowing crescent, the color of the sodium (Na) &quot;D&quot; line. It hovered over Byrd Spring Lake for about 15 minutes on June 4. Last night it emitted extremely bright yellow flashes that lit up the lake and the inside of our house.  The bright yellow flashes were not the orange of the sodium spectrum. There is nothing behind the lake for several miles.  There is a hunting preserve, followed forests on the Redstone Arsenal.  We heard no noise, and the object was stationary.  It has disappeared, as if the lights were turned off, and then returned.  It is shaped like a crescent.((NUFORC Note:  We assume that the sighting occurred at night, and we have amended the time accordingly.

We were all just relaxing and looking at the stars when all of the sudden a fairly large bright star looking object that was above us for sometime started to move. It went unnoticed before because when it was still it looked like just another star in the sky. When the object started to move it was CLEARLY not an airplane or a satelitte. It started off moving a signifigant distance acorss the sky, from a our view of the sky I would say a few feet, which I&apos;m sure in terms of space is millions of miles.  After doing that a few times it came to a stand still. When it was at this stand still, I&apos;m sure that it was directly above us, and when i say directly I mean as in if they dropped a pin it would have hit us. After repeating this process a few times, it went it to a frenzy of figure 8&apos;s. When the figure 8&apos;s occured we all noticed three other birght &quot;star figures&quot; which in turn were UFO&apos;s as well. They did not do as much moving as the one above us did. It seemed as though the one above myself and my compainions was the leader and the other three were followers. After doing the figure 8&apos;s and unexplainable patterns for about 10-30 min, it stoped abruptly. Right as it stopped, a car drove by us, this was probablly about 3:30 AM in a suburban area, thats not very typical for our neighborhood. The creepy thing about the car was that it stared directly at us when it drove by, which at 3 in the morning, and in very dark night on a hill, is strange. They should not have known we were up there because we made no noise and blended in with the hill. After the car drove by we became very frightened and ran back to my friends house.((NUFORC Note:  Date in July 2002 is approximate.  PD))", "My brother caled me outside to see a white light slowly heading east. The light appered to slightly speed up and slow down as it travled across the sky. As an aircraft flew in the direction of the light, it chainged directions and flew from the east to a east northeast direction. We watched it till it passed out of our line of sight.", "A cigar shaped craft the size of a football field, very slowly came hovering over our neighbourhood and stayed for 1/2 hour.In the evening, after dinner, my little sister(8) at the time, ran into our home in a panic and hyperventilating.  While lying on the floor, she pointed to the outside.  Thinking some bullies chased her, I went outside on our corner lot to take a look and then I saw it too, coming over the field near our house.  It was a huge black cigar-shaped ship the length of a football field and it slowly, very slowly hovered just above the tree tops.  It came right over the other houses and then it stopped right over our house.  I had two other sisters who saw it.  My mother came out too and saw it.  I ran to maybe four other homes and got them to come out and see this.  I was 13 at the time and very excited to know these things really did exist.  This craft just stayed there for about 1/2 hour hovering and it made a soothing humming sound.  It had some red and white lights flashing off and on the underbelly of the craft.  When it got dark out, the humming increased in pitch and frequency, then the craft slowly turned around while going upwards, turning faster and faster while it went higher and all we saw were three white lights spinning until it disappeared.((NUFORC Note:  Date is sighting is approximate.

It was Oct,could be Oct. &apos;77 or &apos;79. This is 1 of several sightings that I have had and the last to be what I consider extra-terrestrial. I just got done bowling from my Tuesday bowling league. I was going to a bar right after that to have a few beer with a friend of mine and discuss the upcoming Lions game. Actually both of us were were more interested in the gal working behind the bar. Anyways, I left the bowling ally and proceeded north to my destination. Nice evening. Sun still up. Beautiful fall day.I went about a 1/4 mile and all  of a sudden my FM radio started making a hissing noise that I never heard on the radio before. I pushed the buttons set to different frequencys and got the same hiss. I took the tuner button and manually turnd the radio throughout the whole FM band and all I got was the same noise. Then I tried the same thing on the AM band to no avail. I thought my radio was broke being I got the same noise on both bands all the way through both bands. I got to the bar I was headed for and parked facing south. One more time I tried to go through the Am band and all of a sudden the Am band started fading in. Just as this happemed I noticed something in my peripheral a few hundred yards moving south. It was below 500 ft altitude and I heard no sound as it passed by me. I couldn&apos;t see it as it passed by me in the parking lot because it was almost directly overhead. It hit me that this craft was putting out some kind of electromagnetic interference. Next thing that hit my mind was to identify the craft so I got out of the car. The craft was gaining altitude then leveled off at no more than 1,000 ft. I got a very good look, no wings, no rotor, no gondola. Just a disk shaped object, big red light on top of the dome, all kind of flashing lights on the edge. Looked like something out of a Spielberg movie. This was no plane, helicopter, ballon or even marsh gas. I could clearly see the edge of the disk did not come to a point but was about 4 1/4 feet thic! k at the edge. I would like to point out at this time I am a vetran of naval aviation and familiar with identifying air craft. I worked on fligt lines on naval air stations, air force bases, and the air craft carrier John F. Kennedy pre flighting air craft, launching, recovering, and maintaining aircraft. I worked as an aviation fire control bombing technition in a photo recon squadron. I was also in an electronic warfare squadron where I also worked in radio communication, radio navigation and electronic warfare systems. I believe I knew what I saw and what was happening. By the way, that is the only time the radio in that car didn&apos;t work. Next thing I knew my friend was hollering from behind me, &quot;Did you see those lights?&quot; I told him I could still see them. The object was heading south about 1/2 mile away at that time. Then by chance another friend and his wife happened to drive up and park. First friend said he saw the craft enter the atmosphere from many miles up, more miles higher than any plane could ever fly. He said it came down below treetop level. That is where I first saw it, rising from a field where I used to play little league baseball. That is about the time I saw it as it was gaining altitude and going south. Second friend and his wife happened to be coming home from visiting the wife&apos;s mother and thought they were watching a planecrash. I pointed the object out to them. Their jaws dropped wide open. Many people saw this. Next to show were State Police. They saw people milling around, stopped  and we had a short conversation something like this: Cops- &quot;What is everybody looking at?&quot;  Me- &quot;A ufo, sir&quot;. Cops- laughing and makingcoments about little green men. Me-&quot;Do you want to see the ufo?&quot;  Cops- &quot;Yes!&quot;  Me- &quot;Then turn your heads and look out the windshield.&quot; End of conversation because when they turned their heads to look, they saw, then their jaws dropped wide open. Then suddenly for a split second they looked at each other. Next thing they did was simultainiously roll their squad car windows shut and proceed down the road approaching close to 100 mph.I never saw the objct do more than 20 mph. I&apos;m starting to think I whised that I was with them because by the time they got a half mile down the road they got a nice close look, but then all of a sudden they slamed on the brakes and ducked into a restaurant for coffee and doughnuts. So my friends and I had to chase it down ourselves. We kept up with it for almost 20 minutes until we lost sight of it.  I talk to very few people abouy ufos((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I got out, and saw a huge triangular craft.  It was gunmetal in color, and had bright white lights on each tip of it, with one also in the middle.  It was lighting up the yard, the lights were so bright.  It hovered over us for 10 to 12 minutes, before slowly moving off to the north.

At 9:30 p.m. CDT, on May 23, 2003, a family of three (mother, father, and 23-year old son) were headed north on Highway 17 in Webster City, Iowa when they met and drove under a dark, slow-moving triangle (speed is estimated at only 15-20 mph, and the sighting was of 3 minutes duration) as it headed south above Highway 17.  The son estimates the triangle&apos;s altitude as only a few hundred feet in the air, and even though it was deep twilight, the sky was still light enough to not only see the triangle as it approached, but to also discern the structure as they drove beneath it.  [Weather conditions were as follows:  Clear, below 12,000 feet; Visibility 10 miles; Temperature 57 degrees Fahrenheit; Wind out of the East at 6 mph]  Bright orange lights were observed at each angle of the object, although those lights did not illuminate the structure nor surrounding area.  The family observed what seemed to be a lighter gray circular area on the underside of the structure, with some sort of line, or stripe, or structural component leading from each angle in toward the circle in the middle.  With the car radio turned off and the window rolled down, the family could hear no sound associated with the object.  After meeting the object and driving beneath it, the family turned off on a side street and circled back around the block (while doing so, trees blocked their view) so that they were now back on Highway 17, only now they were headed south -in the same direction as the triangle had been moving - but by this time, the triangle was nowhere in sight.  The bright orange lights they had observed as the object approached (during this 3-minute sighting) had actually seemed a bit dimmer as they drove beneath the object, and the family theorized that perhaps the orange lights at the three angles were situated toward the top of the triangle rather than closer to its underside.  &quot;Apparent&quot; size estimate is that the object looked to be about the size of three full moons.  The family has indicated that they are not looking f! or any public attention regarding this incident.

However, because of the background of the witness in this case, we make an exception.  This is one of two high-quality reports submitted by the same source.  PD)) Connection between my vivid dream and reported sighting of crescent-shaped ufo over Huntsville, AL?Seeing a June 2003 report of a crescent-shaped ufo over Byrd Spring Lake in Huntsville, AL (~3 miles from my home), and not knowing the details of the second sighting of the crescent-shaped object, prompted me to submit the following diary entry I wrote with respect to a &quot;dream&quot; I had in January 2003.  It took me weeks to stop thinking about my dream and I still wonder about it even now. For the record, I am a 40 year old mechanical engineer with much NASA and DOD design experience, have an avid interest in aircraft and flying machines, am happily married with two children, and am mentally stable.  I am very scientific in my approach to problems/solutions and take great care to apply my knowledge of engineering and science to the world around me.  I do believe that we are not alone. I am submitting a sketch of the object seen in my &quot;dream&quot; via email. My rather lengthy diary entry is as follows:  Just so I can remember later I will document a &quot;dream&quot; I had the other night.  I can not say I actually observed what I will describe, but the vivid detail of the dream, the fact that I could remember so much of it, and a power outage that left both myself and my wife with an inexplicable &quot;weird&quot; feeling about the power outage that night makes me wonder if maybe it really happened. During the night of January 21, 2003 (morning of Jan 22), my wife and I were awoken by a strange beeping sound coming from somewhere in the room.  This sound reminded me of the sound that our old answering machine would make to indicate the end of a message.  The beep was periodic and would beep, then be silent, beep, silent, etc.  I remember about three or four beeps. As I was becoming conscious, my wife said &quot;what&apos;s that&quot;, and I said I don&apos;t know&quot;, to which she responded &quot;the power&apos;s out&quot;.  About that time there were no more beeps to my recollection.  We both were very puzzled as to the nature of this power outage, for some unknown reason, and felt there was something odd about it.  The baby monitor we&apos;ve been using, has battery back-up on both the transmitter and receiver side should there be a power failure.  A day or so later, I tested this feature by unplugging both the receiver and the transmitter power supplies and observing the result.  The battery back-ups worked fine and there was no beeping.  The monitor, nor any other device in the house of which I am aware, emits any sound when the power is off, or when the power cycles on and off.  (At some point in this whole incident, I noted the time to be around 3:00 am, must be after the power came back on??)  When I was aware enough of what was going on, I decided to get up to check on the kids and peek outside to see what was happening.  I do not recall that I actually checked on either of the girls, but I do remember leaving our bedroom into the upstairs hall and looking out the front Palladian window.  I noted that the street light was off and it seemed very dark outside.  The lights in the valley were on, so it appeared to me that the outage was isolated to our street.  At some point I remember that I realized the power came back on and that the street light was re-lighting.  My wife may have said &quot;it&apos;s back on&quot;, I don&apos;t know.  I think I remember getting back into bed, and maybe that I used the bathroom, first (I can&apos;t be sure). Of itself, the previous seems ordinary, I admit.  When I awoke in the morning, I recalled a &quot;dream&quot; or &quot;dreamy event&quot; in vivid detail and could not get it out of my head.  This is very unusual for me since I normally can not remember 99.9% of my dreams no matter how hard I try. This is one of three dreams I can remember in any detail for the last 15 to 20 years or more.  They all may be related.  My memory of this &quot;dreamy event&quot;, as I refer to it, is not complete, but I can remember many striking details. We have a north-westerly facing Palladian window, which is in our two story entrance foyer.  When in the second floor hallway/balcony, one can look straight out the window.  Otherwise, it is 14 to 20 feet above one&apos;s head, from the first floor.  Although I can not remember exactly when in the night this happened, or time-wise, how it relates to the power outage, I remember looking out the Palladian window and observing a deep red light shinning down from above the window.  The color of the light was not quite ruby red, it had a quality to it that hinted of a touch of purple/violet added to it, but not enough to move it very far from a pure red color.  My oldest daughter has a lava lamp that gives off light of roughly the same hue.  The light was diffuse in nature and seemed to emanate from a point above the house and possibly centered over the house.  From the foyer and hallway, no source could be detected.  There was also, what seemed like another light of exactly the same color that was flashing on and off with a steady period; it also seemed to emanate from the same unseen source. I remember walking down the stairs and looking up and out of the said window trying to determine the source of what I was seeing, but not being successful.  I also looked out the library window, to the north, and observed the same lights illuminating the trees outside that window.  Something led me to believe that I could get a better look if I went out the back door to look up.  The angle of the light, perhaps told me its source was closer to the backyard than the front. The next thing I recall was standing on the sidewalk to the back porch with my gaze turned toward the house, and up toward a point over our master bedroom.  I was in awe of the sight before me. Hovering over our house was a very large disk-shaped craft.  I thought several things to myself at that instant. &quot;I&apos;ve got to remember what this thing looks like&quot;, &quot;I wish my wife was here to see this&quot;, and &quot;for it being in the 20&apos;s outside, I don&apos;t feel cold, in fact I&apos;m very comfortable&quot;. My recollection of the technical details of what I was seeing at the time are more sketchy than I would like, however, here is what I can recall.  I would estimate its diameter to be approximately 30 feet, based on a quick mental comparison to the house directly below it.  The disc was hovering, completely motionless, maybe 20 feet to 40 feet over the house.  On its &quot;belly&quot; for lack of a better word, were what I recall as 6 lights arranged hexagonally with respect to one another, with a 7th light in the dead center of the craft.  The centerline of the hexagonal pattern of lights was inboard of the outside edge of the craft by approximately 4 feet.  The color of the 6 lights was the same red color I have already described, although at this point, none of them was flashing, they were steady and not extremely intense.  I don&apos;t think I could look directly at any of them due to the nature and quality of the light they were emitting.  I seem to think the light in the dead center was white.  All the lights appeared to be the same diameter and looked as though they were fixed and non-moveable/non-aim able.  I don&apos;t remember the diameter of each light, and can&apos;t remember if they took up a large portion of the available real estate on the craft&apos;s bottom, or only a small portion.  I seem to remember them as relatively small in diameter.  There may have been additional white lights, a sort of annular ring around each red light (I don&rsquo;t know for sure). The contour of the bottom of the craft and its thickness escape me.  I want to say it was very flat on the bottom and, at least, had a thin edge.  The total height and top side were not able to be observed from my perspective.  I made my observations in what seemed like only a second or two before the color of the lights changed; to what, I don&apos;t know, I want to say white.  The craft lifted higher into the air and rotated 90 degrees, or so, counterclockwise and pitched upward 5 or 10 degrees.  If I could have put a line on the disc pointing N NE, that line would have now rotated to the W NW. (direction of flight)  As the craft performed its rotation and changed its pitch to a more skyward angle, I observed 2 additional structures.  On top of the craft I could see a portion of a long, thin rectangular object oriented longitudinally, along the &quot;direction of flight&quot; (as described by my imaginary line, above) and positioned above and through the center of the craft, as if being lifted and supported by the disc. The rectangular object had a square cross section that I felt was in the neighborhood of 3&apos; by 3&apos; and a more broadened &quot;tip&quot; that gave the impression of it being a &quot;cockpit&quot;.  (Although I never felt it was a cockpit, that&apos;s just an easy way to describe its appearance).  It was (based on the 3&apos; cross section) about 6&apos; long, by 5&apos;wide, by 5&apos; tall centered left and right, as well as up and down on the rectangle.  The sides of the &quot;cockpit&quot; portion were flat and straight while &quot;nose&quot; was radiused and sloped both up to the top and down to the bottom surfaces with an angled portion (see sketch).  Looking at the color and sheen of the material gave me the feeling that the structure was made of a charcoal-gray ceramic material.  The finish was dull and lusterless, although very smooth and perfectly flat.  The structure was one contiguous piece of material with no seams, windows, rivets, etc.  It was perfect as though it was &quot;grown&quot; into that shape.  The &quot;cockpit&quot; portion of the rectangular object was outboard of the disk enough that there was a good separation between it and the disk (4&apos;???). The second structure I observed was at what could be described as the aft end of the assembly.  This was crescent-shaped object, in the same plane as the disc, made of the same material as the rectangle.  Top to bottom, the thickness was the same as the rectangle (3&apos;???).  The bottom surface was very flat and I could not see the top surface, but assumed it was equally flat.  The crescent inside radius was offset aft (with respect to the direction of flight) of the disk by the same amount the &quot;cockpit&quot; shape was forward and its radius was equal to that of the disc plus offset.  The outside radius of the crescent was such that it caused the crescent to look like a waxing or waning moon with a taper starting at 0 to a max width about equal to the offset between the crescent and disc (4&apos;??).  I did not note any attachment between the crescent and any other part of the assembly, it was just &quot;there&quot;.  I could not viualize the area between the disc and crescent as there was not enough light  The crescent looked as though it could be slid toward the craft and cradle it.  The chord length of the crescent looked to be the same as the diameter of the disc.  The surfaces of both the inside and outside radii were both perfectly flat and seamless.  The bottom surface of the crescent appeared to be in the same plane as the bottom of the disc.  Based, again on comparison with the house, I estimated the total length of the assembly to be around 45 to 50 feet. These observations were made in only a second or two.  As the disc rotated and pitched upward, the other structures only became visible as they apparently reflected some light.  I remember wondering why I could see them, since it was the middle of the night, but just assumed streetlights were the light source.  I also remember thinking &quot;so that&apos;s how they do it&quot; in relation to the dark rectangular and crescent structures and I knew for a fact that the disc was &quot;driving&quot; the whole assembly; the rectangle and crescent were there only for the ride.  As the craft  pitched up, I waved &quot;goodbye&quot; as if the occupants were good friends and it streaked off at amazing speed toward the West.  There was a very slight high pitched sound that it made as it left, similar to that of the sonar ping from many popular war movies, except without the reverberation.  The sound was pure, momentary, faint, and trailed off. The next thing I remember, it was morning.  Later in the day I discussed the &quot;weirdness&quot; of the power outage with my wife and she agreed there was something odd about it, but what she did not know.  I asked her if she had seen any lights that night and she answered that she thought it was the utility company.  Later, the day after that, she had no recollection of seeing any lights.  For a whole week following the &quot;dream&quot; the inside of my mouth was raw and dry and some of my molars hurt.  (I assumed that eating cashews was likely the cause, but I continued to eat them and my mouth cleared up).  A week later I spoke briefly to our neighbor, directly across the street, and asked her if anything odd had gone on with respect to the outage and she said that not everything had been without power and that one of her clocks was flashing 9:30 when she got up, and based on the time of the outage should have said 3:30, or so.  A few days later I was speaking with another neighbor, two houses up the street, and she had mentioned that there had been a power outage (I verified with her that that was the same outage) and that their transformer had burned out, leaving them and three other houses without power for over 8 hours.  The utility company attributed the transformer burn out to too much current draw on too small and old a transformer. There is no evidence to suggest that any of this happened, or could have happened.  For all I know, it was just a vivid dream and concerned a subject about which I have an interest.  I wanted to document what I remember because I still think about it over a week later.  I NEVER remember my dreams. ******* PLEASE CONTACT ME ONLY VIA EMAIL, IF NECESSARY.

I did&apos;nt feel threatened by it,but the size of it overwhelmed me and I drove off quickly for about another 1/4 mile and and again slowed down.As I looked back,it was still just sitting there,hovering.I was just very anxious(and scared) to get home in New Castle at this point to tell my folks what I had seen.I reported it the the H.C.sheriffs office,they took my name,phone# and was told they would check it out.I never heard back from them.I always rode home with a co-worker after that,I never witnessed it again.I&apos;ve always wondered what would have happened if I had stopped and got out of my car.I sometimes think I missed out on a once in a lifetime chance of being part of something &apos;special&apos;.In any case,I&apos;ve never seen or experienced anything remotely like it since.((NUFORC Note:  Date and time are approximate.", "triange shaped craft with three bright lights came within ten yards of our car on hwy in NevadaMy wife and two kids (3yrs and 4yrs old at the time), were driving back from California, headed toward Las Vegas on Interstate 15.  It was a very clear night, with lots of stars.  I forget if the date was Jan. 2nd or 3rd of 2000, but it was between 10:30p.m.-11:30p.m. and my children were asleep in the back seat in there car seats.  I was driving, and my wife was passenger in the front seat.  We were near the Nevada border( within 25 miles either way), when my wife and I noticed 3 bright, white lights in a row, one behind the other.  They were about 200 yards in front of us, and about 15 yards to the right side of the highway,(south) at a hight of approximately three telephone poles.  They appeared to be hovering, or moving very slowly toward us.  As we aproached within 50 yards, the lights began to ratate, slowly, as if on a side of a plate that was perpindicular and spinning downward.  My wife and I nearly lost our breath as it came right at us.  My wife thought it was actually going to crash into us, but as the spiraling lights appeared to almost hit the ground in the ditch next to hwy.(aprox. 10 yards from car at a 1:00 angle), the lights abruptly went out.  I thought for sure the thing should have crashed and that was why the lights went out, but there was no crash sound.  My wife then told me that right as the lights went out it abruptly made 90 degree turn toward the south and disapeared at a rediculous amount of speed.  Since I was driving, all I saw were the lights(about the size of tires, spaced aprox. 10 yards apart).  My wife however was able to see the dark shodow of a craft, stating it was wing shaped, moderately flat, with the three lights positioned on the side, and bars hanging from the front(possible landing gear).  The craft made so sound at any time, and for being so close to our car when abruptly changing direction there was no turbulance from any propulsion system.  I am curious if we have any technology in propulsion systems that would allow the sudden direction of! change, with abrupt changes to extreme speeds, without making a sound.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "Two lights in a series formation traveling at about 200MPH with no sound at close proximaty.I was coming home from church one evening and all of sudden there were two white lights that passed right over my car in the same direction that I was traveling. They were about 100ft above my car, barely high enough to miss the trees. But, what got my attention was that there was no sound coming from them. I also had my windows rolled down, and if there was any sound, I would have heard it, because it was really quiet outside. They were traveling at about 200MPH. Also, the two lights were traveling in a series formation at about 150-200ft apart. Since it was dark outside I&apos;m guessing the color of the crafts body was flat-black, all we noticed was the lights, which were about 1-2ft in diameter. My mother was also observing this from the front passenger seat. This is the first encounter of ufo&apos;s we have ever witnessed. If you want my opinion I think it&apos;s some government related project, because there has already been a fighter jet that has crashed nearby.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

When they turned back to see the object it had turned into a light and it streaked across the sky from north to southwest.

It looked to be over maybe Islip Terrace or so....  I made the next exit onto a side street to see the helicopter, but it was blocked out by trees.  Instead, going northwest towards Brentwood and Commack, I saw a pair of red lights side by side.  They looked pretty far apart, so if they were on airplane wingtips, either the plane was very large, or flying very low.  I had gotten out of my vehicle by this point and heard nothing.  I also saw no other lights between them to suggest any kind of airplane I&apos;ve ever seen (like a tail light or something).

We do not know if this is a serious report, or not.  PD))4 foot being produces &quot;orb&quot; of bright light and disappears.My wife arrived home from work late one evening in a state of panic and terror. She was pounding on the front door so shaken, she was unable to get her key into the lock. It was very disturbing for me to see my wife going through the fear she was experiencing. I assumed she had been assaulted or raped. As I was getting ready to call the police, she was able to calm down somewhat and she told me to put the phone down, that it would not do any good anyway. Confused and shaken I asked why. She explained that as she was pulling into our apartment complex, she was slowing down to select a parking spot (in low level light) when she noticed what appeared to be a small child playing around a large steel waste dumpster in the corner of the parking lot. The steel dumpster was located underneath a large stand of trees about 15 feet from her location.  She got out of her car and walked over to the rear passenger door (facing the dumpster)to get her brief case and saw movement out of her periphery that further caught her attention.  Her next concern was if this child was too young to be playing out in the dark late at night. She began to slowly walk towards the dumpster to ask where the childs parents are at. As she approached the dumpster she could make out the contrasting shape of a head peeking out from one corner as she calmly spoke. She approached to within 6-8 feet when she heard a loud banging noise and this &quot;child&quot; suddenly had an ability to high jump 5 feet. It was then standing on top of the dumpster&apos;s steel lid staring down at her.  At this point she described feeling a pressure in her head, nausea and dizziness (this may have been a physical reaction to fear.) She told me she strained to identify if it was a neighborhood child who was staring at her for about 20-30 seconds, a kind of &quot;stand-off&quot;.  Just as she realized this was not a child, the &quot;being&quot; produced a glowing-white orb of light about the size of a volleyball in its hands and held on to it at about chest height. The light cast off from the glowing orb illuminated its head for several seconds and she described a large almond shaped head with big black eyes staring intently at her movements. She told me that she just stood there in stunned silence trying to understand what was happening and that everything seemed to be happening in slow motion. The &quot;being&quot; seemed to tighten its grasp on the glowing orb of light and it jumped feet first into the dumpster and disappeared without making any noise. Right after that is when she began to break-down emotionally and run into the apartment. Between the time she entered our apartment and calming her down and debriefing her was about an 1-hour. With much reluctance (I&apos;ll admit I was really creeped out to do this). I went back out to the exact spot she described with my metal softball bat and D-Cell Mag-Lite. I had to know what it was that terrified my wife.  I examined that whole area, even to the point of looking inside the dumpster and I did not see or notice anything. Over the past several years we have seen many electric-white blue streaks of light in the area around this parking lot, during late evenings without any cloudcover and have had frequent but brief power outages. My wife and I conclude that these may be related to what she experienced. This is going out on a limb here, but my wife thinks that the orb of light was some kind of device that gave this &quot;being&quot; an ability to disappear, conceal or transport itself. At this point, we choose not to be contacted. Based on the emotional trauma she went through, I prefer that she moves on and put all of this behind her.", "Looking into the telescope, I was shocked to see that it wasn&apos;t a star, but a glowing cylindrical object.While looking at the night sky, I noticed that one of the &quot;stars&quot; was moving around.I watched the star move vertically, horizontally, diagonally, in squiggle-y at very high rates of speed.  I broke out my telescope, and once I had the object sighted, I was shocked to see that the object was not a star, but rather a glowing, neon-green cylindrical shape - it was almost worm-like.  It continued to move sporadically, and was difficult to keep up with using the telescope, but each time I got it sighted again, it appeared exactly the same - glowing, neon-green and cylindrical.My wife, my son and I observed the object both with the naked eye and using the telescope as it continued move in this manner for over an hour and a half, so far...it&apos;s still out there.((NUFORC Note:  Witness describes self as having a considerable degree of technical training.

PD))", "My co-worker brought to my attention something unusual in the sky while we were doing some work outside of the warehouse. I looked up to where he pointed. I saw what looked like three shiny round pellets suspended in the air somewhat perpendicular to each other giving the appearance that they were right on top of each other. There was a fourth object that was shaped like a cone pointed downward. This cone object was just below the three shiny round objects. This gave the overall visual image like that of holding a tripple snow cone up in the air. Near the bottom pointed end of the cone object there was a constant flash of light like that of a kodak camera when taking a snap shot. This would flash every 3 seconds. There was also the impression that the cone was spinning because of shadows and reflections that could be seen. The four objects came descending rapidly from high altitude. They were at first shiny specs in the sky and then within less than a minute I could see the details of the object getting more and more clearer as they descended. They were about the size of buck shot at half arms length. An airliner passed below the objects. After the plane passed below the objects, they began to quickly ascend and soon dissappeared in the morning sky. There was no sound other than the airliner that took off from the nearby airport.", "3 spheres of multi-colors circled and shot straight up out of site.saw three objects in the sky.  All were spheres and were changing different colors. They were flying in a v formation. After flying together for about 3 mins they stopped and then the outside two began slowly circling the each other in a very tight circle pattern. While circling, the lights on the outside spheres changed to red and the middle light changed to all green.after about another two minutes all three spheres shot straight up and out of site.", "faint triagle formation massachusetts rhode islandappeared to be three crafts traveling south east resembing faint stars.  i stress, very faint. pyramid was an accute triangle, furthest point leading the pack. approx the size of tip of thumb to bottom nuckle for the hypotonous then connecting your other fore finger and index finger as the accure angle.  if my orientation was correct, they would be crossing over, onto the atlantic just south of the rhode island / massachusetts border.  what i found odd about the occurance was the speed and the formation being a far distance apart traveling at that altitude. i was atop a roof watching fireworks in a town called attleboro MA.  my wife and i laid staring up at the stars for a short time thereafter.  there were city lights, however many stars were visable, these lights were much more faint.  i logged onto passur.com for logan airport (boston) and saw no travel in that direction, let alone that formation.  curious however if passur.com would report non-commerical aircraft. never seen anything i felt was unidentifialbe in the sky before.  came home type in google &quot;report ufo&quot; and presto... this site. hope it has legs.((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witnesses may have observed the triplet of satellites, thought to be part of the U.

The tripod was free and I tracked the object till it left the horizon.  its speed was very fast.  I could just barely keep it in the viewfinder, but both my girlfriend and I saw it.  I have seen satelites before and this was MUCH faster than one of them and this was far slower than a meteorite.  There were several witnesses with me and the object was not visible to the naked eye.  In the telescope the object&apos;s size and magnitude was that of a +4 star.  Again, I tracked the object in the viewfinder and my girlfriend just saw it for about a second, and it moved in a northern direction", "4 glowing circles 40 ft in diameter flying in rigid formation - aerial acrobatics 100 ft off the beach for &gt; 15 minutes -many witnessesI was on the beach, in the summer, with a close friend and his family after eating a buffet dinner at the Sea Horse Inn off 79th st and Atlantic Ave.. It had just become dark out, and we all watched 4 circular completely silent objects about 40 feet or more in diameter (along with all the others on the beach at the time -people were basically just quietly standing and gawking at these objects) and only about 100 feet offshore. They flew in rigid formation, straight up to an altitude of several hundred feet and then dipped to about 50 feet and would go straight up again. They kept this up almost as if they were doing yo yo tricks which no known aircraft I knew of could possibly do. Again they were completely silent. My friends mother suggested we leave the beach because she thought they could be UFOs and we could be in danger despite the wonder of it all. We did leave. My friend&apos;s mother said she saw the glowing objects the following night as well but I wasn&apos;t on the beach with her at that time. My eyes were excellent and though I was only about 11 at the time, I strained to get some detail because they were so close, but all I could make out was that the bottom of the craft emitted a white light, like the surface was emitting the light but it was a diffuse light and not directed like a beam. They light was not brilliant, but about as bright as a white screen on a modern day CRT. We discussed afterward what was unusual, which was that they were totally silent (we were only a 100 feet away from these aerial acrobats) and that they glowed, and that they were able to stay in such rigid formation while maneuvering vertically, like a yo yo, even when they would hover, start and stop abruptly, drop and rise again and hover, almost as if they were part of the same object. But we all agreed they appeared to be separate objects. We also felt it was unusual because this sighting was not far from the Naval base down the beach (which my friend and I once walked to from this location). There were no j! et intercepts and there was nothing in the paper the next day either. It must have been witnessed by at least more than 50 people. I know these were not moons or satelites etc. I owned a telescope at the time and would easily be able to identify such objects. They also did not have qualities I would associate with mirages. The edges of the objects were crisp and did not wobble. You could see the normal effects of size change with distance as well as they came close and moved away (perspective indicated these objects were probably within 100 feet of the beach). The experience itself is clear enough in my memory, but I would have to really do some digging to determine the date. It was either 1962 or 1963 and it was definitely either July or August. Those are the times I visited my friend in Va.. This report is factual and true in terms of what happened and what I saw. I am not speculating as to what the objects were, but did try to indicate what I knew they clearly were not as I thought this could help in terms of accuracy.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  One of two seemingly credible reports submitted by the same source.  PD))", "Bright light  formation moving at high rate of speed with no noiseI had just laid down and was looking out our window, I saw a bright white light with four smaller red lights forming a diamond shape around it. Distance was about 1/2 mile heading north at a high rate of speed. I see commercial jets flying over every day and it was moving alot faster than I have ever seen anything else move except for military aircraft. The light was very large which made me think it was close. I could hear sounds of of crickets outside but this object emmitted no noise, NONE!!!! I told my wife to look and she commented on how fast it was moving. She thought it was probably a military jet. I said it&apos;s not making any noise? I used to be an aircraft mechanic and my wifes father is an aircraft mechanic. We both have spent our lives around airports and aircraft. Neither of us could explain this as something we recognized. I just wonder if anyone else saw this?", "Enormous, oval shaped object, hovering over a field-it had lights that were like no other type of lights I&apos;ve seen.One night in the early spring of 1990,  my younger brother and I were out basically just being  teenagers-preparing for a weekend night of underage drinking and cruising around.  We had to drive about 12 miles down State Highway 6 to Clifton, Tx. to get ice for our cooler since no stores were open in our hometown of Valley Mills.  On the way back, as our beer was cooling down, something happened that made us totally forget our plans.  Between the two towns, as we were driving along, my brother suddenly yelled &quot;What the hell is that???!!!&quot;  I looked over towards a very large, open field and saw a sight that was probably the most amazing thing I have ever seen.  To this day, over 10 years later, the details are as sharp and clear in my mind as if it had happened yesterday.The object in the field was of enormous size.  It was hovering, probably not even 50 feet above the ground and VERY close to the highway.  I could see the outline of it-oval in shape and dark- colored.  It appeared to be larger than a football field and had a single row of lights along its middle.  The lights were different colors-amber,red, blue, and green; and almond-shaped.  But it wasn&apos;t the colors or shape of them that made an impression on me-it  was the light they produced.  It seemed that they were made of liquid or possibly a gaseous substance.  It is very hard to describe, because they were like no lights I have ever seen.  The closest I can compare them to would be neon; but still very different from neon. They were much brighter than standard neon but they didn&apos;t produce a glare-it was more like they were glowing.  Something in them seemed to be swirling or moving.  As I said, they were like nothing on this earth.The sighting only lasted a couple of minutes-I slowed and pulled onto the shoulder of the road, transfixed.  We both stared in disbelief and fascination until suddenly fear took over and I stepped on the gas and got out of there as fast as I could!  We were both so freaked out we forgot about our beer and went straight home.  We told my mom and my grandma about what we had seen; and they wanted to see if it was still there.  We drove out to the area, but it was gone.I&apos;ve told many people about my ufo sighting in the years since; but never reported it officially.  I truly believe that it was not of this planet, and I&apos;ve often wondered what we might have seen had we stayed a little longer.((NUFORC Note:  Date in March 1990 is approximate.

She was looking for possible answers over what her and her husband witnessed at the beginning of June at 9:00 p.m. in Ardmore Tennessee, United States. Also the witnessed talked with a friend shortly afterwards, explaining what the couple saw. To the witnesses surprise her friend also said she noticed the same bright light on the same evening at the same time when she was outside, but never gave it much thought until the witnesses brought the topic up. I hope I can come up with some kind of answer for the witnesses to this event. Report &amp; Update below:  I have been looking for something for almost a month now, to help me understand what we saw one night.We live in Southern Tennessee USA, in the central part.  My husband and I were coming home about 9:00 PM, and as we started down the road towards our home, I got a glimpse  of a very bright light off to the north of us, not very high up, over the tree tops, it was more of a glowing or illumination...not a reflection!  I told my husband to look, and as he looked up, he said it was a plane.  I told him that it was not and since it was moving slow, I was gonna follow it, and we did.  We took back roads and tried to keep it in site, at one point, we went down a dirt road and it looked like it just hovered above the trees, maybe 1500 feet or so.  It was a giant egg shape.  At first I thought it was a blimp, and as of yet, I am not sure what it was.....one thing for sure, it was something I had never seen before.  There was no sound at all, and it was moving very slowly.  Not once did it speed up.  As it moved out of sight, we had to drive a short distance to be able to see it again, and it was moving to the South west....still not making a sound.  As we got into town, where we could see it better, it was moving further away, and appeared to be going higher.   Other people had to have seen it, but nothing was ever mentioned in the papers or to the police.  About 2 weeks later, I was talking to a friend who lives in the area and told her about it, and it jogged her memory to the same night, she went outside, and just looked up and seen a bright light, and wondered what it was, but never thought nothing else about it.  I have tried to find out what a blimp looks like at night in the sky, and I can&apos;t find anything.  I wanted to call the airport in Huntsville Ala, and see if they seen anything on radar, but my husband said, &quot;They probably wouldn&apos;t tell you if they did.&quot; So I didn&apos;t call them. Can you help me out,  what do you think it was?  Anything you can tell me, I would appreciate it.Thank You.(name deleted by HBCC UFO Research)  Update: I asked a number of questions in hopes of trying to get a better idea of what the folks saw that evening. Below is the witnesses response. Thanks for the answer to my email.  I will try to answer the questions as well as possible. It took place about the first part of June, of this year 2003.,about 9:00 PM.  The weather had been rainy for a few days, but it was rather clear that night, during that time.  From the time we spotted the light, until we lost sight of it, was about 30 minutes, I think.  Maybe 45, with all the driving up and down dirt roads and trying to find it again when it would go behind the trees and hills.  At one time when we seen it hovering, we had driven down a hill on a dirt road, and it was off to our left, hovering above the trees, if I held out my arm and measured the length of it between my index finger and thumb, it would have probably been about an inch and half to 2 inches in length.  (My arms are short also)  When we seen it hovering, we could not make out any details on it, it was just bright, no sound, no flashing lights, no indications of windows or anything like that.  It was just so bright, I don&apos;t see how anyone didn&apos;t see it.  The town we live in, is Ardmore Tennessee, which borders the state of Alabama also.  Interstate 65 runs north and south. And the town of Ardmore is located on the line.  As we drove into town, so we could get a better look, due to the horizon line, we noticed that no one even acted like they seen it.  The teens were cruising the strip and not even noticing what was going on.  As we entered the town, the road we were on was coming from the north east., and the object had moved across town and was headed to the West, southwest.  My friend that seen the light, lives south west of Ardmore, and she only briefly got a glimpse of the bright light, they have a lot of trees there and she couldn&apos;t see it at all, just a light in the sky, through the trees. The bright light was like the color of a fluorescent light, kind of glowing.  Putting off a lot of light around it.  I said it was egg shaped, more of an oval, with the egg lying on its side, not standing up.  When it hovered over the trees, it wasn&apos;t long, rather, we stopped and looked at it, maybe 2 minutes, and then we drove off, trying to get a better look, as it started moving slowly again.  It never made a sudden movement, and never sped up, unless it did so while we were driving to get a better look.  The path it took, seemed to be straight.  We were the ones going in circles. I was in awe, I have always been amazed at these things, and although people have made fun of me, I know my husband seen it with me that time.  When we finally got out of the woods and back up on top of the hill coming into town, it was headed on to the west, southwest.  And getting to far off to see it good, but you could still see the bright light.  It was just getting farther away, and my husband wanted to come home, and quit chasing something we may not want to catch. Usually when something odd is in the sky, the meteorologist say something about it on the news at 10:00 that night, but not a single word was said.  Especially Adrian Gibson on channel 31 in Huntsville Ala. where we get most of the weather conditions.  That&apos;s why my husband said it was probably a blimp.  I got on the Internet and tried to look up pictures of blimps at night, and nothing came up....that was any help. My friend said she didn&apos;t see anything that she could speak of, except the light.  She didn&apos;t see the object.  So I guess we will have to go on my word.  Attached is a drawing I did to kind of show you how it appeared at first.Thanks again (name deleted by HBCC UFO Research)  The statement below referrers to a computer drawing the witness sent to me which gave me a better idea of where they were when they spotted the object.

I noticed a glow on the ground near a fence. It was two and a half feet wide and about five feet long. It looked about three inches deep, it was a foggy white with blue crystal looking chips in it. I could see the formation of the ground but not the color of the dirt. I also noticed three other glowing areas about twelve by twelve inch squares spaced in a zig zag formation about three feet apart. They also had the same glowing effect. At first I thought it was the light from the moon or a street light in the front yard but as I looked at it, I realized the moon was covered by the clouds and the light couldn&apos;t reach the rear yard. The light was illuminating from the ground not on it. As I realized that this was an unusual sighting I spoke out loud to my self and said &quot;What the f--- is that?&quot; just after I spoke those words the illuminations disappeared in sequence. First the large rectangle than one by one the square illuminations followed. I thought it heard me. I was spooked. I awoke my children to look out the window and the illuminations had not returned. The next day I checked the area but everything looked undisturbed. Has anyone seen anything like this?", "Tube shaped ObjectI received a telephone call from a man who resides in Victoria, on Vancouver Island, British Columbia. He reports that himself and two other friends saw an object sitting at approx: 100 feet from the ground. The sighting took place right downtown in Victoria, B.C. over the Calwood Hills. (Witnesses description to where the object was seen). He said there is the break water running along Dallas Road, and from here you can look over what is called the Calwood Hills, in the Calwood area which is over a small stretch of water called the Esquimalt Lagoon. The witnesses were out taking a walk right down at the waters edge at sunset and fortunately one of the men had a pair of binoculars with him. One of the fellows looked up and thought he was seeing a very large airplane over the Calwood Hills. The distance between the witnesses and the hills was approx: 3 to 4 miles away. When they all realized what they were seeing was not an airplane they got very excited and went on to explain the shape of the object to me. One witnesses described the object as being tube shaped, or like the fuselage of a large aircraft just sitting stationary in one position. Even though the sun was setting behind the craft, they could see it glowing brightly from the objects side facing the three men. It was slightly tilted at about a 20 degree angle then moved slowly down behind the hills. The men stood watching for approx; 20 minutes more to see if they could catch another glimpse of it. It was about 9:45 p.m. and completely dark at this time when the object came back up and sat just above the trees. Finally they remembered they had the binoculars with them, and started to pass them around so everyone could get a good look at it. After watching it for about another 10 minutes it slowly dropped back down again. Due to having a young child with them at the time, and it was getting cooler they decided to head back home. The fellow I talked with still went on with a few more details about what he had saw. When the object dropped down for the last time, he said it would have been right over a small lake, called Prospect Lake which is spring fed. He also said the lake itself was only a half kilometer across at the most. After thinking about it, he wondered if the object was dropping down to pick up water. The fellow claims that what was witnessed was larger than two of the biggest aircraft he knows of, even with them being so far away. There were no wings visible on the structure. I would like to thanks the folks for the report.

I keep my binoculars on my desk because I like to watch birds and airplanes landing at Tampa International Airport which is just South of my location.

It was black but not dull, but also not shiney.  However, it seemed to reflect some light.  As I watched the object I relized it was not a balloon because it was moving Northward faster than the wind was blowing.  At the same time, I realized I was not able to establish a distance either from the object or the altitude of the object.  While maintaining what appeared to be exactly the same altitude, the object began to rapidly accelarate and in an instant dissapeard beyond my visions ability to maintain contact.

While working, my partner and I heard the engine of a (large)plane decrease rapidly. My partner, (who is located in another area of the site that we both work at), radioed to me regarding the sound of the engine decrease. I responded to him that I did hear the engine decrease and looked up to see the plane. It did not appear to be in any trouble and continued on it&apos;s way south towards the Phoenix metro area. As I turned my sight away from the plane, I noticed a light in the sky south/south west of our location. I watched it for a couple of seconds and my partner radioed to me again regarding the light. I informed him that I was watching the light and that it did not appear to be moving in any direction. We both watched the light and as we did, we noticed the light was changing color from an orange to a red and back and forth. It was at this point that my partner radioed to me that he was going to join me at my location. Upon arrival, we both stood there getting a bearing on it to see if it had moved. It didn&apos;t. We tried to come up with explanations for what we were witnessing and after about 15 minutes of not coming up with anything substatial, another light appeared just to the east and a little higher. Since the lights were miles away, there was no way for us to tell exactly what it was that we were viewing. Two minutes into the sighting of both lights, the first just went out. Some surprise for both of us, to say the least. About a minute later, a third light appeared slightly higher and to the west of the one we were now viewing. Then the second one went out. As we were watching this incredible light show, I asked for my partner&apos;s cell phone to call my wife so that she could maybe see it. I really didn&apos;t think she had a chance considering we live in the heart of Phoenix. She never got to a clear spot in time. The third and final light went out! After a few minutes, my partner turned to me and said &quot;Where are all the planes that were flying around here&quot;? True. Not a plane in the sky. As if they were told to vacate the area. Only a half hour before, we had counted at least 15 aircraft in the vicinity. We watched the skies for an hour after that and never saw another light. The entire incident lasted for 30 minutes.", "While Driving with my family, South on I-35 over Lewisville Lake in Texas -  we observed a shiny disk (55 degrees) on the southern sky.

What was interesting, was that when I observed the object I thought it was a plane moving for a landing in DFW however,  as the objected was decending it stoped and reversed itself then shot off in a opposit diagnal angle. I was apprehensive about telling anyone but I thought maybe this might be of use to you for record keeping purposes. From where I was realtive to where I observed the obeject I suspect it must have been at least as large as a 747. I&apos;m sure I was not the only one observing the object given the size.Regards", "Communication with Lights in WisconsinI&apos;m not going to write my whole life story here but I can assure you that I am a credible witness.  I can further assure you that I am of a sound mind, have never been in trouble with the law, and do not have the imagination to cook up a story like this. I rarely drink alcohol and was not drinking at this time. The only skeptism that there could be about me is that I do have an interest in extra terrestrials ,as I have had many dreams of them recently. THIS WAS NOT ONE OF THOSE DREAMS.  I have not told this experience to anyone and I do not seek any attention or money.I have lived in this small Farm house, surrounded by open fields, for seven years and have lived within a half-mile of this farm my entire life.  I am extremely familiar with this location and what the sky looks like at night.Two days ago, sometime after  11:pm. I went to the bedroom to prepare for bed. all the lights in the home were turned off.  As soon as i entered the room I instantly noticed a VERY BRIGHT pure white ball in the eastern sky outside the window.  i went directly to the window and watched as it seemed to &quot;bounce&quot; and move slightly. I looked up at the stars and looked back at it but it seemed much too bright and much too close to the ground to be a star. I kept watching it and every time I started to think of some sort of an explanation, it would immediately do something that would rule that explanation out.  For instance, I would think it was a star and it would begin to move a little bit more. I would think maybe it&apos;s a plane, and it would bounce directly up, then drop down. I thought maybe an erratic helicopter pilot but then it  dropped down from side to side like paper in the wind. after evrything it did, it would always go back to it&apos;s original position. Grasping for a more broad explanation I thought maybe someone was up in a silo on some nearby  farm with a flashlight  or something. it changed color.  maybe there was some possible reflection from something or some kind of atmospheric phenonmnon. It was really hard to tell how far away it was. I thought to myself  &quot;i&apos;ve been waiting to see a ufo, but you&apos;re gonna have to do better than that!&quot; Before I finished my thought, A GIANT YELLOW BALL appeared INSTANTLY out the window, it was to the right of the first object. It was MUCH CLOSER. It had rays of yellow light emitting from it. the rays waved like fire but were exactly the same tone and color as the object. Sharp lines and triangles. This was the real deal. this was actually happening. I felt excited and amazed as the object glowed and the rays made beautiful patterns in the sky. I am certain that it was putting on a show for me.  I am certain that it knew i was looking at it and I felt them looking at me. I could hardly look away as it was very beautiful and very mesmorizing. I looked briefly at th! e first object which was in exactly the same spot as before, only now the ground underneath it was illuminated like daytime. there was no streaks of light or rays comming down. just the light in the sky and the lit up circle in the field, nothing between them. There were some sounds from the back door of the house but I was unable to pay attention. looking at the second object and realizing that it was looking / communicating with me, I began to get frightened. It started to move like  &quot; S &quot; and when it came around the second turn it came directly at me very very fast. My heart was pounding. I thought &quot;st  st st st st stop!&quot; and before i finished my thought it stopped. i started to tell it that i was scared.  the rays of the object retracted. i said i&apos;m sorry but im not ready for this yet. it turned blue. i may have had another thought, im not sure what but then the object turned deep red for a moment then back to yellow and slowly moved outside the view of the window. i ran to the other window where it should have been but could not see anything.  Looking out the first window I saw the first object was still there. I ran out of the room to peer out other windows but found nothing. I ran back to my bedroom to the first object but it was gone. I looked at the clock but i just can&apos;t remember what time it ended, nor do I recall exactly what time it bagan. I feel like it happened somtime after 11pm. I will say that the object was friendly and pleasant. it was very beautiful and i felt somehow like i had just turned away an old friend. They seemed so kind and they made me feel so special that i really feel guilty after asking it to leave.  Another strange thought is that I kept expecting them to return last night. Even though they didn&apos;t. i really feel like they know who i am,  and will return for another visit. I hope to be more brave next time. I miss them.", "Strange object in Bridgend, Nr CardiffI was staring out of the window and i saw a bright bright object south of my house, a few miles in the distance. It was stationary and at first i thought it was a star, then i realised it was much too big and bright for a star. It was silent. After a few minutes it moved very quickly in the opposite direction to me, still silent, before vanishing after a few more minutes.

The objects leading edge was at about a 15 degree dive the whole 8 seconds that I was able to view the object before it totally disappeared into the tree line.

As we got out of the pool we saw 4 dots that stayed in the same position. By that time all 7 of us began to look and saw 7 dots. We also saw 2 dots revolving around each other and flashing brightly. At that time, as we were looking at the dots, two commercial airliner almost collided! It was very bizzare and all 7 of us agreed that this sighting was something from a different planet.

My estimate is about 2000 to 2500 ft. altitude.It took me a few minutes to figure out how many craft there were. One would make a figure-eight and have a trail of light behind it briefly, while the other craft would do the same but at 90&apos; to it. So that it looked like a four petaled flower, about 2-3 miles from end to end. The two craft would come very close and almost hit each other at the center point. The duration for one cycle was 4-5 sec.ANOTHER two craft doing the same thing about 4-5 miles away over Mt. View.Total of 4 ships making BIG figure eights. As I say each group of two at 90&apos; to each other. The loops or light trails were oriented on North, South, East, West directions.After about 35-40 min. I said out loud &quot;is that all you&apos;ve got&quot;? 5-10 sec. later a red light detached itself and made an erratic path away and down before fading out. A white light did the same a few seconds later. I was getting bored and went inside. As an experiment I turned on my stereo to check for RF interference. Scanned the dial, some intermitant noisy static on 104.5 FM. My AM was not hooked up to the antenna at that time. I got a phone call from a friend. I thought it was to tell about me about the lights, but she hadnt seen them. I told her go outside and look in the sky. A few minutes later she comes back to tell me, it&apos;s &quot;search lights&quot;. They were not search lights, there was NO beam up into the sky and they were moving far too fast. It is hard to credit your senses that you are seeing what you are seeing when looking at ufo&apos;s.About 15 min. later I went back outside and noticed that one of the &quot;flowers&quot;, (two ships) are gone and only the Sunnyvale two remains. Then I heard bam bam bam bam bam bam, six pops. Gunfire from behind me (north), real close. Somebody shooting at them! I thought &quot;thats stupid&quot;, their too high.Just then a ship comes from the area of the gunfire sounds. It was about 100 ft. away from me (east). Moving about 25 mph. It cleared the power lines by 10 ft. So however tall the high tension lines are, add 10 ft. It was dark but I got the impression it  looked like a &quot;top&quot;, (Ya know, the childs toy?) it had a light on the top and the bottom. One was red, one was white. I dont remember which color light was where. Probably the size of a car or truck, not very big. It leisurely made its way south-west towards Wolfe Ave. There are other details of this sighting and later events I&apos;ll leave out.While all this was going on I counted 16-18 aircraft in the sky. Apparently the miltary and whoever else was watching too. Pretty spectacular. But I never heard a word from the TV news or radio or people talking, anywhere. Not even a report on THIS website by anybody. During this time frame, 1988-91 I saw a lot of ufo&apos;s.((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  We believe that conventional aircraft, or perhaps advertising lights of some sort, would be the first possibility to be ruled out during an investigation of the sighting.  Sunnyvale is where Moffett Field is located, which is a major U. S. government research center, so perhaps the event was the result of some type of work or display conducted there.  If this had been a genuine UFO-related event, we suspect that hundreds of reports would have been generated, and the incident would be well known among present-dayUFO investigators.

As we approached the top of plateau, the light took off fast on north course toward Madera.  I sped up to over 90 MPH and the light kept moving away. I began to flash my headlights and beep the horn.The light source went to the horizon.  Normally, at that speed, it should have vanished over the horizon.

The first cluster had four lights on it in a diamond shape as if the lights were at the 12-3-6and9 like a clock would be, moving slowly from southwest to northeast direction. The second cluster had only three lights, moving in the same direction, but the third cluster had four lights all moving together but rotating on an axis, in a counterclockwise fashion. The fourth cluster only had three lights, but it was a little different then the rest, because as it went over the highway it rotated slightly, and it reflected the orange highway lights from below. But it then appeared to have a single light in the middle of the triangle, It looked as if it might have been silver, it was the only one that I could tell that was solid. These crafts were about 500-800feet up.There was no sound at all as these things went over head, because by this time the alarms had stopped.

I thought it was simply a TV helicopter, out filming beauty shots of the traffic for the 6 o&apos;clock news. My clock read 5:49 PM, a bit early for news footage. But then the light did something alarming. It began to drop quickly out of the sky. I blinked to make sure it wasn&apos;t moving towards me and I was just seeing it wrong. But in spite of my doubt, it was doing just what I saw - dropping like a rock. &quot;Damn, that pilot is screwed,&quot; I thought. I believed I was witnessing a helicopter crash, possibly one that was being transmitted live to the area&apos;s televisions. I blinked again. The helicopter couldn&apos;t have lost power, since it wasn&apos;t &quot;autorotating&quot; to the ground. If so, the light would surely be spinning around. The light plummeted as I continued to drive. Then, just as suddenly as it appeared, it vanished, blinking out a few degrees above the horizon. I squinted in that direction but could not find any trace of it. It took me a while to decide that what I saw wasn&apos;t the usual helicopter sighting. No sane pilot would drop a helicopter that fast. And there was no trace of it afterward. Very weird. I actually spent the rest of the trip scanning the horizon for signs of smoke plumes, on the chance I really did see a helicopter crash. Thinking about it again later that night, I decided it could have been a flare. Why someone would shoot a flare into the evening sky is beyond me, as is how it could hover in one place as long as it did before dropping. -- I put the above description in my journal for that date, but didn&apos;t consider reporting this event until today, 26 June.((NUFORC Note:  Witness describes self as having considerable technical experience.

At that point it was when we realized that we were twenty exit ahead than we just were a minute ago.  Checking the speeding ticket wich had the mile marker and exit on it we realized that over three hours had passed since the citation was written.

I really could see a very defined white-silver oval shaped object.

Very big and visible with a tail.", "UFO over Northern Utah/Hill Air Force BaseHad an interesting experience yesterday (06/29/03) between 5:00p -- 6:00p.  We were having a family gathering in our backyard in Roy, Utah and my Son-in-Law pointed out an object in the sky.  It was pretty high, I assume because, with the naked eye, it was about the size of a pencil eraser.  The rest of the family search the sky a spotted the object. Watching it, it looked like it was heading toward the ground, because it looked like it was getting larger.  Then it stopped and hung there for about 5 minutes.  Then the object slowly began moving North-Northeast.  I looked away and my son exclaimed &quot;Hey! it just divided in two.&quot;  So I looked up again and I spotted the two objects.  The second just accelerated really fast and flew off in a South-Southwesterly direction and disappeared behind our trees. We continued watching the first object, then suddenly the second returned with equal velocity flying in the North-Northeasterly direction catching up to the first.  The first still traveling slowly North-Northeasterly. The second object then changed direction and flew off South-Southeasterly at a high rate of speed then disappeared.  I looked back to the first object and watched it for a few more minutes then it, too, disappeared. The objects appeared round or oval, I thought they may have had wings but I cannot be sure.  It was either white or silver-reflecting-sunlight.  The display lasted about a half-hour, 45 minutes. There were three of us watching the whole time, and four other watched for a few minutes", "SPHERICAL UFO sighted 20 METERS away IN BROAD DAYLIGHT for 15 minIt was the beginning of July in 1982, a clear bright summers day in Wembley (London, England) without a trace of cloud in the sky, and my brother and I, aged 10 and 7 respectively, were playing in our bedroom (The front bedroom on the 1st floor of your usual 3-Bed semi) when I noticed a dull metallic sphere hovering above the fir tree of our neighbours across the road (approx 20 meters away). I called my brother over to the window to have a look as I couldn&apos;t believe my eyes; even at that age I could tell it was a UFO immediately. We had a very clear view with no restrictions in the way so my brother was able to confirm what I saw. The object was completely spherical and approx 1m in diameter (without any creases, bumps, folds, depressions or protrusions) and had no lights, emissions, or sounds coming from it, it was completely seamless. It was a non-reflective dull metal colour which remained constant throughout the experience. We watched the object from our bedroom window for approx 15 mins; it was motionless and remained hovering over the fir tree (approx 1m above it) without touching it or anything else for the whole time. We watched it for so long, I guess we were hoping it might move, but it didn&apos;t. We then decided to go out and see it, so we rushed out the bedroom down the stairs and out the front door, which must have taken 5-7 seconds as I remember running as fast as I could. As soon as I opened the door I could see the fir tree and the sphere was gone. To this day its one of the most vivid things I can remember, which can be best described as a &quot;Seamless Non-reflective giant ball bearing 1 meter in diameter&quot; hovering for 15mins. I don&rsquo;t know if anyone else has seen anything similar but I know what I saw and it was definitely a UFO and probably of alien origin???????((NUFORC Note:  Date in July 1982 is approximate.  PD))", "Only saw object for a couple of seconds. White. square, no reflection.A friend and myself were playing tennis at McGavock High School tennis courts this past Sunday, 06/01/2003.  Some golf tournament was going on the same weekend at a nearby park.  There was a large yellow blimp flying over head in the distance, west I think, the sun was behind me.  I always look up in the sky while out there, was a partly cloudy day.  I looked up, saw the blimp, there were some airplanes in the air, as we were relatively close to the airport.  I see alot of planes daily. Anyway, as I was looking up this one instant, I saw a white rectangular object, it appeard to be white, could have been a dull silver, very small, but not to small to tell the shape. It appeard to have cut across the path above the blimp. I only saw it for a second, then it was gone, I kept looking for it, but did not see it or a trail again. I told my friend I was playing tennis with, he did not see it, but he knows me well enough to know I was not lying.  Anyone else in Nashville see this????", "a bright light and no soundIt was Saturday night and very clear and dry. I was out back stargazing with my telescope. I looked up to see a bright light approach out of the south. The object seemed low as if on a approach to land.  As I observed the object I did not hear any sound or see other lights. As it crossed my line of sight it went behind some trees and still appeared like a aircraft on approach. At this point seemed to be ascending off into the northeast.

PD))  Triangular craft followed on foot, and gray at my window. Seperate and presumably unrelated experiencesHello Again. I have decided to contact you about another of my past sightings. I never remember the exact dated, I probably should be writing them down, but at the time of the event I never seem to think about that, only wishing that I had a camcorder or decent camera to capture my experience. It was again in the summer, and later in the evening probably about 11:00 and my brother, and long time friend were outside looking at the night sky. Because the three of us have a history of being in the right place at the right time we often look for ufo&apos;s. Most of the time we go inside without any remarkable events, but sometimes we do see something we can&apos;t explain. Most of the things I&apos;ve seen were just odd lights behaving oddly, and could be anything really. But this one time it was definately a craft of uncommon design. Now weather it was experimental earthbound technology or extraterrestrial I will never know. As I stated in my previous posting that I live in the vacintity of sevral air ports both commertial and military, as well as sevral military bases, and I would assume sevral more that I&apos;m not aware of. So here&apos;s the story.We were outside, when my friend looked up over the treeline and saw a large low altitude low speed triangular object. It had a red light at each corner, and it made absolutely no sound. It seemed to drift, and sort of reminded me of the way one of those toy hovercrafts moves, but with more stability. It was about 100 or 200 feet above the treeline and moved at a rate slow enough that we could walk and keep up with it. No sound or exhaust what so ever. We followed it around the block for about thirty minutes after watching it for about 10 or 15 in our front yard before it moved off in a direction that we did not have street access to follow, and so we watched it as it dissapeared in the distance.Of all the sightings I have had, that was the first where the actual body of the craft was visible. It was very large, about 200 feet acrost, and moved in a slow lazy fascioun, sort of like the occupants had no worries about being seen. As I above stated about the glut of local airports large and small, there was no way in hell that what ever we saw was unnoticed by radar towers, and other people. Being the most up close and personal encounter of such a large and obvious craft in the sky, I am asking anyone reading on this board who is also from Fayetteville NC, or surrounding cities who may have seen a similar object in the summer of 95-98, I&apos;m pretty sure it was within those years but don&apos;t remember exactly when. It was before I got my first computer in late 98, and before playstation took hold in the video gaming community so that should give you a basic esitmate when I saw it. I regret not remembering the exact times and dated when I have these sightings. I know it makes it hard for you guys to make a thourough documentation. As of this night when I have newly found this forum I am going to make better documentation of my sightings. I bought a digital camera for the reason of taking pictures of them. howerver it is a cheap 50$ camera and preforms so poorly in low light conditions I am not going to bother to use it to take pictures of ufo&apos;s, after all since it&apos;s digital there can come the accusation of altering them, and I know some about computer graphics so I could, and since the quality is so poor it could be anything. So to not give myself the reputation of a hoaxer looking for publicity I will not bother to send any pictures. However I could draw pictures, but that&apos;s really no better than my descriptions.I am very very interested in looking up sightings from my area of the US in hopes to find someone describing similar sightings. I know that If I see something, there is a good chance someone else did as well. Something is definately going on. Black book experiments, physical extraterrestrials, or demonic desception are all theories I have come acrost in my personal research, and truthfully there is no data that leans the case in one direction or the other. I have not only seen objects in the sky, but a being at my window. I was in fifth grade when that happened so that would make it around 94 or 95. I saw this triangular craft after the window encounter. The odd thing about that is that It was late in the evening before the sun went down and I had been up all night. I had the blinds pulled up, and a bunk bed that raised me perfectly level with the window. As I went to pull down the shades a thought hit me, and I thought something to the tune of. &quot;Why bother? Leave it up. It&apos;s not like you&apos;re going to actually see anything. and there&apos;s a large bush and tree in front of my window so on one is going to look in on me from the street.&quot; So I was in bed and I had dozed off for a few hours. By the time I woke up it was dark. and I know I wasn&apos;t asleep because I lay there with my eyes open, view of the window blocked my my blankets debating on getting up or going back to sleep. When I finally decided to get up, I saw up and saw it. It was a very odd experience because I only cought a glimps of it for about a second before I threw my head back under my blankets and began praying to every God I could think of to not let something grab me. I had a vertigo almost tunnle vision, where my perriferal vision was blurred, and somewhat blocked, and there was an odd time distortion feeling. I can&apos;t exactly explain it but it seemed like time slowed down in the second I looked at this thing. I later found out from my brother that this which I was describing was known as &quot;the oz factor.&quot; and is quite common. At the time he rea! d more UFO and paranormal books than I did. I wasn&apos;t much of a reader back in those days. What I saw was a pearly white almost luminous though it didn&apos;t appear to be glowing. I could not see the tree of bush behind it, only a inky black void, and it seemed like it and I were all that existed in my sences at the time. I didn&apos;t recieve any telepathic communication, no words in my head. but thinking back on it I didn&apos;t get a hostile feeling from it, only the fear of actually seeing an alien. It had the usual diamond shaped bulbous head, it had no nasil opening, no nose protrustion or mouth. In fact I got the impression that I was looking at some sort of mask because it was very smooth, and almost had a designed look to it. The eyes were a glassy black, but they were not slanted tear drop shaped like you commonly hear described. They were flat on the top and bottom, rounded on the inside edges and wrapped around the sides of the head like sunglasses, or more accurately a dragonfly&apos;s eyes. So I threw my head under my blankets, too scared to move a muscle or make a peep wondering which was worse it being there to take me or there to put me back, and I&apos;m not sure how much time i lay there before I got the courage to take a look to find nothing was amiss. Needless to say I got the hell out of that room pronto, and stayed up all night clutching a butcher knife.I must say that it was that event that sparked a great deal of my curiosity. I had known about UFO&apos;s before and seen strange lights, but never an encounter so up close and personal with something that I could not explain away as a shooting star, or satelight, or unidentified form of uncommon airplane, not exactly one that is top secret but one uncommon enough to not be identified as an airplane. Now I have nightmares, and have had all my life, some of them of UFO themes, but I do not notice any missing time, or have any screen memories or abduction memories, so either I am not an abductee, or I don&apos;t remember the events. I would like the first of the two to be true. I know this is a rather lingthy post describing the two most undeniable encounters I have had with unknown beings. I have not seen any odd lights since at least 2000, and I have never before or since seen an actual alien being. I do have a 3d rendering of what I saw, which I don&apos;t even like to look at because of how well I reproduced what I remember seeing. It still scares me to this day.Someone please tell me where I can locate others who are sincere about their experiences where I can relate and recieve stories and compaire and contrast. Something is going on, and it&apos;s only a matter of time before we find out what it is.", "Orbital Sighting Not Satellite or MeteorWas waiting for the International Space Station Pass to start at 22:05.  Just after the ISS was to hit 10 deg alt, a steady light (sun reflected) passed from NW to E at a high rate of speed.  The light moved faster than an unpowered satellite and was not a meteor.  There was a thin overcast of clouds but the craft still reflected at about 2 magnitude with only a couple of stars showing.  The ISS followed on time and looked normal.((NUFORC Note:  One of two sighting reports from same source.

Then it got slower and slower, almost a complete stop, that&apos;s when I opened my window to see if I could hear any sound and I couldn&apos;t. Then it flashed a big bright white, yellowish light and made a sharp left turn and moved faster towards the North, the light fading as it moved. I lost sight of it over the high buildings in the downtown area. Do you know of any aircraft that has this kind of lighting and can move like that? I would appreciate any information that you might have.Thanks  &quot;Addition Information&quot;  I should tell you that I first spotted it when I was in a taxi cab on my way home from work.  I just glance up and saw this blue light and before I could take a better look we took a turn and It was above us so the roof of the cab blocked the view. It was just above Granville bridge as high as a small plane that&apos;s why I took it to be a plane and didn&apos;t think about again until I came home and saw it again through my window and it was moving from the west going towards the east. 2. I remember really taking a good look at this light moving and trying to make out any shape against the dark sky and thought that I did see something besides this light like a shape but couldn&apos;t make it out and it also seemed to have a very tiny faint light in front of the blue light but I&apos;m not sure about that  I would say I watched it for about 7 seconds before it turned bright and turned, then another 5 seconds watching it fade and move towards the North. 3. Yes I would say pea size when blue but it expanded when it flashed bright and at that time it would be dime size and then back to pea size when it move away. 4. Altitude would be the same as a small plane. The same altitude of the planes when the Symphony of fireworks are here. Ten thousand feet?  5.  No one else was with me in my apartment at the time and when I was in the cab I didn&apos;t ask the cab driver to look because he was driving and I thought it was a plane. Surely someone else in the downtown area saw it too. People on their balconies facing it would see it but would they say report it? I don&apos;t know.

I was standing on the trail, waiting for my husband.  Looking to the southeast, I saw what appeared to be an oval object, placed at an angle, and appearing to leave a short trail behind it.  However, it was not moving at all.  It is possible that there was no trail, but rather that the object was larger than I thought at first.  The object was an odd color - sort of a dirty brown.  It occurred to me that it could be reflecting the landscape below it.  I watched the object for nearly a minute, and it seemed odd to me that it was not moving.  But I had the impression it was fairly distant.  I glanced away only for an instant, and when I looked back, it was gone - no trail, nothing.  I told my husband about it while I was watching it, but by the time he turned around to look it had gone.This was the second strange sighting for me in three days.  And I have never reported a UFO sighting in my life.  Possibly because the objects had certain similarities, yet were sighted in two quite far-flung spots in California, I felt compelled to report them.  Both objects were sighted in daylight, hung over mountain ridges, and seemed to be reflective.  I would be very interested in whether anyone has reported similar objects during this timeframe.", "Brilliant red-orange light that could maneuver unlike any human aircraft...Me and six other acquaintances met at a friend&apos;s house to shoot fireworks, as this friend had missed the 4th of July. We were behind this friend&apos;s house (on the outskirts of town) in a large open field with a mostly clear night (no clouds visible until 11:00pm or so). Around 9:00pm EST (when it began to get dark) we began firing off things with bright and beautiful explosions, such as artillery shells. At approximately 9:30pm we stopped shooting fireworks for a few moments when we noticed a bright red-orange light moving at about a jet&apos;s pace across the skyline. We thought it looked sort of odd, but shrugged it off and went back to shooting fireworks. After a few more minutes, say 9:40pm, we looked back up and noticed that the craft was moving back in the opposite direction. We decided to watch it for a few moments to try and determine what the strange light was. After staring up at the sky for a while, we noticed the craft suddenly slant itself (to where it was oriented diagonally instead of horizontally, or I assume so -- it was difficult to make out anything but the actual light itself, which seemed to cover the majority of the craft, if not all of it). After this change in orientation, it suddenly turned around and headed back towards its first direction without actually turning around or losing speed. It was just going one direction fairly quickly and suddenly decided to go the other way. About this time we also noticed that there was no smoke or contrails behind the craft, as well as no noise. The sky at this time was still perfectly clear. After the craft went back and forth (between North and East) 2-3 times, we lost interest again and went back to shooting fireworks. We continued to see the craft while shooting fireworks, and eventually my friend&apos;s little brother came up to look at the red-orange light as well, dismissing it as an airplane. How many of our aircrafts are composed of just one giant red-orange light, though?  By 10:30pm we all had made the realization that the UFO was not just moving back and forth on one side, but was actually circling our field. It was always within 1.0miles away, but never came much closer than approximately 0.5 miles. The light object would not just go in a complete circle around our field, though. Mostly I saw it move from (1) N to E to N and then under a high treeline continuing N-to-NW, (2) NW to W to NW and back under the treeline, (3) and W to SE and back. Maybe around 10:50pm (at which point we were still shooting fireworks), we noticed the craft was staying in one position to our South, perhaps 0.75 miles away. We stopped shooting fireworks yet again so we could see what the light was doing. When we stopped shooting fireworks, the craft appeared to begin moving straight toward us rather slowly (the light was growing larger, and no trees were below it to determine its exact distance). Perhaps after reaching 0.5 miles from our spot, it stopped for a brief moment and then began heading West again. By the time the strange light was back to our West, I noticed an aircraft (most likely a passenger plane), SW of us which was moving West. It did not appear to be pursuing the light or to be near the UFO&apos;s actual path (the plane was much further away from us than the light). One of the witnesses to the event began shooting bottle rockets in the direction of the light around this time, which seemed to make the light linger in that one area a little longer (West of us, close to the start of the NW side of the treeline). We yelled at the guy to stop firing bottle rockets at the UFO, which he did. After he stopped, the light continued toward the treeline. The light went back under the N/NW treeline. It appeared again above the treeline, at which point a second ship came up from below the treeline to &quot;meet&quot; with it. The two ships moved somewhat close together (perhaps 10-15 yards from each other) and remained there one or two minutes (moving around some, but staying in that one area), and then both of them moved their seperate ways and quickly went under the cover of the treeline again. A moment later one of the UFO&apos;s came back out from the trees and moved W to SW and back perhaps two times, and then went behind the treeline again. This was the last sign of the ship that we saw, and was around 11:05pm or 11:10pm. Oddly enough, it went away only a few moments after we ran out of fireworks. Heh, perhaps it was watching the show... By 11:15pm we were cleaning up the little mess we had made in the field (firework debris and containers). Around 11:20pm we began heading from the field to our friend&apos;s house (where all of our cars were parked), and had left his house by 11:45pm. One thing I forgot to mention was that there were several times during the UFO&apos;s flight that it would seem to orient itself diagonally and continue on its apparently set course with no noticeable change in speed. This, and its ability to suddenly go in opposite directions without turning around or changing speed, made me believe that the craft was nothing made by man. The UFO appeared to just be composed of that one giant red-orange light, which seemed somewhat solid. However, the light did seem to slowly pulsate a lot of the time. I&apos;d like to say again that there was absolutely no noise, smoke, etc. to accompany the light. There were no wings or propellors, and I could only make out some sort of round-ish shape (perhaps an ellipse, maybe disc-like). We attempted to record the light with a camcorder, but the girl who recorded it said she hadn&apos;t looked at the tape (as of July 13, 2003), and I doubt that it picked the object up anyway (camcorders aren&apos;t the greatest). If it did, however, show up I will submit the video and some stills from the video to try and give a better image of the object. I would roughly estimate that the length of the ship is around thirty feet. I did look for some similar sightings on Google after I came home, and found some ships that look like what we witnessed...http://www.iwasabducted.com/UFOPictures/ufo9.jpg http://www.iwasabducted.com/raulgarza/anniversary041499b.htm http://www.abduct.com/contact/_contpix/c21.jpg  Also, NUFORC: If you would like to contact me, you can email me at the address I submitted.

I donno, probably lens flair of unknown mechanism.If you KNOW, and can prove it with similar flair/reflection images taken under &apos;grey&apos; conditions please email me so I can take this thing off my web site!  http://www.polyradial.com/Lensflairorufo.htm", "Daylight disc , Jeffco Colorado , 2001In the fall of 2001 , my elderly father and I were attending a high-school football playoff game on a bright late-fall Sunday afternoon at the beautiful North Jeffco stadium , nestled right against the foothills of the Colorado front range . At one point , a jet roared overhead , and many spectators immediately looked up ( a not-unusual reaction immediately following the 9/11 debacle ! ) and saw a 757 heading west at about 5000 ft. altitude . Everyone looked back down to the action on the field...and my father goes &quot; What the hell is THAT ? &quot; . I looked back up , and on a south to north heading , at a hieght of no more than a thousand or so feet , a small , oval or egg shaped , brightly reflecting silver object was zipping at a good clip , disappearing to the north in a matter of less than half a minute . My Dad was in WWII , well versed in estimating distance , speed , and aircraft identification , and I have been an aircraft watcher and fan for over 35 years.......and niether of us have ever seen anything to compare with the high speed or odd shape of this problematical object .((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  PD))", "approxametly 6 lights(orange/red) were flying high in the clear night sky, first in an ordered structure and than they breaked into a fary dance flight, and back to a flying structure, and so for app. 15 sec after they disapeared.the speed and the manovering abilities were imposible for an airplane or birds.", "This is an UFO to me, I am just curious if it is to others as well.Returning to the Oklahoma Panhandle State University campus after visiting a friend in an Amarillo, Texas hospital after a pit stop at a gas station in Stratford I saw in a distance an object made up of three visible lights. In the shape of a triangle.  It moved fast and smooth in flight.  It was less than a mile up in the air.  I was mesmerized, but I tell you that this object was an UFO to me.  It moved slow enough that I feel that government/airport tracking officials could ID it.  But it was low enough in the air that I wouldn&apos;t think that radar could confirm it&apos;s existence.  I went out to a creek crossing about 7 or so miles north of Goodwell, Oklahoma two times within a month timeframe and in a distance I feel that I saw the same formation gliding along the same path.  Of course, the sighting was not so closeup.", "Strange red glow in the skySon was comming in from work and saw about 5 airplanes in sky. Called me out of the house to see. As we looked toward the horizon we saw a bright red object, not moving it was    glowing and the planes were comming from every which way. North, south, east, west. They were all flying toward the bright red light. We heard helicopters far away. My son ran into the house to get his camera, I ran in also to wake my husband, it took all of 30 seconds to do this. When we came out it was gone and we could see search lights in the sky.", "I am compelled to relay this recent experience of mine to anyone that may usefully document it.  Keep in mind it&apos;s an account written by the biggest paranormal/UFO skeptic going but my partner of 7 years and I DEFINATELY witnessed something unusual on a recent unwind trip in Mexico this past week.  We are both two very sane, sober professional Minnesota guys in our thirties and were hardly in search of anything more exciting than some R and R by the pool when we landed in Cancun this past Monday.  After quickly being shuttled to our resort just south of Cancun we settled in our room and indulged in the food accomadations but skipped the complimentary Tacates because after a 4 hour trip all we wanted was to shower and inspect the fantastic playground and beach.  We were already relaxed and by this time it was dark.  Neither of us were tired though, flying from Minneapolis we had the luxury of being in the same time zone and I can assure you NOTHING clouded our vision that night.  We sat togther on two empty lounge chairs on the beach no more than a few feet from the grounds of the resort and discussed our options for our all inclusive packaged week.  We had never been to Cancun and it was exciting.  Above us was a spectacular sky, there were a few clouds and it was a little windy but altogther quite clear.  My partner had pointed out a few constellations I had never seen before having never been that far south in my life and no later than a few seconds after he started talking about the sky then TWO BRIGHT WHITE STARS from opposite sides of the beach MOVED toward each other.  SHOOTING STAR/S????????????!!!!We were intantly stunned and silent as they slowly moved toward each other, they then sort of stopped and &quot;kissed&quot;, moved slowly apart then across the sky again, sometimes in perfect unison and at other times at different speeds and zig zag patterns.  I can say that neither of them circled in any way or ever appeared to come close to the ground.  They moved in straight lines, stopped an! d then changed pace and pattern over and over.  We were actually laughing in amazement, scouring the dark beach for other witnesses to this event but the only sound was the faint chatter of the full restaurants in the backround. It was a real &quot;What the hell is happening&quot; moment and the more excited and vocal we got in our astonishement the more faster and elaborate the patterns got, almost as if these things knew there was an audience!  It lasted no more than a few minutes, they just lost their brigtness and faded abruptly.  We couldn&apos;t take our eyes from the sky but they didn&apos;t return that night and we didn&apos;t check again on any other night although we talked about it often as we enjoyed the rest of our vacation just freaked that it had occured.  Nothing like that had happened to either of us before in our lives.  It changes you a bit.  We didn&apos;t feel threatened by these things, and nobody in the world could ever discount that moment for us although I&apos;m very open for an explanation for this because from our hotel patio during the day I COULD see large, noisy commercial flights taking off in that vacinity from the local airport.  These were not planes and I have seen amusement park/Vegas style light effects in the sky before and I know that these things definately could not be produced in that way.  In fact it was much more than just seeing these thing that we experienced that night, we both had an overwhelming sense of being &quot;performed&quot; to as if something was communicating and although it wasn&apos;t clear what that was it wasn&apos;t beligerent in any way and maybe enhanced our trip altogether.  I was ready to ditch this memory this wind down weekend back home until I searched &quot;Cancun&quot; and &quot;UFO&apos; on the internet out of curiosity and again found my self astounded by a few eerily and almost IDENTICAL experiences to ours in the very same area involving &quot;dancing stars&quot;.  For this reason I add our account for whatever it may be worth, remaining as true and accurate to it as I can possibly be.", "I saw a saucer shaped craft that defied aerodynamiccs as we know it.My wife,daughter,niece and myself were at the twin drive in theaters in Stockton,Ca.in 1977 to see the remake of the movie &quot;King Kong&quot;.I had seen the original made in the 30&apos;s and was looking forward to seeing this one with all its special effects.The screen we would see the movie on was facing west.Dusk approached and the theater started its advertising.Get your fresh popcorn,drinks,etc..At that time I was working at the Stockton Airport,employed by San Joaquin County.As a kid I had always loved airplanes and it was a treat to work at a place where you could talk to pilots and people interested in aviation.Some people never look up at the sky but for some reason if I&apos;m outdoors I&apos;m always scanning.I saw a craft coming from the west heading southeast.At first I thought it was just a small airplane.I noticed some lights but they were not compatible with any aircraft I had seen.My interest turned from the movie I really wanted to see to something in the sky.At some point I mentioned it to my wife,daughter,and niece.They were somewhat absorbed in the movie which is logical.We didn&apos;t come there to watch the night sky.I became totally involved watching this craft which skirted the drive in and seemed to be heading over downtown Stockton,Ca.I remember saying &quot;I bet the guys in the tower (Airport) are looking at this thing&quot;.They didn&apos;t have radar back then but it wasn&apos;t a busy airport.They had lots of time to observe visually and check out things with binoculars.I kept watching from my car while the movie proceeded.This craft after awhile seemed to be coming back our way.I got out of the car when I realized it was coming directly over us.I was scared because at some point during this event I knew what I was seeing was something I had not seen before.A totally silent craft,extremely slow moving,with confusing lights.I watched it come directly over us,maybe 200 feet or less.This was not some streak of light or a blur you might have problems seeing.It passed right over our heads.A saucer shaped craft.Maybe 50 feet in diameter.It seemed to consist of two sections or if not rotating lights that flashed at it revolved gave that impression.They were bright white that went alternately off and on as the craft revolved.I just stood there in awe as it passed silently overhead.My wife and the kids witnessed it also...I thought the next day the local paper would have some unusual headlines.Not a word.Not a word from any news source.No one at the airport tower mentioned it.No on at the drive in got out of their car as I did...What did we see? A US top secret aircraft flying over downtown Stockton.This was not the Nevada desert.Whoever controlled this craft cared not who saw it...Which brings up the most perplexing question to me.Did anyone else see it at all? And how could they not?..I am 60 yearw old now.I have a family and grandkids.I am retired from the Army National Guard.My word is my bond.I would neve lie about anything like this nor would my family.I have no reason to.I have told this stories to numerous friends.My real fiends believe me.Others scoff and roll their eyes.My nature is not to jump on any bandwagon.I am very skeptical about any eye witness report.Ten people can describe an object ten different ways.Nuts and kooks abound.I saw what I saw.My family saw it.It proves nothing.That is my story.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
