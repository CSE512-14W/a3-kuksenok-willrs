["spheroid, leading edge shimmering red, main body whitish yellow, low altitudeAbout the same time what had caused me to look up in the sky was a loud roar of a jet - clearly military by the sound of it.  The jet was going east to west and this sphere was low going west to east.  It didn&apos;t look like any weather balloon, no odd shapes dangling, or geometry.  It wasn&apos;t at all high up.  Hard to tell size, but I would say about 20 feet in diameter. It wasn&apos;t translucent, didn&apos;t change shape, or seem to bounce at all, but had a definite direction heading towards Lakewood, CO.  As it reached the front range, it looked like it turned back to the west, and I watched it slowly getting larger again until it was blocked by trees.  This is the second time I have seen something like this in the same approximate location and duration. - The previous event was in 2004.", "V-shaped, no sound, no light , Gliding slowlyFirst of all, I dont believe in UFO&apos;s , and secondly, I dont even know about this website until I searched for answers or even a hint if anyone else had seen the flying object last April 7, 2008 at around 9:30 PM here in the Bay area. Anyways, wether you publish this or not, I&apos;m just gonna try and tell my story just to let the others who saw the same thing,know that what they saw was not a figment of their imagination!!! Neither was mine. I went out of my house to fix my solar lights which I just bought from Home Depot that morning, andlike every other evening, I would glance at the stars and watch the constellation. I looked up towards the Big Dipper and I saw this huge V-shaped object, almost like a wing with black and green color. It wasnt brightly lighted but theres some glowing green light along the edge. I thought it was a glider but it was late at night and the object was so huge and was gliding so low that I can see it vividly. I thought it was a Stealth bomber but military planes dont fly as low as 30-50 feet from the neighborhood&apos;s rooftop, it would be dangerous and illegal.The lowest Stealth bomber I saw was in Pasadena during the Rose Parade, and it created a sound 20 minutes after it passes you.This one was just very quiet. I watched it for almost 8 minutes until my roof covered the view. It has no sound,  was gliding very slow towards the NorthEast.I dont want it to be a UFO, but what else can it be? Theres no airport in my area nor an airforce base. I am a Registered Nurse. My brother is a pilot. I asked him if he had seen a plane like this that flies so low before and he has not. So there. I told my story. Wether you believe it or not, its not my problem!", "On Dec. 12, 2007, at just before 5:00pm, I saw three bright lights over the Susquehanna River.  I was just south of Wrightsville at Long Level in York County, facing north.  At first I thought it was a low flying airplane.  The three lights became only two then became three again then went out.Over a period of about 15-18 minutes I watched as lights emanated from that spot, I&rsquo;ll call point &ldquo;A&rdquo;, and two other spots, one to my west, I&rsquo;ll call point &ldquo;B&rdquo;, and a third location just north of the first sighting, point &quot;C.&quot;  The three points looked to be on the same plane.The lights did not waver in position.  The lights were bright white.  They came on in a series, in a straight line as if from a large flashlight being turned on.  In other words they did not fade in and out but came on suddenly and brightly.  The line of lights emanating from point A, as they came on, seemed to radiate toward the SW.  When they went out they just blinked out one at a time.  It was not a quick flash like warning lights on a tower, they did not strobe or flash but appeared in a slower &ldquo;on&rdquo;, &ldquo;on&rdquo;, &ldquo;on&rdquo; pattern, in a straight line.  When the last in that series was lit, the lights then went &ldquo;off&rdquo;, &ldquo;off&rdquo;, &ldquo;off&rdquo;, starting with the one that had first come on.Occasionally I saw one or two lights at point B.  No two of the location series lighted at the same time.The lights that appeared over the river (points A and possibly, C) increased in the number of lights each time a series would light up starting with the initial 3 lights then 4, then 6, then 8-10 and as many as 12 or more.  I couldn&rsquo;t count fast enough.The series of lights from point C began after several series from A and B had taken place.  The first series from point C included 6-8 lights in a sequence whereas point A started with 3, those emanating from C appeared to be roughly radiating towards NE.   The longest series I saw looked as if it could have had 12 or more lights.I saw approximately 4-5 series at point A, 3-4 at point B and 3-4 at point C.The weather was clear, few or no clouds, no sounds heard, no airplanes seen at that time.On 12/13/07 I e-mailed our local weather station (WGAL TV) to see if anyone else had seen sightings like this.  Their answer was negative.Later I spoke with a person who saw on Dec. 12, the three low lights becoming two then three again.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I could see the shape shitfting smoothly like the tail of a jellyfish or a flock of birds. But the distance between the dots never shifted or broke pattern. There was total silence and steady movement. I could see the spaces between the dots clearly and as it got further away the dots got smaller. But the whole time it was totally silent and it was dark out but I could see each of the dots clearly. What caught my attention was the amount of dots and the flowing movement the group of dots made. It was not sharp movements but smooth flowing, rotating movetments.", "cigar shaped object reflecting for cloudsOn March 6, 2008, in Gig Harbor, WA, a local theater was due to open the next day.  The evening of the 6th, as a promotion the theater had numerous search lights (I would say five to seven) scanning the skies to attract attention of the event.  The weather that evening was probably 1000 foot layer of broken to overcast clouds. Earlier that evening my girlfriend and I were watching the searchlights scan the clouds and watched the lights dance through the clouds for several minutes, as they lit the undercast.  Later that evening, about 9:45pm we once again went outside before going to bed.  I looked up at the searchlights still scanning the skies, when I noticed as the lights crossed a certain point in the clouds, there was a bright reflection coming from within the clouds.  The reflection was not like anything I had seen before, a very distinct long narrow reflection.  It remained in the same place, not moving with the clouds, changing shape or intensity as the lights randomly past the same place.  I have been a commercial airline pilot for over 20 years and know the effects lights or lighting can have on the clouds.  This was NOT light reflecting of different layers or shear lines of the overcast.  We watched the object for about 15 minutes, until the searchlights were extinguished for the night.  The object appeared to be in the cloud deck itself, and we were only able to see the light refracting off the object.  It would not have been balloons or other promotional material such as a banner, sign, etc for the theater as it would have been tethered almost on the centerline of the Tacoma Industrial Airport (TIW) and in the decent path, less than 1 mile for the runway.  That would have caused serious FAA fines to pull such a stunt.At several times, as the lights passed the object there appeared to be two reflections. I would be hard to estimate the size, due to it being in the clouds, but I would guestimate due to the height of the cloud deck I would say 30 to 40 feet in length, and 10 feet in width. There was no lights on the object.", "Triangular craft slow and low over Dallas.I swear this to be fact.The hair on the back of my neck stands as a preminition washed over me. I stand from this computer and desk, then walk to my home office door. I open the door, step out into the cold night.  I look up, and oh my God... maybe 300 ft DIRECTLY above my head is a triangular craft.I have such anxiety as I write this. The craft was maybe 150&apos; wide along edge. It clearly traveled forward along one point of the triangle.  All edges were rounded and smooth. NO SOUND.  The bottom of the craft was clearly visable to me.  It had 3 large domes at the corners of the triangle that were glowing a steady amber light.  In the center of the craft was a larger dome that had antenas and other fixtures, that extended down from it.  The longest, and most centered of the extentions had a smooth pulsing red strobe.  The craft had no distinct color other than a metalic dark grey.It moved at about 15 to 20 mph, slow and steady in a SouthWest direction.  The craft seemed to be surveling and mapping, this is just a hunch.  I live in flight paths of two major airports, DFW and Dallas Love Field.  I could not help but notice that there were NO airplanes in the air.The nite was clear and crisp with N/W wind gusts.  I had an unobstructed view of the whole event for approximatly one minute and a half.  For the first 15 to 20 seconds, I was struck dumb with awe not even blinking.  Take a picture I quickly thought.  As I rushed in my office, completely confused as to the logical whereabouts of my family camera, I rumaged through my shelves and grabbed a pair of binoculars.  I stood on my diving board, and at 17x mag. I watched it float off over distant house and treetops toward downtown Dallas.For the record, I am not crazy, although this event has tested every limit of my logical capacity.  I sat in true shock, shivering on my couch wearing my bathrobe trying to calm down for the first 15 minutes after.  I dont understand why I was allowed to witness it or them.  I did not roboticaly move on command or anything like that, however I was asked or encouraged to see.  I just dont know how else to explain that part of the experience.", "Saucer UFO at Mt. Washington Auto Road in New Hampshire June 20, 2007This is a photo of a UFO I took at Mt. Washington in June while standing at the western edge of the parking lot at the visitor&apos;s center where the &quot;Mt. Washington Auto Road&quot; to the top of the mountain begins. I was taking pictures of the mountains to the west of where I was standing when I noticed this distant object flying around erratically and I attempted to get a couple of shots of it.After I took the photos I completely forgot about them because at the time I didn&apos;t have any thought of a UFO on my mind. It was too distant and it appeared to be something like a bouquet of mylar balloons getting blown in the wind in a sort of counter-clockwise rolling motion. I didn&apos;t load or look at any of my vacation photos in my notebook PC until returned to our camp trailer in Maine again in early August. When I got to look at the one that contains the object, I suddenly remembered why I took the shot and zoomed in on it to see if I could make out what the object was I had seen.When I looked at the second photo, which was taken 3 seconds later, there was no object that appears anywhere in the frame.I was using a Canon PowerShot A540, without the zoom on, and was holding it at about a foot in front of my face. I have no idea where the object went after the first shot was taken.I would say that the ridge in the foreground, just below the object, was about 2/5 of a mile away from where I was standing and that the object was much further away than I had intitially thought, possibly a mile from where I was. I would put it&apos;s size at about 35-50 feet in diameter. I also noticed when I zoom in on the object in the photo, there appears to be some sort of vertical rod on the top of it. Others I&apos;ve shown the photo to, have noticed the same thing.The whole time frame of my sighting lasted about ten seconds from when I first spotted it, took the two photos, and was no longer able to see it anywhere.My son and his girlfriend where in the same parking lot, but where about 100 feet from where I was. The sighting didn&apos;t excite me and I didn&apos;t even mention it to them. As I said, it was distant and it never struck me at the time as possibly being a UFO.Who would have thought they&apos;d ever be presented with the opportunity to get a shot of one in their lifetime? At the time, I just took the photos as a curiosity.((NUFORC Note:  We believe it&apos;s a bird, with wings upraised.

PD))", "12:15 AM March 6, 2008  I was driving back home from my brother&rsquo;s apartment in Alexandria, VA right around midnight when I saw this object. I was driving west on the Fairfax County Parkway into Springfield where my parents live when I noticed an unusually bright air plane about 35 degrees from the horizon in the west/north-west region of the sky. Living in Springfield I am located between two major airports; Washington International, and Dulles.  Seeing many air planes in the Northern Virginia sky is extremely common, air traffic is quite busy in this area. However, at night air planes have a distinct brightness and have flashing lights on the wings to identify commercial air craft, and are not hard to determine. The craft I saw was about four to five times brighter than the other air planes in the sky and had a golden white light emitting from all sides. I did not see any blinking lights that resembled the lights on regular air planes. There were commercial airplanes flying in other parts of the sky during the sighting so I could tell that this craft appeared quite different. Continuing my route home, I noticed that I was getting much closer to the object. It appeared to have been flying close to the Fairfax County Parkway. I also remember that I couldn&rsquo;t take my eyes off it, it seemed too bright and was moving way to slow and just seemed out of place. It was approximately 5 minutes after initially spotting it that I got close enough to it that I could see that it was not a helicopter. It was also silent; I couldn&rsquo;t hear any engine sounds of any kind. It seemed to have been flying over the neighborhood near Hunt Valley elementary school before I saw it slowly cross over the Fairfax County Parkway. I drove right underneath the craft as it crossed over the road right by the Sunoco gas station located on the Gambrill road exit ramp. When I was approaching the craft just before driving directly underneath it I could tell that this object was about 250-300 feet off the ground and was moving at maybe 50-100 mph. I remember stretching my neck out of my window to get a closer look at it when it silently floated across the parkway, and over the neighborhood on the other side. While looking at the craft from underneath, it looked like a diamond shape but with an elongated front point. I could not see any wings, granted it was dark out, but I was able to see that the whole craft had a white-ish yellow glow with two yellow point lights close together that did not blink on the underside. I would estimate from the distance it looked in the air, that the size of this object was anywhere between 70 to 90 feet long and about 20 feet wide. After it crossed over the parkway, I kept turning my head back and saw it fly barely over the tree line bordering that neighborhood. I tried to keep my eye on it as I was just about home. When I turned off the parkway onto the Hooes road exit I could still see it barely above the trees, and still so bright. I lost sight of it as I turned into my neighborhood across the bridge from the fire station. I would say that I lost sight of it as it was somewhere above the Newington Forest area. This object seemed to be flying too low and too slow to be passenger airliner or single passenger plane.", "Bright white-blue light in the sky, the light moved, no sound, no other light.  Object changed color, speed, and course quickly.I was leaving my front porch for a walk this morning, it was dark, and I noticed a bright light behind me. This light was not usual for the time of morning.  At first I thought it was the moon because of the purity of the light, but the moon is not in the west at 5 in the morning. I turned and saw what looked like an extremely bright star; however, this star was moving from the southwest at a steady pace no faster than a jet-plane. I watched the object move overhead and checked for running lights, flashing lights, and sounds. There were no colored lights besides the white-blue light, and no sound at any time.  When the object passed over me it light seemed to rotate from front to back and spin. As it spun it became brighter and cleaner to me.  Following the moving light, the object changed course.  It also changed from the white color to an orangish-pink color.  I realized what the object was once it passed over head, having seen one many years ago.  The shape, however, was different. The tear-shape was not exaggerated.  There was only one (I searched for others).  As far as my background, I and my father have had previous contact with a craft like this.  My father (who died last winter) has notes on his experiences on the Ore. Calif. border in the seventies, and my own occured near the same region. The same kind of light moved very fast from Mt. Shasta. I have also seen one being chased by Military aircraft while on a hunting trip.  Do people who see UFOs often have more than one experience?  My father claimed he had a stand off with the light and took it very serious that is why I&apos;m reporting this to you now.", "Bright colored sphere shape in the Western skyWhile smoking a cigarette on my patio facing west towards the ocean I glanced into the night sky and happened to notice, it was very clear visibilty and as I looked over the horizon I saw what appeared to be a flashing star, it changed color from bright reds to blues in a spectrum. I thought that maybe it was a plane but it didn&apos;t move but stayed floating in the sky positioned in the same spot. It appeared to be several hundreds of feet away after making my assumptions as what it was I then ran in my home and alerted my wife to view what I had saw. She returned outside with me and was amazed! She then ran inside to awake my daughter who returned with her to witness this object. I had grabbed my camera in the midst of all that had gone on and used my 75X300 lens to capture the object and I have pictures.I also used my video camera and captured it as well.

Diagonal, but in plain view from my porch, is an orchard. Its one of those random things where houses were just built around. We were eating popcicles looking over there and all the sudden I was overcome with emotion as I saw a glowing white, tripod like figure raise out of the orchard. I knew my friend was looking at it to because she was silent. If you have seen Zenon, the Disney movie, the &quot;aliens&quot; in that movie is what resembled what we saw. The only difference was it was brighter and a little smaller. It proceeded to rise about 12 feet and hover for 3 or 4 seconds. It than began to spin rapidly, turn in to a ball/disk thing and stop. It was so surreal and strange because it looked like those fake ones in movies. A circle with blinking red and blue lights on the side. It kept changing color for about 7 or 8 seconds, shot down a yellow beam of light, sucked it back up, than zoomed across my neighborhood and out of sight.

It looked exactly like a giant manta ray with a short tail. The Object was almost the color of the sky like it was supposed to be camouflaged but lighting from the ground made it possible to be seen, it completely blocked out the stars that would have been visible had it not been there and it&apos;s shape was determined by the outermost edges of the craft.

Whilst we were there a large almost circular object was in the sky from when we arrived at 8 in the morning until 5 in the evening on around four different days, three consecutive and one the day after a one day gap.When I saw the object for the first time I mistook it for the moon, but I soon realized I was  wrong as the moon was in the sky at the same time as the object. I also checked if it was the sun but it wasn&apos;t. The object was almost a full circle but there seemed to be a small chunk missing from its bottom. The object looked to be about half the size of the moon which was visible at the time and was slightly bluer/grayer than the moon itself. As i have said earlier, for the first three days of the holiday the object was visible to the south but did not appear the next day and was visible the day after that to the east, but was considerable paler than before and blended in with the sky much more easily. As we were staying at a very busy ski resort many people from outside our school witnessed this too and an American man showed us a photo of the object which he had taken on his digital camera which when zoomed in looked as though there were hundreds of brightly lit windows on it.Eventually, towards the end of the holiday the object was no longer visible, but my friends and I have many photos of it. One friend of mine has a zoomed in movie of the object in which the object seems to revolve very slowly. Another video taken, in the evening shows there to be about 4-6 small illuminated dots circling the object at what looks to be high speed.A video I have taken, this time not with the object in the frame shows three car sized disks slowly moving over trees in a circular fashion, (they were moving in a circular formation and circling like a carousel). As these disks were flying only a few feet over the trees I managed to estimate they were about the size of a large car (20x20 feet). These disks are very clear and seemed to be slightly reflective. Also gray/black lines are visible on the beneath of the disks. While I was filming I did not notice these disks even though they appear to be flying slowly at around 40mph and were within about 200 feet of me at the time and first noticed them while I played them back on the computer. I assure you that these are not aircraft or light specs because you cannot hear the object on the video and there is a reasonable amount of detail on the disks as my camera is 10mp. Also, I don&apos;t know If this has anything to do with the disks or not but on the day I filmed this, everyone I knew , including myself who had taken a camera or mobile phone with them skiing that day had problems with them. For example, my camera wouldn&apos;t always tern on or off when I wanted it too and sometimes the zoom had a mind of its own.If you could advise me what to do with these videos I would be very grateful.((NUFORC Note:  We have written the source, inquiring whether the report is a hoax.

This time I am 100% sure of what I saw.  Once I arrived home I looked out into the night sky and saw a flickering light up in the sky.  Defintely not an airplane, because it remained still. It was changing colors, emitting an amber glow.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))", "Investigation was conducted by: David I.

PD))This investigation was conducted with the cooperation and permission of Mr. Peter Davenport, director of the National UFO Reporting Center in Davenport, Washington who took the original report of the witness through his NUFORC reporting system.The original report is as follows minus witness personal  information:  Date: 01/20/08 Time:05:58 am Duration: 7 minutes Sighting City: East Dublin Sighting State: Georgia Sighting County: Laurens # of witnesses: 2 Shape: Oval # of craft: 1 Description: Landing of a 3 lighted, fairly large craft with pulsing red to amber lights. No sound at all.Description by witness narrative: I  wasn&rsquo;t going to report this until I saw that someone else from this exact same city experienced something similar just two months ago. So, I decided to also write a report since there must obviously be something going on here that is unexplained and I would like answers.Earlier this morning (Sunday Jan. 20th, 2008) at approximately 5:58 AM I decided to look out my front door to see if the ground was covered with ice (we had a lot of rain last evening and freezing temperatures overnight), and as I was looking out the front door I noticed something completely strange to my left.  It was floating above the tree line across from a field approximately &frac12; mile from my front door. The lights were pulsating from red to orange (similar to flames from a forest fire) as this thing or craft was slowly receding behind the tree line behind the open field&rdquo; &ldquo;It seemed to have three large lights from the side I was seeing. And judging from the neighbor&rsquo;s house down the road and the distance this craft was from their home and ours, it had to be at least the size of 4 or 5 homes combined, possibly even larger. A truly amazing sight and a camera was the last thing on my mind&rdquo;.&ldquo;Anyway, I couldn&rsquo;t believe what I was seeing, so I went to wake my wife up to verify what I was seeing. She quickly awoke when I told her that she had to see something that was going to blow her mind. I was hoping this thing wouldn&rsquo;t be gone before we made it back to the front door. When we both got to the front door it was still there and was now half way down behind the tree line. My wife said &ldquo;oh my God, what is that?&rdquo; We both looked at it in awe as it descended behind the trees and seemed to have landed&rdquo;.&lsquo;The area it seemed to have landed in is near a creek in a swampy area.  In a place people wouldn&rsquo;t  normally go or have good access to. All I could think is why would someone or something be landing there&rdquo;.&ldquo; My wife and I stared in the direction for nearly an hour to see if it was going to fly away. She described it as being similar to the sun going down behind the trees due to the brightness it displayed and the red and orange colors, but this definitely wasn&rsquo;t the sun, it was only 5:58 AM and was in the north west during the dark of night. She was only able to see the top half of the object and the lights as it was already landing as I awoke her. We both couldn&rsquo;t believe what we had just seen. This definitely was like nothing I had ever seen, especially this close to our own home.. I must mention that I am prior military (US. Army Veteran) and I am very observant and have an IQ of 138. This definitely didn&rsquo;t seem like any modern day aircraft that our military would have and even if it were, why would they land in the middle of the swampy creek area at 5:58 AM on a Sunday morning&rdquo;? &ldquo;As far as the shape of the craft, it seemed to be an oval shape and had no sound at all as we stepped out the front door to listen as it was landing. Another thing that was real odd was that this is in a suburban neighborhood with lots of yard animals and none of the dogs were barking at all and the air was dead silent&rdquo;.&ldquo;As big as the object was and as bright as the lights were, we were expecting to at least hear the neighborhood dogs barking, but none were&rdquo;.&ldquo;After waiting on the front porch of our home for close to an hour with blankets to keep warm, we finally decided to go back into the house. We were hoping this craft would come back up from the wooded area and would show itself once again while leaving, but it never did. And no, I don&rsquo;t plan on going in that area of the woods and swamp to see it close up either. I will be keeping a guarded eye on that area for the next few nights and even months to see if anything else happens there&rdquo;.&ldquo;All I can say about this is that we&rsquo;re definitely not alone and these things are making themselves known. I&rsquo;m just wondering why they aren&rsquo;t trying to communicate more clearly if they are superior life forces. It&#x5C; almost feels as though we are like the ants living in the ant farm and they just observe us when they want to. A little food for thought there.&rdquo;.&ldquo;Anyway, thanks for allowing me to vent about this here, because I surely can&rsquo;t tell me friends(sic) about this. I&rsquo;m not sure how they would take it&rdquo;.END OF ORIGINAL REPORT!  Upon receiving the permission of Mr. Peter Davenport to investigate this sighting report he sent this Field Investigator for MUFON the witness contact information.I contacted the witness by phone and set up an appointment at his home for January 31st, 2008 at 3PM.The primary witness is  married with two children, a boy  and a girl . He owns his own business. His wife  works at a local business. Their residence was very clean and modern.  East Dublin, Ga. is a very clean and prosperous appearing town located in Laurens County, Ga. long: w 82.9 and lat: n 32.5.This FI arrived at the witness&rsquo; address at 1PM on 1/31/08  and spent the next hour scouting the area of the sighting and getting the lay-out of the community/neighborhood surrounding the residence. Moving North passed the residence on the road they live , on the right side of the road at approximately 100 feet distance from witness&rdquo; driveway is a high-end subdivision  made up of approximately 1 acre parcels with large,modern homes which are located in an open, spacious property with a view across its expanse of approximately &frac12; mile in most directions. The road upon which the witness lives dead ends 1.10 miles into another road that runs in a West to East direction.  100 yards to the East on this road is a Georgia Power Company grid line of tall electrical towers. On the North side of this road the grid can be seen running at the foot of a long ridge (hill) approximately 250 to 300 feet high in a West to Easterly direction. This power line grid crosses over this road in a South Eastern direction where a creek crosses under the roadway at a bridge and the creek and the grid together runs into and through a swampy, mixed forest area of several 100&rsquo;s of acres. The creek has created a boggy, wet-land area and there are no roads, paths, or other entrances into this location, which is the direction of the witness&rsquo; sighting from his residence of 1.10 miles south of the creek. Heading back South on the witness&rsquo; road I went to the junction with another Georgia highway and headed East for 3 &frac12; miles. This road lead me to a power substation in 2 miles from the resident&rsquo;s road. I also noticed the other side of the ridge and swampy wet-land with several tree farms and cotton fields for the 3 &frac12; miles. Back at the residence, directly in front of it is a tree farm . This appeared to have a road that runs around the South border of the subdivision that may give access to the power-grid approximately 1 mile away that crosses both of the other roads in the area. However this land is posted with a locked gate with no contact information given on signs. Witness does not know who owns this property. Leaving the neighborhood I drove back into East Dublin business district and decided to have lunch at a very small, one room restaurant . I enquired of the owner if he had heard of any UFO sightings. He had not. I arrived at the witness&rsquo; residence at 3PM. He was warm and friendly but was still plenty excited about what he and his wife had witnessed the morning of 1/20/08 and began immediately showing me the area and recapping the event. Inside the home I conducted an interview and at first brought up the issue of the time of the sighting at 05:58 AM mentioned several times in the original report, inquiring  as to what he was doing up at that time of morning after a cold, rainy, stormy night, on a day most would &ldquo;sleep in&rdquo;. The witness stated he arose to check for &ldquo;snow&rdquo; as the local weather provider had said it was a possibility that night and he wanted to show it to the family. This FI having checked the weather report, etc. before my interview, indicating according to the U.S. Naval Observatory Astronomical Department as follows: For the East Dublin area 1/20/08 @ 04:21 AM EST- winds had been out of the NW with gusts up to 20 MPH. There had been rain over the area for several hours: humidity averaged 81 % .  A severe weather system had moved across Georgia the evening of 1/19/08 and on into 1/20/08. Temperature averaged around 47* F. No snow recorded in the area.Sunrise 1/20/08 was @ 7:32AM EST. The Moon was waxing  Gibeous with a (95% disk surface showing/ illuminated and was 2 days before full which set at the &ldquo;exact&rdquo; time of 05:58 AM that morning 1/20/08(Thanks to MUFON ASD GA. MARK AUSMUS for exact moon charts) Charts on file. Witness said the sky was clear at the time of the sighting. Please note that the lack of animal activity (barking of dogs) that the witness originally reported does not seem to this FI to be in anyway connected to the sighting as most critters, especially family yard dogs would be bedded down after such a weather system that lasted around 12 hours  and 2 hours before sunrise. Nothing appears unusual of this time frame(at this time) and the witness remembers seeing the exact time of 05:58 AM on the DVD player near the front door from which the sighting took place, which he showed me.The witness had viewed the object as he looked out of the decorative glass, front door panel, noticed the lights and opened the door. Recapping( again) the sighting as recorded in the original report, I had the witness go over the statement about the size estimate . I discovered that what he actually saw were 3 large, bright red/orange lights encapsulated inside a half &ldquo;dome&rdquo; shape, rounded part to the top, and the 3 lights were inside, tapered back from the bottom to the top as if they were  3 panels of light. The panels of light appeared &ldquo;fire like&rdquo; the sun, rather than pulsating. Estimating the size of the object was based on a neighbors house approximately &frac14; mile North on his road. I had him do a measure at arms length exercise and we determined the object to be 1 &frac12; inches to 2 inches at arms length, making the object 100 to 175 feet in length along its bottom at 1 mile distance.The entire period of the actual event was 7 to 8 minutes. Next the witness took me outside to show the exact location ( again) where he saw the object and where his wife joined him on the porch. The direction was North, North East, not NNW as originally reported. It was NNE across the open area over the subdivision at approximately 3/4/ to 1 mile distance according to my compass readings and previous drive through observations. If the object had been floating down behind the ridge line off the other road north of the location, it would not have lit up the trees, like the witness stated to this FI, and it did light up trees located closer to a small pond located on the North East side of the subdivision. It appeared to come down behind the silhouette of one specific, large pine tree near the pond about &frac14; mile away but the distance was probably closer to a &frac12;  to 1 mile away in the swamp land. The witness stated that the object maneuvered &ldquo;blimp like&rdquo;, moving very slowly and drifting down from about an 80 degree angle above the large pine tree and there was sky line well below the object estimated at about 100 to 150 feet above the large pine tree. Again, I wish to emphasize, as this FI viewed the exact angle of the objects dissent, it would have had to go down in front of the ridge line located on  the  other road to the north , not behind it. Again, this ridge is 1.10 miles from the residence and an astronomical object would have went down behind the ridge.That would put the object going down into the swamp off the northern border road. I next spoke to the second witness, the wife, by phone at her place of business and her description was as the original report, but reiterated that &ldquo;it looked like the Sun going down at Sunset&rdquo;.I asked if she had noticed anything unusual sense the sighting. She stated that their house lights had been surging up and down over that day and a few days following. At this phone interview (on speaker phone) her husband recalled with her that the automatic, dawn to dusk, mercury vapor light in the driveway had gone out as well during that time and had not come back on. This driveway light has sense been repaired and both bulb and sensor had to be replaced. The witness also remembered at this time that he had been having all the rechargeable batteries in their cell phones, remote keyboard to his business computer and the children&rsquo;s electronic toys in his home office being drained of their charges. He would charge them up and next day they would be uncharged. This FI after returning to Savannah discovered that my brand new camera&rsquo;s batteries were completely drained and I had put new ones in that morning before leaving for East Dublin. Coincidence? Maybe! Witness had also noticed an intermiten humming sensation/noise  in his and his wife&rsquo;s ears for 3 weeks after the sighting.I had the witness file a formal complaint with the Georgia Power Company and at first the customer service representative said that they are not able to look up previous  power problems. Instead they did a new report on the fact that witness was experiencing humming noise and &ldquo;possible power surges sense the 19th-20th through the end of January 08. No mention was made of the battery drainage to Georgia Power company. A Ga. Power technician was dispatched to the residence that day. The witness inquired if they could explain the humming sensations and the power fluctuations, or any other problems for that time period.  The Technician&rsquo;s log book indicated that 2 power sub-stations went out between January 20th and 21st, in the area. He unlocked the house&rsquo;s power meter and did a few tests inside the meter ands stated it was working fine. The humming noise was not detected and the technician could only say that what had been happening must have been caused by the 2 downed sub-stations . The Technician could give no explaination for the substations failures. At this writing the only problem electrically , seems to be the continual drain of freshly charged batteries in the home. This FI nor the witness can figure this out at this time. This FI first speculated that the witnesses may have seen the &ldquo;Moon set&rdquo; as it did in fact set at exactly the same moment the object seemed to land in the swamp. However, the Moon set in a wooded area directly&rdquo; behind&rdquo; the residence and was about 120 degrees in the opposite direction in the West North Westerly location at the time of the sighting.The witness stated that the object never rose up after 1 hour . After approximately 30 minutes of waiting for the object to rise , a meteor, which the witness described as normal except that it was very short in duration with only a very short trajectory of about 1 to 2 inches at arms length appearing. They speculated that they felt it was connected in some way with the object. This FI does not. As the witness&rsquo; children arrived from school on the day of the interview/investigation, he introduced me to them and I interviewed them briefly. They had not seen anything, but knew all about the details. The  daughter had had a &ldquo;nightmare&rdquo; about seeing the lights similar to what her parent&rsquo;s had described and had drawn a picture (on file) of the object. She slept with her parent&rsquo;s that night.This FI does not believe this was a &ldquo;recall&rdquo; experience by the child but simply that this incident has impacted this family in a stressful and negative way. The witness claims to have a high IQ and so does his  son. The witness has been troubled over the fact that he cannot reconcile what he saw with what he knows to be normal and logical, He has stated to this FI that it affected him as he has become protective and concerned for the families safety more than usual.This FI believes  the daughter has seen and heard her parent&rsquo;s attempts to explain the incident and became fearful.  I told the witness to consider playing down the incident to help his daughter overcome her initial fears. He agreed. This FI has 35 years experience as a professional clinical counselor and 27 years as a Christian Pastor and I can say with some certain knowledge that the witnesses (husband &amp; wife) have experienced something that has disturbed their normal life in a dramatic way and this disturbance has spilled over to their children. I have checked back once per week with the witness as of this writing and they are still trying to figure out what they saw. UFO TOOLS website gives this case with the evidence available at a 57.5% reliability, strangeness 14.29%, info quality 10%, certainty 00.82% Valle classification is FB1 possibly FB2 considering the electrical circumstantial evidence.The probability of the object being a plasma ball over  the power grid would be highly likely except for the fact that it was first seen moving 100 to 150 feet above the tree line that hides the grid line from line of sight from the witness&rsquo; front porch. Along with the appearance of being a &ldquo;dome&rdquo; or half a circle/sphere with lighted panels ,this probability is slim .FYI/ The witness mentioned the reason he made the report was because of another sighting in East Dublin 2 months prior. This incident also was reported to NUFORC on 11/26/2007. The report is similar at first examination and I can see why this witness of 1/20/08 was prompted to file his report.It was unfortunate that this FI was unable to gain access to the swampy area where the object went down to check for traces of its presence. However, due to the overall evidence of the circumstances and the insistence of the witness to remain anonymous, and the consistency of the testimonies and the adverse affect it had on the them and their children, I conclude at this time that this case should be classified &ldquo;unknown&rdquo;. However, this case will remain open for this FI and contact with these witnesses will continue until I am personally satisfied they have some closure. David I. Marchant Sr. /ASD/MUFONGA/ COASTAL AREA March 3, 2008", "Two unexplainable lights over  the southern horizon near Las Cruces, New Mexico.My residence is approximately five miles east of the city of Las Cruces and approximately five miles west of the Organ Mountains, half mile south of highway 70.  It is a routine for me to take my dog out to our backyard, which is on the south side of our home.  From our backyard we have a very open and clear southern view of the horizon.  This particular evening I noticed a light, approximately five to seven degrees above the horizon.  It was straight south, particular to my position.  I noticed as I looked, that it seemed rather bright and flickering like a fireball.  I immediately asked my wife to look with me.  We agreed that it was a light we had never before seen.  As we both looked, the light seemed to get larger and more intense for a couple of minutes.  Then, suddenly, it went dim as if it instantly moved further away.  At this point even I was skeptical, until the light moved to the east briefly, but noticeably and vanished.  As we stood, amazed and shocked, the light reappeared.  This time it appeared slightly more to the west than originally and a couple of degrees lower in the horizon with a slightly more reddish hue.  At this point we asked our cousin to look with us.  The light acted similar to before, getting larger and more intense.  However, it acted differently in the respect that it moved lower in the horizon before it went dim again in the same way.", "Two bright lights off Long Branch, NJ over the Atlantic OceanToday I was standing outside and a bright star over the Atlantic ocean caught my eye. At first I thought it was just an early bright star, kind of like when you see the moon early in the afternoon. The sky was very clear. I figured it might be a &quot;star&quot; because the sun was now in the west, behind me. It was very high in the sky. It had height similar to a star or even a satellite moving in low orbit, but was stationary. We live in an area that does not have high light pollution, so at night (especially in the summers) we are able to see satellites at night when they fly over. Our views are so good that one evening last year we were able to see a NOSS satellite group fly over. I was able to gauge the height when an aircraft was flying at what appeared to be it&apos;s maximum altitude to the left of the &quot;star&quot; and the &quot;star&quot; was much higher than the aircraft. I knew the aircraft was high due to its jet stream. There were also two birds flying at a height that dismissed the chance of the &quot;star&quot; being a balloon. Suddenly a second light appeared and was aligned in a way similar to Orion&apos;s belt. The second &quot;star&quot; seemed to have started to move slowly below the first &quot;star&quot;. In order to make sure the second &quot;star&quot; was moving I closed one eye and used my finger as marker and sure enough the lower &quot;star&quot; was moving in a southern direction. Literally, in a blink of an eye the moving star was gone. It just disappeared. No flash or high acceleration, just gone. I was looking back to the first star when it too disappeared. I waited for a few more minutes for the &quot;stars&quot; to reappear but they did not. This has been bothering me all day so I decided to post it here to see if anyone else has seen it.", "Bright green light &quot;draws&quot; serveral strange marks over the Atlantic OceanI was at the Virginia Beach oceanfront with five friends on a summer night in 2003. Three of them left to go play pool. My friend and I went and sat on the beach around 80th street, a few miles down from the strip. When I first saw the green light, it looked like a dotted line being slowly drawn downward slowly in the sky. It seemed to be very wide and very high, miles out over the Atlantic Ocean. I pointed it out to my friend and we both just thought it looked cool. It stopped abruptly, but about 5 minutes later it returned, a little faster now, and it was a solid line. The light made one streak and then stopped. This line remained visible for quite awhile. My friend and I became very interested after that. I called my mother and a few friends to tell them to look for it. One of those friends was on as boat just off the Outer Banks of North Carolina, and she and her friends could see it from there.We eventually settled back down, but an hour or so later the light returned. It started the same way, making a segmented line. When it came back as a solid line it made a broad, looping stroke in the sky. It was really bright green, and reminded me off a neon sign. My friend and I started to feel uneasy after the second appearance. There were other people scattered on the stretch off sand, and they all began pointing up and acting afraid. There was a group of around ten teenagers there from the Ukraine on work visas for the summer. They approached us and asked if we knew what was happening. Some of them seemed really scared. They sat and talked with us for another hour or so (it was between midnight and 1am) and then the light returned a third time. After its dotted stroke, the light made another sold line. This time the light swooped around a few times before culminating with an incredibly bright flash. At this point I became frightened as well, and I remember thinking we were seeing some kind of unfathomable missile or bomb approaching and that we were all going to be killed. Both the lines and the shape of the flash remained visible for what seemed like an hour. My other three friends came back sometime between 1 and 2 am. We told them what happened and one of them stayed on the beach with us and the Ukrainians. As I recounted the light appearances, it struck me that the three different shapes left by the solid line resembled the numbers 1, 2, and 3, in that order. This wasn&rsquo;t completely true, however because the &quot;3&quot; had an extra swirl at the tail before the flash.We were all completely amazed when it came back again, making the same dotted and solid line as it had the first time. I was scared, but I was also mesmerized and couldn&rsquo;t tear myself away. We all just sat there watching the sky, wondering if it would keep coming back. When it did (again, about an hour later), it repeated the pattern of the second dotted and solid line. I was sure it would come back and repeat the third line and its flash, and just before dawn it did. I was still completely awed and so even as my companions went to bed, I stayed on the beach.The cycle began to repeat itself a third time as the sky grew lighter. It was still visible after sunrise. I watched as the light again formed its first and second formations, but before the third pattern could be re-drawn, I succumbed to my exhaustion and went to sleep.I remember wanting to see what the newspaper or local news would have to say about the lights, but I never heard anything about it. I assumed the stations would be flooded with calls from people in Virginia Beach and as far away as North Carolina, so I never even considered calling myself. I did do an internet search to see if there were any weird tests being done at nearby military bases, but came up empty-handed. I still tell people about it, and when I run into the friend who had been out there with me we ask each other whether we&rsquo;ve figured out it was.  We haven&rsquo;t, of course.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))", "strange shape seen over  wigan, lancashirewhilst filling up my car with petrol my partner and i saw the shape on a completley cloudless evening sky, it made no sound and traveled west to east. when it got over the top of the roof of the petrol station it must of disapered. i managed to take a photo of it on my phone and on looking at the image i found a smaller round object following the shape", "2 UFOs Seen After A Fierce Thunder/Hail StormFollowing a fierce thunder/hail storm, my room mates and I watched as 2 UFOs remained perfectly stationary, appearing to be overlooking a not too distant lightning storm. They were slightly different in design but looked generally the same. Once the lightning slowed, one of them left in a generally calm fashion. A moment later, the other headed off into the clouds with a very sharp, fast turn. It came close enough to see it pretty well. It had 3 very bright still lights on the bottom and a bright red blinking light on the back.", "A triangle shaped craft with brilliant lights flew over my house.On April 29, 2008, at about 11pm or so, I stepped outside to take the trash out along with my dog when I happened to look up at the stars and notice an unusual, triangle shaped craft.For about 5 or 6 seconds, I watched the craft fly over my neighborhood at pretty fast speed and was flying very low, only about 1000 feet above. At first I figured the object was just some type of plane going to land at a major airport about 30 miles away. The problem was that the object didn&rsquo;t seem to heading in the direction of the airport.As the object passed, it didn&rsquo;t strike me as any type of aircraft I had ever seen before. I couldn&rsquo;t see the actual structure too clearly but the outline was noticeable. About 10 or so lights as bright as stars lined the craft to form the triangular shape.The strange thing was that there was absolutely no sound coming from the object. I am very familiar with human aircraft and there is no such craft of that shape that can fly so low and not make a sound.After watching the object for a few seconds, I looked down at my dog and when I looked back up, the object was completely gone. I waited outside another five minutes to kind of gather up what I had seen and to wait for any delayed sound, however a sound never came.I could also see and HEAR a commercial plane in the distance (about 5 miles away) after about five minutes after I had seen the UFO. The commercial plane was moving much slower than the UFO. And the lights were noticeable for a few minutes. The lights of the UFO were not visible after I had looked away for only 1 second.", "Saw bright lights, changing in color over South Chain Lake into backyardMy fianc&eacute; and I were driving north on Interstate 35W.  We decided to stop at my folks place on South Chain Lake.  It was around 11:15pm or so.  The weather was windy and cold with some light snow.   My folks were out of town so I was checking in on the house periodically.  My fianc&eacute; wanted to check the baseball scores so he went downstairs to use the computer.  I was upstairs making a late-night snack in the kitchen.  About that time I was startled by bright lights in the backyard towards the lake.It was so bright I thought a helicopter was shining lights down but there was no noise. The brightness quickly reduced and turned into a blue-hued light shining into the house.At this point I fainted and my fianc&eacute;, Dwight, heard me hit the floor. He came running upstairs to find me lying on my side by the sliding glass door (I must have gone over to look out the window).  He says he saw no lights and nothing outside. We went outside and there were two parallel tracks coming up from lake shore to the middle of yard, almost like car tracks but they were smooth. The odd thing is I seemed to have no injury from when I fainted, and this all seemed to take place in under a minute, but Dwight swears he was on computer for 10 or more minutes. I felt I had to tell my story somewhere.  I never really believed in UFO&rsquo;s previously, but I&rsquo;ve been having nightmares about it for 5 days now and have had a couple of flashbacks. Also, my dreams include seeing a hovering globe or sphere-shaped craft and I feel weightless, like I&apos;m always falling.", "Four lustrous orbs sighted over BurienI walked out onto my porch to enjoy a sunny afternoon, when I noticed 4 lustrous orbs floating in the sky.  They were to the east, above Burien I suspect, about 8 degrees in the sky, and the size of a pea when held at arm&apos;s length.  I tried to make them out, but although they weren&apos;t distorted or fuzzy, there was no discernible detail other than the strange luster. The objects climbed upward at a diagonal to the north.  I watched them until they disappeared.  They didn&apos;t zoom off or climb into the cloud cover, as there wasn&apos;t any that day, they just seemed to pop out of existence one by one, like each one became invisible in turn.  The curious thing is that even though they appeared to climb, they never got smaller in size.  They weren&apos;t moving very fast.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD))", "HELP!  Trumbull, Ohio, 1994, Local Authorities &amp; NBC cite Mass UFO sighting, Gov./Military Denies Incident, flimsy, but effectiveCover UPNote:  I live approximately 30 mile from this area and I never heard this story until recently when I was seeking quantitative data on Mexico City UFO reports for possible hypothesis tests relating public opinion of UFOs and official sighting reports frequency.  I didn&rsquo;t find the Mexico City data I sought, but I did find this story and was nearly ill.  The following is an abbreviated account of a mass sighting incident in Trumbull County, Ohio on Dec.14, 1994.   The incident involved the prolonged observation and pursuit of at least one, but more likely multiple UFOs, by no less than 15 local police officers.  The local 911 office received numerous civilian reports of inexplicable craft-like illuminated objects moving through Vienna, OH and surrounding communities.  Many objects were reported to be low near the ground and all were reported as displaying bright multicolored lights.  Police officers pursuing the objects were able to describe specific details about the objects physical appearance including the presence of machinery-like aspects of the objects.  A reporter for local TV station 33 Youngstown (ABC) initially followed up the incoming reports, but when she learned that the incident was most likely a genuine anomalous event and following a telephone call to the local FAA, she admittedly dropped the story out of fear.  This admission was made in an interview with an UFO investigator in 1998.Police officers and local emergency 911 employees are willing to publicly discuss their observations.  Official verified recordings of communications between police officers and telephone communications to and from the 911 center are publicly available as well.NBC did a report on the incident broadcast in 1999 called &quot;Confirmation.&quot; The story went completely unreported for two years until 1996 when a UFO investigator mistakenly called Vienna, OH Police Department when seeking information on a 1988 sighting near Urbana, OH.When the reporter made an inquiry about a recent UFO sighting the officer fielding the investigator&rsquo;s call began describing events that took place in 1994.  The investigator quickly realized that this was a different event from that of his initial inquiry and the event being generously described by the officer was unusually significant in terms of standard UFO phenomena reports.  The event described was openly corroborated by several law enforcement officers as well as many other witnesses.The local 911 Center provided the investigator with duplicate recordings of presumably all related communications from the night which are widely available and undisputed as authentic. All witnesses noted that objects were silent. Rough Outline of Events the morning of Dec.14, 1994 paraphrased from a publicly accessible non-commercial website dedicated to the aforementioned principal investigator&rsquo;s numerous reports. An object was first observed at a treetop level before midnight in the near  Samson Drive and the Fifth Avenue Extension. It was bluish-green with flames. Four calls were placed to the dispatch office before midnight. An additional call was placed to WYTV Channel-33 news reporter &apos;St*%ey A. A unit (#998) was dispatched to Samson Drive to investigate. At this point Unit #998 viewed the object at close range.  It was red and illuminating the ground with a red light &quot;as bright as daylight.&quot; Approaching the object, the police car suffered inexplicable electrical failure and stalled.  From all accounts, the object was described as &apos;huge.&apos;  Officer Unit #998 later stated that he encountered an elderly man in the roadway, saying: &quot;it was right above my house!&quot;  Having reported his (Unit #998&rsquo;s) observation, other units are dispatched for backup. A call is placed to the airbase by the dispatcher. There is no answer at the airbase, and a call is then placed to the FAA tower, where the tower operator states to have nothing on his radarscope within a 60-mile radius of Youngstown.At this point, the unidentified aircraft departs from the Samson Road area and Unit #998 advises that he was &apos;out of service&apos; for a duration to &quot;gather his thoughts.&quot; The time is near 1:00 a.m. The UFO is again reported when Unit #429 advises central dispatch that an object is spotted to the east of the 911 center. The dispatcher, eager to view the object, steps away to look for the UFO as another person takes her place.The object is said to be near Route 11, and several units from different locations and directions triangulate its position from areas near Kings Grave and Henheid. The object is then observed over an empty field, and changes color from whitish red to a pulsating greenish lavender.The dispatcher returns, saying that she did not see the UFO. More incoming radio traffic relevant to the UFO causes her to &apos;take a break&apos; where she plans to meet an officer who will pick her up and take her to see it Through heavy radio traffic, several unspecified police units converge upon the UFO and triangulate its position.This documented triangulation of an aerial object from different vantage points indicates to us that it is not a star, as the object maintains a localized presence within a specific area.  One unit claims that he is heading east to intercept the object. Another unit advises that he is heading north to approach the object. A unit headed eastbound advised that the object was &apos;southeast&apos; of his location.The object remains stationary over an empty field prior to a departure path to the southeast, where it is seen near an 84-Lumber hardware store. There it is described as a structured object with an attachment or unspecified element protruding from the top of it.Every police department in the county now has the object under observation, and many units are now pursuing the UFO from different departments and localities.Several units are maintaining the object under binocular observation, and discern a &apos;parachute-like&apos; structure attached to the object. One unit tries to signal the object.One officer, who is at the airbase, is also observing the object from his vantage point. Present with him to view the UFO is a security guard at the airbase.At this point, &quot;several&quot; objects are suddenly under scrutiny by law enforcement officials. This is announced rather cryptically, as the officer states: &quot;We have both of them under observation.  I think you&apos;ll know what I mean.&quot; The exact nature of this dialog is uncertain, but it is at this time that multiple objects were observed One specific object, described as a &apos;white light,&apos; appeared over the airbase, where it was observed and reported by a police officer Pursuit of these objects continued for some time, and it was again stressed that all departments in the county were concerned with the situation, and held the object(s) under visual observation.All objects ascended to a high elevation and appeared as stars in the sky. As the objects were viewed at a high elevation, others on the police force that did not engage in close range observation of the main object, while at its low elevation, assumed that everyone else had misidentified planets or shooting stars. Toward the end of the event, jets were seen in the area, and one officer believed they were military jets from the airbase sent to engage the objects.One officer refuted the &apos;planet&apos; comment, but stated that there were shooting stars visible. He stated that there were six shooting stars in the same part of the sky that the UFO was seen in.One unit took exception to the remark that planets were mistaken as UFOs, and he added: &quot;What I saw was not a planet. It was 50-feet off the ground and lit up the whole area like daylight.&quot; It is thought that the event ended around 6:00 a.m. from previous discussions with officials involved, although a specific time is not reflected on the tape. The exact number of witnesses to this event is unknown, but the 911 center received numerous citizen reports some of which can be heard on the 911 Center recordings.Unverified reports indicate that officers from 10 Trumbull County police departments responded to the event.  The principal investigator suggests the following departments as likely candidates for having officers involved in close observation and pursuit of the object(s): Niles City PD Howland Twp. PD Girard City PD Warren Twp. PD Liberty Twp. PD Cortland City PD Brookfield Twp. PD Trumbull County Sheriff Hubbard Twp. PD Hubbard City PD  An officer in the area reported climbing an observation tower and saw three hovering lighted masses in a regularly spaced formation.  His communications with other officers is also on the recordings. Other reports mentioned law enforcement investigation of similar phenomena as far from Vienna as East Palestine, Ohio around the same time.  This assertion needs verification.Other officers noted that in pursuing some of the objects, if the officers fell too far behind the object seemed to wait for then to catch up.Perhaps most unsettling about this event is the clumsy yet mysteriously effective campaign to ignore the event.  The FAA staff, working at the shared Youngstown Regional Airport and Youngstown Air Force Reserve Station at the time of the incident, were all replaced by new staff not long after the event.It may also be of interest to note that the region in which the reported sighting took place is relatively close to a Defense Logistics Agency and National Defense Stockpile at 1740 Niles-Warren River Road, one of the biggest radar/air defense installations in the United States. The Youngstown Municipal Radar Air Defense Agency is also within the locality.Local media deliberately chose to ignore this event despite the fact that local civil authority figures of undisputed credibility and presumed competence openly declared the veracity of the events.  The media doesn&rsquo;t deny the story, they just refuse to bring it to the public&rsquo;s attention.During the NBC broadcast of &ldquo;Confirmation&rdquo; in 1999, NBC totally ignored the 5 year gap between the event and the report.Included in &ldquo;Confirmation&rdquo; was an interview with an astronomer who has a reputation for slanderous statements and a decidedly unscientific anti-UFO stance blatantly accused all witnesses to this event of mistaking stars for large, complex, brilliantly lit airborne objects.The CO at the Air Force Station, also in charge of PR for the Air Force Station, spoke on behalf of the military and blatantly denied, dismissed and derided the whole incident. The principal investigator made two requests for all data for the Youngstown Airport/Air Force Station regarding air traffic on Dec. 14, 1994.   The request was made in accordance with The Freedom of Information Act.  Both request were flatly denied  If one does minimal fact-checking, this frightening incomprehensible incident will be corroborated and verified via a myriad of sources.  I find it disturbing that the incident is not already included in the database and this fact alone begs many questions. Anyone truly acting responsibly must bring this national and potentially global security threat into the public eye.  I find it disturbing that North Americans actually disbelieve in UFOs when they are a well-documented officially recognized phenomenon.  A UFO is simply an unclassified airborne object and nothing more can be said about them with impunity, yet many N. Americans are ill-informed and largely misunderstand the phenomenon.  While this event should have been the story of the late twentieth century, it is instead buried in obscurity.   One would think that if NE Ohioans really understood that so many local, credible, civic officials trained to quickly and concisely assess conflicts and threats were witnesses to an event of this magnitude and importance and yet were all deemed incredible, deluded and incapable of distinguishing a star from an aircraft, by the Feds, that the citizens of NE Ohio would be united in indignation and demand an explanation, but for some reason this is not the case. It is all-too-familiar and frightening.  The motivation and reasoning behind the military&rsquo;s public stance on UFOs is incomprehensible.  To allow large unidentified objects to invade our air space, potentially drain resources and instill existential terror among innocents is tragic.  Then for the military to wholly deny it, leaving perfect sane productive members of society marginalized, confused or worse. The mystery of the phenomenon while inexplicable for years, is growing more and more ubiquitous.  Slowly, people are learning and I think the Federal authority&rsquo;s position ( that I can only hope is erroneously intended for the good of the people), may become a liability as faith in our own institutions decay in the face of incongruent and mounting evidence.  The best way to solve a mystery and counter a threat is to have every hand and mind possible contributing to the effort. I can say no more except, please, please help inform our fellow citizens.  Ignored and unaddressed issues always resolve themselves one way or another.  I think market and economic stability is threatened by this irresponsible outdated policy of public denial by our Federal Government.  It isn&rsquo;t a &lsquo;right to know as a taxpayer&rdquo; issue, but rather one of honesty is the best policy and cooperation between all levels of society in problem-solving is the best chance we&rsquo;ve got of avoiding global mass-hysteria or some other even worse unprecedented catastrophe when the Powers can no longer hide this anomalous, ubiquitous threat.((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to the source of this report for his having submitted such a thorough account of the Turnbull, OH, case.

There were 3 lights on each object 2 white and 1 green.  There were a lot of objects in the sky.  Aprox. 20 objects.  I looked all around and they were in a grid formation in the sky. They were spaced about 3 miles from each other.  They all sat about 900ft up and didn&apos;t move.  I was in the Air Force and I&apos;ve seen aircraft before.  As I drove more and more showed up. None of them moved.  As I drove further 1 object moved in formation to line up with the others.  Same light pattern as the others. It stopped and I drove out of the city. I called my wife to tell her what happened from the road. I am not crazy. I&apos;ve driven truck for 5 years.  I was in the Air Force for 8 years.  Something was over Loiville, Kentucky that night.", "Craft with intense white lightI was out in the backyard on the phone and happened to locate what I thought was a star, moving at a speed faster than an airliner. It came from the northwest traveling to southeast.  As I was about to lose sight , it suddenly turned into an intense white light for about 10 seconds, almost like a spotlight and then dimmed back to its original star appearance. It could have been a satellite, but I have never seen an intense light come from one like that before.", "WAS LETTING THE DOG OUT WHEN MY DOG LOOKED UP AND THEN I DID THE SAME TO SEE WHAT THE DOG WAS LOOKING AT. THERE WAS A BRIGHT OVAL LIGHT MOVING NORTH THE LIGHT GOT REALLY BRIGHT . IM HAVE SEEN PLANE LANDING LIGHTS BEFOR BUT THIS THING WAS 10-TIMES BRIGHTER THEN THAT. THE LIGHT THEN JUST WENT DIM THEN I COULD NO LONGER SEE IT. IT WAS MOVING FROM THE SOUTH TO THE NORTH. IT WAS NOT A PLANE I SEEN THEM BEFOR MOVING IN THE SKY AND NOT SOMETHING LIKE THE SPACE STATION SEEN THAT BEFOR THIS LIGHT THING WAS TO FOR NORTH WHEN IT GOT REALLY BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT.", "Horizontal row of lights seen from a bridge over the Arkansas river, which changed configuration to a vertical column and disappearedI was driving on I-430 northbound across the bridge over the Arkansas river when I noticed a horizontal group of lights several hundred, perhaps as much as two thousand, feet in the sky above some trees on the right side (relative to the freeway I was driving on) of the northern coast.  All the lights were the same color, a bright white with a tinge of yellow.  They were four or five circular-shaped lights very close together so they almost appeared as one bar of light.  None of the lights blinked or changed color.  I was watching it for a little less than a minute when suddenly all the lights disappeared and a new set appeared in a vertical formation, bisecting the horizontal set of lights if they had remained visible.  The change occurred while I was watching and there was no smooth transition: the horizontal lights simply disappeared as the vertical lights appeared.  The vertical lights were the same color, intensity, and spacing as the horizontal lights, with each light just far enough apart from the next that they did not appear to be a solid bar of light like a fluorescent or neon tube.  Shortly after the vertical lights appeared, within a second or two, the top light quickly became much brighter.  A few seconds later, the vertical lights disappeared leaving only blackness.  The vertical lights were only visible for about five seconds before disappearing. The entire time the lights were visible, just over a minute, they were completely stationary.  Had the lights been on at the same time, they would have resembled a cross (+).  There&apos;s no way the lights could have been attached to a radio tower or any other antenna.  I&apos;ve made the same commute from Little Rock to Jacksonville almost every night for several years and am very familiar with all stationary land beacons.  Partially due to my familiarity with the drive and the fact that the bridge across the river is completely straight, I could devote a lot of attention to the lights.  It was too dark to make out a shape of whatever the lights were attached to.  Unfortunately, the night was too black and the lights too bright for me to make out any kind of shape the lights may have been attached to.  I never heard any sounds from the lights as I was driving on the freeway around 65 Mph in a cheap, poorly sealed car.  Because of this, it was impossible for me to conclude if the lights made any sound at all. Note that for number of craft seen, I&apos;ve selected 1-10: as few as one if the lights were all connected to one craft, and as many as 10 if each light was attached to its own craft.  I remain unsure of if there were four or five lights comprising the horizontal row and vertical column as I could barely make out the shape of each light.  However, I&apos;m positive one of the numbers is correct.", "White Sphere loiters than darts towards eastThis incident occurred a week and one day prior to the first incident I filed tonight  I was on a break with a coworker (he did not witness the event), and I get up to check the area between the store I work at and the one next to it. Since this area is the darkest in the entire property, I take a look at the stars and quickly notice a white brightly lit sphere (it was at a low enough altitude I could tell its shape) loitering and wandering over the sky above a nearby high school. Suddenly it &quot;boosts&quot; and crosses a couple degrees of the sky in less than a second, before shooting towards the east so fast it seemed to disappear in an instant.", "Two boomerangs, joined at center, split and become 2 craft03/25/08 2145-hrs:  While inside my house, I overheard a very loud and strange sounding engine &ldquo;hum.&rdquo;  I went outside immediately, gazing skyward, to see what could be making the sound.  I observed a craft heading south-easterly, which had just passed over my house when I came outside.  The craft had (5) distinct lights and appeared to be like (2) boomerangs joined (facing one another by the points) in the middle.  The &ldquo;middle&rdquo;, where the craft(s) were joined had one large red light.  The &ldquo;tips&rdquo; of the boomerangs had white lights.  Their was no contrail.  At first, I did not believe this to be (2) separate crafts, as it appeared to be one large shaft and moved in a uniform and completely synchronized manner.  It was obvious, in my sight, that this was one craft.  The sound, size and shape of the craft intrigued me, so I called my husband outside.  He arrived within several seconds and watched this craft with me.  He said that it &ldquo;might be military&rdquo; although he said he had never seen anything like it.  We both continued to watch the craft, which proceeded at what I would consider a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; speed for a low-flying aircraft.  The craft was about the side of a grapefruit, with my hand held up in the air to reference it.  The craft was low-flying enough for me to barely make-out the joined &ldquo;boomerang&rdquo; shapes&mdash;what I would estimate to be about 500-feet of elevation.  As my husband and I watched this craft pull away, we then noticed that it split into (2) separate and distinct craft.  The craft split apart from one another by approx. 10-fingers width.  We could see the (2) crafts at slightly different elevations and they flew obviously apart from one another.  The red &ldquo;center&rdquo; light was no longer visible.  The craft then came back together, but &ldquo;side-by side&rdquo; with no &ldquo;space&rdquo; between them.  They flew together in this manner, never returning to the &ldquo;joined boomerang shape.&rdquo;  My husband, somewhat of a skeptic, even said that &ldquo;was weird&rdquo; and that he &ldquo;had never seen anything like that before.&rdquo;  He st! ated tha t it may have been mid-air refueling of an aircraft coming from Vandenberg.  I consider this as a possibility, but wonder, why would they need to conduct mid-air refueling so low over a populated area and so close to Vandenberg itself?  -Vandenberg is only about 18-miles away &ldquo;as the crow flies.&rdquo;  Environment:  It was a clear and star-filled night and the houses in my development are spaced-out by at least 100 (or so) feet between one another and the condo association itself takes great care to curtail light &ldquo;pollution.&rdquo;  -The motto in our area is &ldquo;Turn-out the lights, see the stars.&rdquo;", "White Orb leaves ground to go up to an objectOn a clear night I happened to look out my den window and there appeared to be a truck that failed to make the turn on the corner.  2 men appeared out of the truck wearing what appeared to be welder helmets.

This was quite unusual.(I live in a rural area and always see a few house lights, snow on the mountains, and occasional car headlights in the distance.) In the upper left corner of my window I saw a large luminescent lime green rectangular object with rounded corners. In the 2-3 seconds I saw it, it did not appear to be moving. There was no glow, trail, aura or beams from this object going to the ground or sky. All the luminescence and color were contained in the rectangle. Inside the rectangle there appeared to be other colors of perhaps yellow-green or silver-white that I can only say reminded me of plumbing pipe shapes. There appeared to be movement of the light within these shapes.  All of this happened within a few seconds and as I thought &quot;what in the world is this?&quot;, before the whole sentence was formed in my mind, the rectangle light flickered out, as if a switch had been turned off. It was still completely black outside my window. I went outside within five seconds. All looked &quot;normal&quot;.

These lights were fairly close together and at first I thought it was a commercial jet on high approach to Pittsburgh Airport, but it was not heading in the usual NE to SW direction. It reminded me of a satellite because at one point the lights were jumping slightly out of the path of the object as if it might be rotating, but the distance they traveled sideways was more than 4 times the distance between them (there appeared only a slight separation)as if it might be a larger object and the lights were simply moving from one side to the other in a sideways direction. I could not see any outline, however. As I watched, the lights made a slow wide arc of about 90 degrees to the west and disappeared over some trees to the west. They were in view for quite some time through the trees and my impression was that the object was either moving very slowly or was very high. It was almost like it was floating or gliding and there was no sound coming from its direction at any time. The night was clear and the visibility was good.

I eventually made my back into the house and told my friend who was upstairs still.

And he got up out of bed immediately, he almost jumped out of bed literally.  He became very pale and disoriented.  I opened my eyes, and I saw an amazing event happen right before my eyes..  From what I can remember there were about two solid &quot;fire ball lights&quot;  in a perfect circle the size of about 3 tennis balls.  and they were moving around in such a synchonized pattern, almost a pattern of something that existed all on its own.  It had sort of a magnetic movement...  The balls were moving very fast in a circular sideway motion and they would leave a trace of light behind, which made an amazing design in front of us..  It only lasted for about 4 to 5 seconds and then it completely dissapeared.  The lights were not on the wall or on the ceiling, they were floating in the middle of the room.  Now, there are no open windows in the room, they are all covered with blinds and dark curtains.   So there is absolutely no possible way that they were being reflected from outside.  I also heard a few knocks in the door, but my boyfriend says he did not hear the knocks.  After this happened, he ran outside and saw nothing.

I deduced that an airport must be nearby and began scanning the sky for other aircraft. Not noticing anything, my scan gradually rose in altitude until I noticed a V-formation of white dots flying from west to north-east. I counted seven individual dots, one on point and three on each leg. They were moving rapidly, left no contrails, and appeared to be at extremely high-altitude. They had no discernible form, appearing as small white dots-not shiny but soft white. I watched them move at a constant speed for approximately 15 to 20 seconds as they traversed 45 degrees of azimuth. At that point they appeared to slow almost imperceptibly and then vanished.Analysis:  Although this event occurred almost 13 years earlier, it is quite accurate. I had written down the particulars shortly after it happened, and my present memory of the event corresponds exactly to that written record. I have also confirmed the exact date, although the time of day is approximate.It is impossible to tell at what altitude these objects were flying. However, I expect that they were at extremely high altitude because they had no discernible form. Commercial aircraft flying at FL330 have a clearly visible aircraft shape, but these objects were merely dots. They were clearly not birds, which display a typical individual motion as they flap their wings. These objects never varied in size, color, intensity or motion. It is quite apparent that just before they vanished from view they began a turn, giving the perception of slowing. As the turn progressed, they no longer reflected sunlight toward me and became invisible.The angle of azimuth covered by the flight of the objects is known because they came into my view just beyond the left corner of the windshield and they disappeared almost directly ahead. Furthermore, this section of the Interstate was as straight as an arrow, for you could see the road stretch out for miles ahead with no curves whatsoever.The duration of observation is approximate; I did not record the exact times. Estimating duration of time for short-lived events is notoriously inaccurate, unless there is some reference. Because I am cognizant of this fact, I have tried to mentally relive the event and time its duration. While observing the objects I kept pointing them out to my passenger, who never did see them. I have taken that dialog into account and added additional precious seconds to arrive at what I believe is a fairly close and extremely conservative approximation.Given these variables, it can be estimated that at 30,000 feet the speed of the formation would be between approximately 780 and 1045 MPH, and at 50,000 feet the speed would range from approximately 1295 to 1725 MPH.", "3/09/08: Bright, shiny liquid-silver colored oval hovering in the sky.On Sunday, March 9th at 12:30pm, on a very clear afternoon, my husband and I were driving home from church, when we both noticed a flashy object in the sky.  At first, we thought that it was a helium mylar balloon.   Only after watching it for several seconds, were we able to tell, that it wasn&apos;t a balloon.  First, the object was hovering, not moving in any direction; second, the texture was too bright and shiny, like liquid silver, and finally, the shape was too precise to be a balloon.  It was oval in shape, but it seemed to be smaller on top than on the bottom.  From the angle that we were looking at it, the shape was similar to a kidney bean.

Being only one mile from the base they would have been able to see same from there flight tower. After all sources had been checked no one admitted to seeing or knowig anything about the UFO. I did not think much of it at the time for one simple reason. There was no way the two bases could not have know about this UFO. When I call this a UFO I mean it in the truest form. I did not know what it was, but given its location I knew good and well the military knew what it was. Because of this I took it to be something from earth. Now after all these years I still believe it was not from outer space. It was an amazing sight. To see this huge round stationary UFO located at about 1,000 ft with these small round UFOs dropping from under the belly of the mother UFO and darting off at great speed in every direction was a sight to behold. What was it, I have no idea, but I do know this much. The nearest base could not help but see this object. The point is they knew what is was snd were not about to tell lawenforcement anything.

I am familiar with the celestial bodies, this did not fall into that category and was much brighter than the ISS.

I looked for the familiar flashing lights normally spotted on planes, they were absent (for the record, my vision is better than 20/20).

It had several clusters of brilliant white lights.  I called my husband to come look at it.  He looked at it and said that it looked like a UFO. It was approximately 2 miles away and somewhat low to the ground.  After opening the window and listening, we realized there was no sound coming from it; No motor noise noted.  It moved slowly from Northwest to Southeast and then just vanished.  Total time that we watched it was approximately 5 minutes. I do not believe that it was an airplaine because it was flying too slowely and too close to the ground.  It did not fly in a straight line.  There was no noise from any type of engine.  It was silent. The lights were brilliant white lights-not like those on an airplaine.  It was very large.

It doesn&apos;t end there.Ok from what I can remember, I was attending elementary school in about the mid 80,s, I was about 8-10 yrs old and after lunch we went to the play ground, and on the way, there was talk and children excited about an object in the sky.  So I ran to see, when I arrived the teachers and children where pointing in the sky, so I looked an there it was a UFO!!!  What ever that ment  I didn&rsquo;t know rather to be excited or scared so I looked at the teachers, they seemed to be fine so it was ok. Thinking back it was very high up possibly miles up and north about one or two o&rsquo;clock high, at first, at least to me it appeared to be saucer or oval shaped but definitly chrome in color, and It just seemed to set their for awhile it didn&rsquo;t move at all, what was so exciting about that. At least 30 min went by as the children started playing again, then suddenly the teachers started yelling look!!! When I did It had started changing it&rsquo;s shape to a tear drop facing down and flickering from a dark chrome color to bright chrome glow, at this time my watch a Dukes of hazard watch started beeping Its horn sound , fuzzy sound but It was beeping and it wouldn&rsquo;t stop so I covered it with my hands and continued looking, then it fell in like a controlled fall about a third of the way down and stopped again for a few minutes, I started playing with my watch when all at once some of the children said it was falling to the ground, I looked but couldn&rsquo;t find it for a second until it flickered here an there on the way down until I last seen it just above the tree&rsquo;s. I don&rsquo;t know if it had fell to the ground are not but it was definitly falling down. After that we couldn&rsquo;t see it anymore then we went back to class after observing it for at least 45 minutes. No big deal to me I didn&rsquo;t even know what UFO was. If I am correct on the date the next day when we returned to school, again after lunch we where playing in the play ground when unexpectedly I&rsquo;m  pretty sure of it are we wouldn&rsquo;t have been playing out there, the teacher! s starte d yelling at us to leave the play ground, at the same time I Noticed one or two military helicopters just over my head, and that was it for me checkmate I was gone!!! Anyways  when we the children had seen that it was the military and they had landed in the play ground we were excited. I remember thinking they were there for us the children and were going to paint our face&rsquo;s  with camouflage like they would at the city fair when they would come. But in full uniform the officers just walked on bye straight to the principles office screw them!!! We later went back to class then soon after my teacher including other teachers where called to the office, and we were subbed by another teacher while she was gone. And that was about it until the next day when we arrived back to school and was told on the intercom that what we had seen was none other than a weather balloon and we were even told on kplc news that it was. So that was that. Go figure!!! Hell I believed It. Until about 20 years later after I had forgotten It all those years, it wasn&rsquo;t a UFO that&rsquo;s why I forgot about it until I&rsquo;d seen a similar event on the history channel, then WOW what had happened all came back. Any way I&rsquo;m glad I seen this site on the web I haven&rsquo;t really had it in me to tell this story to any one else around here because I haven&rsquo;t heard anything about it since don&rsquo;t want to bring it up again. I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m not the only one that remembers it around here. Awe one more thing for what its worth just a couple of miles north of my small town of about 3,500 is a large prison compound it could have had a strange appearance from above. And I also seen on the history channel about UFO&rsquo;s a map showing a UFO crash recovery just about 40-80 miles north of my town. about 40-50 miles north of here is a military base called Fort Polk, I don&rsquo;t know when the so called recovery took place but it was a long time ago, I guess it would be possible for the craft that I seen to have crashed way up their since it was so high it could have appeared to be c! loser.

My cousin and grandma claim not to remember the latter part of the sighting (only the star-like lights and for my cousin the explosion).  I remember them standing there just staring blankly up into the sky.  They claim that we got &quot;freaked out&quot; and went back inside before anything too detailed happened. My cousin and I procrastinated feeding the cats outside, so we had to do it in the dark.  I stood outside of the cat pen to make sure none got out and looked into the northeastern sky where I observed two lights.  One beam shot from the other and there was an explosion, which my cousin witnessed.  We ran inside and grabbed my grandmother and we stood in the front yard.  There was still residual light in the sky from the explosion, and more lights started appearing, looking like stars.  Then, as the numbers increased, they grew closer. There was no set formation and they were all traveling at different altitudes and distances from each other.  I can&apos;t recall how many there were -- not that I was counting.  I was in a state of shock and awe.  One craft flew at about treetop level right above our heads as if saying, &quot;Get a look at me!&quot;  It hovered over us for about 2 minutes.  It was triangular shaped, probably about 15-20 at the base (back end) of the craft.  The edges of the triangle were rounded out.  The color of the craft was a gunmetal gray with a greenish tinge.  I got the impression that it was a soft metal.  There were geometric shapes etched in the metal -- lines and shapes formed together to create symbols.  There were semi-bright, rounded, amber colored lights at each point of the triangle.  They never dimmed or pulsed.  There was no sound, only a humming which seemed to come from inside of my head and the air seemed electrically charged.  It continued on, moving at about 10mph with it&apos;s buddies and gradually gained it&apos;s altitude.  I&apos;m really not too clear on what happened after this, honestly.

Over my house the larger airliners are typically at about 10,000 ft. or above, but even at that altitude the are easily distinguishable by the strobes, nav lights and jet sound.

There were several things about the object that were odd.  (1) The object headed due North, a direction I almost never see aircraft go.  (2) The lights were white, and not flashing like strobes would.  (3)  There were no wing lights/ navigation lights- just unblinking white lights.  (4)  The object, flying at what I estimated to be low altitude, based upon many previous sightings of small aircraft, generated absolutely NO SOUND whatsoever!  The object flew across the sky rather quickly, and disappeared in the due North horizon.  I refer to this as a &ldquo;mundane&rdquo; sighting because there were no multi-colored lights, no &ldquo;cigar shape&rdquo;, no instantaneous 90 degree changes in direction, no odd noises- nothing spectacular; just an object that flew across the sky without flashing lights and totally devoid of sound, something I cannot explain.  I have ALWAYS heard the sound of EVERY aircraft that has flown over my house, high or low; I simply cannot explain this particular sighting- why was there no strobe lights?

To avoid turnpike traffic (the road was off of Flanders Netcong Road) anyway about half way home The cigarette lighter in Eric&rsquo;s car began to smoke terribly (now the weird part is that his dad unplugged it to keep him from smoking in his car ~~ I know  but it is true he is a Preachers son) Then a few seconds later the car died ~ we rolled off the road in a turn around spot I grabbed a rag and pulled the lighter works out of the car and thru it into a puddle on the side Of the road ~ it was so hot steam came off of it. And while we were looking at the lighter in the puddle Going what the hell just happened ~~ Eric grabbed me and dude look , look look ~~ I kinda paniced at first because here we are 2 West Virginia boys in the middle of no where on the side of the road at night ~ this is a movie right? So I turn and look up and bam ~ there it was just hovering over the tree line Which if anyone knows the area knows &quot;Pines&quot; between 40 to 80 feet tall ~~ medium growth ~ I look straight ahead and there is a wooden fence and a huge field with several cows kinda huddled real close together and next to the fence line. I run over to the fence and stand on the first rung and begin looking at the craft which is enormous I mean 4 football fields or more ~ so big you couldn&rsquo;t see the end or the beginning or the sides ~~ it just covered the entire field!!! We just kept looking at each other going this isn&rsquo;t happening!! The thing was just hovering it had several lights not flashing but not so bright as to Cast any kind of shadow or anything and it was so dark ~ there are no kinds lights out there ~ at all I mean really pitch black ~ the lights I&rsquo;ll never forget they were red white and a few where kinda like glowing not really any kinda positive color just hot or heat looking if that makes sense ~~ Eric says it was triangle shape but me being the more level headed of the two in stressful situations I believe it was square but in the night sky and as big as it was who knows? All I know is that the damn thing was big and I was scared for the first time in my life ~~ I&rsquo;ve gone 200mph on a motorcycle and jumped outta planes seen two of my kids be born even had a toe to toe with a real Hell&rsquo;s Angel . But I&rsquo;ve never seen anything like this ~ nor Have I ever spoken of this to anyone else other than Eric ~ and I don&rsquo;t think he has either ~ I&rsquo;M A PROFESSIONAL AT WHAT I DO NOW some years later and this is something I&rsquo;ve never gotten over ~ anyway ~ the thing start to move north west by my best guess because we followed it after it moved away the car started right back up and we rode back to the RT. 206N then onto 613 then onto 667 ~~ were we lost it ~~ it crossed the main highway several times and I kept saying to ERIC man doesn&rsquo;t anybody else see this freaking thing?? It was so damn big!! We weren&rsquo;t drinking  anything stronger than Gatorade and were weren&rsquo;t doing drugs ~ really wasn&rsquo;t our thing ~ just heading home after shooting some hoops with some friends ~~ I think for me there is more to the story than what I have spoke of because of something that happened as a child to me ~ but I won&rsquo;t go into that ~ just know that I&rsquo;m a realist who believes in the here and now ~~ and this thing haunts me everyday!!  I&apos;m only doing this becuase of a show I saw last night about the NYC area UFO Hunters  ~ ~ and some of the things they showed looked like this and man it was weird first time in years it really really hit me ~~ I gotta speak up ~((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

It was dark and while they did not appear to be glowing, they were ever so much lighter than the sky or clouds behind them.  My girlfriend was driving so I asked her to stop the car.  We pulled over and got out of the vehicle. She was the first one to see the second cluster.This second grouping was not so &apos;tight-knit&apos; as the first. I was easy to dismiss the whole event as escaped balloons at first....especially with the first group being so close together. But, with their altitude, it was plain to see these two clusters were much too far apart to be simultaneous balloon releases.We noticed that we could make out individual &apos;units&apos; in the second cluster which moved almost like fish in the water. There appeared to be 30 or more in this cluster alone. Not pushed about on the wind like floating balloons, and certainly not with the flapping motion of a bird, the movement of each unit was fluid with definite acceleration by some to keep the group together.Birds such as geese, flying in a V formation, do not circle for a better position within their group, as we witnessed that night.

And it maintained a relativly constant speed.  Not very fast and slower than a light aircraft in flight.  The rolling and flipping motion is what I found odd.

(Derived from the exif data of the first picture.) Approximate location was the City of McHenry, Illinois, the intersection of Routes 31 and Bull Valley road, and traveling South from there, approximately one quarter mile. As I was walking down my driveway to check my mailbox, I saw what seemed to be a kite or windblown scarf, brilliant orange and darker orange in color, it was slowly moving toward me traveling from North to South very slowly, its size at the time appeared to be no more than maybe four feet in any direction.  I did not observe it intensely because it had a motion as though moving up and down as if tethered by a string from the ground, the speed of the oscillations were approximately three or four cycles per second, the range of motion restrained to about twice it&rsquo;s physical size.  The odd motion had me ready to grab for my pocket Sony camera that I keep with me,  but still not enough to trigger a reaction to take an image, &quot;no need to waste memory card space,&quot; I thought. I continued on to check the mail, it had not come yet, when I looked to see where &quot;the Kite&quot; was located, all my internal alarms went off.  The object was now abreast of me, it&rsquo;s path seemed to be about 200 feet West of me, but I had no reference to gauge it&apos;s actual size, and it was never directly over me, it was clear to me that something strange was happening, the &ldquo;thing&rdquo; was rising up while still traveling due South, now directly West of my position, and abreast of me, any sense of its size was now lost, it may have been much larger than my initial estimate. It is worth noting that the bizarre appearance and motion of the Orange object matched nothing in my mental catalog of known objects, it is almost impossible to even describe it accurately because it looked so strange, it had sharp angles and curves and as it was rising in front of me, it&apos;s motions were so fast as to cause it to be a blur as it was close to my position. The motion at this angle were now a horizontal back ! and fort h, as it was rising, same frequency of cycles per second as noted before, about three of four times per second, and still rapidly rising. I did grab my camera, got it turned on, as I lifted it up, the LCD screen was almost completely washed out by the brilliant sunlit sky, I had to approximate the correct direction, the camera is set in bracket mode, it will take a series of three frames, each with a different exposure, one overexposed, one optimized, and one underexposed, usually at least one will be usable, and you can make an HDR image by combining all three together. As I depressed the shutter button, the multi hued Orange &ldquo;thing&rdquo;, abruptly faded out within one second, an extremely brilliant strangely hued point source of light popped into view slightly to the south of the orange colored object at the same instant, as the first orange colored one dissolved, the bright light appeared. The distance between the two objects locations was about the size of my fist held at arm&rsquo;s length. Upon examining the camera images I saw that I did capture the light points but they are quite underwhelming compared to the impact of the actual event. The Sony cameras lens was set to minimum zoom which is 38mm, the average 35mm cameras lens would be 50mm, this means my camera (a Sony DSC T9), was set to a fish eye setting as opposed to a zoomed in setting, this makes the light I saw too small and far away looking to provide images with high detail. The light had an odd purplish blue cast to it a little bit like a welders arc, but strangely different,  to my amazement, this small yet powerfully bright light began immediately moving up and away now traveling Southwest an unknown distance, in just a second, it paused in its apparent movement and ascension, but then engaged in a series of severe and rapid saw tooth type oscillations, occurring within a second, while staying within an imaginary box, the size of which I could not guess due to a lack of references pertaining to size and distance. The small bright light seemed to! have an abundance of energy to burn judging by its erratic and speedy movements. I was taking pictures all the time, the three images are taken in quick succession probably almost occurring within a second, there is a delay of several seconds as the three shots are written to the memory card and then it will take another series of three. The point source light then either dimmed or moved away at an incredibly fast rate, leaving again in a steep vertical climb, with a slight Southwest direction of travel. My initial reaction as it disappeared from sight was that the thing I had just witnessed was very unusual and most likely not caused by any natural phenomenon I am familiar with, the rapid oscillations were so fast that I saw a streaking or elongating effect that happens with fast moving very luminous objects viewed with my naked eye. I would say the after image (The streaking effect.), behind the light source was very noticeable, like rapidly waving a glowing stick of incense in the dark. My impression of what it was is mixed, the first manifestation looked like something solid, but it moved erratically, it seemed to have a physical presence. When the point source of light appeared, it is hard to imagine anything moving so erratically could be moving under intelligent control, the motions were just so extreme. Why would such radical motions be part of its operation or function, it does not make sense. I took pictures, but they are only of use to someone with some computer graphics background, I think someone with some Photoshop skills could overlay some of the pictures and show the trajectory that the object took as it moved away. There are foreground objects (Trees and power lines), in enough of the frames that they could be overlaid to show the differing locations of the light as time elapsed. The digital images do not show any streaking caused by the rapid motion, perhaps because of the bright conditions, the automatic settings most likely would have selected a very fast shutter speed on the camera, or it c! ould be that the object happened to be moving at a slower speed at the moment the frames were taken. The pictures have no value to the casual observer, as far as the wow factor goes. But the testimony I give is honest and true.As for myself, I have a limited educational background, but have always been a scientifically minded person and was an Ultra light aircraft pilot, with a good understanding of weather and other natural phenomena. I enjoy watching YouTube videos and am very skeptical of 99% of the UFO videos and images seen there and elsewhere. I enjoy reading and contributing to the Above Top secret forums, especially those topics concerning alleged UFO activities.  The Chad Drone incident was covered there extensively with hundreds of contributors joining together to analyze the data, eventually a consensus was reached that it was a hoax. In short, this object flew over the wrong person, if it was attempting to be stealthy!  I feel that I am very qualified to make an impartial, detailed report detailing the behavior and visual characteristics of this event.My Flickr account has the images here. http://flickr.com/photos/ring0/sets/72157604542071914/ there are 21 images in all. I hereby release them to the public domain, free to use for nonprofit purposes.  They are of very low usefulness for the casual viewer, no craft are seen, only a hard to see point of light in most of them, the last few images show none, but I included all the frames that I took that day. The few people I have shown them to have said that they do not show anything of an interesting nature, and I cannot blame them, but there is enough there to satisfy myself that I was not imagining the incident.", "a big star-like like that closed from one side to the other, not reappearingI went out back for a ciggarette as I often do, looking up at the sky.

Upon closer inspect it had no visable wings but it also made no sound. So we decide to try and go under as we came closer it started to leave. Thats what else made it interesting because it speed away and disapeared in less than 10 seconds. We know that no aircraft can do that or it would have made a sound.

It was flashing randomly, no type of pattern.  It would flash rapidly or slowly or not even flash for 10-20 seconds at a time, it was very random. I watched it for about 3-4 minutes moving from one place in the sky to another in a back and forth motion.  I ran down stairs to get my camera, which took approximately 30-40 seconds.  By the time I got back it was practically above my head.  Unfortunately I was unable to get video of the object because I froze in shock watching the object.  I did not expect it to be so close.  It was about two to three stories overhead and about two closely neighboring houses down.  It made no sound and for an object that close and as visible as it was, it was unlike anything else.  At this point it hovered slowly in an up and down motion almost like a zigzag.  It was in view for about 30 seconds until it went past my roof and above the house.  The flashing light was in the middle of the metallic like object. I saw a saucer in shape and it clearly had dark windows all the way around the side I viewed.  It was not very big. It was less than 20 ft. wide.  I went to the front window of the house to see if it passed by but I saw nothing.  About 45 minutes later I looked out the back window again and saw flashing lights in the opposite side of the sky as before.  This time it was about 5:15am and it was all over the sky.  It moved very quickly and in far distances in a short amount of time, unlike before when it was moving slowly.  Almost like it was having its last of fun before the sun came up.

It was around 3am, perhaps a bit earlier, when we saw the bright lights swooping low over the freeway and making radical turns, repeatedly flying over a nearby grove of fruit trees and then over the freeway again.  The shape looked triangular, but I could not tell for sure since all I could see were the three lights (could be three sets of two lights each).  I could not see any markings, or even the shape, but I got the impression that it seemed to be a &quot;flying wing&quot; like the B2 bomber, from the positioning of the lights (one forward, two a little further back and on the sides).The seems just like the other reports for the object near Coalinga on this site.  There were no red and blue lights like standard aircraft have.  This was very low, and there were other cars on the roadway that spotted it.

In the sky next to the moon was a small silver glowing round object that caught my eye.  As i stood there and watched, a neighbor saw me and said they have been there for a few hours.  She told me there was a &quot;fireball&quot; type of thing in the sky that lasted a few minutes and everyone in the area by the pool had witnessed.  Then it disappeared and these Little glowing balls appeared.  i looked for a few minutes and went into the house.The next day i got a call that &quot;they&quot; were in the sky again.  it was about 1 pm.  So i went outside and next to the moon was the same glowing object.  By now I&apos;m getting interested!!  So i started watching and tracking these things.  They seem to have a distinct pattern in the sky.  Usually appearing near the image of the moon, moving west, then moving north to particular point in the sky then disappearing.  This went on for several days.I went to a friends house about 1/2 mile away and told them about the silver objects.  they came out and we waited and they would literally just appear out of nowhere.  So we watched for a few minutes, and some of their neighbors came out and we were all watching.  Then out of nowhere there was this &quot;giant luminescent green round thing&quot; floating by.  It was round but flat as if you cut it out of paper and held it up in the sky.  it wasn&apos;t round like a ball, but just circular.  It was larger then the moon in the sky, but not next to it.  it appeared to be above up. it was really hard to tell how far away it was.  Once this Green thing appeared, 3 small silver ones appeared.  it was the most silver ones i had seen at one time in the sky.Before it disappeared one silver ball appeared next to the green one at about 1 o&apos;clock position, and moved around it to about the 5&apos;oclock position before it faded.  Then as quickly as it appeared it vanished, (it lasted about 15 seconds) and only the silver one remained.  We watched for a few more minutes hoping the Giant green thing would come back but i never saw it again.A few months later i did see one small silver object, i tracked it for a few minutes till it disappeared and went in.  i haven&apos;t seen anything else in a few months.  A side note, the silver objects moved very slow, appeared very high in the sky and seemed to wiggle slightly.  i never saw anything after dark and they did seem to glow and not reflect light. i never got the feeling while watching one that i was actually moving, but it was covering sky.  i do have a few minutes of video of the silver objects, but i don&apos;t know how to load it from the video camera to the computer.

We had arrived there around 5:30 p.m. or 6 p.m., and the only reason the security guard at the gate let us in was because my friend knew somebody. There were private homes surrounding the lake, but there were no homes in the area where we were fishing, which we did for hours during the visit without catching anything.At around 10 p.m., I turned around to get a cigarette out of my tackle box when I noticed three large bright lights hovering behind some trees. Behind the pond was an open field of high grass a few hundred yards in diameter, and along the perimeter of the field was dense forest. The object I saw was off to the left. I said to my buddy, &quot;What the hell is that?&quot;   Astonished, he said, &quot;I don&rsquo;t know.&quot;  The object moved out from behind the trees and started to slowly make its way toward our position. It was only two or three stories above the ground, and I had a great fear it was about to land in the open field. My friend pointed his flashlight at the object when it was just about over our heads. I wanted to get in his truck and flee the scene. The object, which emitted no noise whatsoever, then started to move in another direction away from us toward the forest until it finally disappeared over some trees. The object&rsquo;s lights faced us during the entire sighting, making it impossible to determine the craft&rsquo;s shape.My friend and I threw our fishing gear into the back of his truck and sped away to the entrance of the private lake, which happened to be in the direction the object flew. We were traveling along a dirt road when we had to stop and wait for a slew of deer to cross. The animals were running from the area where the object had flown.Regarding the object, we were unable to make out its shape because the three lights facing us were extremely bright. Each light was three times as large as an automobile headlight, and they were brighter than high beams. The object must have been fairly large, however, because there was some decent space between each light.The object could not have been a plane, jet or helicopter because of the way it moved and because it made no sound. Furthermore, I&rsquo;ve never seen any flying craft that could move so close to trees like this one did.Other aircraft were visible from our position, but they were merely planes taking off and landing at a nearby airport, which was pretty far away from the lake.

I saw 3 perfectly round white orbs flying together.They were pretty high up and were moving at a moderate speed across the sky.Then the one on the right made a sharp right and a couple of seconds later the one on the left made a sharp right. This lasted about 30 seconds before I lost sight of them behind a building.I got a good look at them. They were definitely not birds, planes or balloons.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

More looked like a disk. Not aircraft shaped.  Making a turn, the object literally vanished after trees obscured out vision for a mere 5 seconds. Was definitely NOT an aircraft.  Appeared to hover", "2 lights, possibly the front and back of one object, move in the night sky and vanish as if dimming to naught, in 8 secondsI was lying on a blanket, outside, star gazing with the naked eye.  I was just staring at Orion, when off to the left, East, I noted a star with 2 very bright companions.  At first I did a double take - there had been no pair of bright stars there all night, as I had been out since 6:30pm and it was now after 8pm EST.  The lights were separated consistently by the same distance, to an observer, it would be about 200 or 300 ft in length, if it were one object, with a light in the &apos;front&apos; and one in the &apos;back&apos;.  These two lights were separated like stairs, one slightly above the other, but they moved very very slowly, and in tandem, making me think it was one object but its edges were not quite visible to complete its form.  The issue for me, that made me sit up and really stare hard, was the fact that at first, I thought it was a constellation.  I wasn&apos;t even sure it was moving, or they were moving.  Then the distance between the two lights moving together away from a near by star made it apparent.  But the distance between the lights did not alter, nor the -----   ___  stair like separation.  There was no sound, but it was not that close, I would say 10,000 ft up and quite a way off.  There was no blinking or other colors other than white, with a very faint hint of blue on the outside of the white lights.  They moved slowly, much too slowly for a plane, and the lights were about double the size of the nearby star, but brighter by a degree or so than any of the stars in the sky or in nearby Orion.  It moved very slowly from North To South for approximately 8 seconds and then seemed to dematerialize, or slowly dim and shut off.  It did NOT travel far enough to dim due to distance.  Not at all.  And for the last two weeks there has been persistent small aircraft, general aviation Cessna, circling and circling West Lake and points right around my house, like never before, and I am a flight sim buff and can recognize most aircraft.  I don&apos;t know if that has any connection to the lights, but o! ne thing did change.  The aircraft for the last two weeks circled DIRECTLY over my lake, in about a 5 sq. mile circle, approximately 5,000 ft of altitude, unusual for my area, because most general aviation aircraft, A.) are lower, ready to land, or having just taken off from North Perry Airport, 2.5 miles to the southeast of the lake, and B.) traffic slows to the airport after sunset, and after 9pm, I believe only has its facility operating with the tower unmanned.  It is unusual to see a Cessna type aircraft circling for so many hours, sometimes up to 4 hours, and ONLY after sunset.  I thought perhaps it was nighttime IFR training for student Pilots, but I am not sure, because tonight, that plane was about 2 miles further west, and cirlcing.  It circles clockwise for about an hour or so, and then reverses for a couple hours.  Tonight, right after the lights I saw, the craft switched its circular pattern, from Clockwise to Counter-Clockwise, AND it shifted directly over my house, and where I was laying, on a blanket, out in the yard, much closer to where the lights I had seen, had appeared.  The plane directly shifted, right after the lights.  And it stayed in this pattern for another hour or so.  It also shifted in the middle of that time, to the opposite heading, clockwise again.  I have no idea what to think of the plane, other than the lessons theory.  Unless it is an observer flight, or something?  I do not know what I saw, but it had no lights like a plane (no wings, nose, rudder shape), and was so slow, no plane could have stayed up in the sky, it would have stalled.  Furthermore there were no flashing lights and no colored lights.  The light was about twice the size of the star near it, but several times more bright.  And it was silent and moved in tandem, or was one body, with 2 lights.  And it evaporated, dimmed rapidly and was no more.", "orange/red teardrop looking with many bright lights object stopped before us above a field and then left.Witness one,  On Thursday march 20, 2008 my friend and I where on our way home at about 10:29p.m, when my friend saw an object in the sky to our right above a field, which to her appeared to be an airplane, Kidding with me she said, &quot;Look, a ufo .&quot;   I looked and the more we looked at it, it wasn&rsquo;t moving like an original airplane, it was stopped in the middle of the air.  As we watched it the object seemed to have a lot more lights then a usual aircraft. The lights looked as bright as the lights you would see at a pro baseball game shining down on the field.  The object in the air seemed to be square in the front, and that&rsquo;s where all the lights where as well as the back end that came to a point with a bright red light that was not blinking it was solid RED! Looking as if it was a  bottle cap from the side.  We sat there and watched this object for a good solid two minutes, but no longer.  As it flew about in the sky at a sharp angle with fast speed, my friend and I where so frightened of what we have seen we took off with no more words left to say.Witness two, Thursday March 20, 2008 around 10:30 p.m., my friend and I were driving on our way to her house. I was in the passengers seat and she was the driver. The road that we were traveling on t-boned onto a road we had to turn left onto at a stop sign, which would be going East. As we approached the stop sign, I saw bright lights sinking diagonally downward past a group of trees. Jokingly I screamed &quot;UFO&quot; just trying to scare my friend. We turned left at the stop sign heading East towards her house. I was staring ahead at the road and, from the corner of my eye, I saw the flying object we had seen before, over a field. I knew it was the same object because from the side it looked like the shape of a flattened cylinder, and the lights were extremely bright, it was as if I was staring at a stadium from a distance. The lights on this object were incredibly bright and , the lights flashed once but, they never flashed again. I told my friend to stop the car, and she put her hazards on. We sat in her car on the side of the road, for about two minutes watching this object, which had stopped in the sky above a field, to our right. The object was about the height of a water tower above the field, so we knew it couldn&rsquo;t have been an airplane because, airplanes don&rsquo;t usually fly that low to the ground. After about two minutes, the object started to move away in the same direction it came from, but it went diagonally up at a fast speed, in the almost exact same path it lowered in. As the object was going up, I saw a red light which was not blinking at all. Frightened, I told my friend to just put the car in drive and leave. I knew we couldn&rsquo;t have mistaken the object as a light from a city because, we were on back roads in the country and there aren&rsquo;t many tall lights like we saw around, in a field.", "Bright light moving in sky for about 3 seconds before burning out?Driving home from dinner, I looked up. A bright light caught my eye: slightly brighter than the two airplanes in the sky. The bright light moved fairly quickly: it covered about 15 degrees of arc in about 3 seconds. I saw a (much smaller) spark fly off of the light, then the spark faded out. The main light itself winked out while it was in the air. I heard nothing; I was in my car. I have no idea what it was. It seemed too fast for an airplane, but too slow for a meteorite.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I asked my brother to turn and look and he could not believe what he was seeing.It lasted for at least 10 seconds, maybe 15 seconds.The time was 10:04 pm on 3/5/2008 (Weds night).It appeared to be a round mass with a firetail, maybe a meteor?  Have there been any other reports of anything like this near Southport NC ?  Sincerely,  Two Fisherman", "V shaped object that flew from the north of phoenix and eventually right over phoenix 3/13/97I was sitting in my jacuzzi on the evening of March 13th, 1997.  It was sometime between 7:30 and 8:30 P.M..  My recliner seat in my jacuzzi at that time faced the north.  I could see planes coming in from the northwest every couple of minutes which I assume were coming in from Las Vegas and they still fly that same pattern today.  As I was looking what would be due north I notice 5 lights heading straight this way as if they were following I-17.  I was thinking I was going to see maybe the concord. The lights were not real high off the horizon when I noticed them.  I set an watched them coming in anticipation to see what they are.  At a distance they looked like they were in a straight line.  As they got closer they gained in altitude gradually and I could see a V formation.  There is a tree in the lot behind my house that they went behind for just a few seconds.  When they got on the south side of the tree I was amazed at how they had even gotten higher in the sky.  The lights never broke there V formation.  I could see that this was one object of an enormous size.  The lights flew directly over Phoenix while gaining altitude at an accerlerated speed.  I watch the lights along with my Mom and cousin Katy.  As the lights gained in speed and altitude the craft made a straight angle turn with no curve in its turn.  It was simply amazing.  I have seen footage over the years and only one  video showed the same object or one similiar to what we seen.  The lights that supposedly appeared down in south phoenix I do believe were flares.  The object I witnessed was flying and had no sound at all.  It is way to big for any aircraft that we as the general public no of.  I do not know much about the other lights in south phoenix but I wish they would debunk them and focus on the huge craft that actually flew from the north and over the city of phoenix.  I saw the video of the lights that were over Phoenix last night[4/22/08.  At first they resembled the lights I saw however the front light was not there and that video showed the lights moving towards and away from each other so I know it was not the same object I saw in 1997.  The object I witnessed had &quot;fixed&quot; lights on it and they looked the same in roundness from any direction you looked at them.  When I was a kid my brother and I have one other sighting I would like to talk or write about but at this time I would like to know more about the object that flew over ! Phoenix.", "OMG UFO&apos;s OMG!  We were camping!  A man ran up too us.  Do you want too see a UFO!  Yea sure where?  Right there! OMG!!  It was right there, up on the east side of the hill, right by our camp! The moon was coming up too! It went down behind the hill. It came back up. It went on. Minutes later, OMG here comes another one! Through the Binoc&apos;s, you could see the ships were see through! One after another kept coming in from the north east area too Lake Isabella!

So what I saw looking sideways,at this Giant ship, it reminded me of the long cigar! I seen on sighting etc! OMG they kept coming! The last Real big one, broke off into 2 other ships! My daughter at the time had the binoc! She said 2 I seen 4! This one ship broke off into diamond shaped ships. One headed west the other went behind the hill. OMG Only at 30 to 60 mile an hour! On our way home, behind the hill is a small town of people! Farmers! A women had told me that she heard about this, she said just this past week, some towns people seen UFO&apos;s! My husband is retired AF! You could see the stars through the ships! They didn&apos;t seem too care who saw the lights, it was so bright! my husband said they were in formation, like ready too attack! We have no pictures, no video.. didn&apos;t think of it! because we were so excited, and everyone was OMG! Look look... Absolutely no Wind, NO SOUND! You could make the outline of the Vshape! But you could see all the stars!! :) I can&apos;t sleep! Were home, I was sleeping, woke up! Thinking about my husband saying he had a dream about them taking his face off! Tonight I had a dream, he was right! weird! OH OH 3 mos ago, two were in my room! You know how I know! I was in a deep sleep! I woke while o! ne was putting something in my leg!

I tryed too get it out, which cuz it only too go into my skin!! who hoo! wonderful! Sorry we have no pictures! I&apos;m really worried about the town people that night! WTF!! sorry!", "The black object  flew at a  constant speed, high altitude, in an uncommon &amp; constantly changing flight path then vanished instantly.Today I witnessed a flying object that I definitely could not identify, it was unlike anything I had ever seen before. I am a 24 year old man, healthy, with perfect eyesight, and no history of mental illness of any type. I am not prone to exaggerations or having an overactive imagination. I served in the U.S. Army a few years back, and I do not drink or do any type of drugs, nor do I take any kind of medication. What follows is a detailed description of the object I saw this afternoon while sitting by the pool with my fiance. She did not see the object because her view was obstructed by some small shade trees surrounding the pool, also her eyesight is not that great, and by the time I told her what I was seeing, the object was seconds away from disappearing from sight.The object seemed to be flying at an extremely high altitude, making it appear extremely small and making it very difficult to discern it&apos;s actual shape and size. From my position on the ground it was like watching a tiny sugar ant! It appeared to be dark in color, probably black. The object appeared to be opaque, and it did not seem to reflect the sunlight or emanate any light of its own either. It moved in and out of the few clouds that were in the sky mostly at a constant speed, although it did seem to speed up somewhat as it left from view. The really odd thing is that it did not disappear from sight into the clouds, but rather just seemed to become invisible into a clear blue sky. There was very little cloud cover at the time, but I did see what appeared to be a very faint trail of vapor or exhaust trailing behind it. It flew in a very odd flight path that I&apos;ve never seen with airplanes, helicopters or birds. First it seemed to make a circular pattern, then a figure eight, followed by a straight line from left to right, and then back from right to left, it again made one or two circles, one more figure eight, and another circle, before simply disappearing into a cloudless patch of blue sky. Another thing that struck me as odd, and this my fiance did witness first hand too, is that there were several large black birds that flew above us just a short while before the object first came into view. They were flying towards us, in the opposite direction of where I saw the object. At first several of them were flying pretty high up, but they were still very clearly recognizable as birds. This is why I know for certain that the object I saw afterwards could not have been a bird, for one thing it was flying at an altitude that was much higher than any of the birds, who at one point were flying about as high as any birds I&apos;ve ever seen before, although later they flew above us again but at a much lower altitude. Also the flight path &amp; speed of the object was so completely different from  birds or any known ai! rcraft, at least in my experience.", "Cheveron craft over Tampa, FLThe object was chevron shaped.  There were 3 dim lights, one in front and one on the tip of each wing.  You could see the grayish outline of the craft as it flew over.  It made no sound and was moving quickly to the North East.  My dog looked up, which made me look up to see this thing flying over.  I would say the wing span was that of a DC-10 and was about 1,000 feet up.", "Cloud shield maker over Clay county FloridaMy wife and I had just finished lunch at some eatery on Fleming Island (Orange Park, FL) and were headed west on SR 220 (Clay county).I had just remarked at to what a beautiful day and as to how the sky was completely cloudless when I noticed a very small cloud (the only cloud) in the sky almost immediately straight ahead of us and about 45 degrees from the horizon.  The cloud, strangely enough, was almost square and about the size of my thumbnail when viewed at arms length.  I thought that to be quite odd, pointed it out to my wife and we both continued to look at it.As we watched, the cloud slowly dissipated, fading out completely and then amazingly reappeared in the same place in much the same shape and form.  My wife, not nearly as interested as I was, watched for a second and then something in her purse, perhaps her cell phone--I don&rsquo;t remember,   attracted her attention.  It was at that point that the cloud dissipated again and I saw what appeared to be a small gray craft, its features somewhat blurry and indistinct but squarish in feature.Look I said &quot;it&rsquo;s a UFO,&quot; but in the fraction of a second it took for my wife to look again it was gone.   Of course she didn&rsquo;t believe me.I would have submitted this report sooner but I just now found this site.   However the above report was written as soon as I got home that day - about an hour after the viewing.  I have not altered it since then.", "I saw an egg shped flying saucer in the sky at midnight, it was glowing in a green color. It flew so close to my house, I could see alien creatures waving at me from inside the craft! I also saw Jimmy Hoffa inside the craft, he was the pilot and on the rear of the egg was a teamsters bumpersticker.", "Two red lights seen over eastern ontario in the north/eastern direction of the sky.Myself and two friends were relaxing in the hot tub in my backyard and I was looking up at the sky, hoping to perhaps see a shooting star as I often do. After a good 4 minutes of just staring upwards, I saw two circular red lights appear out of thin air in the Northern part of the sky and they hovered shakingly for about 3 seconds.By that time I had yelled to the people who were with me and they quickly turned their attention to the direction that I had pointed. We all watched as the two lights moved across the sky from the North part of the sky all the way to the East part. The way they were moving was strange too, almost as if they were chasing one another. They moved in and out in a disarranged criss cross motion weaving in and out from each other, shaking and almost bending in shape.They reached the Eastern side of the sky in approximately 8 seconds, and they made no sound what so ever before they vanished as easily as they had appeared.", "I was driving down the road and saw a large egg shaped object that was dark in color. I was able to see it for around 15 seconds then some trees obstructed my view. It was too large to be a blimp. I tried looking for it again through clearings but I never saw it again. After that I saw some jets flying what seemed like an altitude of 30,000 ft or more in the air emitting vapor trails. The vapor trails made a sign in the shape of an arrow pointing east.", "white circular object falls in behind commercial liner-middle of daystanding outside facing east i was watching a plane approach that seemed to be heading west northwest towards charlotte douglas. as it approached my 1200 overhead position i noticed a white circular object on an intersecting course coming from the north towards south southwest. it appeared to be 1/2 the size of the commercial liner. for maybe 10secs i watched it approach, slow down, and fall in approx. 500 yards behind the plane. when this occurred-i grabbed my nextel and called my co-worker outside for a 2nd witness.  the dot sped up behind the plane and appeared to be persay weaving left/right behind the plane. my coworker saw the 2 from about 115degrees overhead to the 135degrees mark-at that point the object turned left(s.w.) and sped off. the plane continued on over charlotte douglas area. the sky was carolina blue clear with straight con/chemtrails creating borders here and there.  beautiful carolina day. height guess was prob. 28,000 to 30,000 feet.  this thing was at least 1/3 if not 1/2 the size of the plane with NO wings.", "Flash of light and loss of time  I was driving home from work on a long, dark stretch of hiway from Fairbanks Alaska to Eielson AFB.  About halfway home, there was a bright flash all around me.  Almost like a flash of a huge camera going off.  Right after the flash, everything in my car started to die slowly.  The lights went out, the radio stopped working and eventually the car died completely.  My first thought was a battery problem.  The next thing I remember was the car starting up again on it&apos;s own and everything working as before.  I drove on home, (there were no cell phones back then), thinking it had only been a few seconds.  I was completely shocked when I arrived at our house in military housing to find out that I had lost an hour and 20 minutes.  I have absolutely no memory of what happened during that time.Ever since that incident, I have had many medical issues and severe back problems.  Doctors always ask me if I&apos;ve had an injury.My husband and I have been married 32 years and have seen many UFO&apos;s in our travels across the US.  The largest one was in Wasilla, Alaska, somewhere around 1993/1994.  It was about the length of 3 football fields.  Several cars were stopped along the road watching it and it was reported in the paper the next day.  Even state troopers reported seeing it.After that sighting, my husband began having vivid dreams.  We found out about 5 years ago that my husbands blood type changed.  He&apos;d been typed in High School and throughout his Military Career as type O+.  He had a physical 5 years ago and was typed A+.  The doctors thought there was a mistake and sent him to the hospital to be re-typed.  Although all his previous records showed O+, he is now A+ as confirmed by three seperate doctors.We have a firm belief in UFO&apos;s and watch every show on television about them.  The dreams, for mly husband still continue.  Mine have stopped for now, but we still see many UFO&apos;s, some just lights and some we can see the entire body of the ship.I haven&apos;t reported any of this before because of fear of reprisal((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

No sound at all.Description by witness narrative: I  wasn&rsquo;t going to report this until I saw that someone else from this exact same city experienced something similar just two months ago.  So,I decided to also write a report since there must obviously be something going on here that is unexplained and I would like answers.  Earlier this morning (Sunday Jan. 20th, 2008) at approximately 5:58 AM I decided to look out my front door to see if the ground was covered with ice( we had a lot of rain last evening and freezing temperatures overnight) , and as I was looking out the front door I noticed something completely strange to my left.  It was floating above the tree line across from a field approximately &frac12; mile from my front door. The lights were pulsating from red to orange (similar to flames from a forest fire) as this thing or craft was slowly receding behind the tree line behind the open field &quot;  &quot;It seemed to have three large lights from the side I was seeing. And judging from the neighbor&rsquo;s house down the road and the distance this craft was from their home and ours, it had to be at least the size of 4 or 5 homes combined, possibly even larger. A truly amazing sight and a camera was the last thing on my mind.&quot;Anyway, I couldn&rsquo;t believe what I was seeing, so I went to wake my wife up to verify what I was seeing. She quickly awoke when I told her that she had to see something that was going to blow her mind. I was hoping this thing wouldn&rsquo;t be gone before we made it back to the front door. When we both got to the front door it was still there and was now half way down behind the tree line. My wife said, &quot;Oh my God, what is that?&quot;   We both looked at it in awe as it descended behind the trees and seemed to have landed.The area it seemed to have landed in is near a creek in a swampy area.  In a place people wouldn&rsquo;t  normally go or have good access to. All I could think is why would someone or something be landing there.&quot;My wife and I stared in the direction for nearly an hour to see if it was going to fly away. She described it as being similar to the sun going down behind the trees due to the brightness it displayed and the red and orange colors, but this definitely wasn&rsquo;t the sun, it was only 5:58 AM and was in the north west during the dark of night. She was only able to see the top half of the object and the lights as it was already landing as I awoke her. We both couldn&rsquo;t believe what we had just seen. This definitely was like nothing I had ever seen, especially this close to our own home.. I must mention that I am prior military (US. Army Veteran) and I am very observant and have an IQ of 138. This definitely didn&rsquo;t seem like any modern day aircraft that our military would have and even if it were, why would they land in the middle of the swampy creek area at 5:58 AM on a Sunday morning?  As far as the shape of the craft, it seemed to be an oval shape and had no sound at all as we stepped out the front door to listen as it was landing. Another thing that was real odd was that this is in a suburban neighborhood with lots of yard animals and none of the dogs were barking at all and the air was dead silent&rdquo;.&quot;As big as the object was and as bright as the lights were, we were expecting to at least hear the neighborhood dogs barking, but none were.&quot;:After waiting on the front porch of our home for close to an hour with blankets to keep warm, we finally decided to go back into the house. We were hoping this craft would come back up from the wooded area and would show itself once again while leaving, but it never did. And no, I don&rsquo;t plan on going in that area of the woods and swamp to see it close up either. I will be keeping a guarded eye on that area for the next few nights and even months to see if anything else happens there.&quot;&quot;All I can say about this is that we&rsquo;re definitely not alone and these things are making themselves known. I&rsquo;m just wondering why they aren&rsquo;t trying to communicate more clearly if they are superior life forces. It&#x5C; almost feels as though we are like the ants living in the ant farm and they just observe us when they want to. A little food for thought there.&quot;&quot;Anyway, thanks for allowing me to vent about this here, because I surely can&rsquo;t tell me friends(sic) about this. I&rsquo;m not sure how they would take it.&quot;END OF ORIGINAL REPORT!  Upon receiving the permission of Mr. Peter Davenport to investigate this sighting report he sent this Field Investigator for MUFON the witness contact information.I contacted the witness by phone and set up an appointment at his home for January 31st, 2008 at 3PM.The primary witness is  married with two children, a boy  and a girl . He owns his own business. His wife  works at a local business. Their residence was very clean and modern.  East Dublin, Ga. is a very clean and prosperous appearing town located in Laurens County, Ga. long: w 82.9 and lat: n 32.5.This FI arrived at the witness&rsquo; address at 1PM on 1/31/08  and spent the next hour scouting the area of the sighting and getting the lay-out of the community/neighborhood surrounding the residence. Moving West past the residence on the road they live , on the right side of the road at approximately 100 feet distance from witness&apos;s driveway is a high-end subdivision  made up of approximately 1 acre parcels with large ,modern homes which are located in an open, spacious property with a view across its expanse of approximately &frac12; mile in most directions. The road upon which the witness lives dead ends 1.10 miles into another road that runs in a South to North direction.  100 yards to the North on this road is a Georgia Power Company grid line of tall electrical towers. On the South side of this road the grid can be seen running at the foot of a long ridge (hill) approximately 250 to 300 feet high in a South to North direction. This power line grid crosses over this road in a  Eastern direction where a creek crosses under the roadway at a bridge and the creek and the grid together runs into and through a swampy, mixed forest area of several 100&rsquo;s of acres. The creek has created a boggy, wet-land area and there are no roads, paths, or other entrances into this location, which is the direction of the witness&rsquo; sighting from his residence of 1.10 miles from of the creek. Heading back East on the witness&rsquo; road I went to the junction with another Georgia highway and headed North for 3 &frac12; miles. This road led me to a power substation in 2 miles from the resident&rsquo;s road. I also noticed the other side of the ridge and swampy wet-land with several tree farms and cotton fields for the 3 &frac12; miles.Back at the residence, directly in front of it is a tree farm . This appeared to have a road that runs around the North border of the subdivision but aerial maps indicate that it does not run far enough around to give access to the presumed landing area and falls short at least  &frac34; of a mile from it, ending in the forest  behind the subdivision. Another road West of residence of witness does give access through a home owner&rsquo;s property, but the witness is reluctant for them to be contacted at this time. Leaving the neighborhood I drove back into East Dublin business district and decided to have lunch at a very small, one room restaurant . I enquired of the owner if he had heard of any UFO sightings. He had not. I arrived at the witness&rsquo; residence at 3PM. He was warm and friendly but was still plenty excited about what he and his wife had witnessed the morning of 1/20/08 and began immediately showing me the area and recapping the event. Inside the home I conducted an interview and at first brought up the issue of the time of the sighting at 05:58 AM mentioned several times in the original report, inquiring  as to what he was doing up at that time of morning after a cold, rainy, stormy night, on a day most would &quot;sleep in.&quot; The witness stated he arose to check for &quot;snow&quot; as the local weather provider had said it was a possibility that night and he wanted to show it to the family. This FI having checked the weather report, etc. before my interview, indicating according to the U.S. Naval Observatory Astronomical Department as follows: For the East Dublin area 1/20/08 @ 04:21 AM EST- winds had been out of the NW with gusts up to 20 MPH. There had been rain/sleet over the area for several hours: humidity averaged 81 % .  A severe weather system with lots of lighting activity had moved across Georgia the evening of 1/19/08 and on into 1/20/08. Temperature averaged around 47* F. No snow recorded in the area. But witness indicated there was ice everywhere 1/20/08 Sunrise 1/20/08 was @ 7:32AM/ EST. The Moon was waxing  Gibeous with a (95% disk surface showing/ illuminated and was 2 days before full which set at the &quot;exact&quot; time of 05:58 AM that morning 1/20/08(Thanks to MUFON ASD GA. MARK AUSMUS for exact moon charts) Charts on file. Witness said the sky was clear at the time of the sighting. Please note that the lack of animal activity (barking of dogs) that the witness originally reported as unusual does not seem to this FI to be in anyway connected to the sighting as most family yard dogs would be bedded down after such a weather system that lasted around 12 hours  and 2 hours before sunrise. Nothing appears unusual of this time frame(at this time) and the witness remembers seeing the exact time of 05:58 AM on the DVD player near the front door from which the sighting took place, which he showed me.The witness had viewed the object as he looked out of the decorative glass, front door panel, noticed the lights and opened the door. Recapping ( again) the sighting as recorded in the original report to NUFORC, I had the witness go over the statement about the size estimate . I discovered that what he actually saw were 3 large, bright red/orange lights encapsulated inside a half &quot;dome&quot; shape, rounded part to the top, and the 3 lights were inside, tapered back from the bottom to the top as if they were  3 panels of light. The panels of light appeared &quot;fire like&quot; the sun, rather than pulsating. Estimating the size of the object by the witness was based on a neighbors house approximately &frac14; mile West on his road. I had him do a measure at arms length exercise and we determined the object to be 1 &frac12; inches to 2 inches at arms length. This FI using www.ufotools.com their website calculations estimated the size at a ground distance of approx. 5000ft.(1524 m) at an angle of elevation 10 degress based on the terrain lay-out from the witness&rsquo; front porch at eye level. The estimated length of the object at the base of the &frac12;  dome was approx.93.624 ft.(28 m). The altitude estimate was 882 ft (269m). FYI/ this FI is comfortable with the distant from the witness calculation of 93 ft. due to the fact the object could have been as close as &frac12; mile and as far as 1 mile due to the angle in which it was viewed across various landscape/terrain. There was no way to get an exact measurement from either side of the objects landing area. One being a neighbor&rsquo;s yard that the witness didn&rsquo;t want me to contact and the inaccessible swamp on the  other .The entire time period of the actual event was 7 to 8 minutes.Google maps of the location will follow at a later date. Next the witness took me outside to show the exact location ( again) where he saw the object and where his wife joined him on the porch. The direction was North, North West,  as originally reported. It was NNW across the open area over the subdivision at approximately 3/4/ to 1 mile (approx. 5000ft) distance according to my compass readings and previous drive through observations. If the object had been floating down behind the ridge line off the other road north of the location, it would not have lit up the trees, like the witness stated to this FI, and it did light up trees located closer to a small pond located on the North West side of the subdivision. It appeared to come down behind the silhouette of one specific, large pine tree near the pond about &frac14; mile away but the distance  of the object was probably closer to a 3/4  to 1 mile away in the swamp land. The witness stated that the object maneuvered &quot;blimp like,&quot; moving very slowly and drifting down from about an 80 degree flat , right to left angle above the large pine tree and there was sky line well below the object estimated at about 100 to 150 feet above the large pine tree. Again, I wish to emphasize, as this FI viewed the exact angle of the object&rsquo;s dissent seen by the witness, it would have had to go down in front of the ridge line located on  the  other road to the West , not behind it. Again, this ridge is  approx. 1.5 miles from the residence and an astronomical object would have went down behind the ridge.That would put the object going down into the swamp off the Western border road.I next spoke to the second witness, the wife, by phone at her place of business and her description was as the original report, but reiterated that &quot;It looked like the Sun going down at Sunset.&quot;I asked if she had noticed anything unusual since the sighting. She stated that their house lights had been surging up and down over that day and a few days following. At this phone interview (on speaker phone) her husband recalled with her that the automatic, dawn to dusk, mercury vapor light in the driveway had gone out as well during that time and had not come back on. This driveway light has sense been repaired and both bulb and sensor had to be replaced. The witness also remembered at this time that he had been having all the rechargeable batteries in their cell phones, remote keyboard to his business computer and the children&rsquo;s electronic toys in his home office being drained of their charges. He would charge them up and next day they would be discharged. This FI after returning to Savannah discovered that my brand new camera&rsquo;s batteries were completely drained and I had put new ones in that morning before leaving for East Dublin. Coincidence? Maybe! Witness had also noticed an  intermittent  humming sensation/noise  in his and his wife&rsquo;s ears for 3 weeks after the sighting.I had the witness file a formal complaint with the Georgia Power Company and at first the customer service representative said that they are not able to look up  previous  power problems. Instead they did a new report on the fact that witness was experiencing humming noise and &quot;possible power surges sense the 19th-20th through the end of January 08. No mention was made of the battery drainage to Georgia Power Company. A Ga. Power technician was dispatched to the residence that day. The witness inquired if they could explain the humming sensations and the power fluctuations, or any other problems for that time period.  The Technician&rsquo;s log book indicated that 2 power sub-stations went out between January 20th and 21st, in the area. He unlocked the house&rsquo;s power meter and did a few tests inside the meter ands stated it was working fine. The humming noise was not detected and the technician could only say that what had been happening must have been caused by the 2 downed sub-stations . The  GP Technician could give no explaination for the substations failures. At this writing the only problem electrically , seems to be the continual drain of freshly charged batteries in the home. This FI nor the witness can figure this out at this time. This FI first speculated that the witnesses may have seen the &quot;Moon set&quot; as it did in fact set at exactly the same moment the object seemed to land in the swamp. However, the Moon set in a wooded area directly &quot;behind&quot; the residence and was about 90 degrees in the opposite direction in the West South Westerly location at the time of the sighting.The witness stated that the object never rose up after 1 hour . After approximately 30 minutes of waiting for the object to rise , a meteor, which the witness described as normal except that it was very short in duration with only a very short trajectory of about 1 to 2 inches at arms length appearing. They speculated that they felt it was connected in some way with the object. This FI does not. As the witness&rsquo; children arrived from school on the day of the interview/investigation, he introduced me to them and I interviewed them briefly. They had not seen anything, but knew all about the details. The  daughter had had a &quot;nightmare&quot; about seeing the lights similar to what her parent&rsquo;s had described and had drawn a picture (on file) of the object. She slept with her parent&rsquo;s that night.This FI does not believe this was a &quot;recall&quot; experience by the child but simply that this incident has impacted this family in a stressful and negative way. The witness claims to have a high IQ and so does his  son. The witness has been troubled over the fact that he cannot reconcile what he saw with what he knows to be normal and logical, He has stated to this FI that it affected him as he has become protective and concerned for the families safety more than usual.This FI believes  the daughter has seen and heard her parent&rsquo;s attempts to explain the incident and became fearful.  I told the witness to consider playing down the incident to help his daughter overcome her initial fears. He agreed. This FI has 35 years experience as a professional clinical counselor and 27 years as a Christian Pastor and I can say with some certain knowledge that the witnesses (husband &amp; wife) have experienced something that has disturbed their normal life in a dramatic way and this disturbance has spilled over to their children. I have checked back once per week with the witness as of this writing and they are still trying to figure out what they saw. UFO TOOLS website gives this case with the evidence available at a 57.5% reliability, strangeness 14.29%, info quality 10%, certainty 00.82% Valle classification is FB1 possibly FB2 considering the electrical circumstantial evidence.The probability of the object being a plasma ball  over  the power grid would be highly likely except for the fact that it was first seen moving 100 to 150 feet above the tree line that hides the grid line from line of sight from the witness&rsquo; front porch. Along with the appearance of being a &quot;dome or half a circle/sphere with lighted panels , this probability is slim . This FI contacted FI Brion Trainor/ a retired electrical engineer and team member of MUFONGA/ Coastal Georgia and he advised that due to the altitude the object was first seen and it&rsquo;s coloration , that indeed, a plasma ball was very unlikely.This FI also personally spoke with all 3 departments of Law Enforcement in Laurens County. East Dublin PD, Dublin PD and Laurens County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department. None have received any UFO or unusual  aeriel  phenomenon reports as far back as memory serves them. I spoke either to the Chiefs or their Ranking officers and they were very cooperative and want to be contacted in the future regarding any such report and will contact this FI should they receive reports of this nature in their respected departments.Also this FI has contacted a newspaper reporter to look into any media for that area that may have received reports for the sighting&rsquo;s time frame of 1/20/08. Any information forth coming will be posted as received.FYI/ The witness mentioned the reason he made the report was because of another sighting in East Dublin 2 months prior. This incident also was reported to NUFORC on 11/26/2007. The report is similar at first examination and I can see why this witness of 1/20/08 was prompted to file his report.It was unfortunate that this FI was unable to gain access to the swampy area where the object went down to check for traces of its presence. However, due to the overall evidence of the circumstances and the insistence of the witness to remain anonymous, and the consistency of the testimonies and the adverse affect it had on the them and their children, I conclude at this time that this case should be classified &quot;unknown.&quot; However, this case will remain open for this FI and contact with these witnesses will continue until I am personally satisfied they have some closure.David I. Marchant Sr. /ASD/MUFONGA/ COASTAL AREA March 31, 2008", "Bright multicolored lightWhat at first appeared to be a VERY bright star to the West of Incline Village, approximately over Kings Beach area.  Just above the tree line.  The light alternated in color between white, red, blue, and green as if a light was shining through a prism. When viewed through binoculars the formation of the light was changing and at times took on a triangular shape with a line of each color (red, blue, and green) making up each side of the triangle. The light remained stationary in the sky and very bright for about 20 minutes then dimmed and became much lower in the sky (even with an electrical pole from the second story porch) for about ten minutes before it was no longer visible. The rate of descent was much greater than the movement of the stars in the sky which remained more or less stationary in relation to us and the light during the time the light changed positions. However, the rate of movement was not significant enough that you could really tell it was moving if you were not already watching it. We thought it was Venus or Mars at first but this light was much too bright to be either planet. It also seemed to have an aura and extending rays in variations of the contingent colors at times. The closest analog I can think of is the glint of a prism.((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of the star, Sirius??

On my way i see what looks to be a blue light flash across the high way.  Even though it was foggy you could not miss it, it was half a mile away but high enough to fly over the grain silos that were off in the distance.

To my right in the field I saw 3 bright, white lights moving across the field, at least a 1/2 to 3/4 mile apart from each other looking like they were searching for something, scanning back and forth, and as I drove along the road watching them, the lights were always pointed in  my direction as a drove the probably 10-15 miles stretch along the field.

He and another man drove out to where the light was, watched it from the top of a hill moving from animal to animal moving along searching for something.  They drove down without their headlights on to sneak up on the poacher, but when they got to where the light was, there was no truck or 4wheeler or anything, the light was coming from above.

It moved at a steady, unchanging pace across the sky for about a minute before it was joined by a second light behind it.

Upon examination of other aircraft flying in the area I could see that this was much too high to be a light on top of any pole.  What was floating was about three times as high as any other aircraft in the sky was and about three times as bright as anything else in the sky also.I had my boyfriend look at the object.  He agreed that it was unlike anything else in the sky (and he wants to be a pilot so trust me he knows what should be in the sky).  It did not twinkle like stars nor did it move like a plane, and again because of its position in the sky and the area we live in we knew that there are absolutely no polls around that are that high in the sky.Upon us moving closer in the direction of the light it actually began to descend if you will.  While not moving forward or backwards it was dropping altitude.  Once it was just above tree level (below all other aircraft in the sky) it began moving forward (we were heading east on the highway so forward for the craft was southwest).  As it went over our truck (which had a sun roof so we were literally right under it!!!) we noticed what appeared to be a triangular shape with lights along the outer back points of the triangle (on the sides and bottom).  These lights on the wings (if we can call them that because they were attached to the body and not like airplane wings) flashed on both sides at the same time.  They were a band of lights that flashed simultaneously on both sides alternating red and the blue/green color from front to back.Also on the underside, located where a cabin might be for someone to fly the craft or the landing gear might be was three circular lights, like spot lights, that were giving off the glow.  There was absolutely no light coming from inside the craft.  These lights would have been in the way of any landing gear, so we could not understand how this craft could be a plane and land.  These lights were pointing down at the ground! Not in the direction the craft was going!! There was absolutely no directional light!! The lights were allowing the craft to see the ground perfectly but did not emit a beam glow down towards the ground but rather a glow around the object.Once the object did start to move and travel over our vehicle, it moved at a steady  pace, yet quick enough to remain uncatchable by our vehicle upon turning around.I am a 24 year old property tax consultant and my boyfriend is a 22 year old aspiring pilot.  In our free time we like to observe the stars and planets as well as go to the local airports to watch plane come and go all day.

The rest of the sky was cloudless and blue from the 12 o&apos;clock position to about 3 o&apos;clock. From 3 o&apos;clock there were houses on the near hill side, and finally down to the 4 o&apos;clock position was the roof of the next door neighbors home that was about 50 feet away. I was looking south.From behind one of the houses on the hill, appeared first one colored light, then several more. They were moving in a group of about a dozen lights, evenly spaced. Each light, was a different color. Each light being about the size of a pencil eraser end at arms length. The group was about the size of a soccer ball held at arms length. The lights didn&apos;t blink, the colors they were, remained steady. Orange, green, red, and one or two almost white. They were moving from the south to the north.I watched in silent amazement. The group moved across the blue sky, then behind some of the elm leaves and again they appeared in a patch of blue sky and then disappeared behind more leaves and were gone.During the 50&apos;s planes made noise.........a lot of noise.  We were directly under the flight path of four engine planes flying to Boston&apos;s Logan airport 60 miles to the northeast.  You not only heard the planes go by, but you felt them.  The noise would vibrate though you.  There was no traffic in the nearby street at the time I was watching the lights only a few birds chirping here and there.  It was this thought that filled me with fear.  What I had just witnessed passed by without a single sound, nothing!   As the fear built up in me, crying I ran down the stairs to tell my mother.  I think she thought I was putting on a performance, to be let out.  She comforted me, and sent me outside.  I didn&apos;t want to go, but she insisted.  I then sat on the porch, looking up at the sky thinking about what I had just seen.", "Did anyone else see thisMAR-24-2008 Around 5:38 pm today I was driving home when I noticed two airplanes flying fairly close to each other. I believe they where commercial liners, but I am not positive on that. While I was watching them, and trying to figure out why they were so close to each other, I saw a saucer shaped object suddenly appear to the south of them. The planes were flying west to east. I was driving east to west, so they were coming at me in clear sight. The object that I saw was hovering. Since the planes where moving, it was very clear that the saucer shaped object was sitting still. It remained in the same position for about ten seconds then disappeared in an instant (while I was looking at it) without a trace. At that point the planes sped up to a much faster speed then they where flying at before the object appeared.  This was in no way possible a reflection or gas vapors exploding from the sun. I saw a unidentified-flying-object - U.F.O", "Me and 2 others saw 15-20 saucer like objects that had a dim orange glow.Me and 2 of my friends were in front of my house talking and joking around when at the corner of my eye I saw movement. At that moment I thought maybe it was a shooting star, but then I saw whatever it was come back. Then I realized it wasn&rsquo;t a shooting star. I pointed at it, and told my friends &ldquo;what the f*** is that&hellip; Holy sh*t&rdquo;. We just gazed at it for about 15 seconds, just perplexed. We tried to make sense of it, saying its birds. But birds don&rsquo;t glow orange at night. We realized we&rsquo;ve seen something incredible, unbelievable and eerie at the same time. Gave me chills. There were somewhere between 15 and 20 saucer like objects with bulges in the center and they had a dim orange glow. The objects were south of us when we saw them.  It was very unnatural how they moved. They were staying still, then moving together at the same time, and somehow :swarming.&quot;  I&rsquo;m not really sure how they left, they just kind of disappeared. This happened somewhere between 7:20pm and 7:30pm on March 8, 2008.I&rsquo;m sending an image I created through email.

My perception was that it was very low, just above the tree tops, and about the size of a dinner plate.  It traveled very fast -- so fast that it appeared to have a light &quot;tail.&quot;  There was no sound.  At first I thought it was a meteorite but the travel was horizontal, west to east, and it was too big.  A meteor that big and low would have crashed somewhere close.  This was in the north Naples, FL area and the whole thing lasted about three seconds.  I don&apos;t scare easily but this really freaked me out!  I would be interested to know if anyone else saw anything.", "Saucer seen in the San Gabriel ValleyI recently found this site and decided to post my sighting. This was a very long time ago, and I was rather young, so the details are somewhat hazy.  I remember seeing the craft while out trick-or-treating with some of my friends. We stopped at my friends house down the street and we were standing in his front yard talking, when one of my friends said &quot;What is that?&quot; and pointed to the north/northwest.  We looked at it for a little bit, and lost interest (being kids, and all). I remember the object being very distinct, and I remember that it was floating stationary.   It had a metallic look to it, and there was no noise whatsoever.  I felt very awkward about the whole situation, and I never really spoke about it until years later.  My friends and I never spoke of it again, and I have not asked them about it.  It felt so surreal that I almost immediately assumed I was seeing things, or that someone was playing a prank on me. But when I look back on it, it is very hazy, and I cannot explain a lot of the time immediately after the sighting. If anyone has any information on this, I would love to hear about it.((NUFORC Note:  Year of the sighting may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

My son and I had just left our home to go get gas in the car for a trip that we were going on the next day. as we were driving something caught my eye in the sky.  I looked up and saw a silver glow in the sky.  It was  shaped like a butane tank but maybe the size of three traincars.  It was just over the tree line. I slowed down and pulled over. and then like a shot it went stright up and turn to the west and was gone. I looked over at my son and asked if he had seen that. He said woo mom what was that thing.  He was 18 at the time.  I am a nurse and my husband at the time worked for nasa. so when we got back home I asked him if there were any test or flights that he new of for that night. He said no but after telling him what we had seen, he made a call to nasa to see.

We were doing some routine work when I looked up towards the west and noticed a very bright white light moving very slowly from north to south. Normally I wouldn&rsquo;t get excited about a &quot;light in the sky,&quot; but this particular light started out very dim, in fact the reason it caught my eye is because I thought it was a satellite, however that soon changed when it seemed to morph into a huge bright light about 10 times as bright and then back down to its original size. It did this several times before fading down to a pinpoint and then just like a light switch, poof it was gone!", "thing s were stolen by an unknown identitywell it started out a normal day at school.

The first sighting was around 20:00 TO 21:00.  The first time was just after sunset, thought it couldve been the reflection of the sun on an airplane.  The color was bright oarange/red, very strange.  The flight path was odd as it climbed quickly and soon was out of sight.  My wife was witness to this 1st sighting.  The second sighting was the same color, same sort of light and shape.  The light was in the same place as the 1st time, which made me again think it couldve been a plane taking off from Tampa Intl Airport or St. Pete Clearwater, but it was too high to be St Pete Clearwater.  The light again disappeared into the sky.  I am not sure what I saw, but if others saw something thing strange than so be it.  I should also mention that this was in the general direction of Mcdill AFB.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I ran inside to get my 8mm camcorder, and filmed it just over my house.  I am currently trying to figure out how to get it off 8mm and on too my computer so I can submit it.  Upon review of the tape, towards the end of the film the smaller craft, takes off at a right angle and disappears.  I did not see this with my bare eyes. Then something else shoots from left to right of the screen next from the bigger bright orb. I could not identify what it was.

I do/did not believe in UFO&apos;s. I have never done drugs or drank, not even coffee.  My friend was with me, she hasn&apos;t done anything like that either. We&apos;re both Freshman at a private University in Idaho.Anyways, my roommate and I went to DQ for some ice cream at about 22:00. When we got back to the women&apos;s dorm&apos;s parking lot, (22:40) I jumped out of her van to move my car to a different spot. She was still parking her van when I got done. She and I both took astronomy during summer 2007. While I was waiting for her to park her car I looked up at the sky to see if I could remember the names of the constellations. It was a crystal clear night. I was looking westward. Out of the corner of my eye (south) I saw something moving in the sky. It was moving slowly. I thought maybe it was clouds or the Milky Way. Then I looked at it. It was a black, slightly grey color, which made it hard to see unless you were already looking at the sky. I thought it was part of the sky but I realized it was a distinct object. It was gliding northward. It was very high up in the sky, at about where planes would fly or a little higher. It was huge, as in if you would land it, it would have been gigantic! It definitely wasn&rsquo;t as small as an airplane would be when you see one in the sky. It didn&rsquo;t have any lights on it at all which is why I kept looking at it. I&rsquo;ve never seen an aircraft fly without lights. There seemed to be a little blur around it.  My mind couldn&rsquo;t make sense of what that was around it. Usually when that happens, something weird&rsquo;s going on. To me it looked like a dragon, but without any arms or legs. It was kind of squarer at the front and gradually got thinner, kind of like a triangle but it didn&rsquo;t look like a triangle. I drew a picture for one of my other roommates. She said it kind of looks like the shape of a whale to her. I thought it was a dragon, which I don&rsquo;t believe in either. When my roommate got out of her van, I ran over to her and told her to tell me what that was. We couldn&rsquo;t figure it out. She thought maybe it was a flock of birds, but it was too high up for birds to fly. We listened closely to see if we could hear it making a noise, but we couldn&rsquo;t hear anything. We had no idea what it was. We&rsquo;d ! never se en any aircraft like it before. It was a definite object, I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to tell you what it was made of, since it was dark outside, and the object itself was black. I would guess metal, but it was so smooth. It didn&rsquo;t leave behind any exhaust or anything. We watched it until it got further away so we couldn&rsquo;t really see it anymore.", "Triangle craft  positioned over Winslow, AZ for 30-40 minutesAt approximately 21:50 on March 26, 1997, I left home with my mother to drop some items off to some friends at the Pilot travel center in the north part of Winslow (1/8 of a mile, perhaps, north of I-40), at the I-40 and North Park Drive interchange. It didn&apos;t take long for us to drive from home, to the travel center, for me to run back and get back out to the car park. I think it was probably about 22:15 when we were leaving the travel center parking lot. As we were driving toward the traffic lights at the interchange, my mother had asked me what that streak across the sky was, and the object that was hovering high above the town. I had to squint hard to see it at that time, and at first dismissed it as Venus, as the twinkling colours looked the same. Then I realised that Venus was in the opposite (Eastern) part of the sky!  We drove down North Park Drive to Aspinwall Street, and had nearly a dozen blocks to go before we arrived home. As we drove west down Aspinwall Street, the object started to become larger. Two blocks from home, it was apparent that this craft was waiting for us at the end of the street (it&apos;s a dead-end). At the same time, on the same block, my aunt&apos;s boyfriend was outside their home throwing out the rubbish and spotted this craft. The craft was shaped like a equilateral triangle, silver in colour. The strangest part was it looked only like an outline of a triangle. It moved up and down, side to side, in a very quick manner. Like a helicopter, but with a million times more precision and speed. Its maneuvers were amazing-- I had never seen anything like it. The craft was riddled with several lights along the &apos;outline&apos; of the triangle. They were mostly white, but would periodically change from white, to red and then to blue. As it moved, there was a sort of red and blue aura around it, and there were trails coming from these lights. My mother drove the car to the very end of West Aspinwall Street. That area of the street is a dead end, blocked by a large hill. On the north side at the end of W. Aspinwall street, there is rather large empty field. My mother drove to the empty field and turned off the car lights, as well as the engine. I had her roll down the window. The craft was probably 150-200 feet above us (rough estimation), a bit to the west (above the hill). It&apos;s hard to tell the size of the craft; I&apos;d say if I extended my arm all the way out, and made a fist, the sides of the craft would have been visible by about three inches or so. I&apos;m not keen when it comes to distance measurements, so I could be off on how far up the craft was in the sky. There was absolutely no noise coming from the craft. My mother started the car again, and we started to drive through the field. This is where I got very alarmed-- if our car was moving, it would move with us. If my mother would stop the car, it would stop its movements. My mother was trying to convince me to run in the house and grab a video camera, and my 35mm camera. There was no way I was getting out of that car! I urged her to drive back to the busy travel center we had just left from, as I felt safer there, amongst many people. We drove back to the travel center and stayed in the car park and watched the craft hover, but slowly ascend until it was a small speck in the sky, then we saw it dart off to the west at an alarming rate of speed. After it dashed off, it was no longer visible. This sighting, coincidentally, occurred on the same night as the Heaven&apos;s Gate suicide in the San Diego, Ca. area. We had arrived home around 23:00, just in time for Nightline (Ted Koppel). The feature story was on the mass suicide and the whole story involving the Hale Bopp comet. I honestly don&apos;t believe these two incidents were connected. They just happened to occur on the same night. The following evening, my mother and I went to my aunt&apos;s house (she lived two blocks east of us). Her boyfriend kept asking us if we had gone out the previous night, and definitely  beat around the bush regarding what he saw. He wouldn&apos;t come out and say it-- he wanted to know if we had seen anything. When we both confirmed that there was something in the sky, he showed me the drawings he made and description he wrote out. It was the same exact thing we saw. At the time of the sighting, I was working for the local newspaper as an editorial assistant and photographer. I didn&apos;t report this to any local authorities, nor did I mention the incident to anyone I worked with, although the newspaper&apos;s editor did mention a rash of phone calls that came in to the local police department. Additionally, one of the local police officers had come into my mother&apos;s hair salon for a haircut, and had mentioned to my aunt (his hairdresser; same aunt I previously mentioned, whose boyfriend saw the craft at the end of our street) that approximately two dozen reports had been made that night. It was then that she told the officer what her boyfriend saw. My mother and I heard from friends that there were sightings of the same craft the following night, in the Camp Verde/Cottonwood/Clarkdale area of Arizona.", "8 orange lights in the northern sky of wabash indiana dissapeared within 5 min. no noisesaw 8 lights in a row with orange glow in the sky pulled over to observe and they disappeared one at a time. no noise((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I noticed these two bright headlights above the tree tops, and I thought what are they?  It just couldn&rsquo;t be a plane or a helicopter. Well, I stopped my car and was watching the lights between the branches of the tree.  I was just looking to see how fast this thing was moving.  Well, it wasn&rsquo;t moving very fast, it was just slowly gliding.  I then started to drive a little bit further, and the lights stopped moving forward. I thought, what the heck is going on?  I stopped my car and the lights came toward us, above the car, closer. My 16 year old, who was sitting in the passenger seat, said, &ldquo;Mom, let&rsquo;s go, it&rsquo;s just a plane!&rdquo;  At that time I ended my conversation with my mom and focused on the lights, my son, did the same.

Well, it didn&rsquo;t take me long to put my foot on the gas and tear up our driveway.  I was NEVER so scared in my life.  I quickly called the house, because my boyfriend was home, to tell him to meet me downstairs.  I was crying and very scared for some reason.

It occurred during their childhood in rural Neshoba County, Mississippi.  Both are Air Force veterans and solid citizens.  I have absolutely no reason to doubt their word. According to the observers (who are twin boys), they were about seven or eight years old, and out of school for the summer.  The rural mail carrier delivered the mail to their home somewhat near the end of his route, and usually arrived after 3:00 p.m.  Their home was located approximately 100 yards up a gravel driveway from the main roadway, also a gravel road at the time.  The twins heard the mailman approach the mailbox, stop, and then accelerate off to the next home down the road.  They asked their mother if they could go down to the mailbox and get the mail.  She allowed them to go. They walked the 100 yards or so down to the mailbox, retrieved the mail and headed back towards the house.  When they were approximately half way up the drive (50 yards from their home), my great-aunt began yelling for them to &quot;run, run!&quot; in an urgent tone.  They ran towards her.  When they arrived at the front porch of their home, my great-aunt pointed towards the woodline on the other side of a field approximately 4-500 yards from their home. Silently hovering over the woodline was a very large silvery disk, perhaps 100-200 feet or larger in circumference.  They observed the disk hover for approximately another four or five minutes.  It then took off at a very high rate of speed, accelerating as it gained in altitude.  It was out of sight in only a few seconds, and was entirely silent.My cousins told me that they were in awe of the object but, being children, they quickly resumed playing and had only the vaguest memory of both the object and the event for many years.  While reminiscing at a Thanksgiving dinner many years later (in the mid-1990s), my great-aunt questioned them both to see if they remembered the event.  They both recalled the event and had virtually identical recollections.  An older brother who was a test engineer at the Nevada Test Site until his retirement also recalled that the story was related to him shortly after it happened in the early 1950s.I am not aware of any other witnesses, nor am I aware of any graphic images such as photos, movies, etc., that exist of the incident.

It sounded like it was right over our house.  I then realized my husband had also been startled by the sound and had already been up to investigate prior to my awakening.  The sound I heard was totally unfamiliar to me.... I would describe it as sounding like a gigantic bumble bee that would get louder, trail off, and then come back again, only to then disappear altogether. My husband was clearly shaken by what he saw and heard. He told me of bright blue pulsating lights shining in through our dining/living room plantation shutters which were open.

He said that it looked silver, but he is not exactly sure and that you could see the windows and the sun was giving a glare on it. He and his brothers were watching an airplane way up in the sky, he didnt really know why the airplane caught there attention, but then out of no where an object appeard and then it was gone. It was higher than the airplane and the airplane was about as high as one can get. The object was way bigger and it looked like it was gonna hit the plane, but it was above the plane. He said it was only there for a few seconds, about 4, and poof, it was gone. He said it was like it just vanished into thin air. It was the coolest thing that he ever saw and if it were not for his two brothers who also seen it, he said it would be hard for even him to believe!!!", "Copper spherical object moving at great speedsAt about 6:55 pm on May 5, 2008, I was on the phone with my girlfriend, sitting outside.  I looked up at the sky and noticed something moving across the sky.  At this time of year, it is still daylight and there were big, cumulus clouds in the sky.  I thought at first it was a plane, because in profile, it looked to have wings of some sort, but it looked almost like an old bi-plane.  But there was no noise, and the object appeared to be too high to be a plane like that.  As I watched for the next ten to fifteen minutes, this object kept moving further and further away and also appeared to be climbing.  The only frame of reference I had for altitude and distance was when it passed in front of a smaller cumulus cloud (or perhaps through it, because this was the first time I almost lost the object.)  As it moved further away, it seemed to be more spherical than I first perceived, and was a copper color, because it glinted a little in the sunlight.  When it passed through or in front of the cloud, it looked like a black speck, but when it emerged, I could see the copper coloration again.  The only other thing that bothered me was that this object appeared to be fast-moving, because in those ten minutes, it moved in a seemingly pointed direction, all while climbing higher.  The other thing I thought strange was that there was no stream after the object, like a jet leaves.  I estimate the distance traveled at about ten to twenty miles in a matter of eight minutes or so.  I have no idea what the object was, could not see it in the viewfinder of my phone&rsquo;s camera and lost the object shortly after 7:15 pm.", "Due west bright white light, then golden, red&amp;green.

This ufo was not seen by anyone but was captured by the digital camera. The dates were not set on the camera and ARE incorrect.We did not see any objects in the sky at the time, but in a split-second it was detected by the camera only. It appears that there may be a second object flying next to it, or perhaps in is part of one object as a whole (?)  It could be circular shaped, but due to the angle it appears oval shaped. There are small wavy ridges that make up the shape of the body.  We don&apos;t have much information about it since we could not see it flying in the sky, but it is definitely visible in the photograph and we truly believe it is not an &quot;accident&quot; with the camera. There was no dust in the lense, and no one&apos;s finger was blocking the view. My mother took this picture and had taken a series of photos of the landscape, one after the other in a few moments time, and this strange object was captured immediately after she had been clicking away at the camera.Other than that, there was no strange noises in the area.

I got very confused and my friend asked me what is wrong.  I said I wasn&apos;t sure then looked up towards the South East and saw what looked like a rocket, plane or air craft.  It had a white belly with dark writing on it.  It was on fire and clouds or flames of green and pink smoke surrounded it. As we watched others waking up and walking dogs also saw this object.  The object continued to streak across the sky until it exploded in what I would say was about seven pieces that started to descend and disappear.  That morning before the attack I was watching channel five and they had reported witnesses seeing a ball of fire all along the North East coast.  He was then handed a piece of paper and reported it as a Russian rocket that entered the atmosphere. A few hours later I woke to 911.

I was getting ready to go to a cub scout meeting. As soon as I stepped out my back door, I noticed a bright sphere-shaped object hovering (not even really hovering, it was just perfectly still) maybe 500 feet or less over the corn field near my house. The sphere was about 1500 - 2000 feet in total away from me (in a straight line.) I was totally shocked. I had never seen anything like it. Even at 10 years old I knew it was not an airplane or a helicopter. It made no noise whatsoever. I was overcome with the feeling that the object was &quot;staring&quot; straight at me. I can&apos;t explain this, it&apos;s just something I knew was happening. I also had the sense that I couldn&apos;t look away. It was a very, very peaceful feeling, I felt very happy, more so than the moments before I stepped out the door. It was as though the object was telling me &quot;it&apos;s ok, don&apos;t worry&quot;. Very strange but that is the overwhelming feeling I had. The sphere wasn&apos;t very big. Maybe about 50 - 75 feet across. It was emitting light, but the light didn&apos;t really light up the night. There were no beams of light coming off it, but still it was as though it was shining a flashlight straight at my eyes. The light was white, all white. This lasted maybe 20 seconds and as I said was a very joyful feeling. Then suddenly, the light shot off across the sky at an extremely high rate of speed. It didn&apos;t have to speed up. It reached the full speed I saw it traveling at instantly. It travelled east toward Grand Island and in the distance it arched upward slightly and disappeared. I&apos;ll never forget this as long as I live.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

I was relaxing in a hot tub in my back yard and just staring up (at an estimated 65-75 degree angle) when I happen to look directly at a fairly large (estimated school bus-sized) object with red lights appear, then quickly disappear (at an estimated 50 degree location) in the sky. It was obviously traveling at speeds faster than an airplane, which I admit, I am in an area where planes fly by frequently, but this is how I know it was not an airplane.One of the most odd things I noticed about the object was it&rsquo;s motion. I seemed to be making very close swerves, like a back and forth motion. They were not large movements, but noticeable in spite of it&rsquo;s speed and duration of appearance.I also noticed that the object was below the cloud coverage, or seemed to be. I was very sure of this detail at the time, but looking back I question whether it was only my eyes telling me that, due to the thinness of cloud coverage. Accordingly, if it were not below the clouds, it would have been much larger than I thought.The object was traveling West-southwest.", "Orange light / V-shapedMy mother and I were driving home from a friend&apos;s. We were about at the Toyota dealership about 2 minutes out of Potsdam, Ny. My mother was just looking at the sky, it was very clear out that night. All of a sudden she says &apos;What is that?&apos;, looking at the orange light in the sky. Then she said &apos;Oh my Gosh, Look over there in the sky!&apos;. I saw a street light orange colored ball light up and turn, almost like a lighthouse, then disappear.  It was probably 300 feet in the air and maybe a mile away.  Then we drove past the tree line into an open area and  we saw three of the same color lights, same shape and size. We looked over and saw it was accompanied by 2 smaller lights  at a 45 degree angle to the ball. Then we started driving in the direction of town it was over and it was gone.

There was no discernable shape, it appeared that the UFO was at least 50 miles north of my position, maybe more. It first appeared that it was going west, however, as soon as I spotted it, it began going southwest. 30 seconds later, as it was just about to exit my line of sight (I was viewing it from my bedroom window), it stopped and hovered for about twenty minutes.

We live North of Dallas in McKinney Texas, with an unobstructed view to the South. I have grown up around aircraft and I am very knowledgeable about most types of air planes. Our house seems to be located in a position that gets a large amount of Care-Flight helicopters either directly over, or very near our location. We were watching the air traffic coming and going out of Love Field, DFW and Addison airport, always trying to figure out who was going where. We noticed what we assumed to be a Care-Flight or a private plane headed directly towards us from Love Field (due South). It was a bright red/orange light that resembled a bright landing light or a spot light on the front of a helicopter that was pointed towards us from a distance of approximately 10 &ndash; 15 miles and at a low altitude of 500 &ndash; 1500 agl (above ground level). After several minutes, we noticed that the aircraft never seemed to get any closer. At that time I got my binoculars out to get a better look at what was going on. The only thing that I could tell was that the red/orange light was all that I could see. I thought I should have been able to see a rotating beacon and anti-collision lights. After a total of approximately 5 - 6 minutes, the light moved due West. Now that I had what should be a side view of the craft, I knew that I could see the rotating beacon and the anti-collision lights. Not only were there no other lights, the spotlight seemed to still be pointed to the North. This is when we both knew we were seeing something that just wasn&rsquo;t quite right. It was moving to the West at about the speed a fast moving helicopter would be going at a distance of about 5- 10 miles. After a few more minutes, it stopped again. Trying to rationalize what we were seeing, I thought a larger aircraft descending out of the South towards Love Field and then turning towards DFW (this may be possible due to the ru! nways at Love are 33 &ndash; 13 and DFW are 36 &ndash; 18), but we still couldn&rsquo;t figure out why the light was that bright and moving that slow. The light was now standing still over DFW for another 4 &ndash; 5 minutes. As we were both watching this thing, it went due South over the horizon in a fraction of a second. After we could see the light move over the horizon, I had the feeling that the light was much larger and higher than what we had first assumed. I now believe it was approximately 5,000 agl, assuming that it was indeed over Love Field and DFW. The size of the light was approximately the size of a bb at arm&rsquo;s length. The next morning we anxiously watched the news for a story on this light over Dallas, there was no mention of anything. I called the towers at Love Field, DFW and approach control via land line and no one knew anything about what we had witnessed the night before. I just pray that it was ours.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

It moved approx. 70 degrees in a flat trajectory in about a second and a half, stopped for about a second, and moved out of sight to the East in about 2 seconds. The deceleration and acceleration were both instantaneous. Altitude is hard to estimate, as we did not see it relative to the ground.

The first boom occurred at 10:00 and the next at 11:04 and sometimes there is a third or fourth sound. It is scary because the entire building structure feels as though it is moving.

At first i didn&apos;t take to much care into it but, it was happening about every couple minutes another jet or some kind of fighter aircraft that was very loud would fly over. This lasted for about an hour or so. Finally i got up to let my cat out on my back porch &amp; I saw a blood-red object that was very high in the air and was not pulsating this was around 9pm. It was very bright blood red and moving in 90- degree angels very quickly much faster than any aircraft I have ever seen.  Two jets were chasing it, well were trying to keep up with it anyways. I was in awe standing on my deck with my cat. I ran inside and called a close friend who was about 5-10 miles away in a town called Pleasant hill. I explained to him what i was seeing and he didn&rsquo;t really believe me. I stood on my back porch and there were about 20 to 30 different aircrafts spread out every flashing in the night sky. I thought it was very unusual for that many aircrafts to be flying around our small town because were no where near the Airport.I decided to go grab something to eat down the street &amp; drive around and investigate shortly after, there were more and more aircrafts flying around our town and i lost sight of the red orb like object. Shortly after I came inside i got a call from my friend that i called previously. He said that he was outside with two of our friends getting ready to get in there car in Pleasant hill and saw the same blood red object and there were the same jet aircrafts chasing it. But they heard a very silent hovering sound from the red object. They got in there car and turned on the radio but none of the stations would come in on FM they were all static same with the AM, Making odd fuzzy sounds throughout the car ride to my house. They arrived at my house and we all discussed and went over what we all saw.  We all had seen the same object; we concluded that the object was chased by the jet aircrafts from Altoona in the direction of Pleasant hill.We all were standing on my back porch discussing what happened while Aircrafts were still lingering all over our skies. As we were talking i realized about a month pervious on the night of February 16th i saw a similar blood-red object over Pleasant hill on my way home to Altoona coming home from a friends house. I didn&rsquo;t think much of it at the time but it was the same solid-color blood red orb like object. I looked around the internet for sightings of UfOs in Altoona Iowa and found an abundance of similar UFO sightings throughout the months of February and January and march.  I was positive that the object I saw racing through the sky was not any sort of friendly air craft, seeing how it was a bright red orb of no familiarity.The jets that were chasing it were pulsating a very very bright white light in some kind of pattern so I&rsquo;m not exactly sure if they were also ufo&apos;s or jets. They kept flying around in a pattern with the Red orb like object all over my town.  So it is very possible that the white strobe like lights that were following it a bit slower could have been UFO&apos;s as well or some type of military aircrafts. But there were 20-30 aircrafts circling Altoona for about 2 hours after the incident. There was also a very low altitude stealth looking silent aircraft flew over my neighborhood.Not sure the exact type of stealth aircraft it was but im positive it was a stealth aircraft by the triangular lights on the bottom of the craft and it was also V-shaped. Im positive what we all saw was a ufo on account of military crafts chasing it and military crafts lingering around for two hours in the area My backyard is also a casino resort called prairie meadows which the Red object was hovering over to begin with.

I like looking at the stars because it relaxes me, so I know which stars should be where even if I don&rsquo;t know there names.  That star started out to be dull but you could still see it.

It was moving down towards Earth at about an (if you figure a 180 degree angle is straight up and down) the thing was moving from a westerly position to an slight easterly position at about an angle of 150 degrees. Picture it moving almost straight down but with a slight angle as you look up at it. I seen the thing actually hit the Earths atmosphere and it became a bright white object for about a second, still moving in the exact same direction and angle. Then there was a big really bright burst of white light.  Picture being in a dark room and someone using there flash on a camera and that&rsquo;s how bright the light was. This flash lasted for around two seconds. It was like this thing exploded. Instantly I thought it was a meteor and that was that. But, I saw an object come out of the light in that two seconds and I saw this object make a very sharp turn and headed off to the north. This thing wasn&rsquo;t loosing in height. That&rsquo;s a right angle turn from where it was originally heading.  The object I saw had to be a hugh object for me to be able to see it so far up in the atmosphere. This thing had no lights and no means of propulsion that I could see. But I could see it because it was glowing red hot. If you turn on an electric stove burner to high, wait until it gets real hot and! then tu rn off the lights, then turn off the burner, that&rsquo;s how it was glowing. And just like the burner you could see it cooling down. There wasn&rsquo;t any fire, or fire trail like a meteor, just the glow.  It wasn&rsquo;t burning.  I was able to watch this thing for about five seconds after it made that turn. I could see it passing in front of stars and blacking them out.  It was moving really fast. After about five seconds it cooled down so much that I lost it.  This thing wasn&rsquo;t falling like a meteor should be doing.  It was flying due north like it was under some sort of power. From observing the glow I could tell the thing was (and I hesitate to use this term) cigar shaped except the rear end was more pronounced then the front end so I suspect it was larger in the back then the front.  I haven&rsquo;t heard of anyone else seeing this thing and I haven&rsquo;t even told my family about it yet but I have no reason to make this up.  Something came into earths atmosphere list night that I believe wasn&rsquo;t from Earth and it wasn&rsquo;t a meteor. What do you think?  Has anyone else brought this to your attention?((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I was getting on Toll way I-355 north, from west bound Route 6 in New Lenox. I noticed the strobes while on the ramp and watched them for the next several miles (minutes) as I headed north on I-355. The objects were northwest from the Toll way and about 15 to 20 degrees above the horizon. The weather was dry but overcast, I have no idea what the ceiling was at the time.The three objects appeared to be identical in the fact that all three had the same varying intensity, and frequency of the strobe effect, but the objects were not in sync with each other. Since they were identical in brightness and appearance I assume they were of the same size and distance from me. There was also many strobes on each object with some slightly more intense than others, making each object look like a continuous varying strobe. There were no other lights, no red or green or landing lights, no steady lights of any kind, just very white intense strobes. I could not see any discernable shape of an object or objects, or tell how many strobes there were per object since the strobes on each object were very close to each other. My best description is each object was like a cluster of tightly packed, very intense strobe lights.The objects also appeared to interact with each other, meaning as one moved another would follow. This dance went on for a minute or two. Then while two of them were more or less stationary the third one headed away then quickly, amazingly quick, turned around and passed right between the other two and came to an abrupt stop shortly after passing them, making all three the same distance apart. Shortly after that maneuver the three objects got in a straight line with one another (north to south), were equidistant to each other, and appeared to be heading south (remember I&rsquo;m heading north at 65+ MPH)  and then climbed away slowly at a 45 degree angle. At this point they were now due west of me. I never did see them enter the cloud deck or if they changed direction due to my vantage point while driving, and a strong desire to stay on the road. As they were climbing away the distance between them slowly increased but they were always equidistant to each other, as if in formation, and their appearance and strobe intensity although fading, remained constant between them.I am an aircraft technician and I am very familiar with various, not all, aircraft and helicopter lighting. I see airplanes almost everyday and night, going into and out of Chicago&rsquo;s Midway and  O&rsquo;Hare airports, and several smaller airports, as I travel over 100 miles roundtrip every day (or night) to and from work. I am very familiar with the traffic and holding patterns too. In fact I did see airplane traffic in their usual routes, north and east of my location (for the given wind direction at that time). These objects were not in that vicinity, they were alone. I am also aware that there was a Hotel fire in Lockport Illinois, to the south and west from were I witnessed these objects, and the local news teams did have their helicopters up covering it, but these objects were nowhere near that location.I have never seen helicopters with so many intense strobes. I have never seen helicopters or any other aircraft accelerate and decelerate in such a short distance(?) and time. And, I have never seen them &ldquo;play&rdquo; with each other for a lack of a better description, and depart in single file and climb at a 45 degree angle. I am not saying it couldn&rsquo;t have been 3 identical aircraft or 3 identical helicopters playing cat and mouse in the predawn hours, all I&rsquo;m saying is I have never witnessed anything like it in my 30 plus years in aviation.", "V shaped sighting in SonomaSomething appeared to me when I was looking at the stars. It came from the east,hovered directly above me about 4-5 seconds and shot off to the west at tremendous speed.It could have been mistaken for a flock of geese in formation-w/ the sun hitting them. But there was NO SUN @ 9:30 PST,&amp; geese don&apos;t fly at SST speed. It was a group of small(to my eye-who knows how high it was) pale orange glowing chevron shapes that formed a triangle. It was a very dim light-I would have missed it if I would have blinked. There was the outline of the triangle-maybe 6-8 chevrons on each side and 4-5 inside lined up. The point of the triangle was west-the direction it went. All of the chevrons moved together.It made a very slight VVV sound before it shot off to the west. Only a second or so. The whole thing happened so fast, I have been second guessing myself-and trying to come up w/ a logical idea, to no avail.

The lightning was striking fast and the entire sky was lighting up.  My husband then asks me what is floating in the sky.  I look up to where was pointing and I see it.  It was a grey craft that looked somewhat like a jellyfish with no lights emitting from it. It moved in what I can only describe as an organic manner.  We watched for a few minutes as it moved from one place to another.  Some times we lost track of where it was but would see it again only a moment later, as it stayed in the same general area.  Then it ended up flying closer to us and when the sky lit up again the grey craft tuned in to what looked like a geometric 3-d rectangle.  The outer edges of the &ldquo;rectangle&rdquo; were lit up with all different colors.  After the lightning strike and the sky went dark the craft again looked like the grey jellyfish with no emitting light.  It then moved back to its previous general location but looked a little paler than it had at first.  Maybe it was further away and we could not see it as well.

I opened the sliding glass door in our bedroom because of the nice breeze &amp; temperature outside and noticed what looked like a flickering star but it was flickering purple &amp; green &amp; white.  So I went and got the binoculars and went out on the balcony and sat down in a chair and steadied the binoculars on the railing and saw what I would best describe as an object that was stationary but pulsating different very brightly colored lights, blue, green, purple, white &amp; red - the object looked very much like the body part of a jelly fish without the tentacles.  I watched as it at first looked like a circle with lights all the way around, and then it seemed to tilt on its side and looked like a see-through dome on top.  I watched this for 10 minutes and had my husband look through the binoculars and verify that I wasn&apos;t making this up!  I then called a girlfriend of mine at 12:05 a.m. who lives 2 minutes away and she hopped in her car and came right over.  She also saw the same thing I was seeing, although we did notice that, although appearing to be probably 25,000 to 35,000 ft. in the sky, it looked to be above a mountain in the Sylmar area that has some kind of buildings with lights at the top of it.  But there was no beam of light coming from any of those lights on the mountain to what we were seeing in the sky.  It is now 12:55 a.m. and it is still in the same spot.  It is now almost 1:00 a.m. and it is still there!!!  I will look again tomorrow evening and see if it is up there again, then maybe I will believe it is somehow tied to the lights on the mountain.  If anyone could shed any light on what those buildings are at the top of those mountains perhaps that could narrow this down to a logical explanation.  But I have never in my life seen anything remotely like this up in the sky!!", "Clear Costa Blanca sightingA Spanish couple were walking their dog along the pavement.

I walked out of the facility through the front entrance.  It was nighttime, and the moon was shaped like a smile.  I saw clear stars in the sky.  There was one bright light that I thought was a star when I first saw it.  However it was a big star and it was moving.  It actually looked more like it was glowing than twinkling like a normal star.  It was not moving fast or slow, but at medium speed.  No light was blinking on it like I would see on a normal airplane.  As it moved it looked as if it was slightly wiggling from side to side.  It looked as if it was more floating than flying.  The movement of the light seemed very smooth, unlike an airplane that deals with wind resistance.  Even as it moved almost directly above me, it was a big bright light directly facing me the whole time, like the image of a very big or bright star.  Normally when an airplane flies over me, the brightest front light of the plane faces the direction that the plane is moving.  An airplane front light does not continually face me as it passes over me, as it looked with this flying object I saw.  When an airplane passes over me, I usually see some kind of blinking light(s) on its wings and/or underbelly.It might have even been bigger than any star I ever saw.  It made no noise as it moved.  As it kept moving, it gradually started dimming, and eventually disappeared, where I saw just a little light before it totally faded into the night sky woodwork.  Keep in mind that this sighting happened all during the course of about seven or eight seconds.Also keep in mind that this was nighttime.  There might have been redwood trees that it went behind, and perhaps this was the reason it disappeared.  There also might have been fog that it disappeared behind.  However immediately after the experience I went to other locations to try and get a different view and angle of the area that I saw the light disappear to see if I could see any stars.  Well, in one of my other views, I saw stars, and there did not appear to be fog in that direction.I am going to return to my sighting location tomorrow during the day to see if some kind of object or redwood trees might have caused the object to disappear from where I was standing at the time of the sighting.

I heard nothing during my viewing. The object was heading due East (flying west to east). What immediately caught my eye was that it appeared transparent, it was a starry evening, relatively clear, and it looked like the stars were reflecting from the bottom of the object. I saw no lights whatsoever so I knew this was no a civilian or possibly even military aircraft. Size wise, I would say it was about as big as a small private plane. Oddly, the most striking resemblance I can compare it to is the wingshaped B2 bomber. It had a dome cockpit type area and wings that had cut outs similiar to the B2. This object was much smaller. I did not see any lights until it was almost out of sight and it appeared that above the edges of the wing tips there were circular housing that emitted a bright, glowing red light.

The flight left Tucson at 5:00 PM (Mountain Time).  The flight flew approximately in a east-northeasterly route and the skies were generally cloudy and the ground below was not visible. About thirty minutes into the flight, the skies cleared and the ground became visible.  There was no haze or dust obscuring the view from my seat.  As I was looking out the plane&rsquo;s window at the ground below, I spotted a (chrome) metallic, saucer-shaped disc hovering above the ground.   As we were flying about 30, 000 feet, the object was below and I got a good view of the top and sides of it.  It appeared to be metallic as I could see the setting sun reflected on it&rsquo;s surface.  The surface was smooth as well.  I noticed that it was nearly stationary, hovering over the same spot.  It wobbled and pitched a little but remained stationary.  The ground below looked like typical desert and was devoid of any trees or grasses.  There was a dry creek bed to the left (east) of the object and the nearest indication of human activity in the area was a circular crop field about a mile or two east of the creek bed. I did not see any buildings or roads anywhere nearby to where the object was hovering.  I estimated that the object must have been about 1000-1500 feet above the ground.  At first I wondered if I was seeing a water tower but I did not see any type of supporting structure.I watched the object for as long as I could.  I estimate that I watched it for a good four to five minutes.  I looked at my watch after I could not see it any longer and noted the time at 5:35 PM.  I also estimated that this area was about 250 miles east-northeast of Tucson, AZ.  I was expecting the object to fly off but it appeared not to notice my plane flying above it.  It stayed stationary the whole time I viewed it.  I was able to view it on three sides- west facing  to top to east facing.  It was perfectly symmetric except the top did seem to have conical shape.  I am not sure of the diameter of the object but I would guess that it might have been around 40-60 feet.  I wondered if other passengers or anyone on the ground saw it?", "2 shape shifting objects and one small turquoise object sighted over NW New Mexico in daylightMy brother and I were hiking through a small rocky area approximately one-eighth of a mile from the nearby apartment complexes in a small neighborhood of NW Gallup, New Mexico.  We had ascended to a nearby cliff division and took a five minute break.  There was a wind from the SW 15-20 mph and the skies were mostly clear. I noticed a few large aircraft pass through overhead which is normal in this area.  I looked away viewing the area around us when I look back up - directly above our resting location when I noticed a large round white object.  It was about one-half the size of the moon at this point and was not moving.  I pointed it out to my brother and we looked at it for about 2-3 minutes while it remained motionless above us.  It was obvious to us that it was not a balloon and did not resemble any of the other aircraft in the vicinity.  I had sunglasses on that have polarized lenses so I could see with fair clarity when I realized the object had nearly doubled in size and had turned mostly bright red.  My brother seconded this observation and the object began rotating and changing its physical appearance.  This began happening about 5 minutes after our initial sighting.  It was rotating in a clockwise motion and appeared almost translucent or had some kind of field around it that gave it a translucent appearance.  The red color of the object slowly became larger and smaller as it rotated.  It would become oblong, oval, round, square, and sometimes appear to have protrusions that seemed to come out of the body of the object itself. We then noticed large aircraft begin coming in from all directions and seemed to have changed their original trajectory in order to come into contact with the object.  Presumably they are of military origin and had detected them on radar or from some type of space platform.  3 of these aircraft came close to the object but I am unable to approximate the altitude.  You could see contrails that slowly disappeared behind the jet aircraft.  Then the object disappeared.I waited for about two minutes when suddenly an identical type of object as the first appeared in the same location and was bright white and was also rotating.  Then a small bright turquoise light appeared to come out of it and was shining much brighter than a star.  It moved away from the other craft and appeared to dance around to the side of the other object for about 3-4 minutes.  I could see more aircraft begin to aim towards the objects when suddenly the phenomenon disappeared.  We waited for about a half hour and no other objects were sighted on that day.The next day Sunday, my family and I witnessed a larger sighting that I will report for the appropriate date.I had also submitted an earlier report which can be seen at http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16585.html", "Long blue/green flash of light with red core seen for brief moments in the western night sky.My wife and I were driving home at about 8:30 pm, April 26, 2008. In the western sky I noticed a long blue/green flash of light. The front part of the light was in a circular red, orange and yellow shape. My first thought was that it was a meteor but this object was in a horizontal position above the tree line.  The object was slowly moving for about 4-5 seconds and then all of a sudden it vanished. The sky was black and this was the only object I saw in the sky. The object appeared to be very long and skinny. The blue/green color appeared to be the tail end of the red, orange and yellow core.", "Low flying black cylinder without any lights or noiseAt approximately 0430 in the morning I was driving eastbound along an access road of a decommissioned government facility.  I approached a four way intersection and glanced up through my windshield and saw what looked like a black in color cylinder shaped aircraft without wings gliding through the sky with no running lights on it. The movement of the object through the sky caught my attention and by the time I got out of my vehicle and attempted to get a better view, the object had passed out of my field of view in a southeast direction.  The craft appeared to be under a thousand feet in altitude and the glow from the street lights must have been reflecting off of it so I could just make out the shape, color and apparent speed.  The speed of the craft was relatively slow and it appeared to be gliding along and there wasn&rsquo;t the sound of an aircraft&rsquo;s engine at any time.  By the last seen direction of the craft I would guess it would have passed between Rattlesnake Mountain and the town of West Richland, WA.  The Hanford Site is located approximately 30 miles northwest of Richland, a town in the southeastern portion of Washington State. I&rsquo;m a full time employee for the primary contractor on the Hanford Site.", "Bright lights on cylindrical object viewed leaving atmosphere at high rate of speedI feel a little odd writing this, as I never thought that I would encounter anything of this type in my lifetime, but I am hopefully seeking others who may have legitimately witnessed this occurrence to prove the sanity of my wife and I both.At 5:55 PM CST my wife and I were walking when we saw what appeared to be a straight horizontal line at a 45 degree angle from where we stood emitting a bright white light with a soft red-like center.  It initially looked like a series of abnormally bright stars strung together to make this bright &quot;line&quot;.  The sighting appeared to be within 5-10 miles of where we were at the time.  Within the following 20 seconds we saw the item rise slowly into the sky yet diminish in size rather quickly, as if it were moving away from us.  The object produced no audible sound, no smoke or trails.  Within the 20 second duration the object simply vanished as if it left our atmosphere.  The sky was clear without a single cloud in the sky.", "Silver Reflecting Disk shape object over Azusa.CAAt 14:35 at my work, I was doing a foot patrol and something caught my attention in the sky. From north east from the San Gabriel Mountains, there was an object that looked like a plane but I look further and it was like chrome and had no wings or tail wing.  It was shining light from the sun or its own it appeared.  It came from north east headed south then west slowly.After observing it for 5 minutes it appeared to be a disk to long disk shape and I got a feeling whatever it was it was observing me.  I ran to my car to get my binoculars. Then it took off north west. About 2000 feet or so I guess it would be the altitude of the object. The mountians tops at the mountain it came from is about 4000 feet.  The direction was from NE over the mountains slowly sweeping down heading West then up again over the mountains heading NW then speeding fast. It was gone after it went NW. The flight patterns here I know from years of watching and that object took a different one.  May be a military flight pattern but disk shape?  It did not make noise.  Even planes at 2000 feet make some noise.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

At lunch time (20:30 hours) most of us shipfitters and welders would go to our main shop (Building 128) for lunch, card playing, naps or whatever we could do in only half an hour.This was the week after Echo I had been launched and was scheduled to be visible over the Los Angeles area.  I think it was Tuesday the 16th when lunch ended and one of the welders called for us out to the front (South side) of the shop to watch Echo I pass overhead.  It was a very clear night and was easily seen as a silver dot (about the size of a pencil lead held at arm&apos;s length).  It&apos;s orbit from West to East was easily tracked and we all felt thankful to have had an opportunity to see it on one of the few nights it would be seen in our area.The next night there were scattered clouds and as I left the shop building after lunch and walked toward Dry Dock 2 I looked up at the clouds and thought to myself, &quot;Much too cloudy to see Echo tonight&quot;.Then from above the clouds on a Southerly course I saw four crescent shaped objects &quot;flying&quot; in a reverse &quot;V&quot; formation.  Being crescent shaped and not too long after sunset I first surmised it was the sun (now over our horizon) that was reflecting off of some type of aircraft like the Vought V-173 &quot;Flying Pancake&quot;.  I could only see them for about 4 or 5 seconds before they disappeared above another cloud.  I tried to listen for a sound of aircraft engines but heard nothing except for the leaking air from low pressure air manifolds down in the Dry Dock.  If they were the Vought aircraft, I would certainly have heard their twin propeller engines.I checked my glasses for dust, backed up and stepped forward again to see if they were a reflection of something on the ground off my glasses.  I did this for one or two minutes without being able to duplicate the apparent sighting.  In size, and if circular or &quot;saucer&quot; shaped with the reflecting sun on their West edges, they would be the size of a pencil eraser held at arm&apos;s length (as opposed to a pencil lead in my description of Echo I).When I mentioned this to a couple of my fellow workers they just laughed and said I&apos;ve been reading too many Science Fiction books (actually I was reading Harold Lamb&apos;s historical novels at that time).I have modified an historical map of the shipyard (that no longer exists) that I reconstructed from old maps and aerial photos for a book I am writing on the history of the Shipyard, Naval Base and attached Naval Air Station.  In accordance with your instructions of electronically uploading images, I am emailing this map both as an insert and as an attachment for your study.Because I transferred over to the Design Division 4 years later and eventually was the structural configuration manager of the 1980&apos;s reactivation of the Iowa Class Battleships I kept the story to myself - except with friends who like stories like that.  I retired in 1994 but did not decide to file an official report until now when I realized the accuracy of my shipyard map may be of value.", "It was 12:15am April 3, 2008.

It was shifted to the left of the sun and just beneath. It seemed to be as wide as the sun, but closer. It was huge and silent.  I thought it was on optical illusion from the sun rise, but it did not move with the sun. The sky was clear, no clouds that I recall. I was disturbed and looked away.

It was a sunny day with many clouds and I was the only one who saw it on a sparsely populated public beach.  Then they just disappeared.  After they were gone there were about 6 -12 lenticular clouds in the same vicinity.  In about 5 minutes the lenticular clouds were gone.

I was on my own doing ((deleted)) outside the building when I came back and happened to look up in the sky.  It was a very clear night, no clouds and cold.  I saw these circles high up in the sky (I would estimate the altitude to be higher than where airplanes fly).  They were zigzagging across the sky from a direction north to south (from the Dover, NJ direction toward Chester, NJ) in formation.  It was the strangest thing I ever saw or I believe I will ever see.  I stood there not believing what I was seeing and it was about 3 to 4 minutes that I stood there watching this.  The only thing I regret was that I didn&apos;t call back to our base in Morristown saying what I was seeing since I had a walkie talkie with me.  I reported this on the nuforc.org site.

Could be distant radio towers, but some things don&apos;t fit.On the night of February 18, 2008, my spouse and I were driving south on Highway 285 from IH-40.  About half-way between Vaughn and Roswell, I saw a group of red lights on the horizon towards the east/southeast (driver&rsquo;s side of the car).  The lights were very low on the horizon--from my perspective they were at or near the ground.  There were at least a dozen red lights spread out over several hundred yards (from my perspective) and pulsing/blinking on and off at the same rate and at the same time.  They looked just like pulsing radio tower lights, except they were so low to the ground.  The lights were not moving.  The lights were somewhat dim (my husband couldn&rsquo;t see them at all), and were not always visible since the terrain was slightly hilly.  Eventually, as we continued south, the lights moved fully toward the east, then east/northeast, then out of sight. My first reaction was that it was a nearby airfield, but blinking red lights would not typically be used on a runway. Looking at area maps, there is very little in the area.  We were already well south of Clovis/Cannon AFB, headed south, and the lights I saw were towards the east/southeast.  Also, since the lights were generally towards the east, I don&rsquo;t believe it was the Roswell airport either.  Those lights didn&rsquo;t come into view until much later, and were directly in front of us (due south). The most logical explanation is that this was a large group of radio or cellphone tower lights far in the distance -- perhaps as far as the NM/TX border -- that appeared from my perspective to be near the horizon. (We were using XM at the time, so I don&rsquo;t know if there was an actual radio signal transmitting.)  The only thing that doesn&apos;t fit this explanation is that most radio tower groups I&apos;ve seen have lights pulsing at different times, and these lights all pulsed simultaneously. Primarily, I&rsquo;m curious if anyone in the area has seen something similar, and/or if someone knows of a feature in the area that fits with what I saw.", "Copper cigar-shaped object in early 1950&apos;s.My father, who is now 87 years old, stated that he saw a copper colored cigar-shaped craft above the highway at the Oklahoma/Texas border back in the early 1950&apos;s.  He was driving my mother and older brothers, who were babies at the time.  Because my mother was  distracted, she did not see the object; however, my father pulled the car over, jumped out and watched the craft as it hovered for awhile, and then sped away at lightspeed.  He has a good memory, and has always repeated this story.  He says it was in broad daylight, and that he read in the newspaper later that other people reported seeing a similar object in the area.

Then I heard the sounds from inside the mobile home park and dogs started barking.  At this point, I thought, &quot;What am I doing outside?&quot;  I went back inside.  I kept hearing the noise off and on until dawn started to break.  Very creepy and very hard to describe.", "Speeding green ball of lightI was driving northbound on Oak ave in Folcroft, pa one night in February. I am not sure the extact date and I am killing myself over that right now. Folcroft is literally about 5 mins from the Philadelphia International airport. I usually see planes that are extremely close, as they are about to land. This was not plane, it wasnt even an aircraft I dont think. As I was driving a swift motion caught my eye and as I turned my head I saw a green ball of light. I cant put into perspective the actual size but I can say it would appear to be that of a basketball perhaps and it has like a green motion trail following it. As soon as I could get the words &quot; What in the world&quot; out of my mouth it dissapeared seemingly into thin air as if it evaporated. I can remember that it was as close as the top of a tree though and about several house lengths away from me. I just found this site. I wish I could of been more help earlier. I dont know what it was that I saw but it was defintely a fast green ball that dissapeared.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

I saw what I thought at first, a large white landing light approach from the south, near the town of Millersville. I estimate it was about 5 miles to my south when first viewed. My first thought was this aircraft was unusually low, as the local airport is approx. 8 miles to my north.  The white light was moving slowly about 1000&rsquo; AGL and had no accompanying red or white upper or lower strobes, had a bright warm white glow; and no sound. After watching the large white light continue north towards me for approx. 10 seconds, I detected some faint green lights on the upper portion of the object.  At this point, the light slowed and moved SIDEWAYS to the west.  The white light continued facing to the north during the initial move.  The object was partially blocked from my view by a group of pine trees as it headed west.  After the object came back into full view it changed into a group of three inverted V&rsquo;s, forming a pyramid/triangle shape.  It continued west for approx. five miles.  The inverted V&rsquo;s were a mix of pale green and bright red lighting, similar to faint LED&rsquo;s, not a bright aircraft position or strobe light.As the object made the turn from north to west, I could hear a deep sound similar to air rushing through turbines.  That was the only time I heard any sound from the object.The object again turned north towards a tall cell tower with bright white strobe on top, near the town of Mountville.  It flew past the cell tower and it&rsquo;s lighting on the three inverted V&rsquo;s changed to a bright pulsing red. It appeared the pulsing on the object picked up the strobe flash interval on the cell tower. The object continued to the north-northwest in the (3) inverted V shape and passed behind some distant buildings and out of my sight.Disclaimer:  I am a Military pilot (fulltime) and am familiar with aircraft lighting and flight paths.  I&rsquo;ve lived at my present location for over 15 years and am familiar with the day to day flight paths of commuter aircraft and the occasional corporate or medevac helo over my location and this sighting was definitely not normal and &quot;shook me up&quot; to the point I felt it necessary to file a report.   I considered calling the local ATC Approach control after the sighting to see if any pilots had reported similar sightings but my wife talked my out of it.", "4/5 looked like dark objects but were 50% bright orange lights in the front", "I saw a triangle shaped object with multi colored lights that made no noise and landed in the woodsI let my dog out and while I was looking to the north I saw light that was coming towards me.  It went from North to directly East.  Then I saw another light that was coming East to West.  The craft from east had different colored lights and hovered then went below the tree lines.  There was no noise from either craft.  The woods were lit by light.  Around this time I ran into the house and got my daughter and wife to come outside and see this.  Twice while I observed this event, and very low flying jet, with it&apos;s lights on flew over.  The clouds were low but you could see the light from the jet through the clouds.  And you could clearly hear the jet.  The lights from the craft continued to shine through the woods.  Still no noise from the lights. I stayed watching until a steady rain started.  As I write this there are still lights in the woods. The lights were red, blue, and bright white. The object looked to be like a triangle.", "Meteor shower? Sonic boom? I don&apos;t know...I remember two seperate events. The first one happened in June or July of 1986. I was 8 years old. I witnessed what I thought was a Meteor shower. We had a thunderstorm that afternoon, complete with warnings. I believe it was on a Sunday.  Anyway, I liked storms for some reason.  Especially afterwards because I would look for rainbows. Well, as I watched out of the back door through the screen door...I saw a the sky start to turn a brilliant orange/red color.  I mean this was a deep orange-red (almost like dusk, but it was too early in the day for this).  The next thing I know I saw a few fireballs rain down.  I called for my family to come look.  I mean these objects were on fire.  I thought that it was judgement day or something but I wasn&apos;t scared. Which is why I thought it was because noone was concerned. We all had this euphoria going on. They were round and it looked like fire was around them. I mean they were showering, however, no one was concerned about them starting a fire.  I don&apos;t remember what happened after that.  Also, nobody in my family remembers it.  I have asked several people around town and they really don&apos;t remember.  A few people I asked that are around my age say they remember about as much as I do...and nothing after. The rest of the day is just sort of blank.  I try to remember myself and it&apos;s hazy what happened afterward.  However, I do remember not hearing any fire engines or anything.  This has bugged me for years.  I guess it could be dismissed as a meteor shower but I can&apos;t find any reports and nobody remembers.  What happened?  The second incident was about four years or so after that(circa 1990).  I can&apos;t remember what year but it was the summer time and as I looked outsid in mid-afternoon I heard a awesomely loud clangy like sound.  My first thought was that it was an accident but where was the screeching tire sound? The clanging metal sound lasted too long for a MVA! It sounding more like a symbol as it pulsated outward. The musician in me noticed that it almost changed tone as it moved (like someone running their fingers across piano keys, but imagine keys sounding like metallic chimes with tones sounding almost identical but still different). A good example is the movie War of the Worlds (newer version) the sound the tripods made right before they fire the weapons. I looked down out of the window and saw people running outside. They were hollering what was that?! My dad was hollering too. It was on the news. They said that there were no military planes in the area and the airport didn&apos;t even have any planes in the air at that moment. Also, this spread out over the entire county. Wild. I have never heard anything else about it...not even the next day. Also, I haven&apos;t heard anything else like this since then.

There was a loud humming sound. I was so shocked that I went into the house.  When I came back out to look, the saucer was still hovering above the ground-only a few feet above the ground.

It was a sunny day and sometime in late afternoon, or early evening, our phone rang.  It was a friend of my father&rsquo;s and he told us to go up to the roof of our building because there were UFO&rsquo;s flying around.My father and I rushed upstairs to the roof of the building and facing downtown New Brunswick, we could see very clearly, about four flying saucers.  They were roughly about 500-700 ft. up and were clearly &quot;PLAYING!&quot;   (In aviation circles, it is what is called dogfighting). They were chasing each other and darting in hard right angles and various other tight angles that our planes were incapable of doing.  However, they stayed within an imaginary box, so to speak.My father&rsquo;s friend showed up within 5 minutes carrying a telescope.  He quickly set it up and we all had a turn viewing them through the scope.  I was amazed just to see them, in the first place, but seeing them through a telescope, really up close and personal, was truly something else.The ships were silver but not shiny like the bright side of aluminum foil, more like the reverse side, like a brushed metal texture but lighter in color.  The metal, in the bright sunlight, had a bluish tinge to it reflecting the sun&rsquo;s light off of it.  They were what I would call the traditional cup and saucer shapes.  Two plates with the top one inverted over the bottom and an inverted cup on top of the two plates.  All four ships were of the same shape.As I watched one of them through the telescope (I could only watch one because the ships weren&rsquo;t far away to begin with.  Looking at it through the telescope brought it so close that I really couldn&rsquo;t capture an entire ship in my view, just a section of a ship), I noticed it was radiating colors.  Starting at the top inverted saucer of the ship, first a transparent red color, quite faint, would slowly move towards the bottom of the ship.  As the red reached the bottom, then the color green would start at the top and work its way down to the bottom, also transparent in texture, with the red color starting back up at the top again.Suddenly, as if on cue, they streaked out of sight. Within 2-3 seconds, they were gone.I can&rsquo;t say how long they were up there because I don&rsquo;t know how long they were there before we got that phone call, but from memory, I would guess we were able to watch them for about 10 minutes.The following day, in the local New Brunswick newspaper (The Home News), there was a picture of those UFO&rsquo;s right on the front page.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It was one solid object because the individual lights were perfectly aligned. It leveled itself out and just kind of hovered for about 20 seconds or so.  While all this was happening the lights on the object were rotating counter-clockwise. It then took back off up toward the sky and so fast... it just vanished. I live about 20 miles from where this happened.  I was just far enough to know that it wasn&apos;t a bunch of little objects.  It was not a flare.  We would have never been able to see a F16 from there esp. in the night.  We could tell it was one big object with about 15 to 25 lights.  I would imagine that if you were anywhere close to the site like 5 miles or so it would look like a fireball, but it wasn&apos;t we were had a perfect look at it. By the time we got out camera phones loaded up the thing was long gone.  Also, the local news talked about sending heli&apos;s up to the scene, but I didn&apos;t see any of them headed that way. They also said it was F16&apos;s last night. This morning they said it was meteor showers. Now they are saying it was F16&apos;s.

I kept looking up when I saw a craft flying at about 40,000 to 50,000 feet.  It looked like two oval shaped cigars joined somehow.  When I first saw it, I thought it was wreckage from some type of mid-air catastrophe due to its strange way of moving, but realized it was something else when it continued northbound in the sky for about 10 minutes. The way it flew looked like something tumbling, yet in control. Like it was rolling in all directions while still flying in a straight, coordinated manner. I am an extreme skeptic, and usually write-off UFO sightings as military craft, or natural phenomena. But, what I saw was not earthly.

I was finishing a smoke outside, looking at the Big Dipper, when I noticed a movement appear out of nowhere near the constellation.  I focussed on it and saw what looked like lights in the form of a triangle.  There were maybe 12-15 lights total.  They appeared to be a purer white color than the yellow hue of the stars.  They almost looked like a flock of birds flying in formation but steadily all together so I assumed that these lights came from one object.  If it were next to the full moon, it would be about 75% of its size.

Soon after arriving we noticed a light moving across the sky.  We watched and commented how it must be an airplane, but we thought it should somehow have different lighting.  It was a steady white light not unlike a star, except it did not &quot;twinkle&quot; like a star. As we followed the light across the sky we fully expected it to disappear below the horizon.  It did not.  The light circled around behind us and then disappeared below the horizon.  The area behind us was flat for several hundred feet and then rose ten to twenty feet or so.  While still watching where the light had disappeared, the light reappeared, still behind us relatively in the same area it disappeared.  It might have been several yards to the right in the clockwise circle it had started to make.  The light circled around us in a clockwise fashion very slowly for many minutes, sometimes disappearing below the horizon/rise behind us, always coming back up circling. At some point after reappearing from the horizon/rise behind us, the light dipped into a grove of trees to the left of the driver&rsquo;s side of the car.

Straight ahead of me- due east, were two bright red-orange lights just hanging suspended in the sky above and in front of me.  I thought they might be a reflection on my eyeglasses, so I removed them.  I was totally shocked and surprised by what I was seeing.  I put my glasses back on - the lights remained the same.  I could not make out a distinct shape because it was dark and the light was so bright. They started to move very slowly and silently toward the southwest.  Two more sets of lights, identical in every way, joined the first set.  They took a position directly under the first set of lights.  Then a third set of lights did the exact same thing.  There were six sets of identical lights arranged in pairs- each under the other.  They all moved slowly and silently - there was no noise whatsoever - toward the southeast.

It was a single light that moved (glided) very quickly right next to the last set of lights. I kept trying to identify by some logic what the lights might be: hot air balloons, flares, etc, but nothing fit what I was seeing. The lights continued to glide away toward the southeast and just immediately disappeared - they did not fade away - they just disappeared as if their lights went out.

As I watched the object it began to change colors and turned orange/yellow while moving up and down slightly more pronounced then hovering. The object then turned a red/ orange for a few seconds and then to black in the shape of a vertical line or sideways oval, then vanished. I began to look for the light again while driving and noticed in the distance of the general direction of the first event there was what looked like an air craft with contrails coming off of it ( like the tails of comets) usually the aircraft engines can produce this kids of contrail that is a V formation out the back of the craft but this one I saw was not, it was forming a U with the contrail, which I also thought was odd, it had to be a wide aircraft.

It was around 9:30 p.m. and the sky was mostly dark and cloudy. This specific &quot;hole&quot;, or clearing, in the sky was bright blue. A few seconds later, I saw a flicker of an orange color in that area. We kept watching, and suddenly another flash of orange glowed, much brighter and more clear,as if closer to us. It traveled slightly before going back out, or quickly disappearing. We saw a flicker again as if it were further away.  Then several minutes later my daughter saw four white glowing circular crafts moving quickly together. She got it on her cell phone video, approximately 15 seconds worth of footage. I studied the film carefully and noted that the larger one first zipped by in a straight line and flew behind the clouds, then suddenly returned back into view, moved in a circle, as if waiting for the three smaller crafts that then came into view. The first two flew together in a diagonal line, then stopped as one did a few circles and the other hovered around quickly in odd angles. Then, the fourth craft came into view, appearing to be the smallest. Once the fourth one was in site, the first craft zipped back into the clouds and the others seemed followed and just disappeared. I was going to make an anonymous call but was too embarrassed.  After hearing about the World News Report, I figured it was my duty to report this as others may have been afraid to report that day too.", "RED LIGHT UFO IN CANADAAt 11:45 i was looking outside my window and saw a peculiar red light strong shine flashing at a distant.It was stable for 15 minutes and then it moved further away and the light got smaller and smaller.

At this point, I was awake laying in bed hoping to get back to sleep, clock now reading 5:17 am, as I rolled over and stared out the window at two dim white stars in the sky to the left of the Grants Pass Peak, I then noticed that the star to the right of the other one was moving very slowly eastward.  As it moved slowly through the easterly sky the dim light got brighter and it appeared to get larger in size.  I jumped out of bed to watch it out my window as it continued to move to the east and to my surprise it started zig zagging upward and downward in the sky for a few seconds.   At this point I knew for sure it wasn&rsquo;t any airplane or helicopter.  It went back to its previous position in the sky and headed east once again.  Still in my view, I continued watching it and then it did something I didn&rsquo;t expect it to do and that is drop downward in the sky and circle around heading westward back in the direction it came.  The bright light and large size appeared to be getting smaller as it started dimming as it continuing moving westerly and then it disappeared.  I was thinking I had seen the last of it when it appeared further to the west and after a few seconds of watching it once more, it disappeared for the last time.Note: Our house guest was using our spa roughly nine hours previous to my sighting and seen a strange white light moving around in the sky above the same peak.", "Colorful light 1 mile N.

At first sight the ball of light was traveling at a low speed, then suddenly picked up to an extremely high speed and then dimmed quickly out of sight. The ball appeared strangely low to the ground, approximately 300 - 500 yards high.

At times, it would stop completely, then move in tiny circular motions.  It was stationary for approximately 5 minutes, then moved forward and then backward.

I am a Police Officer at Napa State Hospital and was on duty during this sighting.  On 03-26-08 at 21:07 I was looking west at the constellation Orion and the Pleiades. I noticed what at first looked like three stars in a triangular formation all moving together.  When I looked closer I could see the lights were on a triangular form that was darker than the sky background.  I watched the object move from south to north at what I approximate as between 500 to 1,000 feet in altitude.  I estimate the object was 20 miles west of me over the Napa / Sonoma County line.  The object seemed to be an equilateral triangle with a steady white light near each corner.  There was also a dimmer white light in the center of the object.  I would estimate that the distance between the outer lights near the corners was slightly less than the distance that separates the stars in Orion&rsquo;s belt. Based on these observations and my estimations, the object would have been quite large.  A rough estimate would place the sides of the object at 300 feet in length.  A better extrapolation could be ascertained from my previous estimations though.  The object was moving very swiftly and was completely silent.  I often watch aircraft take off and land at the Napa Airport while working on the west side of our facility in the evenings.  The evening was quiet and I could hear each aircraft as it passes over me, even those at high altitudes.  At the time I saw the object, there were no other aircraft in my field of view.  Additionally, I have some experience flying a Cessna 172 from the Napa Airport when I was taking flying lessons and am familiar with basic avionics and flight characteristics. At the distance and altitude I estimate the object was from me, the object appeared to be flying at a rate at least ten times that of the many commercial and private jets I often observe in the air corridors above Napa.  I continued to watch the object as it disappeared behind some trees to the north of me. I looked at my watch and marked the time at 21:07 then reached in my pocket for my cell phone.  I was trying to dial my phone by touch so as to preserve my night vision while looking back toward Orion.  As I did this I saw another identical object moving in the same manner as the first.  This was almost one minute from the sighting of the first object.  I continued to watch the object until it disappeared behind the same trees. I returned my observation toward Orion to see if there were any more.  I watched this portion of the sky while glancing at other portions of the sky for another ten minutes before I stopped to call my friend to tell him about the sighting.", "On April 17, 2008 White and Orange flashing lights from the east appeared.On April 17, 2008 @ approximately 9:15 we were outside watching a storm come in from the west. The lightning was all around and as we were watching it....some lights appeared from the east.I saw the flashing white lights over the tree line  on our property  and told my husband to look. When he turned to look....the white lights were gone and then all of a sudden we saw a row of about 15 to 20 rectangular orange lights aligned in a row flashing in a north to south then south to north sequence.I believe that I have seen this object before and so my husband got in his truck to see if he could get a look beyond the tree line. He returned about 10 to 15 minutes later and said that he could see nothing and yet the flashing lights continued after he got back home.We could not explain the lights. The object had no sound and was huge. ( we estimate about 150 to 200 yards long) and that the object was approximately 1/4 to &frac12; mile away.My husband refused to let me call the police in fear of ridicule, but we both believe that we have seen an UFO.", "large triangle very load3 lights on each corner of the ship on red on the back and a white two very loud dogs barking", "Two objects seen flying, stopping, and then dissipating.The first object was a triangular shaped craft. I would say it was at least three football fields wide and about a quarter of that long. There were five giant lights spaced at regular intervals from tip to tip (width) on the craft. The craft seemed to vibrant and hum as it passed overhead. It traveled fairly fast. It got to about 4 miles away and then it abruptly stopped* and then disappeared over a period of about 5 seconds. The spot where it was just looked many stars bunched together that are no longer there when you look at that general area. *With how big the object was and how fast it was traveling, it should not have been able to stop that fast and that&rsquo;s what made me first think that humans could not have made this. The second craft appeared about 3 minutes after the first craft disappeared. It flew from the southeast and was descending. I would estimate the craft was about as wide as the wingspan of a commercial jet and about as long two football fields. It had a cylindrical fuselage. It had one green light near the front and two purple lights at the rear. The front sloped down from the main body of the craft and was lower than the rest of the craft as well. I heard no noise from the craft. It also stopped very quickly and disappeared. Just like the previous craft, the place where the craft stopped looked like a bunch of stars. I saw or heard nothing more for the rest of the night, but the next evening I looked at those two spots and did not see the bunch of stars from the night before, making me think it was some kind of camouflage.", "UFO was seen back in the 1963 near Russellton PAI heard from one of my teachers that a UFO was seen by her and several people in Russellton back in 1963 with close encounter similer to the Cash-Landrum Case.

I casually looked in the sky as I normally do, and noticed a very bright flickering star that was emitting blue and red lights. I stared at the object for a few seconds and saw it start to move in a zig-zag motion towards the northeast. I continued to watch the object, while another witness came outside and I alerted her to the object. She watched the object for a few minutes when it began to move again. The object would sporadically move up and down or left to right , and even looped in a horizontal circle several times. The object would stop abruptly without any inertia from the previous motion. The object made these movements in every direction, but would only move either vertically or horizontally at a time. For a few minutes I was under the expression it was in a scanning motions, which the lights were apparently scanning the area around the object. I alerted a third witness who also noticed the motions. The object moved around very randomly in the southwestern sky. The lights would dim and grow brighter. And twice I saw a red glow shoot out from the object horizontally and disappear. It appeared to be turning itself , while the body was moving as well. The lights appeared to be facing one direction but would change very quickly as it turned. The object then would stop, and move quickly off and on for several minutes. The objects movement was almost too small to notice , except for a few drastic movements that made  us gasp aloud. The object then stopped moving and slowly dimmed as it drifted west. The object was visible for about another hour, but did not make any movements in that time. The object faded from our site around 23:15.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))", "Repeated Encounter in about 1980I have an incident that seems unique in the fact that the object repeatedly engaged me and two other friends over 30 to 40 minutes. I know that many years have passed, so this event may not be of interest. I just haven&apos;t heard of a story quite like this one.  At the time we lived in a small town, so we all agreed not to tell anyone about it, feeling we would be ridiculed.  Now, after all these years, we&apos;ve only just began to contact each other and recall exactly what happened that night.We were all about 20 years old or so.  I&apos;m not sure what year it was, but me and 2 friends were riding around in my car in Clinton, MO.  It was a boring night riding in circles around the Clinton Square, which is where all the kids hung out.  We decided to go see a friend in Windsor, MO, which was about 25 miles away.  As we were on the way, heading east on highway 52, I happened to see a flashing, blinking object on the horizon to my left, and mentioned it to my friends. It seemd to be blinking different colored lights that were unusual. They took notice, but resumed talking about whatever. I kept watching it as they talked and noticed it was coming closer to us from my left. (I was driving so I could see it better than them.)   As the object now came within a half mile or so, I interrupted my friends and said that they should take a look at this thing since it seemed like it was going to fly over us.  I shut off the stereo and as it approached it was obviously very large.  It had various stationary and blinking lights in a configuration that I can&apos;t quite describe, but as it flew over us, we only knew it was very large.  It slowly flew over us - I mean only 10 or 20 miles an hour at maybe 150 or 200 feet.  Right over us, but we couldn&apos;t figure out a shape.  Just BIG... and NO SOUND.  We hung our heads out the windows and looked up as it slowly flew over us.  It didn&apos;t make sense.We coasted along the highway and began talking about what it could have been as it headed toward our right-hand horizon.  As we talked and watched the object fade off in the distance, we eventually speeded back up and continued down the highway.  We soon realized the object was coming back toward us. (but from several miles away)  It seemed to be on an intercept course with our progress down the highway.  As it approached within about a quarter mile or so, I noticed that there was a circular light below the object.  As if there was a beam of light shining toward the ground, but you couldn&apos;t see the beam, but only a patch of light on the ground below the object.  There were strip pits in the surrounding area, so it was very strange seeing the patch of light floating up and down the hills below the object as it approached us.  I yelled at my friends when I saw it and we all became very uneasy about it.  Now it was upon us and just to the side, about the height of 3 or 4 telephone poles up.  It turned to parallel us and matched our speed, which was now only 10 or 20 miles an hour.  Weird blinking lights, maybe strobing or rotating, but very hard to describe, even just after the incident.  NO SOUND.  Not a whisper.  We still couldn&apos;t make out a specific shape, even though it was right over us. Only the lights that seemed to defy any aircraft-type shape.  Kind of like a big box, but nothing we could actually describe within reason.  We all had our heads hanging out the windows, looking up at it: RIGHT OVER US and it banked and flew toward the horizon to our forward, left.We looked at each other in disbelief again until one of my friends yelled: &quot;Chase it!&quot; I speeded up, but didn&apos;t realize that we were now within the city limits (and speed zone) of Windsor.  Now there were familiar flashing lights in my rear view mirror and we were pulled over.  I told my friends NOT to say we were chasing a friggin UFO and they agreed.  The Windsor cop walked up to my door and put his hands on the ledge of my door... I kid you not, he had &quot;L.O.V.E&quot; tatooed on his left hand fingers and &quot;H.A.T.E&quot; tattooed on his right. This night was getting wierder as it went on.  After he asked for my driver&apos;s license, I realized that I had left it on my dresser at home.  He asked my name and I told him it was ((name deleted)).  He went back to his car for a while as we chattered about what had happened with the object. The cop was the furthest thing from our mind.  He soon returned and told me he didn&apos;t have any record of a &quot;((name deleted))&quot; from Clinton, MO.  I corrected him on the name and he went to his car again.  We were now laughing about Barney Fife, but still trying to figure out what that thing could have been.  The cop returned again, now with a dumbfounded look since he had messed my name up again.  He said we should follow him &quot;downtown&quot; to the police station.  I gladly agreed and followed him there.  We went inside and he introduced me to the &quot;Chief&quot; who quickly pulled me up on his computer, showing me as Barry Wilder.  No Problem and thank you for your time.  We were quickly released.As we walked toward the door, one of us said: &quot;Wouldn&apos;t it be weird if that thing was still out there?&quot; We stepped out the door and looked to our right... There it was, about a mile or two down the road and seemingly hovering. We jumped into the car and gave chase again.  As we headed toward it, it began about a mile-wide cirlcle. We saw an dirt path that lead up to a small hilltop.  There were no trees or anything around it, only this &quot;bald hill&quot; as we called it later.  We stopped the car and got out as we watched the object circling toward us.  It was as if we knew it would fly to us.  It did.  It came directly over us at a speed of maybe 20 miles an hour.  We stood there in disbelievment as it flew directly over us.  Again, NO SOUND.  Nothing.  The sound of the mild wind blowing past our ears was louder.  It slowly flew over us and headed away for the last time.  We looked at each other in disbelief, but when we turned to look at it again, it seemed as if it was much farther away that it should have been at the speed it flew over us.  Soon it was over the horizon and gone.If I seem vague about dates and times it is only because after the event my friends and I decided it would be best not to tell anyone about it since it sounded so rediculous.  We lived in a small town and people would not understand what had happened.  Because of this, it kind of faded into my past.  I moved away soon after the incident so we didn&apos;t have much of a chance to talk about it until years later.  I just spoke with one of my friends and asked him about his recollection of the events.  As we spoke, he said that we actually turned around to follow it after the first pass.  I don&apos;t remember doing that, but we probably did.  I think if we all got together, we could work out the exact sequence of events.  It wasn&apos;t like a &quot;sighting&quot;... It was more like an ongoing encounter that we couldn&apos;t quite grasp, so I think we all just tried to forget it.The date and time could be verified by the Windsor Police Department, unless Barney Fife is in charge of records. They could also verify that we weren&apos;t drunk, on drugs or just crazy.  We were straight as a board and completely sane.  In the years since, two of us have become upstanding citizens and business owners.  The other one has been gone and not much in contact.I know this sounds a little unbelievable, but I&apos;d like to get together with my other two friends and refresh each other&apos;s memories as to the exact, cronological sequence of events. I would then like to take lie detector tests to prove that this really happened.", "Hearing a jet engine at an unusual time at night, looked out window and found it was chasing a flashing light.I live a few miles away from Hill Air Force Base in Utah so hearing jets are a commen occurance.  I was in my kitchen when I heard 2 jets fly a little lower than usual so I looked out the window and sure enough I could see the lights of the jets moving North - North West of my house.  I thought it might be another drill or weapons training that takes place often in the west desert in Utah but further watching them I could see that they must have been following something because of some sudden movements they were making which told me this wasnt a drill, nor an exercise.  I continued to watch when I lost track of the 2 jets and could see a red or reddish orange light sitting in the sky.  I thought it might have been a star because it was fairly small but the night was cloudy so that was out of the question.  The light was just sitting there, very still.  It wasn&apos;t growing or shrinking so I knew it wasnt moving towards or away from me, it just stood still.  Then it started to veer south fairly slow and as I could hear a jetcraft in the distance, the light got a little bigger, big enough I could see it changed colors from red to blue and then to yellow.  It started to move a little faster south and started flashing yellow.  I then found the jet moving in from the north behind it and the flashing light dissapeared as the now lone jet moved in a south to south west direction behind my neighbor&apos;s house.", "flashing object in southwest sky, changed colors from red to blue to white staying in same spot  for 30 minutes, then vanishedOn thursday April 17, 2008, my son wanted to ride his bike at around 8:45 pm. He asked what an object was up in the sky, and upon looking, I saw that it was a star and told him that. He for some reason has a fear of aliens. He thought the star was a ufo and to comfort him, I looked for other stars to point out. I pointed to the southwest sky and sid that there was another one. Upon looking though, I noticed it was changing changing colors from blue to red to white etc. He even asked why it was flashing and I told him that it was probably the effects of the atmosphere...what do I know, it sounded good to me. I thought it was strange but didn&apos;t think that much of it. The next day at work, one of the guys ( Bill, whom I didn&apos;t talk to at this time) who lives about 40 miles from me in Irwin, PA said that he saw a ufo. He told the guy that I&apos;m working with that it was changing colors from red to white to blue, and I said that was exactly what I had seen. On monday the 21st, I saw Bill and asked him about it. He said that it was in the southwest sky, and then I knew I saw what he had seen. He said that he looked at it through a telescope, and that it was surrounded by five other lights that would go on and off intermittently. He said that it had moved at one point also. He also said that it appeared on friday the 18th as well, although I didn&apos;t look for it that night. I decided that I would look for it on monday the 21st. Sure enough, it was there in the southwest sky, and the odd thing was that very few stars were visible due to the cloud cover, but this was a very brilliant light. This was at 9:15 pm. I went in and got my mini dv camcorder and took about a two minutes of video. I zoomed in with the optical zoom as much as I could. I made a dvd so I could watch it in slow mo. It actually changes from red to green to blue to white purple etc. Not neccisarilly in those orders. At some frames it almost appears to have a sort of diamond shape that is flat on the top and bottom. At 10:15 pm, I hap! pened to be looking at it, and it just sort of vanished and I didn&apos;t see it the rest of the night. If it is there tonight I am going to try zooming in with the digital zoom.", "Blinking, bright white light seen travelling at high altitudeWe stepped outside into the backyard in West Eugene and saw a bright white light that was steadily blinking. It was odd... aircraft generally have one solid white light with a red and green on each side. There was no noise... just a white light that blinked steadily. It moved steadily across the sky, directly overhead, and moved behind some high, very thin clouds. At this point, it disappeared. I stepped out into the front yard to scan the sky in the direction it was travelling.  It never reappeared! It travelled about the speed of a low-altitude plane, but was as high in the sky as a jetliner.  The light was brighter than a jet would be. Strange!  I have been a field investigator for 18 years. I&apos;ve spent much of this time investigating Bigfoot reports for Oregonbigfoot.com, of which I am the director.  However, I&apos;ve spent many years following up on UFO reports as well.

The road I was on headed straight towards the light that seemed fixed in the sky and as I kept driving (about 15 seconds or so) I realized that the light was no longer on then horizon, but now in my local area not more that a hundred yards in front of me and had transitioned from a yellow/golden light to a what appeared as a physical object with lights.As I continued forward I noticed a blue blinking light similar to an airplane, yet the object was completely stationary in the sky (so much so that I thought it may have been the lights on a radio tower, but I knew there were no radio towers in this area.)  I ended up driving almost directly under it and noticed there were more lights. I noticed about 5-8 different lights of different colors. They where blinking in unfamiliar patterns, not the standard, regular, repetitive way an airplane&rsquo;s lights normal blink, but they seem to blink faster with irregularity much more swirly and flashy than standard airplane lights (like an artistic light show). I was only under it for a second or 2, but noticed that the lights were circular and had a wavy character as if it were passing through a waving liquid media.The object was not that high up, only about as high as a 20 story building and was absolutely fixed in the sky. It was dark out and the object appeared to be black and in the shape of a triangle and about as long as a city bus. I passed the object and could not view it anymore as it was a behind me. I stopped my car a minute or 2 later to look and it was gone.From the time I saw it in the distance on the horizon until I drove under it was about 30-45 seconds. I thought that this may have been a helicopter, but it had no psychical similarities to one and I drove almost directly under it and heard no sound.", "green fireball-like object observed in the night skyFebruary 28th Approximately 7:30 p.m.I was riding in the passengers seat of a car as my friend was driving me home on Toleman Rd at about 7:30 p.m. There was three people in the car, a friend of mine was driving, and another friend was in the back seat. Never before have a seen anything close to what I witnessed that night about a week ago.I was looking up at the sky when I noticed what looked like a shooting star. I was about to even say &quot;Hey, look at that shooting star in front of us!,&quot; but before I said anything I noticed it had dramatically slowed down but had not disappeared. The object came to a halt and began to turn green, it started to grow and looked like a green fireball in the sky. It was round, and bright. It sort of began to look like a green traffic signal, but up in the sky. Then very suddenly it disappeared.For a few more seconds I thought about what I had just seen in amazement. Then I proceeded to say &quot;Please tell me, I was not the only person who just saw that.&quot;My friend who had been driving immediately replied that he saw it too, and that he could not believe his eyes. The third person claimed to have not seen anything, but admitted he was not looking forward where the event took place, but to the side out the window.", "Had just finished campfire dinner a took dog for a walk noticing all the stars as there was not a cloud in the sky.  Upon returning to camp with the dog, I noticed in the western sky an area that would rythmically glow/light up.  The main shape inside where it would glow appeared to have a similar shape to the little dipper hanging straight down.  There were no clouds in the sky, but this area seemed to eminate through a fog.  We watch for several minuets to about 30 mins. and it never moved.One in our group did take some video.  There were a couple of plane that flew below this thing and they were dwafted by it&apos;s size.  Would love to know what we saw, as all four of us saw it.", "Triangular shaped craft hovering over a desert /mountain area of  N. E. ScottsdaleOn March 19, 2008, I was leaving my gated neighborhood by car to teach a spinning class.  I noticed one bright light in the air about 4-500 feet above the road I was appproaching to make a turn on. I thought, &quot;What is that?&quot;  I looked out the window and then noticed there were 2 bright lights, like the headlights of a car.  I was frightened as I was the only car around...and this THING in the air right above me.  I kept thinking &quot;What in the H--- is that?&quot; Then I noticed 3 lights,2 in the front again like car headlights and one in the back of them, the craft shaped like a triangle.  I had the windows down, there was no sound.  It seemed to hover for awhile then started to gain speed and disappeared over the mountains in our area.  As it left the area, I noticed some twinkling lights, muted colors, behind the back light.It did not look like an airplane or helicopter.", "I saw a helicopter-size and silent object with a belt of lights rotating around it hovering over a park at night.I was walking on the sidewalk on the right side of the street heading west on 34th street from Telegraph Ave towards Martin Luther King Junior Blvd.I was passing a small park and noticed flashes of light. I turned and saw a dark object as big as a helicopter hovering over the park. It was silent and less than a quarter of a mile up in the sky. There was this belt of tiny irregular-flashing lights that would move around this big, dark oval object. The UFO started to go higher in the sky and it moved slowly back and forth like how you could swing a pendulum.  It was now about half a mile in the sky and gradually started to move North-East towards Berkeley.Never have I seen something like this before. It was shocking, and I want to know if anybody else saw it. I&rsquo;m glad I found this website to share this sighting of a UFO which I always thought was as a funny thing until this past Monday night, it is now certainly no joke to me. I am into astrology and astronomy, so I look into the sky a lot at night. The most amazing things I have seen are meteor showers, but now this is the top of the list.", "In Mesa, AZ, I clearly saw a large triangular ship, flying slowly---it turned / flew away at terrific speed.Below is my February 6, 1997 sighting detail, which I also reported to www.ufoevidence.org in November 2005.Appearance / Description of Object(s): The craft was approximately 20 meters in lenth and 10 meters high. I believe it was triangular in shape, but I am not 100% sure. Because it was NOT dark yet, I could very clearly see that this was a flying vehicle, which accelerated at terrific speeds. It appeared lit as it moved south, after accelerating away from me.Size of Object(s): Again, 20 meters long and 10 meters high. With my thumbs tucked behind, my other 8 fingers may have covered it had I held them up.Distance to Object(s) &amp; Altitude: Again, I believe the craft was about 60 meters away, and flying at an altitude of 100-130 meters.Description of Area / Surroundings: Mesa is a suburb of Phoenix, Arizona. The complex I lived in lies near an open field, train track and silos (south), at the end of a road that leaves the main road through town.Full Description &amp; Details: February 6, 1997 was my final day living in Mesa, Arizona.  The next day I moved to San Francisco. Done packing late in the afternoon, I left my apartment and began walking east, on the southern edge of the southernmost parking lot in the complex. I was headed toward the mailboxes to retrieve my mail for the last time.  To my right (south) was a concrete retaining wall that lines the complex.  Behind me, to my right were the large silos, which sit next to the train tracks.  There were no cars or trains passing by. Approximately 500 meters from the mailboxes, I began to hear a low humming noise behind me and to my right (south).  In my peripheral vision, I caught sight of a large triangular craft, the source of the low humming sound. The craft was flying very slowly, at an altitude of approximately 100-130 meters. It was flying over the train tracks, which lie about 60 meters from where I was walking.  At the moment that I turned my head to the right and looked directly at the craft, it stopped, turned right and accelerated to a terrific speed and disappeared.  The craft made NO noise above the low humming I initially heard.  It emitted NO exhaust, fume, smell or fire. It was very much like watching a movie, in real life.Can sighting be explained as any conventional man-made or natural object? NO way.  This was a craft that was being flown by somebody. ANYBODY who saw what I saw would instantly have known that.  The only question I have is, who was flying or controlling the craft?  Humans?  Extra-terrestrials?  Witness Background: I&apos;m a teacher in Brooklyn, New York having recently changed careers from advertising.  I have a masters degree in education.  My undergraduate studies focused on marketing and political science and Arizona State University (1990-94).Views on UFOs, before and after sighting: BEFORE the sighting, I was very open to the possibility that some sightings could be attributed to military tests.  However, I had seen some stories and movies that were compelling with respect to the notion that some UFO&apos;s could actually be extra-terrestrial.  Beyond that, I paid no extraordinary attention to the question, mainly because I felt the odds of seeing something inexplicable were very, very low. AFTER the sighting, I spent nearly a month in denial that it even happened.  Then, on national news, I saw the &quot;Phoenix Lights&quot; sighting on mainstream national news.  My first response was, &quot;That&apos;s what I saw.&quot;  Then, I was not in denial, but also did not speak much of what I saw except with very close friends. Within the last year, my curiosity has risen again, though it is very frustrating to imagine that I may never know exactly what I saw.  However, recently I have had very vivid dreams which strongly suggest that what I saw was extra-terrestrial in nature.", "Abrupt course correctionI spotted this object while stargazing at my home, in the Noordhoek valley which is sheltered from city light pollution.I mistook the object for a satellite but noticed it was slightly larger or dimmer than a satellite, though it had the absolutely smooth and constant movement of such.The object appeared to be yellowish gradiented to white in colour and was in the shape of an ovoid with short stubby wings that protrude from the sides, the same width of the craft, with the front and back edges lining up with the nose and tail of the craft. Like an egg with stubby wings that join along the total length of the body.The object continued on a linear path for +- 4 seconds after I spotted it and then abruptly and immediately made a -50 degree course correction, as if it had no inertia, and faded from view in about a second.", "Loud noise of an extremely low flying plane in Grand Rapids, MI, 4/25/08, from  E or SE, sounded like it was going to crash.I heard a very loud sound over my house.  My first thought was that it was a plane that was going to crash, however the sound lasted longer than an airplane just flying over the house.  I didn&apos;t go outside to look, however.", "Blue lights in a trianular shape southwest of Maumee, OhioWe saw blue flashing lights to the southwest of Maumee, OH. It was pretty far away. It seemed to hover some and move to the left and right some. We also saw a red light separate from the blue that was smaller and dimmer, but stayed close to the blue lights. It was not always visible. We went up a block from home for better visibility with a telescope (not a high powered one). Thru the telescope we saw that there were actually three blue flashing lights on one craft shaped like a triangle. We could not make out the definite shape of the craft due to the distance. It must have been turning while it hovered because the lights were not always in the same position. We watched it for about ten minutes and went inside, checking on it every five minutes or so. By about 22:30 or 22:40, it had disappeared.", "Stationary Light Flashing Erratically, and Low Flying ObjectA stationary strobe of bluish light was observed roughly 10 miles southwest of RDU Airport at 9:39PM EST. Two minutes of video has been recorded on a cell phone showing a stationary and erratically flashing bluish light.At approximately 9:40 a small blue light seemed to approach the flashing object from below and roughly east. At this point the larger stationary light ceases flashing and is replaced by a dim blue light at a constant brightness, and begins to travel roughly west, and away (and out of my view) from the approaching object &ndash; which also changes course, leaving the two lights moving in separate directions, almost simultaneously.It should be noted that the first, larger object/light had flight characteristics similar to a helicopter (though no sound was observed). The cell phone footage taken clearly shows the object as being stationary for the better part of two minutes. The footage also shows the light as flashing erratically and alternating between blue and possibly light green.At 10:02PM, a third object was observed. This time a neighbor witnessed. We both agreed that it was large, and didn&rsquo;t behave or sound like any plane we knew of as it flew very low and very slow with only a very slight humming sound. It was observed in the distance as hovering initially by myself. The neighbor observed it only after it began moving east from roughly the same area as the original lights were observed at 9:39-9:40PM. This object flew approximately 1-2 miles from our vantage point (near highways 55 and 540, and at approximately 1,000 ft. It traveled no faster than 80-100 mph as a rough estimate. We observed this object as having approximately 6-7 lights. A bright yellowish green light in front, three or more red lights around its center, and two flashing blue lights near the rear. It disappeared behind a row of trees after approximately 1-2 minutes.Given the relative proximity to RDU Airport, we agreed that it could possibly have been some sort or plane. But its total lack of sound considering the short distance, and its extremely low airspeed were obvious and unfamiliar to both of us.No discernible shapes could be made of any of these objects.

However, a smaller group of two broke off from the others and traveled in the opposite direction at a rapid speed.My neighbor was outdoors at the time, so I called out to him to confirm the sighting.  He could not distinguish what the objects where, so he went to his garage and brought out binoculars.  We both observed the objects through the binoculars.  The objects appeared to be indistinguishable (reflected?) lights or orbs.Unable to clearly make out forms we came to differing conclusions.  He believed  that what we observed must rationally be birds flying at high attitude.  I could not come to a definitive conclusion, fore I have often in my 50 plus years observed birds in flight and never did they appear like this.

Two smaller objects led a slightly larger object.  The speed of the front two, seemed to stay consistent, while the trailing one matched the speed of the front two for about half of the time that we viewed.  After that, it slowed while the others continued on.The trailing object seemed to stop, just as it was going to fly out of our view which would have been blocked by a tree and buildings.  I ran through the house to get to a better vantage point, but by that time all three objects were gone.The speed - honestly appeared to be about the speed I have seen satellites cross the sky, however I do not believe these were satellites - I have never seen three fly together...nor had ever seen one &quot;stop&quot;.  The larger trailing object, was much bigger than a satellite through the naked eye --  and actually appeared to be round.  The front two, though smaller, appeared to be round also.They made no sound at all.", "Saw a formation of crescent-shapped objects over suburban neighborhood.I was sleeping over at my friends house, when i woke up to a soft humming noise.  I knew i was awake because my arm, which i had broken a week before, was in pain. I looked around to see what the noise was, didn&apos;t see anything, and eventually fell back asleep. about 10 minutes later i woke up again, but the sound was much louder. Upon looking outside, i saw what appeared to be five crescent-shaped flying objects hovering and moving at an extremely slow speed (slower than an average walk, i would guess). They were about 70 feet above the house two doors down from where i was. They stayed there for a bout five minutes.

In the opposite direction moving north was an airplane with it&apos;s lights flashing as usual. Closer and closer they got to each other. I thought they were going collide. All of a sudden the objects light turned completely off. I couldn&apos;t see anything anymore. The plane then pass through the objects path. Soon after the plane passed, the object turned on some lights but this time they were strobing colors. The colors were red, yellow, blue, purple, cyan just an amazing array of different colors. One thing I noticed was that everytime the lights would flash the object seemed to advance about 500 yards more or less. I would see the object then in a millisecond of it&apos;s flashing lights the object would be further south. I live at the tip of Texas. Mexico is about 3 mile from where I live. That object was moving south towards Mexico. I kept my eye on it until I couldn&apos;t anymore.

Up to 3 balls were seen at a time. Objects are moving randomly.", "White and Yellow shiny starlike object moving irrationally and gracefullyMy friend and I (3:39 am) had the windows in my apartment open and saw a asterisk esque shining light hovering around closely and far away. We watched it for 5 or 6 minutes to see if it was making the path to the airport east of here. We were unnerved to see that it was tilting back and forth, in a seesaw sort of motion across the sky. The colors would slowly shift, some colors hard to see, but some colors were white and yellow. When it had no lights on, the body indicated a very soft-edged cone shape with irrationally placed red lights. Its path circled in a diameter around the general downtown area. It was disturbing because it looked so defiantly different than the typical police helicopters, care flights, and airplanes. That had a lot to do with its non-linear path, and slow, but very graceful speed. I&apos;ve never seen something like this before and wanted some insight on similar sightings, I didn&apos;t know if maybe extremely distant helicopters can give this impression, but then I doubt that. I doubt it because the light was very profile, it never moved in a three dimensional fashion, just sort of gave the illusion of moving two dimensionally. The irrational red and white blinking lights moved about this dark cone like object irrationally. It&apos;s also important to note that it was very large and resembled a huge shining star. One more thing to note is that you could not hear it like an airplane or helicopter. Two witnesses: Male", "Jackson sighting on 2/14/08 connected with Wall Sighting on same dateOn the date in question i was walking back from getting my kids and was looking up  in the sky to the north and noticed a lot of aircraft flying.  It was a clear night and i usally will see maybe two or 3 in the sky at a time but this was diffrent.  There were alot of aircraft in the sky flying in clusters of 3 and fours heading north north east. It was very odd. When my wife got home about 15 minutes later i was telling her how odd it was to see so many aircraft in the sky at one time, at that point I went back outside to see a cluster of 3 aircraft flying in the same direction at which point i called my wife outside to show her. Its is very weird that when checking this site to see if there have been any other sightings in the area I came across the people from wall township who saw similar events on the same date athough I saw it a little later in the evening.

I continued to look at it and noticed it was moving in a circular type motion, we then looked throughout the sky and noticed it wasn&apos;t the only one. We noticed there must have been between 20 and 30 of these moving stars. Some of them alone, some of them in 3&apos;s. When in 3&apos;s they formed a triangular trapazoid type shape. As I said some brighter than others but all making the same movements, as if they were hovering but sort of moving around and covering a very small area. Whatever this was, was there for over 2 hours. It was viewable from different areas in Montreal (Canada) as I called friends to go outside and look. It couldn&apos;t have been airplanes because there were no flashing lights whatsoever and it couldn&apos;t be a mass fleet of helicopters because there was no sound associated with what we saw. I&apos;ve never seen an object move in the ways I witnessed these &quot;lights&quot; move. I have never seen or thought I had seen a ufo before last night&apos;s experience, but I am sure that what I saw was incredibly abnormal and nothing I have ever imagined.", "Gaseous object with 4 bright lights speeds across sky over Lake Jackson, TX.On the night of May 4th at approximately 12:00 AM, I was sitting on the back porch having a cigarette. Earlier in the week I was driving down a highway (FM 2004) near my home. To my left I noticed what appeared to be two bright objects much larger than any star. They appeared to be changing positions, almost making formations with each other. It was hard for me to look at them and pay attention to the road at the same time. My first instinct was that I was crazy, and that they had to be planes or helicopters. The next time I had a chance to look for the objects they had moved a large distance in the sky. The next time I looked for them I could not find them. I was very curious about what I had seen, but it did not phase me that much. As I was nearing home I can see what appears to be a military aircraft flying overhead at a low altitude. The plane was flying low enough to where I could clearly make out the body of the aircraft from the lights on the underside of the plane. It was sort of an F16 type shape. It was definitely not a common aircraft. I do not recall if it made any noise. I got home and told myself that all I had seen were some uncommon airplanes flying in the area (possibly military).Throughout all of the last week that night has replayed in my mind. The more I think about it the more odd it becomes. On May 4th, as I was sitting outside something caught my attention to my left. I don&rsquo;t know why I chose to look that direction at that time, but I almost wish I didn&rsquo;t. What I saw left me sitting in my chair unable to move for several minutes. An object moving at an extremely rapid speed bolted across the sky away from my position. It had four lights lined up horizontally. They were huge and bright. They were mostly white but appeared to have a mixture of green and blue. I sat motionless in shock trying to come up with words to describe the object I had seen. My first thought of how to describe it was that it might have been 4 single objects moving sort of like a wave in some sort of an aura. While I was looking at the sightings report form on your website, I saw the word gaseous in your checklist. The word gaseous perfectly describes the object that I saw. The four lights were very individual, but they were all encompassed in the gaseous aura. It was a hazy gray color which was very contrasting to the bright white/green/blue&rsquo;ish lights. It appeared to be shaped sort of like a boomerang. It was either flying at a very low altitude or it was an enourmous object. It was simply the largest thing I had ever seen in the sky. The final detail is that it dead silent and it seemingly appeared out of nowhere only to disappear as it bolted across the sky. I would say it was only visible for a few seconds, but I was looking at it head on from start to finish. The sighting really shook me up. I can definitely say that it was unidentifiable. I became very emotional, sort of terrified. I shed a few tears and finished my cigarette. I couldn&rsquo;t stop looking at the sky even though I desperately wanted to go inside where I feel safe.About 5 minutes later I&rsquo;m still sitting outside and am now having another cigarette. I have settled down a little bit. My eyes are still fixated on the sky though. I see what I am almost certain is a helicopter. This is not unusual at all and I did not think anything of it. I could barely hear it; it was pretty far off in the distance. A few minutes later, I start to hear a dull rumble. I recognized the sound as a jet instantly. It wasn&rsquo;t loud, but it was the loudest noise at the time (it was very quiet). When I see the jet it was very similar to the one I had seen earlier in the week. Although this time it was at a much higher altitude and much farther away. It was flying in the relative direction of the unknown object I had seen about 10-15 minutes earlier.I&rsquo;m writing this right now and it&rsquo;s only been about an hour since all of this took place. I wanted to get my thoughts while I could still remember all of the details. I don&rsquo;t know if I am going to talk about this with any of my friends of family yet. I&rsquo;m scared that they&rsquo;ll think I&rsquo;m crazy. This sighting is so haunting to me that I feel I have to report it. I believe that I saw something that is truly unexplainable.", "Cited five orange/redish lights flying horizontal in an arched formation over Challis, Idaho.Cited five orange/redish lights flying horizontal in an arched formation over Challis, Idaho (central Idaho).

For about a minute it then abruptly started to move west and then it changed course abruptly moving east  and then just stayed in its position. For about 15 seconds it then drifted again east traveling up in a higher elevation By this time I pulled over and someone else behind me pulled over and we got out of our cars at the same time. We both were trying to figure out what it was. The most acurate part to what  we both saw was that there was about three planes coming in different directions coming towards each other so comparing the way it moved and looked was very much different compared to the planes we were looking at in the sky. The planes in the sky had blinking lights like every plane does at night and this craft did not.  The craft then again moved straight up in elevation then  stayed in its position for another 30 seconds and disappeared in the direction of space. Me and this person I have never met stayed by the street and  looked to see if it would reappear, it didn&apos;t.

(All three homes occupy the same land and are only a few hundred yards apart.)  According to their first hand reports, my mother called and told me that she could see a white strobing light in the woods just above and behind their home.  As she was speaking, she told me that the light was changing colors from white to red.  She was actually quite frightened over the situation.I next spoke with my brother who is a former deputy sheriff, EMT, and firefighter / rescue squad member.  He thought that it might possibly be the light from an aircraft that had went down in the woods, so he along with their neighbor (the chief of the area fire department) went to see what the situation was.  They could not tell exactly how far the light could actually be into the woods.  Some thought that it was close, while others thought the light might be larger, and farther away.As they went to examine the situation, the light (after changing colors, multiplying, and performing unusual movements) disappeared.  They eventually found an area that they all thought was the location of the lights.  There was an area of approximately four feet around that included broken limbs on trees, and the leaves and ground clutter was cleared.He got pictures of the light anomaly, but not of the possible landing sight.  I asked him to get photos of the possible landing sight for me, but there was a snow storm coming, which has now arrived.  I asked him to still get photos if he possibly could, to see if there was any reaction to the snow from the sight.  Either way, I told him to get photos of the area as quickly as possible.  I also told him to retrieve ground samples and samples from the bark of the affected trees in the area, and any other possible samples for future testing.", "Hi, I was just gazing at the sky at the horizon on the East when I saw a light floating in the sky. First I thought that it may be a Aircraft, but it was just floating in a limited area. Then I thought may be a Kite with a lantern in it, but a lantern will not remain floating in air for so long and that in such a limited area. So I took some shots with my DigiCam at 85x zoom using night settings. The images were astonishing, it was a circular object with lights at the bottom part and a glow..I took many shots, after around 20-25 mintues the magnitude was fading....I dont know what exactly it was..", "A lighting object in the sky at the morning before sunriseAbout 5:48, before sunrise, I saw some thing weird in the sky from my flat window. it was some thing like a jet but it&apos;s not jet , I took some shots from this object in the sky, it has a slow motion until it covered by a house so I was not able to see that object anymore.I will email some of the images to you and I also have RAW images if you think it could help you let me know.", "was heading south Giant triangle shapped craft, moving very slow with smaller crafts escorting it.Facing the southern sky at 5:40 a.m. The cloud cover was low I looked up and saw three lights forming a giant triangle.Hovering over the pasture. I then noticed four very tiny crafts also triangle shaped that seemed to be hovering along side of the huge one. Moving ever so slowly, I then looked even deeper straight up into the sky and shockingly realized there was an enormous grayish triangle that actualy covered almost the whole sky above me. I could barely see the outskirts of the sky itself! I watched in awe for hours as it moved ever so slowly.Then it went straight up so fast and out of sight. This is the first time I have seen this craft. I have wittnesed many other alien actions in this pasture with my son since November 2004! I can&apos;t describe in words these events. They usually always occur in November. This is the first time we have ever encountered anything of this magnitude.On other occasions, I have witnessed smaller alien vehicles that were landed in the pasture, which resembled only what I can describe as a &quot;tent&quot; with a glowing lantern inside. The actual beings I have seen range from 12&apos;tall and skinny, to short at 3&apos;. All with their own &quot;jobs&quot; to do in their alien race. I&apos;ve seen them digging in the field with what appeared to be an object resembling a shovel.Some forming an assembly line passing something down the line and loading onto this tent with the glowing light.Watching with binoculars ( which they get disturbed by ) if you watch too long! In one instance as I had been peering to intently, the tall one swiftly turned his head looking at me right back through my binoculars causing them to break inside, now looking through them everything I see is double! I have seen craft&apos;s that look like a birthday cake with colors of blue, red, yellow and green. One actualy lifting off the top of the other and seperating in opposite directions.There are many other instances we have enthusiasticlly waited hoping to see them again.This is also the first instance in which they have appeared during or close to a full moon. Another symbolism is that it always gets real cold like a bone cold when they are near. I have no doubt at all that they know we are watching them! They know we are there!Since Nov. 2004 many occurances have taken place which is totally mind boggling. My son is the person that brought this to my attention and at first I must say I was a little to aloof about the whole idea of such! My mind was completely changed after the first sighting.We think these are the aliens better known as ( The Grays. ) After all they are gray and do not seem to be aggressive. So many other odd instances too many to write on this paper! So I will stop noe. Thank you,", "Grey Translucent Being Studying Flowers in my Garden!  I arrived back from work at my house and after parking the car in my garage walked to my front door. I was amazed to see what looked like a typical grey alien being in my garden but I also noted the following. It was translucent, like not completely solid. It was taller than most reports of these things.. approx. 5 ft tall.. and it seemed incredibly thin and had a very pointed chin.. more so than what I would class as a typical &apos;grey&apos;. It appeared to be studying plants and from this point on I have no certain recollection of events. It didn&apos;t appear interested in me and carried on studying the plants. I have two memories of walking into my house. One is where I walk in and go straight to bed. The other is one of alerting the dogs and making them check outside... which they do not as they don&apos;t want to go (too sleepy). My wife was working till 7am and I was in bed asleep when she arrived. The strange thing is that the next day, I had no recollection of any of this. In fact it wasn&apos;t until some 20 hrs later that I remembered it. I told my wife as soon as I saw her the following morning when she got in from work (monday am) and she thought I was insane.. for not mentioning it sooner!  The other thing of note was that the following night I wasn&apos;t at all afraid to go out into the dark garage or garden. I never saw any UFO or craft on this night (although I have seen many previously) and I had the distinct impression this thing belonged here and had as much right to be here as I did. I have the sense it came from below the ground. I should also point out that I did see a large white light sweep across the sky the following evening as I was walking my dogs. I&apos;m confused - and it all appears very dream like and not real now. Anyways - I draw no conclusions - the info is just here for the record.", "Large triangular delta wing looking 10 to 15 lights not bright dull and dim it moved very fast.I need to tell you about what I just seen at 10:15pm central time March 24 2008. I live in Sioux Falls SD and had just gotten home.  I do not smoke in the house so i go out on the deck in the back yard to smoke.  at night I&apos;m always looking at the southern sky and looking at the stars when the weather permits. At first I thought this thing was a cloud when I seen it out of the corner of my eye.  But when I looked strait at it my heart felt like it was going to jump out of my chest.  Then I thought it might of been a plane with no landing lights on coming in to the airport. Then my eyes focused on it more and I thought it looked like a hang glider or a stealth bomber but this thing had a lot of dim blue/grey glowing lights on it at least 10 maybe 15.  This thing came in from the south east and swung in and up to the north it did not get right over head looking up I&apos;d say it got to an 75 to 80 degree angle off the horizon.  I cant tell the distant but it looked fairly high up. If you hold a ruler out at arms length it was 3 1/2 to 4 inches wide from what looked like wing tip to tip it looked big! From the time I first seen it to the time it faded away in the northern sky only took 30 sec to 1 min.  IT WAS AMAZING! I am going to work on some drawings of what it looked like and the path it took, Oh yeah it did not move like you would think some thing shaped like a stealth bomber would it looked like it was kind of side ways.((NUFORC Note:  See other reports for Chandler and Tempe, AZ, for the same date.

It was spinning ,it appeared to be a u.f.o.

I looked up the sky since there were few shower clouds earlier. The sky was very clear, only few whispering clouds scattered. I looked up towards the Orion constellation thinking how bright the stars looked tonight, when I noticed a star as bright as Sirius, which was also visible from where I was standing, moving across the sky from the right of Orion on a straight course from S.W. to N.E. As I was trying to focus looking for the blinking lights of the airplanes I noticed it was traveling at least at 30,000 feet altitude without any sound. No blinking lights just a steady bright light, and as it went over a thin cloud it started to fade into a normal size star in the sky. When it came out from over the cloud it kept on getting dimmer although it was closer to my point of view by then. I lost sight of it behind a building.This is the 3rd incident in the past three months of witnessing an unusual flying object in this area.  My first encounter, however, was in 1971 when I saw a fireball entering the atmosphere and after making a 90 degree turn it split into 4-5 smaller objects that traveled horizontally at a fantastic speed.

I&apos;ve seen jetliners all the time going into Seatac airport in Seattle, they approach from the east over the Cascade mountains. I&apos;ve seen many aircraft flying at night.  This was no aircraft.  There was no noise, and it was brighter than any star or planet, includng the planet venus. I would say it&apos;s altitude was about 3000-5000 ft., because it illuminated the clouds that it passed through and the jets weere under the clouds that were coming in to land at the airport.

Through my telescope noticed a donut shaped object with red, blue, yellow and maybe green lights moving in a quick circular motion.

I was watching the stars and planes in the night sky.I saw a bright light just for a breif moment so I thought it was a falling star and I just barely saw it.Then it flashed again and again. This was not a typical airplane or jet type flashing. It was a white light, very bright and steady. It would stay on for about five seconds and then go out. It seemed to be higher than planes and was moving slowly toward me from the south moving north. It flashed about six times and disappeared. Just thought it was very odd and I might report it in case anyone else saw the same thing.Based on the altitude I thought it could be the space station or something.

Very odd.No sounds before or after.", "UFO&apos;s practicing with the Thunderbirds?While eating lunch and watching the Thunderbirds practicing over Nellis AFB, I was at the north end of Hollywood Blvd, which dead ends into Nellis AFB. I watched the Thunderbirds go through practice routines at about the 10:00 position and I noticed small white objects at the 1:30 position. My first thought was that these were random pieces of paper caught in the updraft of a while wind (or dust devil). I have witnessed this before. These &quot;papers&quot; were very high in altitude, and hardly visible. Then I looked back at the 10:00 position to watch the Thunderbirds do a low altitude pass over.  As I was eating I looked back to the 1:30 position to see these objects slowly moving to the NE, and I noticed that there were 6 of these objects; the thought that these could be geese flying back north, and I wondered if there was any danger that the aircraft could hit them.  I observed the objects for about 20 seconds, and noticed that the were not flying in any formation and there movement was very slow to the NE. My eyes went back to the 10:00 position, the Thunderbird were doing their 4 aircraft going vertical and spreading out at the apex of their climb, and noticed that the objects were in the same area of the apex of the aircraft. I quickly looked back to the 1:30 position and nothing was there. Then as I looked back, the objects were closer together, moving up and down slightly, and then proceeded to travel to the NW until they went out of sight. Immediately the Thunderbirds landed in a rapid procession.", "pin head object disolves into vapor trailbright easter sunday clear day directly over head in the eastern sky looking from my porch balcony I saw a tiny quicksilver dot like the head of a pin in distance appear to dissolve into a vapor trail. anybody else see this thing was it a sat-alight, or a meteor?", "An object flying from the south slowed down near our house and then quickly flew toward the NWI went outside with my dogs. I have always enjoyed the night sky and as I looked up I realized there was cloud cover.  The clouds were heavy with moisture similar to dense fog.  I began to scan the sky to see if there was a break in clouds when, from the south, an object came into view. It appeared to be low flying and it was silent. I live in a very small town and the nights are always quiet.  The object had a basic triangular shape and at what I assume to be the front of the object was a white triangle, behind this triangle and out an equal distance to the left and right were white rectangles and behind them were two more  white rectangles.  To give you an idea of the brightness of these shapes I would compare them to typical white paper for printing against a backdrop of dirty white.  They were not bright but definitely noticeable.  The object flew over my house in a northwest direction. I ran to the backyard hoping to see it flying away but I didn&rsquo;t.This is the second time in three weeks that I have seen something unidentifiable come from the south and fly toward the northwest.  The first time it was a beautiful clear night with a temperature of about 40f.  The object was the same shape as previously described but instead of a solid white color there were bright white lights at each corner of the triangle and rectangles. It was as if the object was trying to blend in with its surroundings.  Another difference between the two was the speed. This time the object came from the south extremely quick, slowed down, changed direction and flew away even quicker than it appeared. It was in sight no more than four seconds.", "Green streaking light appered then went on beyound my sightTraveling South On Belcher Rd.

It was far away, so I can&apos;t really describe the size, but I&apos;m pretty sure it&apos;s smaller than an airplane, and a little bit smaller than a jet.  First, it was only one, then the second one caught up in no time.  The bottom part...or body, was gray, while the top part is black.

About 10 15 min driving distance. It rose up from the ground straight up and while traveling upwards much like a rocket it level out once if got to what looked to the normal height of a small plane or helicopter But traveled at least twice as fast as both of these. On its way up it seemed to spiral and had a beam of light out in from of it. The UFO was bright gold, and had this gold aura all around it. It may sound strange but it seemed to have a similar shape to a plane, it had a pointed tip and two wings but the wings were pointed as well it almost looked like a star, I couldn&apos;t see the shape of the tail end it was just glowing gold, brighter than any aircraft i&apos;ve ever seen.

I too was in Boulder Colorado, watching the night sky, at approximately 2130, in a park near Boulder Canyon.  There were only a few lights on at the time in the area so that my vision of the night sky was not obscured.  I too saw a very large (probably the size of a football field) triangular / boomerang shaped object cross the sky above me &ndash; going from west to east (I know because I was near the mountains and the object came from over the mountains).  It was very large, traveling surprisingly slow, and at an altitude I would guess to be less than 1,000 feet.  There was no sound associated with the craft, there were no lights visible at all, and it was very dark in color.  The only way I knew the craft was there was because I noticed it block out the stars above it as it passed in front of them directly above me.  I focused in on it and observed the very distinct outline of the craft and watched it maintain a straight course for 10 seconds until I lost sight of it as it passed directly over the City of Boulder.  It startled me so that I immediately went to a pay phone and called the Boulder Police Department.  Dispatch for the Boulder Police Department informed me that they had recently received over 20 calls already on the same observation. This wasn&rsquo;t 2005 as was the case of the report that has caused me to file this report &ndash; My experience was in 1983.  Unfortunately I don&rsquo;t recall the exact day.  I can only guess that it was late in the year, very possibly September.  I do know that I saw a craft, however.   I had recently spent 4 years in the Navy and was familiar with every type of &lsquo;publicly known&rsquo; military aircraft, and this fit the profile of none of them.  I have since gone on to develop a career in the Navy and have spent a great deal of time in a flying status.  To this day, I cannot identify a possible aircraft profile that I know of that is similar to what I saw in 1983.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I walked around the inside of the house thinking maybe it was the house settling from the wind but there was no possible way the sound was inside of the house.  It just kept pulsating a loud deep vibration (it made a noise that sounded like this.. wawawawawa...).  I could not explain what was going on and it wasnt until my brother came down the steps in the morning and told me about a bizzare dream in which unknown beings who had larger eyes than normal were trying to convince him to go with them, (i dont want to say the word alien but he described them as sort of a hybrid half human/alien look, he even said some of them looked deformed) he was frightened by his dream because he said it felt so real.  I know this story sounds off the wall, but i find it very strange that i heard something hovering over the house for a long period of time and he woke up to tell me about a ufo dream.

Sheriff&rsquo;s dispatch logs have reports from Chetek and Cameron at about the same time. But Rice Lake airport manager Jerry Stites said he reviewed the survelliance tapes from the airport, which could have recorded activity along Hwy. 53, and found nothing unusual. He did say, however, that the tape showed an aircraft doing touch-and-go landings at the airport from about 9:20-10:35 p.m. The family that reported the incident were all of Chetek. They first saw the object when they were driving northbound on Hwy. 53, taking one of the daughters to her job at Wal-Mart. &ldquo;The oldest daughter said &lsquo;What is that?&rsquo;&rdquo;  &ldquo;I thought it might be some new-fangled helicopter, then it turned on all those lights,&rdquo; the mother said. She said the UFO, which was larger than a semi, seemed to come directly to their pickup truck from the area of the airport. She said it hovered above the truck, only about 15-20 feet away. She said there was also a semi and another car on the road, and that the semi was swerving, possibly trying to get a look at what was going on. &ldquo;It was just the scariest thing&rdquo; she said. She said the object looked like a &ldquo;sideways teardrop,&rdquo; and had blue, green and white lights, and had a purple flashing light at the pointed end. Stites said airport runway lights will cause strange sightings, particularly in cloudy or hazy weather, but the mother said the UFO was definitely not a result of airport lights. &ldquo;There were lights on it that were lit. They were on the thing. I don&rsquo;t know anything that has purple lights on it,&rdquo; she said. She said the object quickly darted off. &ldquo;It turned and switched directions so fast,&rdquo; she said. The daughter said she always has a cell phone, with a camera, with her, but that night she was in a hurry and left her phone at home, which she never does. The mother said they dropped the oldest duaghter off at Wal-Mart, and that they had another encounter on the way back home. She said the object again launched from the airport and came toward their truck. The son said for a bit it looked like the craft landed, and that it had a red laser-like light when it went near the airport. &ldquo;It just sat there in midair, about 5 feet off the ground,&rdquo; he said. The mom said it followed the truck for about 4 miles, then suddenly disappeared. She said although brightly lit, the object made no noise at all. &ldquo;It was nothing from this planet,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;This is a real sighting. This is the real thing,&rdquo; she said. Spooner&rsquo;s Highway Patrol district had no log entries about UFOs, nor were there any entries in the Polk County sheriff&rsquo;s log. But the Barron County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department log had an entry at 10:19 that stated &ldquo;Three officers saw it too. Cameron, Chetek and Vince Graf.&rdquo; Graf is a county deputy. A Cameron police officer was on duty Monday evening. He said he saw something in the air near the intersection of Hwy. 8 and 53. He said it wasn&rsquo;t unusual. &ldquo;What I saw appeared to be a helicopter,&rdquo; he said. Medical transport helicopters are based at the Rice Lake airport, but Stites said there was no record of helicopter flights during that time period. Chetek&rsquo;s police log notes that at 10:28 p.m. all units were asked to look for a UFO between Cameron and Rice Lake. Reported was an object with four evenly spaced lights changing color from purple to orange to blue. The object was there for about 30 minutes and then disappeared. Sheriff Tom Richie said an officer saw &ldquo;some strange type of lighting, unusual lighting that he hadn&rsquo;t seen before, but it certainly could have been some type of aircraft, some type of military training, who knows what it could be.&rdquo; -04/16/08", "Glowing lightIt was a sunny day, with just a few clouds in the sky.

As I watched it I began to think realize that it was unlikely something like that could be that high and still in the air.  Then I thought maybe it was a white balloon, but it was glowing white.  I followed it with my eyes as it ascended, still bearing south, up into the clouds, but it never dimmed and maintained the bright glow. Then seemed to change it&apos;s shape as it turned to go west.  It was completely silent.  Once the turn was complete, it regained it&apos;s original, round/oval shape. I ran into the house as it passed my view and told my brother to hurry and come into the front yard with me.  We both ran out into the front yard, and both witnessed it acsend higher and higher into the sky, appearing more like a bright star in midday.

It looked metallic which is why I believe it was so shinny because the sunset was reflecting off the metallic surface.

Would Turn Into A Night I Will Never Be Able To Forget!!!I was looking in the sky yesterday night to say there weren&apos;t very many stars out.. The sky is very clear usually. When i looked up i happened to notice this very bright light.. It was a little bigger then the regular size of star. I asked my boyfriend what  it was, because i have never seen anything move that fast. For a second i thought it was a shooting star, it was NO SHOOTING STAR! He thought at first that it was a airplane but there was no blinking lights or anything to show it was a airplane..Besides it was doing triple speed of a airplane. We were on the way to Store to pick up cigarettes for a friend.. After i noticed it it began moving faster and staying above us.. When we stopped to look up at time i stopped in one spot and looked like it was hovering over us. Then when we started to walk it moves again which ever direction we moved it would hover above us.We walked very fast back to our friends house. My Boyfriend told his two friends to look.. When we got back out side it finlly moved from above the house almost and was going the opposite direction from where i first noticed it. Not even two minutes we were all looking at it, it then disspeared into the sky. I sat inside my friends house, scared out of mind. I didn&apos;t know what to do!! I never believed in other life forms or anything.. I don&apos;t believe in ghosts and i am not supersicious. After about half a hour we went back outside to go get my friend her cigarettes for the second time. We weren&apos;t more then half way there and i had seen these three bright stars in the sky.. I told my boyfriend again about something in the sky. There were 3 perfectly spaced apart bright lights, that weren&apos;t there before when we were outside.. I couldn&apos;t have been mistaken either because.. Like i had said before there weren&apos;t very many stars out and i am very observant. I didn&apos;t really think anything of it then i realized if it was o&apos;rein&apos;s belt or anything i wouldn&apos;t know because i was never into that kinda of stuff in school. i can honestl! y say i  have never seen that low to the ground stars before. But the fact it wasn&apos;t there before really didn&apos;t honestly scare me.. Considering what we just had seen not even a hour prior to that. We decided to go back again.. To scared to even walk our 5 minute walk to grab cigarettes... We got back inside and told my boyfriends two friends to come see this for themselves.. My boyfriends one friend is very smart when it come to stuff like this so we had asked him about it. The odd thing was the lights weren&apos;t the same color when we got out side they were an almost a green color as silly as that sounds.. After a few minutes they kept like moving a bit.. Almost like doing a VERY slow circular motion. Not even 5 minutes after that they faded away completely. My friends that were in the house came out and they thought we crazy because they didn&apos;t see anything.. They kept making jokes and thinking we were crazy..

I used to hear stories about people seeing flying saucers and thinking they were crazy and it was like a myth..

As one was looking at the Big Dipper, he suddenly noticed a very bright light, the approximate apparent size of a bright star, suddenly flare up at approximately zero degrees (true) azimuth, and at approximately 85 degrees angle of elevation above the horizontal plane.  The object was almost directly overhead of the observers&apos; location. The first observer quickly called the object to the attention of the other witness, who apparently already had observed it. The first observer checked the time of the event with his cell telephone, and the time of the event was measured at 22:11 hrs. (Pacific Daylight Time).  He then stated to the second observer that the event probably had been caused by the reflection of sunlight from an Iridium satellite. However, the first observer, who has witnessed dozens of Iridium &quot;flares,&quot; was surprised by the fact that the light appeared to be moving surprisingly slowly.  During the duration of the event (3-5 seconds), the object did not move more than from one quarter to one half degree of arc (estimated), much less than the typical angular velocity of a satellite in low Earth orbit. When the first observer returned home, he checked the website, &lt;www.heavens-above.com&gt;, and was surprised by the fact that no &quot;flare&quot; from an Iridium was visible at 22:11 hrs.

It was moving left in the sky, passing the stars, and abruptly it got smaller and smaller until I couldn&rsquo;t see it anymore. As it got smaller, it also got redder, until it just disappeared. Something else I must mention is the fact that when I first noticed what I thought was a star, it wasn&rsquo;t moving.  I looked at it for about ten seconds, it abruptly started moving for about 20 seconds, then faded away.", "Orange glow crossed shaped object seen hoveringI was waiting in my house for my fianc&eacute; to pick me up when my mom ran back into the house from the backyard and yelled, &ldquo;there is some weird object hovering over our house. At that time we both walked out the front door and noticed the orange glow of a hovering craft in the SE sky.  The light did not flicker like a plan or helicopter.  From the glow you could see the shape of the craft that almost looked cross shaped.  The craft hovered in the same position for a few minutes and then disappeared into the sky in the SE direction.My mom then informed me the news from what she saw.  When she was in the backyard is when she saw the object appear from the horizon in the SW, soundless she thought this was odd. The craft lifted up she said and then accelerated to the East.  At that point the craft shot through the sky at an unimaginable rate she said, like firework speed, but from a distance.  When we both saw the object from the front yard she thought it was impossible that something could start and stop in mid flight. Again, I only saw the craft hovering, however this was not a star, helicopter, balloon, or airplane.  I have never seen anything like this and I am sure there has to be other reports. At least I would research the FAA logs to determine if a pilot saw the craft.", "A bright bluesh/green light heading quickly towards the ground.It was 6:38 in the morning and I was walking to the bus stop, and I saw a bright blueish/green ball of light moving towards the ground at an abnormally fast speed.

Then I thought it might be an airplane, but again it was moving too quickly, and towards the ground.  I only saw it for about 3 seconds, then it was blocked out by the roof of a house in my neighborhood.

I am the only person here, in my home who witnessed what I am reporting.It was approximately 8pm, I was seated , relaxing with two of my three dogs.I have a full view of the mountains (the San Jacinto Mt. range).  I have floor to ceiling windows which allow me a pretty full view of the sky and the mountains.While seated, I saw an abnormally bright peachy/red/orange light approach.  It was as if it appeared from out in the sky, not from over the mountain top, like a jet or helicopter. It was the color that caught me off guard.  We have many helicopters flying to the Desert Hospital over head, but this was not the same, they usually come from the south.  The item in my view was much higher in the sky, and actually much brighter.  It moved from the top of the mountain range, east, slowly, maintaining its brightness.  The brightness was such that I could not discern any shape.  It was as if I were approaching a car with bright lights on in the evening, a stary glare.  I immediately felt that due to its color, which did not change, that it was very peculiar.  I was tempted to go inside and get my camera, but was afraid I would miss something, movement, whatever.  So, I kept watching it.  It moved from the mountain top to approximately 1/3 - &frac12; across the sky.  It stopped, as if hovering, as if it was a helicopter, and then, it took off, perpendicular to where I was standing, out into space and the very bright light was gone in  less then a two seconds.  I tried to garner any fragment of light available by using the light sensitive area of the outer peripheral portion of my eye, but it was gone.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

It moves up,down side to side, and in a circular motion. Very quick, not like a plane or helicopter. Sometimes it is close enough to see the flashing lights and sometimes far enough away to only appear as a star. But stars do not move, actually nothing I have ever seen in the sky moves like this thing does. I see in previous reports that other people in Missisiipp have seen this also, in the same area of the sky. Is there any reasonable explanation for what we have seen? This is for me the 3rd time I have witnessed this in a week. And frankly it is creeping me out a little. I do believe there is somthing out there, but why are they out there this close?

I am used to spotting commercial planes going to San Jose Airport and Military Planes going to the base coming inland off the coast as I watch the stars nightly. Last night right before midnight I had an urge to get up and went outside to peak at the moon, which was either full or very close.  Clouds covered the moon partially. The rest of the sky was clear. It was a beautiful small cloud formation. Others must have seen this. Although you had to be paying close attention. I suddenly saw an object. It was glowing, but had no lights. It glowed evenly around the craft with a slight green hue. It was more like seeing a giant shadow. It was large, massive, sort of rectangle but it had an angle that slimmed to the nose. It made no noise but the shear size of the object caused my heart to skip and me to involuntarily verbally blurt &quot;Holly SHi%T!&quot; I waited to see the shadow appear from under the clouds where I would really see it as it was not that high in the sky, maybe 2000 feet. I was a bit scared in honesty. It was so big and silent. It quickly came out of the clouds and what I saw was a huge glowing semi rectangular object move quickly across the sky. I could clearly see its underbelly. It was being followed by a large plane. It was not a civilian plane but it could not keep up with the craft. It certainly got a better view than I did. The underbelly had no visible markings, very stealthy. The size really shook me. It was like half the size of the giant craft in Independence Day, minus the lights etc. It was just a smooth surface glowing with a very defined shape. I would have to draw it. The sound of the sound barrier breaking thundered when the UFO left. This could of been the plane pursuing it as it was escalating in speed. The UFO was just there and passed out of view from the building as did the plane as the sound went off. The craft was gone very quickly but I know what I saw. If it was not a UFO unless the military has some very fast, dark,  glowing planes of strange dimension they are testing. The UFO seemed as if it was gliding effortlessly and with no sound. I could hear the plane as it came closer. I must admit it looked just very much like the only other UFO I have ever seen with my own eyes and with my mother very close up around 1973. I can find the exact date as we had a family death later that night. I was young. It was within miles of here. 20 other people saw it as the paper wrote it up the next day. It glowed the same way and was shaped the same. But in 73 it hovered right above the trees so close my mom drove off the road and we just stared and said nothing until it just disappeared. This craft looked the same but was moving where the one in 73 scared us both simply due to its size and left so fast, we did not see it move. I never forgot that night and the strange dark huge glowing object, only to see it again nearly 37 years later.  It was just as ominously as the first encounter. I had no time to grab my camera.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I went back into the house to tell tell my wife and got another set of glasses for her.  Now it had moved to mid height in the SW sky about mid height in the West.  I could not take my eyes off of it.  I was really excited and my wife was like no big deal but glad to have seen one.  You knew it was not a plane because a plane could not hover like that and make the very radical moves.I watched for about a half hour.

What i saw was a triangular shaped group of lights that stayed fixed in position but were coming more clearly into our field of vision (traveling south to northwest across vision). If these lights were at regular airplane flying level, the triangle object should have been at least 3 times bigger than a 747. At this time i was doubting what i was seeing because it was so unbelievable. It was not until the large object had passed bye us that i realized that there was absolutely no sound being emitted, and it in fact seemed quieter, as if all ambient noise was being hushed. The total time of this sighting was about 45 seconds. I would have to guess that the object was triangular and flat because when i saw it in the southern sky four lights were visible but as it passed by other lights came into view on the rear. The lights also would shift in brightness probably due to the angle which it was being viewed at. The object kept traveling until out of view.

I looked at it, noticing that it wasn&apos;t very high up, about 1/4 mile from the ground, about a 1/2 mile away from me, hovering over a field and some trees. From my view&apos;s distance, it was about the size of a small marble. I kept glancing at it, and when I realized that it wasn&apos;t moving I slammed on my brakes. I couldn&apos;t believe how bright it was, and I was so amazed that I exclaimed out loud to myself, lowered my window and checked to see if there were any other cars coming.

When it began to blink, the object silently began to move southwards, parallel to my path, and I started to drive again. It had crossed over in front of me, I was heading down a hill, there were some trees in my view. I kept braking to keep it in sight, suddenly it seemed to be heading more west, then east, then it distinctively was heading west, gaining altitude, and I saw an airplane about to intersect with it. At this point the blinking object was about the same size as the plane, a pinhead, they looked as though they met, but each kept going, and within seconds I lost the object over the trees, as the plane continued east. The plane&apos;s lights weren&apos;t noticeable, and it left a slight trail of exhaust. What had amazed me was that the object initially wasn&apos;t moving, was incredibly bright, and fairly low to the ground, then changed its lights, and moved silently and quickly, appearing to change its direction multiple times.

Could well be an experimental aircraft of some kind. This one puzzles me due to the size, low altitude, and the fact that another aircraft (plane/helicopter?) joined it to the southeast (toward Union Gap), where it appeared to stall or hover for a short while (+/- 5 min). Shorty thereafter, it was out of view (by the time I scaled my roof-top). I was letting the dog in around 11:40 PM when I spotted a large (originally thought to be an) aircraft flying directly over Yakima, WA in a S-SE fashion. It was way off any normal flight paths known or typically observed in the area. Not to mention the low altitude, estimated at 4,000-6,000 feet! The craft was extremely loud which obviously points to a plane of some sort. However, when it was directly above my neighborhood (central portion of the city), a strange triangle shape was clearly observed, and the lights were plentiful.

The sun would have also been in the sky although it was a dull morning). It was a cloudy morning and i would guess the cloud bank to be at 1500-2000 feet. The object was copper coloured and had what appeared to be lines on the underside(?) which formed a thick cross-similar to the nazi iron cross design-there was also a set of lines which went around the outer edge of this thing. This disc also travelled on its rim and climbed into the sky like a wheel. It was not hovering but moving steadily on its rim. I believe i was looking at the underside of the craft and do not know if there was mass or bulk (cabin or infrastructure) on the side i could not see. It was the size of a penny-a canadian or american one cent. i watched it until my head was almost on the dash board trying to see where it was going. Eventually it moved into the cloud bank and out of view.this is a diagram to the best of my memory.

PD))", "My grandmother awoke one morning to find a circular indentation, 10-15 feet in diameter, in the middle of her yard .I am 39-years-old, and I am guessing that what happened to my grandmother occurred in the summer of 1973 or 1974, in Titusville, PA.  I would have been about 5-years-old, and I have my own memory of what I saw.  However, my father revealed to me years later that there was more to the story. My memory of the event is as follows.  My family showed up at my grandmother&rsquo;s house for a summer visit.  (We lived about 6 hours away.)  We pulled up to greet our relatives, who stood around talking about something that seemed unusual and important.  My mother or father explained to me at that time that the circle on the ground in front of me (in the middle of my grandmother&rsquo;s yard) had recently and suddenly appeared.  I asked many questions for clarification, and the information I received was that one night something heavy seems to have been set there.  No one knew what but the speculation and joking was that a UFO had landed there.  Part of the conversation was that there were no tire marks or any other evidence around to suggest that someone created the perfect circle.  It seems like a big drum could have created the impression, but how anyone could put a huge, heavy drum there and why they would do so and then remove it made no sense.   My brothers, cousins, and I all decided to play with the impression, creating games from the circle and having fun while the adults chatted in a serious manner.  I would estimate that the circle&rsquo;s diameter measured 10-15 feet across.  And, as I recall, the indentation has smashed and broken the grass (not burned or scorched).  Brown dirt was visible in the groove that had been cut into the ground.  I remember the groove of the circle as being more v-shaped than flat.  The depth of the groove may have been about 2-3 inches.  I really can&rsquo;t be certain of the exact appearance and depth of the groove, but it was deep and pronounced enough to be seen from her house, from the neighbor&rsquo;s yard, and from the driveway. Years later, while in college, I asked my father about my memory, about which he expounded.  Apparently, my grandmother had been experiencing strange things a few days to a couple of weeks prior to our arrival.  That was, in fact, why we came to visit her.  The events had spooked her so much that she wanted company with her.  My active, pragmatic, not prone to exaggeration Pennsylvania Dutch grandmother had awakened one or two nights to find herself standing and staring out the window at a light.  She felt as if someone was calling her name.  She&rsquo;d &quot;snap out of it&quot; and go back to bed.  Then one night she awakened to find herself downstairs in front of her sliding glass doors looking out into the yard (at the exact spot that the circle appeared).  This really alarmed her because she had no memory of coming down the steps.  My grandmother was born with a problem with her hip socket that gave her a limp her whole life.  Making her way down the steps was a bit of a challenge to her, requiring careful balance and use of the railings.  Again, when she found herself standing at her door, she had felt that she had been staring at a bright light and that someone outside was calling her name, beckoning her to go outside. During these events is when the circle appeared.  My father believes that my grandmother had contacted someone about the circle and that a man from a local university came and collected a sample of the soil from the circular impression for testing.  My grandmother passed away in 1990, and my father never knew what came of the soil testing.  I don&rsquo;t believe that anyone thought to take a photo of the impression, which had disappeared by the next summer when we visited again.  (We kids tried to find it but couldn&rsquo;t.)  My family has been curious about &quot;the circle&quot; and what happened to my grandmother a few nights that summer for many years.

It was pretty clear out and just a few wispy clouds. My wife stepped inside for a moment and I called her out to take a look at something kinda of strange. I first thought it was a flock of pelicans flying in v formation but then as it came more into view it was to wide to be birds. It looked like a wide boomerang like the stealth plane ,but it made no noise at all and had no lights what so ever.We followed it from the back yard around the side of my house and then out front where it finally passed behind some clouds and we lost sight of it. At first it looked really low almost at helicopter hight and if it was at that  level it would have been the size of 2 buses but when it passed behind the clouds I knew that it was much higher because not to much later a small Cessna flew below the clouds and was much higher than I had first perceived. If this was at a high altitude it would have been huge.

I was commenting about the weather and blue sky when i saw it.  It (UFO) was soundless, wingless, and the last thing to come to my mind was space craft but i knew it was not of this world.

The jet appeared to be 7,000 to 10,000 ft altitude and may have been on approach to an airport in the New York City area.  As I watched the aircraft move northwest a silver object caught my eye moving northwest to southeast. The object was at a very high altitude. It appeared to be oval. It left no contrail and it was moving at a fast speed relative to my position on the ground. I watched the object cross over the sky and I lost sight of it after about ten minutes. The weather conditions were very good with an unlimited ceiling and no clouds.

I went outside and saw what seemed to be the egg-shaped and white Endeavor space shuttle moving in orbit at 17,000 miles per hour.  But I was very surprised to see a second white and egg-shaped object following the first object with some distance betwen them and in a straight line thru the sky until they disappeared from view.    Total time of sighting:  1 or 2 minutes.  I telephoned the Griffith Park Observatory and a staff member said the second object was probably a chase plane.  But a chase plane would not move at 17,000 mph at that high altitude in orbit path on its way to Florida.   The Endeavor shuttle landed in Florida (due to weather it had to make two extra orbits of Earth) on March 26, 2008.

Can you explain this?", "I witnessed a very large glow in the sky which cannot be attributable to any known aircraft and which descended into the ocean.While camping approximately six miles east of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, on December 25, 1978 I witnessed a phenomenon at 9:30 PM Pacific Standard Time.  Looking north, I saw a very large glow perhaps 2,000 feet above the mountains.  These mountains were less than two miles away and my very first instinctive thought was that a 747 had exploded.  In a few seconds I realized I was viewing something very extraordinary and tried to absorb details while yelling to other campers to wake up and see what I was watching.A friend&apos;s sister and mother emerged and immediately pushed the children back in the VW bus they were camping in.  One of them exclaimed it was a flying saucer--a thought I hadn&apos;t permitted myself to have.  The large orange glow must have been between 100-300 feet in length.  Within the elliptical glow were two smaller ellipses, perhaps one third of the way in from each side, which were brighter glows within the large orange glow and close to the color of a white florescent light.  One of the two women with me said there were two saucers, but I felt and still feel there was only one huge structure because the two brighter glows within the large glow stayed perfectly parallel to each other as the large glow descended to my left at about a 35 degree angel.I viewed this descent for about 45 seconds to a minute and a half.  The glow disappeared behind a huge rock called Cabo Falso, about three quarters of a mile away.  As the glow came closer to the top of Cabo Falso the brightness began to fade--alsmost as if it were burning out.  There were no sparks, but the extremely bright glow grew much dimmer as it got close to the sea.The next day I went to Cabo to find out if anyone else saw this light.  I talked with five or six others who had seen it from an outdoor beach bar and they said the glow went into the ocean.  Like myself, they were teachers enjoying a Christmas vacation.  The next year I spoke with a lady named Elsa who was married to Harvey--a couple we camped with for about ten years.  She told me that Harvey would not permit her to talk about it, but she had seen a large saucer hovering over brush not too far from where she was camped.  The saucer then flew above the mountains where I first saw it.  The next morning, Elsa told me, she examined the nearby brush and it had been burned a brown color by the saucer.  Elsa and Harvey have both passed away--they were in their 70&apos;s in 1978.I recall trying to listen if I could hear this glow, but the only identifiable sound was hundreds of coyotes howling from a mile or more away and beneath the glow.  There was nothing surreal about the experience--it seemed natural.  I thought at the time that all you had to do to see things like this is to spend a lot of time outdoors at night.  I have seen strange lights on occasion since, but these have always been 20 or 30 miles away and not identifiable.  The experience was the most memorable one of my life.", "bright orange light in sky hovers and disappearsI was walking through a park and I noticed what appeared to be an airplane at first.  The sky was clear, and there were no trees or anything else in the sky near the object.  It was between one and two miles away, and it was long enough to be an airplane.  It had no blinking lights like an airplane, but it had a solid pale orange/red light that was bright enough to be an airplane light, and what appeared to be windows. It did not appear to be moving.  As I kept walking, it disappeared.((NUFORC Note:  The witness indicates a date in the future.  We assume that the correct date is 04/29/2008, and we have amended it to reflect such.

I&rsquo;ve already reported this to the local police and they had no idea (though they took the report seriously).  But then again, this is a very small town and people tend to be very unconcerned here.A little before 11pm, an extremely bizarre series of noises awoke me and my husband.  It was a very loud series of booms or clangs along with a very loud hissing or static noise.  The booms were about 1-3 seconds apart and were random.  The &quot;hissing&quot; noise was consistent.The noise was coming from the sky and we determined it was moving.  The first few minutes very loud and it got progressively quieter.   No car stereo could possibly muster that much volume and it really sounded it was coming from above.Now, we live &frac12; mile from a race track and small airport and I&rsquo;m from a large city.  I&rsquo;ve heard a lot of noise in my life but NOTHING REMOTELY LIKE THIS.  It was way louder than the nearby racetrack or airport ever was.It was so loud and disconcerting we were watching the news because we thought something crazy happened but nothing.  Again, it&rsquo;s very bizarre.  I wouldn&rsquo;t know what to make out of this.  My husband half-jokingly said it could be one of those military aircrafts but what would they be doing flying over a small town like this?  Neither of us could remotely recognize either the clanging/booming nor the air pressure-like hissing to anything.P.S.  The police did say there was a boat show but that&rsquo;s at least 20 minutes away.  We&rsquo;ve heard fire works go off (the big ones) and this was nothing like it.

The area is rural but has scattered houses and farms.I was coming home from college. It was about 8:30 or 9:00 and I saw something moving downward at approximately a 45 degree angle at a pretty good speed. It was in the distance in front of me and I thought that it was a plane that was going to crash. As I drove on, it slowed its downward movement and leveled off. I could not figure out what it was. As I kept going I came over a hill and there it was, hovering in the sky off to my right, over a field. It was not very high up, I could see it very well. It was shaped like a saucer, the traditional flying saucer, with blue, red, and green lights that flashed back and forth on the bottom. It made no noise at all. It just hovered there approximately 100&apos; up in the air. It was a warm clear night and I just stopped my car and watched it. It eased across the road and hovered there on the driver side out over another field very close. I rolled down my windows to try to see if it was making any noise and it wasn&apos;t. It baffled me. What could it be? I looked from every angle I could think of, watched it and could come up with no answers. It finally began to move and it eased off to the east and went down behind an old barn. I decided I had seen enough and went on home. I am a college graduate, hold a graduate degree, and pastor a church, but I still can&apos;t believe what I saw that night.

The light was a bit bigger than a star, thus the abnormality in its apparent speed, if it were an airplane. The light also seemed very bright and consolidated,  with very faint flashing lights. At first I thought it was some kind of orbiting satellite, but that seems unlikely due to its visibility.  I live near 2 major airports, JFK and La-Guardia, and see all kinds of aircraft flying overhead at all times of the day.  This was different.  A plane flying at its height would be fainter, the blinking would be more articulated, and it would be considerably slower.  Also, there were other planes in the area, which made it easy to compare. After walking towards my apartment for a minute I turned around and it appeared not to be moving, and seemed to pulsate.Another craft, flying considerably closer than the first one, flew in from the west.  It had 4 lights rapidly blinking in an L shaped pattern: 3 of the lights making up the rod of the L were white, while the tip of the L was red.

Five bright lights in a circle, all of the sudden a large glowing orange ball appeared in the center. I was in shock. The biggest ball started to fade in and out as the five other objects stayed completely still, I would say I saw it fade in and out twice and then it disappeared as did four of the five other lights.

There were no coloured flashing lights (as on a plane) &amp; it seemed to be moving too fast for either a satellite or a plane;  it was nowhere near the normal flight path to the airport.

I feel there here was something strange about these lights; no noise, no coloured lights, and oddly fast.

I looked up in the sky to see the stars and saw a large red pulsing light in the western sky.  My immediate thought was, &lsquo;who put that huge tower up today??&rsquo;.  Realizing the light was too big to be a light on top of a tower, and the fact that we live in a very rural part of NY state and do not have cell towers or otherwise in the area, I continued to watch the light.  It did not move.  It pulsed brighter, then duller in a continuous rythym.  I went into the house and up to my bedroom window on the second floor to continue to watch it.  I called both my son and daughter into the room so they could see it also.  We were all mystified as to what it could be.   It was continuing to pulse but was not moving in any way.  I went to sleep and when I awoke in the morning to take my dog out again, it was STILL in the same position at 6:30am.  After watching it again for a few minutes it was just gone.  I waited to send this report so that I could see if the same thing happened again last night (thereby possibly being some distant tower, knowing it couldn&rsquo;t be), but there was nothing.  For the life of me, I do not know why I didn&rsquo;t film it.  I  have no explanation.  That&rsquo;s not like me.

I had gotten out of the car first, and was heading toward the house, when I turned back to see if my mother was behind me. I looked up a bit and saw a large craft, floating silently in the sky. It was round in shape but had a raised section in the center. The section had angled sides and a flat top. I yelled out to my mother, who came over and stood next to me while we watched and discussed it. I had the impression that it was quite big. It was floating what I think was about 6000-8000 feet above a very tall tree that was there, which helped me get perspective on it. There was nothing unclear about it. Over the next 10-15 minutes the sun began to set, we were entering into twilight, and some light clouds started moving in. At that time, the fire alarm for the town, which was a few blocks away, started sounding, but instead of just doing so several times, it just kept sounding, over and over again, without stopping. I spotlight appeared in the sky, which was scanning all around the area where the craft was. We speculated that other people must have seen it, and that they were probably trying to find it with the spotlight. It was frustrating, because they came close to it a few times, but missed it. At that time, I left my mother there and ran inside to get my father. He was a pilot in the navy, and had experience with observing aircraft. By the time I got him up and outside, the craft was gone. My mother said that it took off so fast that she wasn&rsquo;t sure which direction it went in. She told me a few years later, before she died, that it had actually vanished, and that she was so stunned by having seen it that she said it took off instead. She was afraid that if the said that it had simply disappeared, everyone would think she was crazy, or that she made it up, because in her and everyone else&rsquo;s mind, huge objects, especially ones found floating in the sky, do not just disappear.I told many people about this at the time, but found out very quickly that very few people would believe me, and that the one&rsquo;s who didn&rsquo;t would ridicule me. It was frustrating, but after a while I just stopped talking about it. The only thing that made anyone realize that I was telling the truth is that I was with my mother when it happened, and she was a very honest, rock-solid person. Any time the subject of UFO&rsquo;s came up in our presence, we would just look at each other and sort of roll our eyes. We knew what we saw.The second sighting I had was with five other people. We were outside during the summer, on a hot night. Our family friend, Mr. M, pointed out what he thought was a satellite, moving across the sky. We (me, my sister, mother, father, Mr. M and another young friend) were standing in our driveway watching it, and talking about satellites. But when it came to a certain point, it suddenly stopped, right next to a second light of approximately the same size and brightness. We were all quite surprised, since as far as I know, satellites don&rsquo;t stop like that. It stayed in that position for a few minutes, and then came the big shocker &ndash; the second light simply disappeared, as if someone turned off a switch. A few seconds later, the first light continued across the night sky, and over the horizon.I had one more sighting, in the summer of 1973. I was alone, in my bedroom, at the rear of the house. I was lying in bed, when I saw lights coming from above the house. There was no sound at all. When I pulled the curtain back, I could see a triangular shaped craft, but it was hard to see, because it was 10-11 at night, and very dark. There were lights on bottom that were strongly colored. I believe they were primary colors: red, a bluish color and a yellowish one. These lights were in groups of three and seemed to be rotating, on the bottom of the craft. It seemed to be hovering VERY low &ndash; maybe 200-300 feet. I was frightened, because it was so close, and my parents were out, so I was alone. It was all over in a minute. It moved on, heading north, over the house. I few minutes later, I went outside to see if I could still see it, but it was gone. At that time, a helicopter with no lights hovered over the house at a low altitude for 1-2 minutes, and then flew off in the same direction that the craft had. It was quite loud.These sightings were in Islip, NY, between approximately 1969/1970 and 1973. I know you don&rsquo;t want names, but I would like you to know that I would gladly take a polygraph, or testify about this in any forum. I think a lot of people have sightings but are afraid to tell anyone, for fear of ridicule. I didn&rsquo;t tell anyone about these experiences for years, for that reason.

I walked closer to look and saw several smaller, quicker flashes of the same color in the southwestern sky over the ocean.  The light was of such an unusual color that I was concerned, and having served active duty in the Air Force, I considered the rate at which the quick flashes occurred to either be weapons fire or a lightening storm.  I&rsquo;ve seen several lightening storms, and they were never of this bright yellow/orange color.  My gut felt it was weapons fire of some type, and a sense of dread had me grabbing my dogs and running under the covers.  I don&rsquo;t scare easily, but I was scared.  I told myself I must be wrong, overreacting, or half-asleep, and that I would see on the news in the morning that it was simply lightening.  No such incident was reported on the morning news, and nothing found on an internet search.  I know what I saw, and had to tell the truth in case somebody else noticed it or knows what it was and could explain it to me.", "On April 10 2008 @ about 4am bight lights heading in from the east towards my house.On the morning of April 10, 2008 at about 4 am I was awoken by a phone call from my daughter telling me that there was a possible tornado heading straight for my house. I turned on the news to find out this line of rotation expanded over several cities and was coming towards me from the east. At about the time the storm was to hit my house , my satellite went out.I went out the back door to watch and see if I could hear or see anything. It was quiet except for the thunder. As I was watching I saw a flash of light out of the corner of my eye coming from the west. I thought that it was stupid for a plane to be flying directly into a storm of such great magnitude. Then I saw the flash again only closer. I still could not believe this plane was still heading directly into a possible tornado. I turned to look at the plane and realized immediately there was something not right.When I turned to look at the plane... there was not only one light but a whole line of lights aligned perfectly in a row. I could see them over my tree line.  The lights were very bright and all of them were flashing. I tried to rationalize of what it could be. The lights were too close together to be planes or helicopters flying next to each other. I tried to hear an engine or a propeller and I could not hear anything. I was terrified because I realized it was not several objects ... but one big one and it was getting closer and closer.I started screaming and was trying to reach my husband by cell phone ...but he would not answer. I started to think he would think I was crazy, so I tried to take a picture with my cell phone. I was shaking too much to time it right. Every time I would take the picture, the lights would be off.  The 4th time I went to take a picture I looked up and froze. I did not realize how close it had gotten. I t was huge. I was screaming at the top of my lungs for anyone to hear.I started to rationalize calling 911 ....I did not want  anyone to think I was crazy. Then it had gotten so close that I did not care who thought I was crazy. As I opened the phone to call.....It thundered to the west of me  and it startled me so I turned to look ..and the storm was hitting my property line. I immediately turned back to the east of me and the lights were dropping down below the tree line.  I was scared to death that it had landed...but I could not tell.The light flashes seemed to slow down and continue about three more times and then nothing.They just stopped flashing all together. Nothing happened . I have  never been so scared in my entire life. I felt I could not call the police because there was nothing for them to see. It just seemed to vanish. I stayed staring at the tree line and crying for over an hour waiting for the sun to rise enough to assure myself there was nothing there anymore.I never thought I would be the one telling an UFO story.  All I can tell you that what I saw was not anything like I have ever seen. I do  believe what I saw was an UFO. If anybody can prove to me of what I saw was something different...please do. I have not slept very well since this has happened.", "Bright flashing lights seen in the night sky, same area every night, odd movement.Around 1:30 am March 23 I was walking past my hall window on my way to bed when I noticed how bright the moon was.  I stopped to look out at the night sky and I noticed a twinkling bright light in the sky that was much larger than the stars.  I thought it might be a plane or planet but its movement, size and the blinking multi-colored lights suggested otherwise.  I watched it for about 45 min.  The lights were blinking from side to side and were red, white, and what might have been green, blue or purple.  It was hard to tell what the colors were as the object was pretty far away but they were clearly multi-colored and extremely bright.  I steadied myself against the wall and put a finger on the window because I couldn&rsquo;t tell if it was moving or not at first.  My finger was on the window just under the object and as I watched, it moved in all directions.  It went left, right, side to side, and diagonal and at times got closer and farther away.  It seemed to be just hanging out in one particular area of the sky but was moving around in that area.  I have noticed this object before in the same spot as much as a year ago and didn&rsquo;t really pay much mind to it.  I also saw it following night around the same time but this time I saw it more clearly.  It seemed slightly closer.While I was watching it on the first night I saw something else.  It was a glowing orange thing that appeared to be much closer and larger though it was hard to place exactly where it was in the sky as it happened very quickly.  It appeared out of nowhere, accelerated and disappeared into thin air.  All I saw of it was the orange glow and the tail that seemed to form when it accelerated.  It was either moving too fast for me to see after it accelerated, or it just disappeared, I can&rsquo;t say which, but this object was just over the tree tops and was very large.  Far too large to be a comet or something like that and it was moving in an upward arc.  I would have never seen it had I not been watching the sky already.  I had a clear view of the sky in front of where it appeared and it really just seemed to come from nowhere.I am a 25 year old college student and mother of one.  I have never seen a UFO before and frankly didn&rsquo;t think I ever would but when I saw this object I knew it couldn&rsquo;t be man made just by the way it was moving.  It was really pretty startling to see how it moved and I have never seen anything like it before. It was high enough in the sky that it would have been easily overlooked.  I also noticed on the second night, closer to 2 am, that whenever a car happened to drive by on my street the object almost seemed to follow it with a light, as though it were watching the people below.  This could have just been my eyes getting tired but it really looked like the lights on the craft were pointing in the direction of my street whenever a car would pass and the object seemed to move around more.  It seemed to be more active when cars passed, almost as if it were trying to get their attention.Neither the blinking object or the orange object made any sounds that i could hear and there was no smoke or anything like that following the orange object.  I was unable to tell the shape of the blinking object because all I could make out were the lights.  The second night it looked closer but it was a slightly cloudy night and the object seemed to be in a clouded or hazy area.", "sighted 09/28/2001 no noise Richmond, Va. at 11:00 PM 2-3 minutes duration going west to east  shape of a sailor&apos;s capMarch 24, 2008  Dear Sir:  I have been a little hesitant to report a sighting two friends and I had some time back.       This sighting took place on Friday night September 28, 2001.   I might also add that one of the friends with me was an active FBI agent and also the driver of the vehicle.We were coming out of Richmond, Virginia at approximately 11:00 PM on the above date when we approached exit 58 on the southbound side of Interstate 95. On one side to the west is state route 150 with high tension electrical lines on the east running parallel to I-95 and (under construction at the time) to the west is  Interstate 895 overpass.We sighted a very odd flying object going from west to east.  What was strange about this is that the object had come in UNDER the electrical lines and was lit up in very bright white lights. The shape was that of a sailor&rsquo;s cap. This object couldn&rsquo;t have been 75 feet overhead. The vehicle was maybe 25 feet square and10-12 feet tall.  We had pulled onto the side of the road to watch this spectacle which had also attracted the attention of several vehicles on the northbound side of I-95.The object hovered over the roadway&rsquo;s columns for a few minutes and then very slowly headed east.I have seen pictures of lots of different shapes of UFOs, but I have never seen or heard of anything like this. Do you have any ideas? We didn&rsquo;t have a camera or video camera to take pictures of this. All three of us have discussed this several times and agree to what we saw.", "Rectangular Shaped 4 Red Lights Which All Blinked Out Within 18 MinutesAt approximately 20:15, as I was taking out the trash, and walking back into my apartment, I glanced up at the sky, and saw a triangular shaped patter of 4 red lights, located in the Northwestern sky. At least one of the 4 lights was set slightly back from the others, making the triangle off just a tad. The lights were at the approximate height that any helicopter, or airplane getting ready to land or having just taken off would fly. There was absolutely no sound with the lights. I walked back into my apartment to get my camera, thinking how odd that was. When I got back out, I almost did not expect the lights to still be there, but they were. It appeared as though the lights were moving very very slowly, because they had hardly moved at all. I attempted to take a picture, but was unable to get a good result. At the same time I was trying to get the picture, two other people were walking to their car, and also saw the lights. Upon staring harder at the lights, it seemed as though they were moving very slowly in a Southeasterly direction. By this time, the 4 lights had formed a uniformed triangular shape. As I watched, the furthest westerly light started blinking, and after a few seconds, blinked out. Then, the next light began blinking and also blinked out. Within seconds, the third light also began blinking, and then blinked out. By this time, the last remaining light had switched directions, and was now moving northeast. As I watched the remaining light, there would be times that it would flash very brightly, and I caught a glimpse of a shape of something, but before I could define it, the light would grow dim again. It almost seemed, as if it were a rounded shape, like the nose of an airplane, but much larger. As I watched, the singular remaining light continued to move to the Northeast, and then it just stopped. It would still continue to blink brighter, allowing me to briefly make out the shape of something, but then it would grow dim again. Within, 18 minutes of my first seeing the lights, the fourth and final light then blinked out. As I walked back into my apartment, I suddenly got chills, as if I had just seen or experienced something extremely important. In the past, I have seen other strange sightings, including something similar a few months where there were three lights also in a loose triangular pattern. All three of those lights eventually blinked out as well.", "There was a ring of blue lights that did not appear to move in the sky.I was exiting the freeway when I looked up and saw a small ring of blue lights.  It caught my eye as it was unlike any light configuration I had ever seen on an aircraft (there is an airport near by and we have a lot of heliocopter traffic, so I am familiar with standard aircraft lights).  I watched it for as long as I could until the turn of the freeway off ramp took it out of my field of vision.  I saw it for approximately 10 seconds and in that time it did not appear to move nor did any lights flash (such as flashing red and blue lights that is on standard aircraft).", "fireballs in a trianglei was getting home and looked up at the sky. it was clear. and then i saw about 13 fireball type red objects. they are arranged in a wide triangular formation. they were  about 100 yards above the ground. they were emitting rays of red light from them making them look like they were glowing. they were moving from north to south.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

PD))", "3 orange lights appeared in a line,one blinked out only to reappear above the next in line,it happened 3-4 times then lights disapearedWhile on a Boy Scout biking trip during Spring Break, we were crossing on the Ocracoke Island to Hatteras Island ferry at approximately 20:30 hours, heading back to our campground, after a day of biking. There were four of us out on the forward portion of the car deck, while most of the rest of the troop was on the back of the deck watching the wake, and the rest were in our bus. I am the Scoutmaster of the troop and have been a Boy Scout leader for years. My son was with me, as were 2 more of my scouts. I was looking towards Hatteras Village, when I saw what appeared to be directly above the village,(Several hundred feet in the air)3 lights blink on, one at a time. They were very brilliant in color, very similar to an orange looking halogen street lamp. There were 3 of them in a line, and there was no sound that I could hear, although we were on the front of a passenger/car ferry. They all faded out one at a time quickly, that&apos;s when I turned and I asked my son and 2 of my scouts if they had seen what I had just seen and they looked up to where I was pointing. That&apos;s when the 3 lights came back on, one at a time and were all in a line. As the light in the rear of the line faded out, another would appear in the front of the line. The lights stayed lit up for approximately 10-15 seconds each time, then they would fade out and appear somewhere else in the line, almost instantly. As we looked at this, I told my son to go get the camera out of the bus, and he ran back to get it. As he was running back to get it, several others on the other side of the front of the ferry were talking about it as well. I never took my eyes off of the lights, and when approximately 45 seconds had elapsed, all of the lights seemed to move quickly to the left, (again all in a line), then seemed to all move in a circular pattern, (once agiain all in unison), and they all faded quickly and did not reappear. We were very baffled by what we saw, and I KNOW WE SAW SOMETHING THAT I CAN&apos;T EXPLAIN.", "2/21/08 Converse, In   Lights  75 min   2 sets of 3 lights over country field viewed from carWe were driving on a state road heading West when two sets of three lights appreared in the sky to our right. We slowed down to look and they went off. We continued to watch in that direction and they appeared again and pulsated on and off, they had a soft gold glow.We then noticed a jet flying fast from a nearby air base, directly to where the lights had been. The jet then continued to circle the area before he flew off. We then turned North on another state road to try and see more. Sure enough the two sets of three lights came on again in a different area in the night sky. Again the jet came flying in and the lights went off. We set out in the country for another 30 minutes hoping for another sighting and saw just one set of lights,they pulseatedand then went off and that was it.Although we stayed out in the country for awhile we finally gave up reluctantly and went home.This happened on Feb. 21, 2008 at 8:06 p.m.", "Military helicopters escort UFO off to Fort Worth Miliary Base.we have had several sightings in Springtown Texas and Azle Texas back in Jan 18th. It was all over the news. I know for a fact because one happened right above my roof top. I live in Springtown. The military even had 6 helicopters surrounding it. It was round and had three rolls of white lights. The ufo was hovering. The military knew that I had heard the choppers and they were out there about 15 minutes before I stepped out on my back porch. We live on this country road an I was out watching the event. One helicopter shot a tracer off directly in front of the ufo to scare it into moving. When it did the choppers surrounded it and herded it off toward the military base in Fort Worth. So you can add that to the map. I also saw one back in Dec 05 again right above my roof top. That was my first sighting. It was scarey. This place I am told is a hot spot magnet for the darn sightings.((NUFORC Note:  The sighting the witness refers to may have been the events over Stephenville, TX.  That sighting occurred on January 08, 2008.  PD))", "10 to 20 lights in the sky above Honaunau, Hi 4/27/08I was inside my home exercising and noticed a glowing light in the sky through my window. I went outside to investigate. I noticed ten glowing lights resembling dim fireballs in the sky in an octagon formation with two or three in the middle of the octagon. I went inside to get my phone camera and when I got back out to the road to film, the glowing lights left their octagon formation and began to ascend in single-file into outer space. I watched as all ten (could be more) faded away at what seemed to be very fast altitudes. It wasn&apos;t over just yet.  Suddenly there were 8 to ten more where the first ten had been in octagon formation. They moved into single-file and ascended into space as well. There were many people on the highway stopping their vehicles to this spectacle. I could hear cars stopping and people talking about what they were experiencing. I heard one person say that they saw a glowing blue/green inside the orange/yellow fire of each light. This sighting took place on Sunday, April 27 2008 at between 8:30 and 10 pm. There was a report of a man down at Keei beach (4 miles away) who saw the lights in an upside down question mark formation at sundown towards the mountains. That was sundown! that means the lights were in the sky for quite some time (half hour+). When I noticed the lights, they were towards the ocean, meaning the lights were between the main Mamalahoa hwy in Honaunau and the ocean- a 4-5 mile area. There were two phases of lights. The first held formation, then ascended at approx 9:00, then 5 minutes later as second series of lights (from the horizon) ascended into  in the same place.I was pondering the altitude of the lights before they disappeared and 20,000 plus feet came to mind. There were dozens of whitenesses. There will probably be more reports of this same sighting. I filmed for five minutes. The movie took does not do the sighting any justice because of extremely low resolution. Only minute specs of dots are seen ever few seconds- nothing consistent to the actual behavior of the lights. here is the link to the video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o3AeYLiY-k  (may contain some foul language)  Thank you", "Fast-moving low-flying light disappears over Chicago.Last night my boyfriend and I were walking to his apartment on Columbia Avenue in Chicago when we saw a low-flying light crossing the sky moving south to north.  The light was quite bright and low enough that my first thought was that it was a flare being fired from somewhere nearby.  I said, &quot;What the f*** is that?&quot;, but the light vanished before I finished the sentence.  The light did not fade out or burst like a flare or fireworks would, it just vanished in the blink of an eye. The light was also moving in a straight line, like a flying object and not something shot into the sky (which would presumably travel in an arch across the sky).  It was moving quite fast before it disappeared.  The object was moving so quickly and was so bright my boyfriend and I were stunned into silence when it vanished.  Neither one of us know quite what to make of it.", "Cincinnati Nature Reserve UFOBright light was seen travelling low through the trees near the Cincinnati Nature Reserve.", "I saw a bright light that was intensly brilliant for a short moment than dimly traveled in a southerly direction.This probably isn&rsquo;t anything but it was certainly odd to me. I was on my cell phone on my back deck and was watching a small plane take off over the tree line from the Rocky Mount-Wilson Airport.  A brighter light caught my attention and I looked straight up to see what I thought at first was a star but it got brighter to the point that it looked  as if I was seeing the bottom of a rocket or missile as it fired. It appeared stationary and further up than the airplanes in the sky. I could not see any strobe lights or any other flashing lights that airplanes usually have. The object appeared to travel straight away from me up and became very dim in the period of about 3 seconds and then became dim and traveled in a southern direction until it disappeared about 2 seconds later. Again, this probably isn&rsquo;t anything but I stargaze frequently and have never seen anything like this.", "A point of light that would move very fast then stop then move again changing directions and even reversing its course.My wife and I saw a point of light similar to a star or satellite.  After watching a few minutes, it would stop suddenly and completely, then it would suddenly move again at what seemed to be a very high rate of speed.  When it started moving it would sometimes change its direction of travel and would even reverse its course.  It would move only a few degrees with each movement but after a time it had traveled across half the sky.When we first saw the light, it was near the left foot of the Orion constellation.  Even though it was changing course, its general direction of travel was to the north.  We have watched many airplanes and satellites travel in the night sky and this one moved like nothing we have ever seen.", "Ring with long arms and crown viewed in sumner county TNI was on my way to work to nashville, When I stopped at the stop sign at indian lake rd I noticed somthing out the top of my window, This thing looked to be about 200 ft off the ground just sitting still it was round ring with three very long arms that came to a point, It also had what looked like a crown or lots of pointy rods going all around the top of the circle,there were no light or bright colors it just looked gray or silver white.If I had to put a size on it I would say the circle was about 40 to 50 ft across the arms looked about a hundred feet long some shorter than the others and the crown on top looked to be 40 to 50 ft tall I may be wrong but it looked very large. I decided to get out of the car to takr a better look, I thought it had to be some kind of baloon for advertising or somthing when I got out it started moving not in a motion like a plane but up and down in the same place, then it rotated and just bliked out like you turned out a light. I have never seen anything like this before and am quite disturbed, I hope it is somthing military or some kind of projected image.", "low flying, slow moving retangular object making a low rumbling noise.Driving down Kemper Road (a small road running between two neighborhoods) at approximately 11:45 p.m., three friends and I heard a low rumbling noise. We looked up and saw a flying object. It was flying lower to the ground than an airplane or helicopter should. It was moving very slowly. It was rectangular in shape and had lights on all 4 corners. The lights were what looked like to be a mixture of orange and purple. The rectangle also had a funnel shaped object on top, sort of like a funnel to a tornado siren.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

The lines moved perpendicular to their shape.", "Green Light seen  flying towards Michigan with a yellowish-green trail.Green, shooting-star type object. This object was going down to earth on a slight angle.  There was the object and a trail of Yellowish-green tail. It was seen from two eye-witnesses, one in Rockford, Michigan. The other in Big Rapids, Michigan.

At first I thought it was a bird, but when no wings were moving I focused in on it with my eyes and figured that it had to be a loose &apos;weather&apos; balloon, or any type of balloon for that matter, ascending into the sky with the help of the wind.  Then I realized that there was no way it could be a balloon either.  As it continued to travel toward me (to the west) and further North, I was staring at it as its path advanced very quickly throughout the sky.  I could see it moving like no other &apos;balloon in the wind&apos; would ever move.  It was completely black and its shape was changing as it traveled through the air to the north before disappearing in the light layer of clouds that was layering the sky over the valley this morning.  It was clearly a thin (relative to my perspective), perfectly round disk of some sort, and while it flew, it spiraled and twisted like a flat Frisbee, a CD, or a flat rock would spiral if you were to throw one into the air.  It was twisting on it&apos;s axis while flying through the air (could not tell if it was spinning or not) very gently and softly but moving very fast though the sky.  The sighting lasted for about 2 minutes...from the moment I spotted it directly East of where I was standing, until the time it disappeared due North from my position.  I could see that it had a perfectly round shape when the angle was right, and I could also see its flatness when it shifted just enough on its side in the middle of its flight.  Its flight pattern was just like that of a bent Frisbee when thrown upside down...you know, it spiraled, sort of rotating on its lengthwise axis, as it flew, kind of twisting as its path advanced.  If you&apos;ve ever thrown a CD into the air, it was flying almost exactly like that, but proportionately, probably not as fast as a CD flung in the air.  It had very slow, smooth, ! almost f loating dynamics that made it seems like it was hovering almost...but it seemed like it was moving at a constant rate throughout the sky.  I could see its round profile and its flat profile as it spun/spiraled, depending on its position in flight relative to my point-of-view.  Its color was black, but it may have been that it was being silhouetted or shadowed or the like.  It was a flat, round disk, twisting and spiraling through the sky about as fast as it would take a small airplane to fly across that much airspace.  If one side was the &quot;top&quot; of the disk, and one side &quot;the bottom,&rdquo; I must have seen the top and the bottom about 6 to 8 times each.  That is about how many rotations it made on its axis.  Its size was not determinable, and the altitude at which it was flying was also not determinable, so I cannot make any postulation as to any of those details. I have never in my life believed in any sort of inexplicable flying objects of any sort.  I always thought that people that believed they saw UFO either had overactive imaginations or were just ignorant in terms of existing aircraft, or a combination of many other factors.  I do not wear glasses and I have perfect 20/20 eyesight in each eye. This was my first time ever seeing what in my mind, I guess, HAS to be a &apos;UFO&apos;, meaning there is no way I can explain what I saw based on my own first-hand experiences.  I have never believed in &quot;UFO&apos;s&quot; simply because I have never witnessed, first-hand, anything that I would qualify as such...there always seems to be an explanation (and there probably is one in my case, with my sighting this morning too!...I just don&apos;t have one right now!).  I always said that unless I see one myself (or a Sasquatch for that matter) I can&apos;t logically claim to believe in them.  This is my first ever &apos;UFO&apos; sighting.  I even caught about 30 seconds of what I thought would be good footage using my cellular phone&apos;s video application...to no avail.  Immediately upon recording the sky, I could tell that there was nothing visible showing up on my phone&apos;s screen.  Nothing showed up during the recording process and there is nothing at all on the footage I have saved on my phone...just the hazy morning sky...no black spot, no nothing!....the object must have been too far away to register on my phone (a 2 Mega-pixel camera-phone).  That is all I have to report.  Conveniently, I am making this report here because I happened to see your website on TV; a History channel special on &quot;the grays&quot; which ran last night, and that is how I knew that this is the place to come if I ever needed to make a report.  Well, wouldn&apos;t you know it...the day after that is the day I have my first UFO sighting.", "Black triangular/stealth shaped craft, white lights on craft made V-shape, craft appeared to move slowly, hover.Around 10:00pm while driving north on 235, I noticed a triangular pattern of white lights behind me and to the right, somewhere south of the Zoo Exit and north of Kellog/54. It was dark outside, but the craft appeared to have a stealth like/triangle appearance with several white lights silhoutting it&apos;s shape.

I lost sight for a minute when I arrived home and parked and exited my car. I looked in the general vicinity where I originally seen this and what I thought was an extremely bright star caught my eye. I didn&apos;t watch it continually at first but kept glancing back as I carried groceries in. Then I stopped and watched it closer. It was only white at this time. I noticed that it didn&apos;t look like a typical twinkling star because it was so much brighter. Then it seemed to be shimmying a little or maybe slightly wavering from side to side. The light on it then appeared to be scanning. I called my mother to get her to watch it. She agreed it was moving and the light appeared to be going around in circles or scanning. It gradually started to fade farther away but was still noticeable to us. Although if I had only seen it at this point I would have definitely thought it was a star. Then I noticed a red light that seemed to come from it. This red light was getting more and more bright as the other was fading more and more. I watched the object with the red light go from west to east just opposite of what the first had done. It traveled along the mountain steadily just as if it were a typical plane I have seen at night. It did seem much lower though. I watched it as far as I could see it and it done nothing significant. The other light continued to fade and eventually I could not see it at all.

The eclipse was hard to see with some clouds interrupting the view, and so we were gazing about at the stars looking for satellites to watch.  We saw several satellites and shooting stars.  Sometime during the eclipse, I&rsquo;m pretty sure it was past the halfway point, someone noticed something and said, &quot;They look at that!&quot;I looked up at approximately 10:00 in the sky, above the height of the moon, but southeast of it.  I saw what appeared at first to be a bright star, a point of bright light.  At first I thought it was a star, then it grew larger and brighter then all the other stars in the sky.  Although it was growing larger, it remained stationary. My next thought was that it was a helicopter, with it&apos;s spotlight on, pointing at, and coming directly towards us.  It made no sound as it grew brighter, then it appeared to turn away and head south.  As it turned, it dimmed considerably.  This I would expect from a searchlight beacon.  Then it dimmed more, until it was no brighter than a star, and no larger.  As it continued moving south it&rsquo;s path became erratic, the way a star looks through a telescope as you&rsquo;re trying to center on it.  It moved up and down, in a jerky motion.  It continued this way, worming it&rsquo;s way through the backdrop of stars until finally it was too dim to see.  The whole sighting event lasted about three minutes.

I managed to get one picture of it with my digital camera before it moved, it kept changing positions around the sun, it was first on the left, then above it, then underneath it. I took some more various photos but they are a bit blurry but still easy to see. About two minutes after I started taking photos of the object I spotted two round objects very close together in the sky, that were different colors. I also have a picture of them. I also took one photo, and didn&apos;t see the object until I got home and enlarged the photo on my computer, it was a silver colored perfectly spherical object, in front of a cloud which was in front of the sun. I took about 10 photos total, and about 5 of them actually have the visible objects. The whole sighting lasted only about 5 minutes total. It wasn&apos;t until I got home that I saw on the news that there was another sighting that evening in Texas, in Baytown. I thought that was eerie.

At first my driver thought that it was some kind of firing range and we were seeing tracer rounds, the army uses red tracers when they are conducting night fire exercises, but the only problem was the spot we saw the lights was a camping area for the non-commissioned officer school, I knew this because that was the area I went to school before I became a sergeant, and another thing is that why would someone be firing live rounds near an ammo point.So, I radioed in to the command center and notified the officer of the guard and advised them I was going to go investigate the lights. So I had my soldiers load there weapons and be on high alert and my driver and myself started up the hummer and rolled to the area we saw the lights, we used a spot light and we could not see anything and we identified ourselves and no one replied to or calls.

Upon standing up, we were getting into a theological conversation regarding Native Americans when she pointed behind me and asked, &quot;What is that?&quot;  Upon turning around I had roughly thirty seconds to view and compile what I could possibly be seeing.  It was in the formation of a triangle, moving very slowly across the night sky, too slow to be a jet, and it appeared to be soaring at roughly 1000 feet above the ground.  The formation consisted of three straight faintly illuminated lines, almost appearing like straight fluorescent shop bulbs. I attempted to rationalize the sight into some sort of concrete explanation before it disappeared as slowly traveled too far to be seen (the lights appeared to be about half as bright as the stars seen around it, but it was quite obvious that it was close to the ground).  I first thought it may be three geese gliding in formation, with nearby light reflecting off of their bellies, but this was quickly disproved, as the lights were perfectly straight and geometrically in tact as it appeared to turn slightly before leaving our vision.  My next thought was a stealth aircraft (as there are military bases within distance on either side of us), but after viewing pictures of said aircraft, the straight lines of light prevent this from being the case. It should be noted that my wife was actually afraid of pointing it out to me, as I am notoriously skeptical...

The 2 lights looked similar to stars and did not move in a straight line. Going generally from east to west they moved in bursts of high speed. There were erratic directional changes in their path. While covering this path the two objects also moved in relation to eachother. They repeated a path of semi circles. The lights started out larger  and brighter at the start of their path, by the end they were too far in the distance to see. It was still high above the horizon as it faded away.

Friday the 7th/December/2007, 20.55hrs. A Woman,58 yrs old, in Launceston, Tasmania, sitting in her lounge room at 20.55hrs noticed two lighted objects, moving from the east toward her house.  These objects, only seconds apart, lost altitude and elevation from 30degrees elevation, to 20degrees elevation, before rising again to about 30degrees and made for a steady course and altitude in a southern direction, and accelerated away. NOTE.....Two other witnesses were present, and both describe the same event (report forms are being expedited, and information to be added here)  The woman then picked up a cheap pair of binoculars from no more than 1.5 mtrs from here window and focused on the objects, for a better view...... As the two objects moved south, it was noticed that two stationary objects were hovering, one above the other, at a reasonable altitude towards the southern end of the first 2 objects trajectory    Approximately 30 minutes later, two objects moving north were seen on the same flight path as earlier, but reversed.  When the objects returned to their point of origin in the sky, it is said they accelerated and gained altitude until they disappeared from view.  These objects are described as being of a triangular configuration, with a white/blue - green prism type colour effect, at each point, and a thin white line of light between each point. The sky was clear of clouds, apart from some weather moving in from the horizons to the east and north, and the moon was not visible.  The sighting occurred in an area of sky not usually known for air traffic, by the witness, her family and some of the local residents, 2 of which have lived in the area for over 20 yrs. The witness describes her state of mind as frightened, and then curious and moving more to a state of acceptance.  She has always been a believer that we are not alone in the universe, but has never before had a sighting of her own.  The witness is a full time carer, of her elderly mother, and a professional therapist.  As an avid artist she also has a good eye for detail, and her memory seems not to fail her in conversation.  The Witness also has a good knowledge and deep interest in the area of astronomy.. Saturday the 8th/December2007, approx - 20.55hrs  In approximately the same position as the previous nights sighting started, a stationary object became visible, described as being three straight lines of light, hovering in a partly cloudy sky.  It is said that the lights seemed to give the impression that they were only part of a lager object, of an ovoid nature.  The same three witnesses then moved to the outside of the house, on the eastern side, for a better view   This object was visible for ten minutes, until clouds moved in and obstructed vision.  At this time it was noticed that there were approximately 12 other objects, slightly bigger than stars and bearing the same colours of the previous nights objects, peppered across the sky.  The colour of these objects was noted as not being normal for stars, even with the light pollution from the city.  There were some small fires burning around the state, high altitude smoke haze could have caused some alteration in the appearance (colour / aura etc.) of some brighter stars.

His experience was that he saw the fireball separate into four different distinct smaller objects, only to converge seconds later back into one fireball before disappearing. The speed of the object was much faster than a plane, but it lingered in the sky for at least 20 seconds before completely disappearing. There was no sound, and it did not breach the horizon, it simply disappeared!

I noticed it for about a couple of minutes; and it moved a bit to the north of the horizon, and it hovered over an area for a few more minutes and suddenly disappeared. I also noticed no sounds and it was almost see through triangle craft, it also had one red light on the tail but it was like in the middle of the end of the craft, so it was not an air plane or a helicopter.

The Los Angeles Times newspaper said the Endeavor shuttle sped in orbit at 17,000 miles per hour on its way to the landing in Florida.  I saw the egg-shaped, white Endeavor shuttle  moving through the evening sky.  I was surprised to see a similar egg-shaped white object following the Endeavor shuttle thru the sky at some distance behind the shuttle.  I did not know what the second object was.   Later I telephoned the nearby Griffith Park Observatory and they said the second object was probably a chase plane.

The window was just a small opening that opened outwards and opened from the top, not the bottom.  I was shocked that these &quot;silver monkeys&quot; were trying to get into the house.  I started running to go into the house and tell my aunt, and then everything went blank.I know that I never did tell her about the silver monkeys because in the evening, she was giving me a bath and I asked her to close the window because I did not want the silver monkeys to come in.

While on commercial flights I typically follow the flight progress by looking for airports below and trying to figure out our position. My wife and I were flying out of San Diego on a commercial flight on 16 April that departed about 3 pm local time. We were seated a few rows in front of the wing of the MD-80. About fifteen minutes out of San Diego we passed over three very remote airports at an altitude I would estimate as between 12,000 and 15,000 AGL. The area is desert mountains and is very rugged. The last airport I saw was marked &quot;US NAVY&quot; on the approach end of the northwest-facing runway (about 320 degrees). From referring back to aviation sectional maps I believe we were just south of El Centro, AZ, which is located in an area of highly restricted MOAs (Military Operational areas). I have noted that the sectional maps warn that there is a tethered surveillance aerostat (blimp) north of El Centro at between 5,000 and 15,000 ft MSL. What we observed was clearly not a blimp. About a minute after we passed over the US Navy landing strip, which was situated between two small mountain ranges we both observed a large, extremely bright and shiny metallic cylindrical object below us, on the opposite side of the eastern range about 20 miles from the airfield. The cylinder was oriented north/south. Based on its relative size, I initially I assumed it was another commercial jet traveling about 2 miles to the north of our track and a few thousand feet below us, but I could see no wings or tail or markings. As our jet flew eastward we observed the ground gradually disappear beneath our wing and as the Navy landing strip disappeared we noted that the metallic cylinder was not moving away from us but was nearly keeping pace with our aircraft, although we were moving slightly faster. What was most interesting was that the cylinder was oriented perpendicular to us but traveling parallel to us. The craft did not move northward; it was flying perpendicular to how a normal aircraft would move. Realizing that this was highly unusual, I now spent some time trying to calculate the size and distance of the craft, based on my experience with visual cues at altitude. Based on the ground detail and runway appearance, I would guess that we were at 15,000 ft AGL. By comparing the observable detail on the cylinder, which consisted of two parallel lines running almost the full length of the craft as well as some slight variations of surface texture on the highly polished surface, I would guess that the craft was three to four hundred feet in length and traveling eastward at about 7,000 AGL. The craft continued to travel in an eastward direction, running parallel with our jet, until it disappeared from view beneath our wing.", "two lights cross the sky in eastern europeThis might not be anything.

The temperature was 59 degrees Fahrenheit; clear skies; 58% humidity; visibility 10 miles (weather.com).  At the 101/I-5 junction in Downtown Los Angeles, I noticed a bright light near the Downtown LA skyline.  As I connected to the 101 freeway junction heading toward the light, I noticed that the light was in fact two (2) lights pointing down.  At first, I believed it to be a police helicopter; however, it appeared to be &ldquo;locked&rdquo; in the same spot, too steady to be hovering.  The almost-golden colored lights were large and close together; reminiscent of heating lights used to keep food warm at a buffet restaurant.  Noticing that there were no vehicles behind me nor ahead of me, I proceeded to slow down to 30 miles per hour (I was initially traveling at 65 mph); at which point I was observing the object above my vehicle slightly to the left, allowing me to see it without the roof of my vehicle obstructing my view.  The object appeared to be at about 700-800 feet in mid-air. The shape of the object as viewed from directly underneath resembled the shape of a human eye; almost that of a football.  The lights were pointing down and were definitely not police helicopter lights (of which there is only one per craft; usually unstable and blue-white/halogen type).  Combined, the two lights took up an estimated 70% of the shape in which they were contained. The object did not produce any visual/audible means of propulsion.  Its surface did not display any flashing lights, such as those of a police helicopter (flashing blue and red strobes on the sides) or any conventional aircraft.  The surface was dark-metallic.  Thin, fine, vertical and horizontal could barely be seen across its dark surface.  The top or &ldquo;side&rdquo; of the object was not visible, since it was viewed from underneath. The area in which it was hovering in is assumed to be restricted airspace for airplanes; both private and commercial due to its proximity to the skyscrapers of the downtown district (less than a mile).  The nearest airport, Los Angeles International is approximately 15 miles southeast of Downtown LA.  Commercial and private airplane routes approaching the Los Angeles Metropolitan area head westbound almost directly above the 105 Freeway, which connects North Orange County/South Los Angeles County to LA International Airport.  This busy and well-known airplane route is approximately 10 miles south of Downtown LA.  It is also viewable 24 hours a day.  Goodyear blimps are known to fly in the area since Dodger Stadium is nearby; however, blimps are not known to display large, exceedingly bright lights.  The object observed was definitely not a blimp; it did not glide or appear to exhibit slight movement.  Dodger Stadium was not hosting any events that evening. After reviewing a map of the area, I estimate the object&rsquo;s position to have been directly above Santa Fe Avenue &amp; 7th Street (near the 7th Street bridge over the LA River) in Downtown LA. As I was observing the object from my vehicle (window down, traveling at 30 mph); I glanced ahead quickly to make sure my vehicle was on track before I glanced back to observe the object again.  This went on for about 45 seconds.  As I glanced at the road quickly (about 1 second), I looked back up and the object was gone.  The area of sight in which I had the object in was large enough for me to track a helicopter or an airplane even at high speeds.  As I circled the Downtown LA area via the 101 junction ramp (first northbound, then northwest bound); I scanned the area for the object; however, it was no longer present.

We were looking into the sky at stars, small aircraft, etc. I looked ESE and saw, just above a tree line, four small white lights in a triangular pattern (three on the left side, one completing the back right corner) travelling approximately south.  I said to my brother, &quot;What the heck is that?&quot; and pointed to the lights.  I had initially thought it was a formation of planes, but it couldn&rsquo;t have been; besides the fact that there were no red, blue, or any blinking lights, it became apparent that we were looking at one solid object. I only realized this as the triangular object began to move behind trees.  My brother was standing to my left and had a better vantage point, and he saw it dip down, come back up, and then fade out.  The whole incident lasted a few seconds. A few minutes later, a helicopter started circling around that area; it&rsquo;s difficult to determine distances, but I would say that the helicopter was probably closer to us than the object had been, and a little more south.  It had a bright search beam on and searched for about a half-hour.

At first sighting I thought it was a small aircraft in distress, on fire and going to hit ground. After a few seconds I realized it was a UFO. Only able to view for about 20 seconds.", "Unusual streak of green to blue light flew down the southern sky.While driving home about 04:20 EDT, north of Jasper, IN by about 5 to 8 miles, I was facing south and saw a greenish to blue-ish streak of light in the southern sky, heading mainly south with a little to the west.  It was only 1 streak visible as most of my view was covered by a thin tree-line. As far as identifying the object, it could be anything due to the thin line of trees in the way.  All I can confirm is the streak of light that appeared and disappear suddenly at approximately the given time.  This is the first time I have seen a streak of light like such that was like 1/4 of an inch thick from my view and distance.", "V shaped objects seen in the night sky over central Indiana, USAFirst I want to say this was no meteor shower. My wife and I live between Noblesville and Lapel, we have left the house to go to work at 10:00 pm. as we pulled out of our driveway onto 186th street we notice what to be an object with several different color lights to the North West. Within 30 seconds we saw what appeared to be five to seven yellowish lights appear to the left of the first object in a V shape and shortly there after another group of yellowish lights appeared just below with the same V shape. We stopped the car and rolled down the windows we heard nothing, no sound at all. These lights we stationary and not moving, we watched for about 2 to 3 minutes then noticed the first object disappear and shortly there after the two V shapes were gone, just disappeared. There was no sound and no other type of flashes that would be associated with an explosion. We did not see any trailing streaks as has been reported by others. A short while later my wife did say that she had seen a falling star with a trailing light behind it. We don&apos;t know what it was that we saw, but we do know that it was not a jet liner as our house sits in the flight path of Indianapolis International Airport in which we see jets preparing to land every night. This is really strange and we agree that we will never know what we saw Wednesday night for sure. The Military and government has a long history of covering up the real truth, thinking Americans cannot handle the truth thus causing panic among the population.", "Strange light in the southern sky (Oklahoma, 1988).I remember the date of this sighting because it was the day before my grandmother died. It was around ten o&apos;clock at night (I don&apos;t recall the exact time),and I stepped outside our house (I was 19 at the time) south of Stonewall, Oklahoma, and looked up at the southwestern sky.  There on the horizon (high enough that it wasn&apos;t anything land based) was a large (larger and lower than the stars) whitish-amber light, &quot;sitting&quot; perfectly still.  I had lived at this location all my life then, and had never seen anything like this light before. For about a minute or more, the light was perfectly still, and then it started moving slowly eastward.  Over the course of probably two minutes it moved from the southwestern sky to the southeastern quadrant of the sky.  Then it stopped and remained stationary for perhaps two or three more minutes, whereupon it simply went out, as if someone had flipped a switch and turned it off. Over the period of perhaps the next three years, I saw something similar to this sighting perhaps three more times.  Once my mother (now deceased) witnessed it with me, and another time my brother did.  Neither of them had any idea of what it was, either.", "My first true UFO sighting!After my co-worker called me on the nextel, I rushed outside to see what he was watching. From the time I step outdoors, I observed a circular object follow behind a passenger jet. This lasted for approximately 20-25 seconds before the object made a sudden 90 degree turn towards the south and raced off through a cloud formation and disappeared from my sight.", "Black Triangle with lights and no sound.I was driving on RT 19 south between the small community of Enterprise toward Shinnston, WV in north central WV. As I drove to work for the midnight shift, I saw a bright light in the sky.  It was brighter than the usual star so I assumed it was a helicopter.  Besides, I could tell the light was moving. As I drove through Enterprise, the light seemed to be getting closer.  I passed through Enterprise and came upon the community of Big Elm.  The light had mysteriously disappeared.  When I came around a turn near the Big Elm Elementary School, I saw something big just above the treeline over West Fork River to my left. I slowed my car to take a closer look.  The object had three lights in a triangle shape.  The lights went between red, orange, blue, and yellow.  I turned into the driveway to the school and got out of my car.  I heard no sound.  As the object slowly passed above me, I could tell that it was a triangle shape against the night sky above.  It looked to be about the size of a football field and to be only about a couple hundred yards above me.  The object passed by me.  I watched it pass by the school until it was out of my sight.  Still no sound.  There were no cars around until after the object had passed above me and was going toward the school. I continued on my drive to work.  When I got to work I called my wife to tell her my story.  We live in Rachel, WV.  The object was moving North East in the direction where I live so I thought maybe she could see something also.  When I called her, she went outside to look at the sky.  She said she did see three lights in the sky that were in a triangle shape.  She didn&apos;t hear anything.  We can&apos;t be sure that she was looking at the same thing I saw but she also watched the object until it was out of her sight and did not hear a sound.  This is the second sighting I have placed on the website.  I alse reported the light that went into the moon.  My wife is so disappointed that I have seen objects but she hasn&apos;t.lol  I will continue to post other UFO experiences I may have on this site.", "objects i&apos;ve never seen before.the objects were triangular and looked to be on fire. it was dark so i couldnt see veery well but the object came twords us maybe a mile and a half away. and did a spiral up motion, were it seemed only one side of the object emited flames, but it looked all on fire. it twisted  up and just got out off sight. the first object came twords us then spireld up, the second followed a minute later and had the same flight pattern.", "saw 5 objects doing amazing manuevers for 20 minutesHello,    My name is ((name deleted)), a desert storm veteran and a 12 yr USAF veteran.  I want to make this report just to do my part so we can someday find out the truth.My incident happened on Thanksgiving in 88 or 89.  I&rsquo;m not really sure of the actual year, however, I am 100% certain of the day and of what I experienced.  I would like to add that at that time I was assigned to a Special Ops unit in the USAF out of Frankfurt Germany and I was just visiting my in-laws for the Thanksgiving Holiday.My father in law and I went fishing up in the mountains of Alamogordo, NM on Thanksgiving.  We fished Silver lake all day and were suppose to come home early for dinner, but decided to stay late since the trout were biting pretty good that day.  By time we were on our way back home to Alamogordo, it was dark, however, it was a very clear night with no clouds or overcast.  We&rsquo;re driving up and down hills coming from the mountains.  Alamorgodo, NM is home to Holliman AFB and next to the White sands missile range.  Also, this little city is based at the bottom of the mountain range and it is pretty flat down in the basin where the city sits.Anyway, as we are going up and down hills, we finally get the part of the trip, where you can actually see the entire basin, the city and a little past the city, there are two large Mountains or very large Hills (they are the only two large landmarks on the other side), which are located behind the city from where we were coming from.  As we are driving I started looking at the two mountains ahead of us and I noticed some lights by them. As I started watching them fascinated by the brightness of them, I noticed that there were three lights and they were moving in odd ways.  One would go up vertically, then speed off at a 45 degree angle behind the mountain, then it would speed back in front of the mountain.  Then soon, 2 more lights joined them.  I would describe them as bright white spheres.  Anyway, these 5 spheres or lights, were just doing the most unimaginable maneuvers in front of these two mountains.  I watched them for about 3 minutes to make sure I was not seeing things and finally told my father in law about them.  He started watching them as well and after a couple of minutes, he stated what the hell is that? We watched them for over 15 minutes and the entire time they were flying, hovering, speeding from point to point and even at times disappearing and reappearing on the other side of the mountains.I must state that I worked on the flight-line a lot, during the day and night and am very familiar with aircraft lights, at night, during the day and have a lot of experience working at night on the flight line. I can tell an aircraft or a helicopter with no problem.  I must also state that during my assignment in special ops, our unit worked closely with Navy Seabees, 82nd Airborne, USAF special forces (Combat Control Teams) and even had the opportunity to support Delta force.  Our unit covered all of Africa, Europe and the Middle East, so any missions, wars, conflicts or humanitarian efforts in those theaters, we covered and supported via the flight-line, during day, night, snow, sun etc..Getting back to my incident.  I guess it&rsquo;s hard for me to describe exactly what the 5 spheres were doing except by saying they were kinda of doing a star shaped pattern next to the mountains.  Also, I could not make out the details of the mountains, but I could see two huge dark silhouettes of the mountains.  These spheres were disappearing behind it then reappearing when they got to the other side.  It would take them maybe 1 or 2 seconds to go from the 1 o&rsquo;clock of the mountains to the 7 o&rsquo;clock position, then streak across the mountains again to the 3 o&rsquo;clock position. Etc. If you draw a star with your pencil, that is exactly what they were doing.I tried to draw a diagram below, with the mountains being the black and the patterns of these ORBS in red.  Please understand, that these crafts or lights, were disappearing behind the mountains and sometimes flying in front of the mountains, so I could see very well that they were in close proximity of those hills, where they could fly behind them and in front of them. These things were extremely fast and their maneuvers were unbelievable.  I have flown on a lot of military planes and  helicopters, I have been to many air shows, and as stated earlier have worked on the flight-line extensively.  So I have seen most USAF aircraft, F15, F16, A10, F18, B1 bomber, B2 bomber, etc T38, KC 135, C130, C5, C141, etc, etc,  I am very familiar with those aircrafts and what they look like and what they can do.In conclusion, either I witnessed a new secret aircraft being tested that we have no knowledge about or I saw a UFO (I&rsquo;m not saying flying saucer), just unidentified.  This incident has stayed with me for a long time and to this day, I cannot imagine any aircraft doing those maneuvers. These things were super super fast, agile and could stop on a dime.  As stated they would fly in front and the back of the two mountains so I could see them moving, speeding, disappearing, reappearing and hovering.I guess we could have been maybe 5-10 miles away.  I could clearly see the silhouttes of the mountains and could see these things fly in front and in back of the mountains.  We were close to whitesands testing facilities, so either new technology or the dreaded word UFO.  I also am very aware of the SR71 and the fact that it was activated n 1964 or 68 and as an active duty member, we really didn&rsquo;t start seeing pictures of it till about 84 so they kept that out of the public eye for a long time.  These things were not conventional aircrafts.  I currently work for the DOD as a logistician.Thank you for your time.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

As I sat, I looked out toward the northeast(over the town of London) and saw a rectangular bright red light. It was probably somewhere around two miles in the distance, low in the horizon, but above the treetops. It was a very brilliant light and was not moving. I am not sure of it&apos;s size, but it was quite large. I kept looking, trying to figure out what it was. I looked from every angle I could from the porch. Suddenly, the oject moved at a VERY high rate of speed away from me. It moved so fast that it became a small dot, then disappeared in the distance. The rate of travel had to be EXTREME, because it was gone in less than two seconds. It&apos;s the strangest thing I have ever seen. I did not report it.", "Circling Shiny ObjectsAbout 6pm, my husband and 2 kids were in our back yard and looked up to see what looked like a bird circling at a very high altitude, only it looked metallic. It was very high and appeared to be circular or possibly a cylinder shape. We were facing east and the sun was behind us. It was still daylight with a clear blue sky. The object appeared to be reflecting the sun as its light varied as it moved in its circular path. It seemed that at certain points in the circle it was at a better angle for reflecting the sun. It was making circles and moving north, then it faded away for a while or moved too far away to see, then it returned and circled around some more. At the time airplanes were landing in a path from Lake Harriet, southeast toward the airport. The planes were crossing under the area where these objects appeared to be circling, so they were very high up. After about 10 minutes, we saw two identical lights circling in the same pattern in unison, again moving northward, then fading away, then returning to the same spot due east. We watched until they faded away again then went inside.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I did a double take because I could not believe my eyes,  I thought at first a plane or helicopter but it was just a red light, no blinkers or different colors, just a steady glowing, red orb.  A commercial jet actually passed in front of it (from my view) and was banking left to head Westerly, this is when I knew it was NOT a plane or helicopter!  I knocked on the French door for my wife and frantically waved at her to come outside.  She came out and witnessed it for a minute and then went back in,   So, I ran and got my binocs and went to the front yard where I got an unobstructed view. By this time it was higher and I&rsquo;m going to guess about 3-4 thousand feet?  Maybe less, I see plenty of Cessna&rsquo;s flying at about the same altitude.  It then stopped and stayed in the relative same place for several minutes, it would sort of pulse I guess I would say or become less intense of a red every couple seconds.  It finally dimmed and then was gone.  I estimate that where it hovered for the longest would&rsquo;ve been maybe a couple miles or so north of me, putting it directly over the West Seattle Freeway or the Seattle Port maybe?  It was very strange indeed specially due to the fact that I sent in a report last night for a triangle craft or 3 lights in formation that sped across the sky!  Strange times.", "Driving down hill a semi main street, boy friend and I were going home and we both happened to see what seemed like a bright green orb falling like a shooting star- lasted less than five seconds and than dissapeared.

I questioned her as to the specifics of the incident while it was still in progress and she informed me of the following observations using my instructions as a guide.I asked her to put her arm out straight and put her thumb up into the air and then sight along her arm, using the thumb as a guide to the size of the objects. She reported that the objects were each as wide as two-thirds of her thumbnail at that distance. The then asked the angle of the objects relative to the perceived horizon, and she reported that they were between twenty and thirty degrees above it, meaning that they were at relatively low altitude.She also informed me that the objects appeared to be in the vicinity of, or over, a local park at Sandy Lane (Lat: 50o 57&rsquo; 55.7&rdquo; N / 1o 18&rsquo; 11.7&rdquo; W), a former gravel pit, now grassed over, and that they were maneuvering around in the sky in a smooth motion, with one or more of the objects repeatedly descending smoothly and then ascending. While she watched the objects formed up into an equilateral triangle formation and maintained it until they were lost from sight into low, heavy rain and ice clouds, which had been moving through the area all day.All of the objects were brilliantly illuminated, seemed to be unaffected by the prevalent meteorological conditions. they did not carry additional lights or changed colors. Following the incident, I requested that the witnesses each prepare a report for me, and illustrations, without showing each other the material for comparison purposes. NOTE: This incident took place within three miles of Southampton Airport (Eastleigh, Hampshire).No photographs were taken as neither of the witnesses had equipment to hand.", "On 4/16/08, I saw a fast moving circular object with colored lights moving across the sky and then seemed to zip-zag out of sight.Kent, OH:  I was outside late in the evening with my dog on April 16, 2008, when I looked up in the sky (it was very clear) and immediately noticed a fast moving circular object with several colored lights all around the outside moving in a straight line and then seemed to zig-zag as I lost sight of it.  I called for my husband to come outside to see it and he caught a quick glimpse too.  It didn&apos;t make any sound that I could hear and was out of sight in seconds.

If others have information about this sighting report, we urge them to contact Mr. Sheets directly at the e-address, &lt;mufonofga1@yahoo.com&gt;.  PD))On 15Feb02, this SD was contacted by a witness known to the writer.  He stated that an incident had occurred the previous year in his home and that he had been trying to determine exactly what it involved, but to no avail.In response to his request, an on-site inspection, an interview and an investigation was began on 11March02.The witness is a 20+ year veteran police officer employed by a major South Fulton County  police agency and has been professionally known to this writer for at least 15 years.  The witness is a former nuclear submariner for the U.S. Navy with all of the attendant training, qualifications, clearances and certifications.  After his naval service, the witness served as a Georgia State Trooper until he decided on municipal police work in order to be able to reside and work in one particular place i.e. no moving around in a far flung region of the state.  This witness spent many years of his municipal career in a particularly dangerous aspect of law enforcement.  His hobbies include traveling the USA with his wife to visit our numerous national parks and photographing other scenic outdoor resorts and vistas, and working with his PC.  The witness lives in a nice middle class neighborhood a few minutes drive south of Hartsfield International Airport.  During the years of this writer&apos;s professional association with the witness, he was observed under pressure and in emergency situations on many occasions.  The witness was never known to over-react, loose his professional demeanor or demonstrate any type of improper conduct when dealing with the public or criminal suspects who were often violent.The event site is his home, a well-kept split (tri) level, 3 bedroom house with a substantial wire fenced backyard, the home facing west on a generally N-S suburban street.  The rear fencing is extensive, with the backyard enclosed by four foot wire fence, with numerous wire sub-fencing within in order to make a dog run, and divide off areas for plants and patio-type yard fixtures.  Numerous large boulders outcrop the soil in the rear, and this is evident in other nearby yards.The interview was conducted on 11March02 in the witness&apos; living room.  He was calm and related the experience in a clear and concise manner.He stated that on 28Sept01, between 9:30 and 10:00PM, he had turned in and was going to sleep as he had to work the next day.  He and his wife sleep in separate bedrooms due to their sometime conflicting work schedules, furthermore that she was downstairs watching TV.  Their cat was laying on the foot of the bed as is normal.  He heard the cat make a growling sound, which was unusual, so he rolled over to see what that was all about.  He then observed a (very) white in color rectangular light hovering over his bed, but a few feet up towards the ceiling and ceiling fan (fan was not in operation).  Witness indicated this light put him to mind of a shoebox-top in shape, perhaps 6&quot;x12&quot;, and appeared like a silent white window just hanging there above the bed, but not giving off any light that would illuminate the room.He sat up and reached out to touch it, but it moved away slightly, but maintaining a general position of about 1/2 of the way between the bed and ceiling. He continued to watch it, then reached over to turn on the night table lamp immediately next to the bed (see photos), but could not find it, as if the table and lamp were gone.  He then reached out for the chest of drawers and did not feel that either. After a bit of reaching around, the lamp was found and turned on.  The rectangular light promptly vanished.  Witness said it seemed like there was absolutely nothing in the room during the few moments he was groping around for the lamp, and this was quite disconcerting.(Sidebar:  In previous months this officer had been working at night and sleeping in the daytime, so he had covered every square inch of each bedroom window with tin foil so he could day-sleep in total darkness.  This window covering was left completely intact when he had changed shifts and remained so on the night of this event. He double checked this, thinking that perhaps errant light was leaking from an outside source, but his coverings were still intact i.e. no leaking light incoming).Once the lamp was on and the rectangle had vanished, he got up and went downstairs and related the experience to his wife, and they talked for about 30 minutes.  He then returned to bed and after turning out the light, the white rectangle made a reappearance in the same location.  Witness then sat up and was able on this occasion to stick his finger through the light, learning that it had no heat, no apparent depth, only height and width.  He then moved his hand around the light to double check for an outside light leak, and discovering none, put his finger into the light again.  At that point the light seemed to break into &quot;a million small specks&quot; and quickly vanished and did not return.  He added that during the time of the event, he was not ill, had not been taking medication of any sort and was in as generally good health as a moderate smoker could be. He did note that within a few days of this occurrence, he had 3 fluorescent lights to burn out on the same day and thought this to be unusual.  No other unusual electrical problems had  been noted in the home.During additional conversation, the witness said his only contact with anything odd, or seemingly anomalous, was during some photo taking in an underground cave in New Mexico.  When their photos were developed, they noticed some floating semi-transparent &apos;orbs&apos; on the photos.  We discussed the fact that some researchers, including our paranormal associates in Georgia, had determined these &apos;orbs&apos; most likely were caused by particles of dust, debris, pollen, or moisture floating in close proximity to the camera and were out of focus, then highly illuminated by the flash unit.  Witness said he&apos;d heard that discussed on TV documentaries.  This writer offered up another opinion regarding the fact that some persons were just more &apos;sensitive&apos; regarding various paranormal phenomena, which seemed to occur in and around them more often than others.  The witness has an interest in such matters, and has read extensively in that area.The witness prepared a sketch of the rectangular light using computer graphics and forwarded recently taken photographs of his home and property .  He also completed and signed a MUFON Form #1.  This writer took additional photos of the bedroom and it&apos;s contents, as well as the yard.  These will be electronically added to the CMS Form at a later date.  The wife of witness did not observe the above described phenomenon, but in essence recalled the same scenario i.e. being downstairs watching TV, her husband coming down and speaking with her about the matter.Witness did state that there had been a severe lightning strike to the fence in back on an earlier date some years before.  The lightning bolt running through all of the fencing.ASD Ralph Howard, a professional geologist and Georgia&apos;s science officer, was contacted and made aware of this investigation.  He scheduled a geological survey of the witness property due to the large amount of rock structure that appears to be just under the surface soil.  (See this geology report to be added to the FIs CMS report in the near future).In checking sources for similar events, this writer reviewed William R. Corliss&apos; &apos;Remarkable Luminous Phenomena In Nature-Catalog of Geophysical Anomalies&apos;.  While his descriptions of some forms of ball lightning, luminous aerial bubbles, and low-level nocturnal lights might be slightly similar to this matter, nothing described therein possesses the perfect geometric rectangular form as illustrated and described by the witness.  Of course ball lightning has reportedly been observed to enter an enclosure or dwelling, but it&apos;s conduct in doing so is radically different from what was observed in this case, and not geometrically perfect in shape.While there were no instruments available on the day of this writer&apos;s on-scene examination, there would certainly be the possibility of an electro-magnetic field in the vicinity of the bedroom ceiling due to the ceiling fan&apos;s electric motor and built-in three bulb lighting fixture, however the fan and light WAS NOT in operation at time of the event.  As stated, the witness noticed no abnormal electrical problems in the home except for the previously mentioned burn-out of three fluorescent bulbs in various rooms on the same day, a few days later.While the witness was in overall good health, the &apos;Electric Power Research Institute&apos; and &apos;International Association of Certified Home Inspectors&apos; describe certain health issues sometime associated with EM fields in the home.  One being Electromagnetic Hypersensitivity that could manifest in allergy-like conditions, or else a physiological disorder which might include neurological symptoms.  The witness did confirm that he also spent a moderate amount of time working with his computers, being something of an amateur computer bug. He described no type of personal condition that would lead one to suspect he suffered from such EM Hypersensitivity.(Sidebar:  Information from the above two professional organizations regarding ceiling fans and other small appliances.......that the EM field RAPIDLY becomes weaker with distance from the source........gaging ceiling fans on a strength scale.....at 1 foot--a rating of 50; at 2 feet--a rating of 6; at 4 feet--a rating of 1.  According to this scale, the strength of the EM field does in fact drop off RAPIDLY as the distance is increased).During the course of this investigation in the early spring of 2002, physicist Dr. Eric Davis of NIDS became aware of this inquiry via our thumbnail posting in Filer&apos;s Files.  He contacted this writer due to his work in quantum teleportation and researching traversable wormholes in the form of a &apos;Stargate&apos;.  This writer forwarded certain information to Dr. Davis regarding this event and Davis asked that the witness also provide him with an account via the NIDS citizen reporting form.  The witness agreed and prepared his account for submission.  He had extreme difficulty getting the NIDS data base to accept his account and finally gave up in frustration.At the time, we did not know that NIDS was downsizing and Bob Bigelow preparing to close down NIDS and pursue aerospace operations.  Dr. Davis, along with his colleagues, was released from service at NIDS.  Davis then contracted as an adviser to the USAF Research Lab&apos;s Advanced Concept Office, later forming his own company &apos;Warp Drive Metrics&apos;.  We were unable to reach Dr. Davis after that, and NIDS was out of business.This writer has rejected the possibility that the witness experienced a hallucination or entered a spontaneous altered state of consciousness or underwent a mystical episode in the &apos;Alpha State&apos; that precedes sleep i.e rejected because the phenomenon was observed twice, about 30 minutes between each event.Based on all of the above, and this investigator&apos;s knowledge of the witness&apos; personality, integrity and seriousness, this event is classified as an &apos;Unknown-Other&apos;.Tom Sheets, Chief of Police (Retired), State Director-MUFON of Georgia Ralph Howard, P.G., ASD MUFON of Georgia", "It was large, fast,  transparent, only two hundred yards away, and made absolutley no sound at any time.I had just gotten home from my aerobics class (I was getting in shape to go elk hunting) and I was unloading grocerices. It was calm, starry night with light winds. I was going back and forth from my truck to the house carrying groceries and I noticed this triangle shaped object over on the rock quarry property hovering vertically. It made no noise, had three lights, and was totally transparent. As I went to the truck for another load of groceries, I noticed that this object was moving closer to the house. I went into the house and put the groceries on the counter and went back outside and stood on the patio and watched this object, still hovering vertically, approach the house and stop about two (200) hundred yards away from me. This was a perfectly still night and I could still hear the crickets chirping, yet, I could not hear any sound coming from this object that was about as wide as two of my trucks placed end to end. The top left and bottom lights were white, but the top right light turned from white to red and then to orange. I could literally see the stars through this object; it was totally transparent. I stood there and watched this object for about five (5) minutes before I went over to my truck and called my friend, Chris. When I moved towards the truck, which was about twenty five (25) yards away, this object moved so that it could look at me with an unobstructed view. I called my friend then I called my Mom and told them what I was looking at. I don&apos;t lie about anything-period-and they knew that I was serious. After I got off of the phone with them, I watched this object for another five (5) minutes and did something that truly blew my mind, as if seeing this thing wasn&apos;t enough. This object, still hovering constantly, made a vertical move, then a downward move, and then took off at the speed of light. It was gone. No trails. No streaks. Gone in an instant. Vanished. I stood there in total awe and then when I came to, I hopped in my truck and raced to the other end of the p! roperty to see if I could find any burn marks or other evidence. I found nothing. I immediately called the Belton Police Department and asked if there had been some reports of strange craft sighted between Belton and Peculiar. They said &quot;no.&quot; I then made a call to the Cass County Sheriffs office and asked them if there were any operations being performed either out of Whiteman Air Force Base or the old Richards Gebaur Air Force Base. They said &quot;no,&quot; and I responded, &quot;well, I just saw an ufo.&quot; The next day, even after investigating in the daylight, I found nothing.", "Bright green light disappeared above Charlotte skyline.My husband and I were driving towards Uptown on South Blvd.  Between the tops of two of the tallest buildings, we saw what looked like a huge bright green-glowing light.  It appeared much closer to the buildings, and we ruled out planes since there were a few flying overhead at the same time. It suddenly arched up and to the left and just disappeared all within about 2-3 seconds.  We were wondering if anyone else saw this as well.  It was just about 8pm on Friday evening, March 21, 2008.", "03.27/08, 20:50, Joseph, OR, Observed bright light  traveling in the sky for several minutes before disappearing..I live at a rural location about 7 miles outside of Joseph, Oregon at the foot of the Wallowa Mountains and at an elevation of about 4800 feet.  It was one of those beautiful starlit nights that can only be experienced in the mountains.  The moon had not yet risen and the sky was magnificantly clear. I stood looking up at the stars and could see Orion and the Pleiades in the western sky.  I then noticed a very bright white light traveling from west to east directly toward me.  As there were no blinking wing lights I assumed it to be a satellite.  As it came toward me I thought that it was traveling at an uncommonly fast speed for a satellite and seemed to be at a much lower evelation than you would expect a satellite to be.  I then heard the distant sound of a jet and noticed a plane traveling in a NW to SE direction above the western horizon over the mountains.  I looked back up at the light which was almost directly above me and then noticed another plane on the eastern horizon traveling in a NNW direction above the eastern horizon.  Both planes seemed to be at a greater altitude than the light. The bright light came to a stop almost directly above me, made a 90 degree turn to the north and then very rapidly gained altitude, growing smaller and smaller in my vision until it dispeared altogether all in just a few seconds. I cannot say what this object was.  I can only say that it wasn&apos;t a satellite, it wasn&apos;t an airplane and it behaved in a manner that I never would have believed physically possible. In defense of myself,I do not drink and I was not under the influence of any substance that might have influenced my perceptions.  In short I was in total awareness of my surroundings.", "San Diego, CA sightingMy husband and I spotted a craft hovering in the sky near our home.  We were driving and stopped at an intersection to watch and listen.  It stayed in one location for a couple of seconds then darted over us heading north.  The craft made no noise and there was no traffic in the area or any other noise...very odd because of the proximity to MCAS Miramar. The shape seemed to be similar to the stealth plane, a triangular shape, black, with large lights on the underside toward the front.  One light was under the pointed nose with two or three lights on both sides, angled with the shape of the plane.  I believe the aircraft had lights on the upper side as well because of the soft light above it.  The lights were not spotlights; they did not cast a beam. I emailed a local news station with a half hour of the sighting, but never received a reply.  Nothing was ever reported in the news, so I am unable to confirm if others saw it as well.  Something else was very unusual:  the news did report that San Diego&apos;s commercial airport, Lindburg Field, was closed for a time due to fog.  Odd, because there was no fog that night.  The sky was clear, no wind.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

It was Monday evening, I was outside my house fixing my solar lights and by chance looked up the sky to watch the stars. I was staring towards the Big Dipper when I saw this huge V-shaped space craft, gliding silently about 30 to 50feet from my roof top. At first I thought it was jsut a glider but I realized that it was late at night and the object was so huge and so close.I thought maybe it was a stealth bomber but I saw a stealth bomber before and it is not even close to that. It has green lights, made no sounds nd was just gliding silently. It even resembles a wing of a dragon, green and black.It was very vivid.I watched it for almost 8 minutes until my roof covered the view.

I looked up over my shoulder to see how much sun I was getting and saw a huge cigar shaped object sliding through the sky at no more than 200 feet up.  It was very shiny, seemless and big.  It was heading south east at a slow steady rate.  There was no indication of a propulsion system.  It was the same in front as in back.  It confused my senses because it was so huge that it should have been making some kind of noise.  I couldn&apos;t even hear it displacing air.  It was in view for no more than 10 seconds maybe less before the apartment complex next to my parents house obscured it.  About 15 to 30 seconds after it left my view a military jet fighter came right behind it low and slow.  The fighter validated my sense perception since it was obviously following the UFO and was loud.  It was very unusual for a fighter to be flying so low and slow over a populated suburban area.  I had never seen a jet fighter do that before.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

My exact location was about the 32 mile marker southwest of Salome at the I-10/US 60 interchange. I had been visually scanning the sky since I left my fuel stop in Quartzite because the night was clear and I like to spot meteorites. The section of the sky I saw the UFO in, I had scanned 6 to 7 seconds prior and there was nothing there. I was looking straight ahead, at the sky and road in front of me, when a bright light caught my eye to my left. I had the window rolled down, and was able to immediately dismiss it as a reflection from lights I sometimes see on my right that are reflected off the driver side window.The object was traveling at tremendous speed in a north east direction at a 40 degree declination off the horizon. At first I dismissed the object as falling space debris because of the blue color of the corona around a bright white center. But when the object disappeared, I thought different. Let me explain why. Normally space debris, or meteorites, after entering or burning up in the atmosphere fade out quickly as they cool or loose enough material to no longer burn.In comparison with a Aries V rocket launch I witnessed being launched from Vandenburg Air force Base last Thursday morning, It is my belief that what I saw was not a vehicle entering the atmosphere but leaving. I went to a hilltop, about 3 miles from the rocket launch, to recorded it High Definition Video. From 3 miles away I could see the rocket very clearly. The UFO was traveling twice as fast as the Aries rocket did, and was 3 to 4 times larger in it&rsquo;s brightness, at a distance of to 20 to 25 miles or more. The distance was figured by the moon lit silhouette of the mountain range to the north and under the UFO. It&rsquo;s path was in a north east direction headed away from me, and just before it disappeared the brightness intensified for about one second.I feel confidant, with my experience in the military, and my knowledge of aircraft, that this was a vehicle that was traveling at a high altitude and only showed itself when it needed to reach escape velocity. The total view time was only 3 &frac12; to 4 seconds, and was a beautiful white round burst of energy surrounded by a blue corona of light. It left no contrail, but did leave a short trail of light that followed it closely. It made no discernible noise, my big rig was too noisy to hear it if it did. In comparing it&rsquo;s size with the half full moon this night, it was large enough to cover half of that. It was an awesome display of power and technology.", "4 &quot;little stars&quot; in the sky: 3 white one red moving then changing directionsdirectly overhead we saw 4 small spherical &quot;little stars&quot;: 3 white and 1 red moving slowly overhead towards a northerly direction.

They had to be over Camelback Mountain (8 miles away), or maybe further west towards Glendale, it all depended on their altitude. They were in an area of the night sky that was void of stars, probably due to pollution. This is why I knew they did not belong there. Upon further visual exploration of the scene, I noticed a third twinkling light at a lower altitude. The three would get brighter and move around a bit, but they would stay in the same general area. Sometimes they would dim to the point that they were impossible to see, only to brighten and twinkle once more. They did not move for nearly an hour, after which time tiredness dectated that I go to sleep. Forty five minutes into watching these lights, or around 12:45, there was what I deemed to be an aircraft with a bright red flashing light, maybe a helicopter, that flew past all three of these objects. It should also be noted that these objects were present before I noticed them, and they probably lasted after I went to bed. I am writing this report after having come inside from watching the event.

For some reason I decided to pet my dogs, which were barking inside the gates of the backyard.  As I was petting them I noticed a light or large star in the Eastern Sky..  As I continued to observe the white light, it moved from side to side vertically and horizontally, very rapidly , and then it turned into two flying vehicles.  At first, all I could see was the &quot;V&quot; shape on the front where lights were outlining the front of the vehicles, which was flying downward at a 45 degree angle.  My first thought was that they were some kind of new air force jets, since we have Sheppard Air Force Base here in Wichita Falls. As soon as I entertained that thought, the second of the two vehicles stopped and turned to a horizontal position and then turned its lights on!  It was just like the ones I had seen on television with the narrow horizontal long wise lights around the outside, and a large light shining out of the vehicle on the bottom..There were maybe 35-40 lights around the outside of the ship. I could see that the shape was oval and could see the beam of the light, as it shone downward.  There were also windows at the top of the dome, and I could see white light shining out, from the inside. It seemed that althought the light was on the bottom of the ship there was something around the light, maybe the device or air system which was keeping the system airprone.  It also seemed like there were some kind of purple or blue lights on the side of the vehicle as it turned on the bottom light.  The side lights and windows appeared first and then the bottom light. Then, after about 5 or 6 seconds the second vehicle returned to a 45 degree angle behind the first vehicle.  They continued flying in a downward pattern and disappeared behind some trees, so I am assuming the vehicle has some invisibility mechanism.  I did not see anyone in the vehicle through the windows but for some reason I think the cabin par! t of it was in the front where I first saw the V shaped light pattern.  When it returned to an angled pattern it turned its lights off, except for the V shape strand around the front. It was flying, maybe 25 or 30 feet behind the first vehicle.  This all took place within a 20-30 second period and is the first time I have seen anything like this.  I was by myside with my two dogs, and surprisingly they werent barking during this period, perhaps they could sense the light or see it as well.  When I went inside, I told my husband, but he didnt go outside to look.  This happened so quickly Im sure I dont remember everything but I know it wasnt a glare, since there wasnt sunlight and it was not an airplane, not ones that we normally see..", "Fast moving object.

We were laying on blankets just outside of the vehicle and the kids had just fallen off to sleep shortly after the first film ended. During the second film I was looking up into the night sky and noticed just how beautiful the stars were in the moonless, cloudless sky. After a couple of minutes I noticed a brilliant white light moving horizontically through the night sky at what seemed to be at a super fast speed (Note: it was not a falling star - I&apos;ve seen a million of those and they move at a much slower pace and tend to be falling down in the sky this object moved sideways). The light traveled in a perfectly straight line over 90% of the entire body of the night sky. I had my wife observe it as well. We watched it move to the corner of the sky at which time it made a perfect 45 degree angled turn upward (not like a falling star) into the sky (I&apos;ve never seen anything cut an angle like that). Then in just two seconds, the moving object proceeded to go into some kind of hyper-speed and it looked like a stepping stone in the sky and then it gradually faded out forming a blurry intermittent line and then vanished. I thought it was the coolest thing I had ever seen. My wife refuses to talk about it to this very day.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

The white sequenced twinkling lights, would be more difficult to explain.", "Glowing large orange ball in Alabama sky August, 1949.On a Saturday night of the summer of 1949 (It would have been between July 16th and the beginning of September), my boyfriend and I (aged fifteen) were &quot;smooching&quot;  in a deserted ball field in Tarrant City, AL, when we spied a glowing orange ball low in the sky. To our naked eye, it was about the size of two full moons.  It moved slowly around a small area for about ten minutes, and then vanished.  We were terrified, but we didn&rsquo;t tell anyone what we&rsquo;d seen, because we weren&rsquo;t supposed to be alone in the ball field.  Of course over the years, we shared the story, but I decided it&rsquo;s time to make an official report.", "2 shape shifting objects and one small turquoise object sighted over NW New Mexico in daylightMy brother and I were hiking through a small rocky area approximately one-eighth of a mile from the nearby apartment complexes in a small neighborhood of NW Gallup, New Mexico.  We had ascended to a nearby cliff division and took a five minute break.  There was a wind from the SW 15-20 mph and the skies were mostly clear.I noticed a few large aircraft pass through overhead which is normal in this area.  I looked away viewing the area around us when I look back up - directly above our resting location when I noticed a large round white object.  It was about one-half the size of the moon at this point and was not moving.  I pointed it out to my brother and we looked at it for about 2-3 minutes while it remained motionless above us.  It was obvious to us that it was not a balloon and did not resemble any of the other aircraft in the vicinity.  I had sunglasses on that have polarized lenses so I could see with fair clarity when I realized the object had nearly doubled in size and had turned mostly bright red.  My brother seconded this observation and the object began rotating and changing its physical appearance.  This began happening about 5 minutes after our initial sighting.  It was rotating in a clockwise motion and appeared almost translucent or had some kind of field around it that gave it a translucent appearance.  The red color of the object slowly became larger and smaller as it rotated.  It would become oblong, oval, round, square, and sometimes appear to have protrusions that seemed to come out of the body of the object itself.We then noticed large aircraft begin coming in from all directions and seemed to have changed their original trajectory in order to come into contact with the object.  Presumably they are of military origin and had detected them on radar or from some type of space platform.  3 of these aircraft came close to the object but I am unable to approximate the altitude.  You could see contrails that slowly disappeared behind the jet aircraft.  Then the object disappeared.I waited for about two minutes when suddenly an identical type of object as the first appeared in the same location and was bright white and was also rotating.  Then a small bright turquoise light appeared to come out of it and was shining much brighter than a star.  It moved away from the other craft and appeared to dance around to the side of the other object for about 3-4 minutes.  I could see more aircraft begin to aim towards the objects when suddenly the phenomenon disappeared.  We waited for about a half hour and no other objects were sighted on that day.The next day Sunday, my family and I witnessed a larger sighting that I will report for the appropriate date.", "V formation seen twice in appr. 15 min. About 25-30 lights that disconnected at one point then rejoined.My fiance and I were sitting out watching the stars. From the south we saw a &quot;V&quot;formation of lights (very high, at first it was difficult to see) they were traveling south. After a few seconds, one side of the &quot;V&quot; moved away from the other and moved out front of the others.  After another few seconds, they all moved back into formation and veered north east very quickly. There was no sound during any of this.  When our 16 year old son came home we told him about it and he then sat uot with us. App. 15 minutes later we all witnessed the same event only this time they came from the west and eventually headed it the same direction as the last.

Out of curiosity i ran to my window, opened the blinds and to my surprise i did not see a helicopter overhead but a brightly lit, isosceles triangular shaped craft &quot;floating&quot; at about a speed of  15 mph directly above me.  The craft was not completely a full triangle, the base was cut out resembling an arrow or a chevron. The lights were vividly bright colors of blue and red, racing at a moderate speed around the full perimeter of craft. Standing there in amazement, I called for my mother and my younger brother, by the time they reached my room the craft was only approximately 100 yards away. Together we watched it barely graze the tree line. I then got my camera and went outside, the craft returned several times. I have two recordings of the sighting one 45 seconds and the other 1 minute and 30 seconds. It was very quite, and moved as if it was literally floating. The object appeared to be round in the sky, my conclusion is because the lights race around it giving it the illusion of a disc. After about 7 minutes the craft vanished.", "Two Crafts. One sighting.2/27/08 At about 430 pst we noticed what we thought was a balloon rapidly rising and falling and changing colors from red to silver to white and emitting a strange aura in the northwestern sky above Lake Union. We called a third person over to show him and ask his opinion about what he thought it could be only for him to point out a white ball/egg shaped craft flying from the east over lake Washington, continuing over lake union, and eventually disappearing behind the Space Needle.The craft made no sound and was flying at speeds not normal with planes that usually fly over Seattle. When we looked for the balloon object after the second object flew by, it was gone.  We have never seen anything like it before.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It was hovering above Blue Mountain, moving south. We had total cloud cover that night, so no stars or planets were visible. The cloud cover also provided a good contrast making the object easier to see. My partner saw a triangular shape with lights. His initial reaction was thinking it was an airplane on fire. When I came out to look at it, it was a bright, reddish-orange, round object.  It didn&rsquo;t move for a few minutes. When I tried to focus my binoculars on it, it retreated in reverse away from the earth into the cloud cover.  And it moved fast. This probably took about two seconds. I contacted our weather service and our local newspaper. I&rsquo;m waiting to hear if there were other sightings.", "Pink light does high speed flight from Tampa to Kennedy Space Center 5 minutes before shuttle Endeavor lands.Peter: Since 1984 I have been broadcasting space shuttle launches on a network of radio stations across the country. I have media credentials issued by NASA and am considered an authority on space hardware and systems. The UFO phenomena has always interested me but until 8:21:28 PM,  March 26, 2008, I had never seen one.I have a whole slew of computers and monitors in my home studio from which I broadcast the launches when I can&rsquo;t get to the Kennedy Space Center. Upon entry and landing I plot all the trajectories and landing paths. On the 26th of March the shuttle Endeavor was waved off the first landing attempt due to weather conditions being unfavorable. That attempt would have brought the shuttle in over Miami and up the east coast of Florida. The second attempt meant an atmospheric entry interface and landing approach directly over my head in southeastern Hillsborough County (Tampa Bay).The evening was perfect for satellite watching; the weather was cool and dry and the sky completely clear. I had already plotted the tracks for the ATV and ISS as well as STS-123. The ATV was in the same orbit as the ISS only about 1,200 miles ( 5 minutes) in front it. Having just undocked from the space station, the shuttle was also in the same orbit except about 326 miles (1 minute) behind the ISS. So, orbital mechanics being what they are, there is absolutely no way for the shuttle to ever overtake either the ISS or the ATV.The ATV was scheduled to go over my house at 8:20 PM and the ISS at 8:25 PM. The shuttle, which by that time, would have been entering the atmosphere and slowing considerably, would be going over at about 8:33:40 PM on its way to an 8:39 PM landing at the cape.Gazing intently at the patch of sky dictated by my computer, we could not see the ATV, it was just too small and dark. At 8:21:28 we noticed a pinkish light moving across the sky. Initially I thought it was the ATV, albeit late.  Then the pink light veered off course and silently zipped in a highly controlled movement across our heads (several neighbors had come out to watch, too) to the southeast and then turned toward the northeast as if headed toward the Kennedy Space Center which is directly across the state from us. It made the trip from right above us to the vicinity of KSC in about 1 to 2 seconds.  I knew then that the object was not the ATV so my thoughts went to the shuttle. Problem being that at the altitude the shuttle flies by the time it gets to Tampa we get twin sonic booms off the nose and tail. This &ldquo;UFOish&rdquo; object produced no sonic boom despite the fact that it seemed to have been moving at thousands of miles an hour.Just as I was pondering the pink light, the ISS went by overhead at 17,500 mph in its orbit. Very bright but, compared to what I had just seen, laboriously slow. It took the ISS a good 2-3 minutes to move across the sky compared to only a second or two for the pink light. I have never seen anything travel that fast, including supersonic jets at closed to the public media events.I went back into the house and NASA-TV&rsquo;s George Diller was saying that the shuttle was &ldquo;&hellip;now just 9 minutes from landing at KSC and about 150 miles off the coast of Florida over the Gulf of Mexico.&rdquo;  Going back outside, sure enough, right on schedule, I was greeted by the twin sonic booms that must have rattled windows all over the Bay area. The shuttle, however, was too dark to be seen without night vision goggles to pick up the residual heat from its reentry.Having watched many launches from my front yard, I have a keen awareness of exactly where the Kennedy Space Center is from my front door&hellip; exactly 142.6 miles to the parking lot at the VAB.I&rsquo;m not saying it was alien, I don&rsquo;t know what the little pink light was, but, whatever it was, it was not a plane in the conventional sense of that word. At first I thought its altitude was orbital but as it moved away from the orbit of the ISS, first to the southeast and then curving around to a northeast heading, it didn&rsquo;t seem to be all that high. If I had to guess I would say maybe about 10,000 to 15,000 feet.Well, that&rsquo;s about it.Enjoy your silo.", "Fast moving bright object moving horizontally with a blue white trialdoesnt work!!((NUFORC Note:  We do not understand entirely what the witness is suggesting.

We were in the back yard of my home in Woodland, CA stargazing when I noticed one of the &ldquo;stars&rdquo; near the big dipper started to move.  At first I believed it to be a satellite and pointed it out to my brother.  Soon all of us noticed the light and its strange movement.  The single light was soon joined by 4 or five more &ldquo;stars&rdquo; to create a Flying V formation.  The Flying V moved slowly to the Northeast, I believe, until it was out of sight.  The most peculiar thing the lights did were, as they were flying away, the lights at the back of the formation quickly switched places and moved about at impossibly fast speeds.  It was almost like watching giant fireflies move around in outer space.  I say &quot;giant&quot; because they seemed to be among the stars, so I guess they were at least above our atmosphere.  If they were that far away these lights must have been fairly large, maybe the size of airplanes.  They made no noise whatsoever.  I know they were not airplanes, no airplanes could move like that.  It was like watching a flock of geese slowly fly across the night sky.  I do not believe anything I&rsquo;ve ever seen could explain those lights.", "Saw a thin object shoot through the sky at 8pm in the dark at lighting speep, no lights, no noise.I was in my backyard on top of the hill in Canyon Country California. I was with a friend; we were taking pictures of the stars on a tripod.  My friend was looking through the viewfinder in one direction over my house; I was looking out into the sky overlooking the Santa Clarita Valley and saw a ridiculously fast object slide through the sky at a lightning fast speed.  The object was about 10,000 feet in the sky and was dark in color.  The object had no lights on it or coming from it.  The object flew straight from right to left and did not make a sound. As I saw the object, immediately yelled to my friend and by the time he looked over at my direction in was gone. The object appeared to be moving through the sky as if it did not want to be noticed disappearing into dark grey sky to my left.  I was only able to see the object because I happened to be looking at that spot at the exact time it was moving through that area slightly lit by the city lights.

I don&apos;t know if you receive information about sightings and will use this to collaborate with other sightings; or if this is of any interest at all.  However, I was traveling close to my home on Route I-78 westbound just west of the Lenhartsville Exit in Windsor Township of Berks County, Pennsylvania. It was approximately 5:30 am and still dark.  Approximately 2 miles in the distance I saw very bright lights and thought nothing of it.  MediVac helicopters travel over my house frequently as I live close to Lehigh Valley Hospital and generally disregard them.   As I got closer, impossible as it seemed, the bright lights grew even brighter. When approximately 100 yards away the shape became clear in the dark.  It hovered over a grassy field on the left side of the four lane highway and was between 100 to 200 feet above the ground.  I could make out the shape and could see that the object was hovering without making the noise that helicopters make.  The shape of the object was like that of an arrowhead and three lights illuminated from the bottom with a red light in the center of the bottom of the object.  The red light didn&apos;t flash like typical strobe aircraft lights; it came on and went off slowly.The entire time the object hovered and did not move.  I did not not have my CB radio on as it has not been working so I was unable to determine if other drivers saw what I did.Subsequently my wife checked the local newspaper for anything partaining to a UFO sighting.  Nothing was mentioned; however, a couple of miles after sighting the object I came across an accident where one truck driver rear ended another which tied up traffic.  I couldn&apos;t help but wonder if this driver had been distracted by the same object because judging by the degree of damage he hit the truck infront of him at quite a high rate of speed.  I had a tough time keeping my eyes on the road while being awe-struck and disbelieving what I was seeing.  Also, there had been another accident a short distance further down the road.I don&apos;t know if this is helpful to you or not.  I do know that what I saw was not a MediVac helicopter or any other flying object I&apos;ve seen before. Please feel free to contact me on my cell phone should you want to discuss the matter further.

As I was waiting outside for my wife to pick me up I noticed a spherical orange glowing ball in the south sky at roughly a 40-degree angle from my position. The sphere appeared to be at an altitude of about 5,000 feet. The object was hovering and appeared to be wavy like the surface was hot. The look was similar to magma and distorted like the surface of hot asphalt.  The object did not have what looked like conventional lights on it, but rather the whole object seemed to give off an orange fluorescence.After the object hovered for about 4-5 seconds approximately 2 miles to the south, it bolted off directly north, passing overhead and stopping about a half mile north of my location.  Again the sphere halted to an immediate stop and hovered.  When directly overhead the object appeared to be about the size of a house (1,500 square feet) the object at this point was at about a 120-degree angle.  The object traveled that distance in about 2 seconds.  The object then sped off at a 90-degree angle and immediately stopped again.  The object would not slow down and come to a stop, but rather come to an instant stop.  While accelerating the object would maintain a constant velocity and achieve its maximum speed at the instant of its movement from a stop.  After hovering in its location, the object bolted off to the N-NW in an upward 45-degree angle, disappearing from sight in less than a second.The object while in motion about 5,000 feet high was traveling a speed of approximately 4,000 to 5,000 MPH.

In a short matter of 5 seconds the green streak started as a single orb-like light source, and then changed to three green orb-like lights stacked in a vertical line before it disappeared. There was no sound other than the road noise from the moving police car and no smoke trail one would expect from fireworks.

I noticed 2 bright white balls of light hovering over the tree tops about a quarter mile away.There was no noise. We couldn&apos;t figure out what they were, so we walked across the road and all over the front lawn and driveway trying to get a better look.We saw one of the lights shoot down a pulsing like red ray and white lights also flashed and moved around at the same time. It also looked like a huge beam of white light was coming down from underneath both of them.This went on for 3-4 minutes.  All the while these 2 things stayed absolutely still and made no noise at all. As soon as we both took out our camera phones and took a picture, both lights immediately brightened and became much larger. It was as if they saw us and were talking to each other somehow.Then one started slowly moving toward us while the other one slowly moved off to the side and rose up a little higher. We watched this light move ever so slowly toward us. It flew directly over our heads as if in slow motion. It was so low and only made a low whooshing like sound. It was like a manta ray shape or some kind of rounded triangle.  It was shiny, black metallic like. The underside had some kind of square indentations, like a grid almost. There was a red flashing light in front and 2 white flashing strobe lights in the back. It had 3 white lights underneath toward the back of it. On each side were 2 rocket like things that were a lighter color like gray.We watched both of these things fly ever so slowly and quietly until we couldn&apos;t see them over the mountains. We looked around for 1-2 minutes then heard a very low noise unlike any plane or helicopter. We turned and saw the same 2 bright lights hovering in the same exact spots! By now we were extremely freaked out so we woke up our brother.We all live near a military airport base so we are used to different aircraft and how they sound. The 3 of us watched these things for a few minutes silently hover above the tree tops. When my brother shined a flashlight toward them they did the same thing. The light immediately became larger and brightened and it started to move toward us. Only this time it was up a little higher and off to the side of us. The other one rose up and over and hovered behind the tree tops. We couldn&apos;t see it clearly like the first time, but I did manage to get a few seconds of it on video tape-mainly the rear lights. We are in our 30&apos;s, have children and jobs. We are regular people who saw something strange in the sky that night. I have been searching the internet for info and similar reports.", "I saw one object with two lights that shot out a flame.One object clear night sky on the sides were two white lights and from the middle and behind a flame seemed to come from no where and within a second it was all gone. Gone so fast I couldn&apos;t get my husband to see it.", "rectangular in shape with a dimly glowing red globe on each end, hovering at 150 ft. , football field sizedI was 15 yrs old at the time, my mother had just picked me up from softball practice and we approached a tee in the road with a stop sign about a mile out of town. I had laid my head back to rest and noticed a dim red glowing ball in the sky outside my window. I rolled down the window and saw a rectangular shaped craft approximately the size of a football field with dimly glowing red globes on each end. Since the ballfield lights were still on they gave some illumination to the bottom of the craft, which was hovering at approximately 150 ft. I noticed what appeared to be ducting all over the bottom side, and the red glowing globes were veiny.At this point we were at the stop sign and I told my mother to stop, while I had my head completely out of the vehicle. There was no noise from the craft whatsoever. It slowly moved to the South about 50 ft, then changed direction to the North about 50 ft. and then the craft changed from it&apos;s horizontal position to a vertical position and started moving. There was still no sound from the craft.I instructed my mother to stop but she told me other cars were coming up behind us and she began travelling North on the highway, and the object mirrored our speed and direction for approximately 4 miles before rapidly accelerating off toward the North.We arrived at our home a minute later, and I stayed outside to see if it may return or if anything more may happen. Aprroximately 20 minutes after I had last seen the craft, I noticed red lights approaching from the West and another set approaching from the East. As they got closer I could easily hear that they were jet aircraft. What did surprise me was that they were flying straight toward each other and at the point they intersected one aircraft turned 90 degrees and headed North, which would have put it on the same flight path as the unidentified craft. It seemed strange to me, and knowing the distance of a local Air Force base I rationalized that it was possible the craft showed up on radar and that they were trying to fly a grid in order to find it.I never saw the craft again, but I remember it now, some 30 years later, as vividly as the moment I saw it.", "My friend and I were sitting on the beach enjoying the full moon and stars. All of sudden the clouds began clustering together and we could see light moving in our direction from behind the clouds.When the clouds cleared there was a circular object hovering about 500 ft. out over the ocean. There was a bright yellow colored light beaming from the object. When we tried to take a picture of the UFO, our digital camera would produce a flash, but there would only be a blank black screen. In fact, we even tried to take pictures of eachother and the same result happened.After about 20 minutes another craft came into view and the two crafts lights began blinking. We were paralyzed with fear and amazement. The crafts stayed there hovering for about 40 more minutes then, we heard a strange humming sound and a loud &quot;boom&quot; sound as the crafts took off into the sky faster than anything I&apos;ve ever seen.We went for a walk on the beach at sunrise since we couldn&apos;t sleep and found 22 dead sharks down at the water&apos;s edge , about 25 ft, from where we had been sitting.", "UFO spotted near Fremont CAThe object was shaped like a disk, which was spinning in cirles. The object had couple of yellow lights in a row on one of the sides. The body of the object was dark and it was hard to identify the shape on top of the disk.

I was at my grandparent&rsquo;s trailer cabin for the weekend with my parents. (About 4 miles south of Harpers Ferry IA and a few miles north of Effigy Mounds Natioal Monument). I went out to the porch outside to talk on my cell phone. At the time it was about 10 P.M. and I was facing eastward toward the Mississippi River. While talking on the phone, noticed a light near the cabin directly to the right of me. I saw it with the corner of my eye; it caught my attention enough so I turn my head to look. I then saw nothing; I figured that it was just an individual with a flashlight. I continued talking on the phone like nothing had occurred.At about 10:30ish, a half hour later, I am still talking on the phone when I noticed a light again with the right corner of my eye. This time around when I turned to look, I saw a bluish-white light about the size of a basketball or a large flashlight. It was about 2 feet off the ground and moved to the right side of the cabin out of my sight. At this time I figured for sure that it was someone with a flashlight but there was no noise of gravel from footsteps or sounds of any kind during or after, just the sounds of insects and other bugs.An hour later I was done talking on the phone but was eating a snack on the porch, mainly looking at the night&rsquo;s sky. No manmade lights to distract from the star light, a great night to stargaze. I was getting done with my snack and was cold so I was about to head inside for the night when the main event occurred! I saw the same bluish-white light across the Mississippi River at a small island a few hundred yards away. It was moving in a straight line southward a few feet off the ground. It was moving about as fast as a car and that&rsquo;s what I first thought it was till I realized that no roads existed on the small island. It stopped immediately then came back northward on the same trajectory. During this time I was thinking it was an ATV or some other motorized vehicle of that sort. It made no noise and did not change shape or brightness. It moved over the River and moved westward toward my direction (I am sitting at about 150 yards away) and then moved southward down river at the same speed and same height above surface. I then knew this was a UFO of some sort and it seemed to be flying over the surface in a grid like formation. I was no longer sitting in the porch chair and was now standing scared. I said to myself if this thing gets any closer, I was going to run inside. It then moved northward aging still flying at the same lined trajectory and stopped, it came toward my direction even closer. I ran inside as fast as I could not a look back and hid in the cabin trailer of my grandparents.The following night at about 11pm Saturday, I went outside on the porch with my mother. As soon as we got outside she was the one who pointed out and asked me about an object that was hovering a few feet off the waters surface. I looked at the object and it was the same bluish-white basketball sized object! It was flying downstream on the Mississippi River and we stood watching it till it was out of sight. As of 3/27/2008, I have not seen it again or anything else like it.", "Huge Bright White Circular Light Divides Into Four &amp; Manuvers Over New Hampshire SkiesA cold clear New Hampshire night in January 2003. We saw a HUGE bright white circle glowing in the Southeastern sky. It hovered for several minutes. There was NO Sound. The Farm Animals were restless. It then divided &apos;equally and in unison&apos; into four smaller white circles. Each one of the smaller craft went through a series of manuvers, including tight zig- zags, up and down, and in circles. This went on for approximately 10 minutes. Then all 4 just stopped dead in the sky and hovered at an &apos;equal distance&apos; from each other for about 2 minutes. They then began to line up, one behind another, and sped away, zig zagging into the southwestern sky.", "Yellow/orange light moving around slowly, appeared to be around 1,500&apos; altitudeAbout mid-afternoon I saw what I initially thought was a plane with the sun reflecting off, but after several seconds figured out that there was no plane there and the object in fact was self illuminated.Then for a minute or so I watched it move in a manner that a plane would not.

There was a full moon outside and I decided to take pictures of the moon. I didn&apos;t see anything initially when I was taking the pictures, but after reviewing the pictures there is a saucer like object in the sky. The shape was not in all the photos so I don&apos;t believe it was a camera malfunction. The saucer had a blue color to it on the dome part of it and the rest of the saucer was gray in color.

We were facing due south and the sky was clear and the Moon and Mars were brightly visible. Suddenly a bright light appeared in the sky, about a palms width east of the Moon and Mars. It was traveling slowly in a easterly direction. I could barely make out a saucer shape on the rt. side of the light. The light was about one and a half times the brightness of the moon. Suddenly the object took off so fast that it appeared to wink out. It was a very quiet night and there was no sound of any aircraft at the time. My wife is a RN and I am a retired Police Officer.

He decided to take a cool bath before bed, as we did not have air conditioning, and our bedroom becomes very warm. He had just gotten out of the bathtub when I asked him if he would like to step outside before we retire for the night and feel some of the cooler night air. He agreed that it was a good idea, so, he grabbed a cigarette, and we stepped outside. We have a paved patio of sorts right out the backdoor and that was where we were standing when this unexplainable &quot;something&quot; came shooting out of nowhere. Out of habit, we both always end up looking at the sky in the evening in hopes of seeing a falling star, which is what we were doing at this point. Suddenly, there it was. I yelled, &quot;Money, money, money&quot; as is my custom when I see a falling star, however, I realized before I even said the third &quot;money&quot; that this was not a falling star at all. When I first saw it, it was coming down fast, like a falling star would, but it kept coming, and it was getting bigger, and it had no tail, flame, or anything I&apos;ve ever seen before. And before I could even blink, it was there, maybe 3 or 4 football field lengths above our house. It was an amber color, and it was shaped like a tylenol capsule. It was huge. It was giving off this amber light, yet, it wasn&apos;t like any kind of light I have ever seen in my life. It seemed to absorb the light around us as much as it seemed to be giving off the light as well. I realize this makes little sense, however, I am at a lack of words to explain it. It stayed there. I have no idea how long. I ran out further into the yard when it then sped toward the center of the town we live in. We have a lot of trees in our yard which blocked my view, so I ran out into the street to see where it was. We have a building here, it&apos;s the tallest I believe in our town, and this craft hovered there above it. Again, I don&apos;t know how long it did, but it seemed about a minute. Then suddenly, it shot straight back up and utterly disappeared. I do not know what this was. We immediantly came back inside, and went to a few sites that forcast or inform about any celestial happenings in the sky such as meteor showers, auroroa borealis, etc.. and there was nothing.

The prediction was that it was just a plane far away, although the planes at this altitude often have trails (as compared with many other planes in the sky at the time). After keeping watch on it for between 10 and 15 seconds, the object had hovered, started flying (to fast for a plane) and disappeared behind a wisp of cloud no bigger than a finger nail when held to the sky.

My good friend sitting to my right in the back seat of the jeep (My other two friends were in the driver and passenger seats) had pointed out seeing a light in the sky doing some strange things. We all watched the light for a minute or two and after seeing that it was moving in a pretty regular pattern to the south we passed it off as a plane. As my other three friends continued to talk I continued to watch this light, I noticed that it was an oval shaped light and had changed direction, it was now moving exactly on the same path, but in a different direction, then it stopped... moved vertically upward... stopped... moved in a diagonal direction, and started moving south again. I had at this point told my friends to take a second look at the light and we were all baffled as it repeated its strange movements, the strangest patterns were the perfectly verticle upward and downward motions of the light, and it was close enough to see that it was not a plane, or a car driving with its headlights on over the mountains. After two or three minutes it settled back downward slowly out of sight to the hills near the Grand Junction Airport. With 4 whitnesses as equally sane as I am I cannot begin to explain this light.

Mentioned on local news as well.After watching Larry King this evening I decided to reflect on a UFO sighting that I had.While traveling on a major road in Port Saint Lucie I and other people in the vicinity spotted un identified flying objects above a line of trees on the eastern side of the road. The other cars slowed down as did I. The incident was actually reported briefly on the 11:00 PM local news that evening.I would need to look for the exact date but it was in the 1997-1999 range. It was a Saturday. I can find the exact date because my husband had a golf tournament that day. We have some dated souvenirs from the event. At the BBQ after the tournament I shared what I had seen with some close friends. Later that evening the news cast mentioned it. They had had some calls and therefore asked various military and weather experts about activity in the area. No valid earthling events had been occurring that match what people had seen.The road is adjacent to Port Saint Lucie Blvd. It runs into the turn pike entrance. It is a north /south roadway connecting Port Saint Lucie Blvd to another major roadway.I was traveling with my four children. My children saw the objects also but were rather young at the time and more interested in their play toys than what Mom was seeing or saying.The objects were disc like in shape. They hovered above the tree line. As fast as I saw them, was as fast as they left. To the best of my recollection there were two to three.As other people that have seen UFOs can probably attest to, by the time I processed what I was seeing they were gone. The string of cars on the road all slowed down to get a closer look at what we were witnessing. On hind sight, I wish we had all pulled over to share what we had just witnessed and exchanged contacts. But as I said, when it actually is happening the feeling of shock and disbelief is rather overwhelming.All I know is what I saw and that I will not forget it.I am a professional of sound mind and body. I was not under the influence of anything and have no reason to make this up. Actually with the stigma attached to those that claim to see UFOs, it isn&rsquo;t something that I&rsquo;d invent for attention. In my profession, making &ldquo;crazy&rdquo; claims can lead to career fall outs. I am happy to see that so many creditable people have seen object that can&rsquo;t be identified and are coming forward to share their sightings.In closing, do you think the ants know we are here? As they build their intricate ant hills and communicate with each other, they most likely have no idea we are functioning as a society. We know the ants are here but really take no special interest in them on a daily basis. Some ants may encounter human beings but have no real idea how to incorporate that into their &ldquo;ant universe&rdquo;.

He told me to pick him up at 11:00PM but didn&apos;t get off until close to 12:00AM. I was stuck waiting outside for him for over a hour. It was pretty humid so I didn&apos;t want to wait inside the car so I got out and waited. The parking lot was almost all empty except the cars of the people that were cleaning up the store.At about 11:45PM I laid out on the roof of my car and looked up at the night sky. I looked at a couple of planes passing by and then something caught my attention. There was this object moving really slow directly above me. I&apos;m a skeptic so I tell myself it&apos;s probably some balloons, until the object stopped moving. Then I got a really good look at it. Here is what I can describe as only a black Triangle and it was pointing north, and where the angles were, there where white dots in their place.The object was almost directly over me. I got a good look at it but because of the lights in the parking lot I had to cover up the light coming off the street lights so the glare wouldn&apos;t get to my eyes. So I just stared at it for about a minute, then it started to move north very slowly. Nobody was around so I could show them so I didn&apos;t bother taking my eyes off of it.It continued north until I couldn&apos;t see it anymore.I googled &quot;Black triangle with white dots in the sky&quot; and this website came up, and I saw that there was a string of sightings of the same thing in February of 2007 that described the exact same thing. So I was happy I&apos;m not the only one who seen it. I hope this info was helpful.", "Me and a friend were driving home from a friend&apos;s birthday party around 10:00 to 10:30 PM. A little ways past his house we noticed a very bright light to our left. Looking at it first I said &quot;Why is that plane flying so low&quot;? But then it dropped down from where it originally was and was coming closer to our car. That&rsquo;s when my friend said &quot;That&rsquo;s not a plane&quot;. The shape of the UFO was triangular with white lights on each of the corners and a big red light in the center. It also had many other little lights but are harder to remember. I rolled down my window to try to take a picture with my camera cell phone, and that&rsquo;s when I noticed that the UFO was completely silent. No noise of an engine or anything, dead silent. I took a picture on my phone, but it turned out very blurred, it was just a blurry splotch of light on my phone. The craft then rose up higher after passing over our car and moved into the distance out of our sight. After seeing this we were both in shock because of how close our encounter was. NOTE: I spoke with the witness who had little to add except that the sighting occured in the Pierpont area around Hwy 163 and N.  - B.

It seemed to be rather large but far enough away that we could not tell the shape.", "Small submarine like structure spottedIt was around 9:00pm and I went outside, only intending to look for the Little and the Big Dipper, but could hardly see anything because there were clouds covering most of the sky.Before I went back into my house, I spotted a submarine like structure (I don&rsquo;t know how else to describe it.. it was the same form as a sub but there was a major size difference: it was probably about the size of a small pop-up camper and it was flat, but it was in the shape of a sub.)  There were no lights.  It was darker than the sky. It flew about 10 seconds and then veered west toward the town of Toccoa on highway 17.", "Lights seen over West Lafayette, IN around 10:30 pm on 4/16/2008The sighting occurred at approximately 10:30 pm on April 16, 2008 as I was driving home from getting gas for my car in West Lafayette, IN.  I was proceeding eastbound on Kalberer Rd going approximately 30 mph.  I was on my cellular phone with my mother at the time of the sighting.  As I was driving I looked up in the east sky and saw what looked like a straight line of yellowish lights relatively low in the sky.The straight line had 6-8 lights in a row.  The lights almost looked like very bright street lights except higher in the sky.  The lights appeared to be stationary for a few seconds and then appeared to turn 90 degrees and disappear into the sky (the movement reminded me of a snake turning).  As they turned and disappeared it looked as they were going upward away from myself at a slight angle.  The whole incident transgressed in a matter of 5-10 seconds. As I was witnessing the lights I did see a car maybe 500 ft. ahead of me on the road.  As the incident was occurring the car pulled to the side of the road.  After the lights disappeared I pulled up on the driver&apos;s side of the car and signaled for the person to roll down their window.  The person was a female probably in her late 50s with glasses and what looked like brown hair.  I asked her, &quot;Did you see that?&quot;  She replied, &quot;Yes, I did.&quot;  I then stated that at least I knew I was not crazy and drove off.  I explained to my mother on the phone what had just transgressed and she was in a bit of shock!  Prior to this sighting I was very skeptical about UFOs but this kind of jarred me from that train of thought.  I am finishing up my PhD in structural engineering and am not some sort of unstable wack job.  I consider myself relatively intelligent and to know quite a bit about physics and hard science principles.  What I saw defies all the scientific knowledge I have.  To see the light turn like it did and disappear so quickly baffles me.  Even fighter jets flying in the evening at supersonic speeds can still be seen for several seconds as they pass overhead.  This object just completely zoomed off and disappeared.", "I was a radar operator at Fallon NAS, we were a parasite unit of the air force. We got a call from the Navy control tower to check out an object west of us, I was on scope and the height finder, I measured it at 5,000 feet at a distance of severl miles, the terraine west of us was flat, we opened up the doors behind the plotting board, and there was the saucer. It would help you guys to talk to radar operators. Respects ((name and e-address deleted)),  I am 70 and in my life that incident stands out so very clear!", "Sphere UFO in high altiude moved slowly and stopped then moved again. I could notice that the movement of the craft was different from any humanmade airplane. It also moved to the side so rapidly too.", "Reading entry from Beachwood in 1972 reminded me that I saw the same type thing.I was probably under age 15...so mid 70s, driving on Winchester behind Acacia Country club, in the morning or afternoon, looked out the car window and saw an object in the sky-about 1000-2000 feet up. hovering- clear day-but humid- so white/sky. gray to reddish grey oval object.", "shiny round object flying along mountain ridge and then down to tree lineWe live at 6800 feet in the Virginia City Mountains overlooking a large valley.  We were getting ready to put away our telescope which had been used earlier when I spotted a bright shiny circular object jetting across the mountains on the other side of the valley.  I showed my husband and he grabbed the telescope to try and hone in on it.  It flew across the mountains and then turned in our direction and dropped to the tree line and slowed down considerably.  It stayed along the tree line as if following the road below and flying between two large outcroppings of rock.  It then went out of sight behind the trees on our mountain. It made no sound whatsoever. My husband was not able to see it through the telescope so we just watched it as it went out of site.  We are in a flight path and have many planes, jets and helicopters fly over.  It was none of these.  You could not safely fly over the trees and through the jagged mountains in any craft we are familiar with.", "Moving at constant speed, always upward in the same fashion as a falling and failing aircraft.The flying object was of dark color, most likely dark gray or black. Its shape was unknown to me and my mother. It was traveling northwest, originally coming from over the Atlantic Ocean. No lights whatsoever were visible on the object.It basically resembled a huge flat fish (ray); it had large and flat wings (one on each side) with very round and basic edges. As intriguing this object was, it still very much looked like an aircraft with two side wings, a distinctive front end and a back end including a wing. Certainly this object was large, but not incredibly massive &ndash; probably a bit larger than a commercial, transatlantic plane. The wings were distinctive from the body which looked like a cylinder. Also the wings were attached about halfway on the body.The strangest part was the motion of this object. It moved upward by rotating on itself at a fairly slow and steady speed (about 5 sec. to rotate on itself). The object never appeared to fly downward and moved up at a slow rate (similar to a small commercial plane) - I and my mother were able to see it for many minutes from the front and back of our house.A fairly quite noise was possibly heard early when we first witnessed the object at low altitude and a certain aura/haze was present at times.Finally, a large cluster of clouds made the object disappear from our vision, but it disappeared steadily and not abruptly.Note that a commercial plane was flying in the opposite direction (Southeast) during the last minute of the sight at a very similar altitude. It could not have been further than 3 miles from it.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))", "Daytime sighting of bright light changing to stationary white/blue gray annulus and then moved very fast.Weather: Temperature (est) upper 80s/low 90s), humidity (dew point 60s), wind light, clear sky with patch of high level cirrus to north east.  Air craft contrails moderate to short with definite gaps in trail.Narrative: I was sitting on a lounge chair located in the patio shade attempting to read a novel as I played with my granddaughter and a neighbor&rsquo;s child.  They were interested in how the chair could change positions as I relaxed so they were tilting me to and fro.  My grandson was off exploring around the corner of the house.I observed a contrail passing from North to South as an aircraft flew along the usual flight path to the west of Washington. This contrail was short to moderate in length as it evaporated into the dry upper-level air.  The next aircraft observed along that path did not pass until after 1700 hours. Length of contrails depends upon humidity level of the surrounding air and there were definite long gaps in these contrails.As I looked at the contrail and the aircraft started to disappear behind a nearby tree, my attention was drawn to a bright light very slightly above the contrail. I assumed this light to be caused by the sun reflecting from another aircraft. As I looked at the light source, its position in the sky relative to the contrail did not change. Thus it could not have been caused by reflection from another aircraft. Nor could it have been caused by reflection from a satellite. Both sources would have moved relative to the contrail.Shortly the apparent position relative to the still existing contrail changed from above to below the contrail.  Time for this change from the initial was estimated in the neighborhood of 30 to 60 seconds.  I noted that the light was now an object that appeared to be similar to a high flying balloon such as those used for upper air studies. So my next guess at the cause of the bright light that I first noticed was a reflection from the instrument package.  Thus I arose from my lounge chair to call my grandchildren so that I could show them the balloon.The object now appeared against the blue sky background as a white/blue-gray annulus with a darker blue-gray center. It was much larger than the original light source. Relative size can be compared to that of a pea (3-5 mm) held at arms&rsquo; length. From my viewing angle I assumed that it was a round object with a flat bottom since it appeared elliptical. Color and shading was consistent with light shining through, not reflecting from, a high flying polyethylene balloon. Brightness was similar to that of the moon which was in the eastern sky on that day. The moon in the southern sky was hidden from my view by the roof of the home.I continued to view the object as it moved quite quickly for a short (relative) distance and stopped.  Upon this movement, I started to think that perhaps the object was much closer to me and that it could be some type of air borne seed (such as cottonwood) or debris moved about by low level winds swirling around the house.  Second thoughts occurred as I changed my position relative to nearby houses and trees.  This object had moved too fast for wind born insects, seeds or debris.As I continued to observe the object, it very suddenly accelerated and sped off eastward passing across my field of view from west to east behind the nearby rooftop in well under one second. Total subtended angle of movement before moving out of my sight was in the 20 degree range.  No contrail or other evidence of its passing remained except the image in my minds eye.Altitude of this object cannot be estimated from this single observation since the size of this object is unknown. Estimated angle above the horizon at first sighting is around 40 degrees.  The apparent standing still with respect to the contrail can be explained by the initial movement of the object directly toward me. The object would have moved closer to me and toward the north as it descended below my reference contrail and become a recognizable shape. From my viewing angle, the object was probably circular giving it somewhat of an elliptical &ldquo;cigar&rdquo; shape popularized by other UFO reports. It moved too fast across my field of view to describe it better. Total viewing time was 1.5 to 3 minutes. This is estimated from my first sighting to my subsequent moving about to locate my grandchildren.  I certainly did not look at my watch during this event.Observer Background: Meteorology (retired)((NUFORC Note:  Witness appears to us to be an exceedingly qualified observer.  PD))", "we saw 7 fireball type objects in formation, moving from the northwest to the southeast.On April 27th 2008 at about 8:40 we were standing on our driveway on S. Arthur Ave in Loveland CO. We saw 6 round orange yelllow lights in the sky, like the color of fire (fireballs). There was no sound.The lights were in formation, two followed by two followed by two, the same distance apart from each other side to side front to back.They were moving from the Northwest to the Southeast at a pretty good speed. When we first saw them they were at about 60 degrees elevation (about 11 o&rsquo;clock looking east) and then when they were about at a 30 degree elevation (about 2 o&rsquo;clock looking east) a seventh came from the Northwest traveling at a faster rate of speed (this is when we remembered the camera and took the pictures) it cought up with the others and joined the formation. And then they were gone.The entire time we watched them was 10 to 15 minutes", "Introduction  I was about 4-5 years old.  I woke up in the middle of night and found myself alone in the house!  It was dark.  I looked out the window and into the neighbor&apos;s kitchen.  Saw a being there, facing my neighbor, and the neighbor was seated.  The being had something in his hand, and when he jutted it toward my neighbor, my neighbor jerked, like being shocked.  I gasped.  The being immediately turned and looked at me.  I ran and did the only thing I could think of...I tried to hide under my bed.  But the bed was low to the ground and I could only get my head and shoulders under it.  It was too heavy for me to lift.  I was terrified.  I waited and then heard soft footsteps on the wood floor.  The being was in the house.  It came to the door and I believe stood in the door looking at me.  I fainted.Have written in detail a number of times, only to never hear back from anyone.  There are other events too:  1. My mother had an encounter, possibly that same night.2. My mother saw a cigar-shaped craft.3. My mother and I were on a trip together and both lost about 2 hours of time on the trip.4. I had dental x-rays that showed a piece of metal in the front of my mouth below the teeth, in the gums.  A few years later another x-ray was taken that showed nothing.5. I saw 5 football-shaped craft with stubby wings, flying in a circle.6. I saw 5 &quot;stars&quot; high in the sky one night in Montana.  There were 4 in corners and one in the center.  They moved together in formation.7. Another incident that defies category.  I was camping in a car overnight.  Everyone in the campground had seemingly disappeared.  There were cars and campers but no people.  Fog, I felt drugged, something was outside.  The car lights seemed dim and yellowish.8. &quot;weather balloon&quot; hovering over my schoolyard.

The neighbor was 30 ish and her son was 19 years old. My sister and I were leaving to go home around 8:00 pm. We all walked outside, as we always did, and her son pointed to an object in the sky. We saw a large &apos;cigar shaped object&apos; emitting light and hovering above us in the sky. It made no sound. We moved toward the back yard (which was a small field) in order to see it better. It started to decend right over us, like it saw us looking at it.  It got larger and larger but there was no way to really judge the size or how close it was, but it seemed bigger than the neighbor&apos;s house. It decended slowly and blocked out the stars in the sky. It felt like it was right on top of us. Then, without warning, the Object shot straight up in the sky at a speed that was astounding. It became the size of a Softball and bright white in the sky.  It stopped and angled right and zipped away so fast that you could only follow it for a few seconds. Then it was gone. A minute or so later, we heard and saw several &apos;Airforce Jets&apos; from &apos;Pease Airforce Base&apos; flying in the same direction the object retreated. The sound of the Jets made us realize that the object that we had just witnessed had no sound to it at all.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

We were standing on the balcony of the 6th floor of the block of flats where I lived.We suddenly noticed that in the clear sky there was a circular disc it did not seem to be very far away as it looked very large, and quite chunky.We could see the detail of it quite clearly. It looked metallic. It was hovering in the sky. We speculated on what it was, I thought it must be some kind of weather satellite as I just could not conceive what it could be, it was so clear but none of us had seen anything like it before. We were astounded however when it suddenly took off at an amazing speed and we followed its flight until it went out of sight.I was excited to read in our weekly local paper that this object had been spotted by many people in our local area.

I was looking along the horizon to the west and up into the sky at the stars and noticed an object that I had never seen there before. It was just over the tree line. I knew at once that it was either a plane or something else since it was too bright to be a star or a planet. It was spherical, bright, and appeared to have a halo or an aura around it. I kept watching it to see if it would turn towards the airport to land, but it didn&apos;t. For a good three minutes it remained stationary in the sky. Then all of a sudden it dropped in altitude and picked back up to the exact place where it was when I first saw it. It then zipped toward the north and disappeared. In the place where it disappeared, there seemed to have been a hole ripped in the clouds.I knew at this time that it must have been something not of this world, so I went inside to get my blanket and wrap up on the balcony. About five minutes passed with me sitting on the balcony watching the sky for another or the same object. Suddenly one appeared on the same place the fist one had. It had the same characteristics as the first. This craft zipped to the north and the south with ease and agility. Then it returned to the same place where it first appeared, and the light that it was emitting slowly faded.I have seen a few UFOs before, but never anything of this magnitude. My father had once described the same phenomenon to me, except the craft was much closer to him. There was the same agility and the same aura to the object.

This object flew just above the tree tops and made a low humming noise.I feel there are two points of particular interest regarding this sighting.First, that my brother filmed the object and other strange lights seen that night then immediately drove to the news station in Detroit.My memory fails me at this point but I believe it was channel 7.  The news station aired the film on the eleven p.m. news.  All that was on it were neighborhood dogs he had filmed earlier in the day.  It was made out to be a hoax.  I also seem to remember that it was somehow proven later that the film had been tampered with.Second, that I was interviewed at a later date by Air Force personnel regarding the sighting.  I was alone with the personnel at our kitchen table as I gave my account of the sighting.  I remember being asked to draw a picture which I did.  Other witnesses in my family were also interviewed seperately the same day.I have been searching to no avail regarding the newscast or Air Force report referencing this sighting.

It was a very clear night, and I was just stargazing while I smoked a cigarette.I noticed a bright light streak across the sky directly above me.  My first thoughts of the white streak was it might be a missile.  But then I realized it had no sound, and only lasted at most, 2 seconds.  The missile thoughts came to mind because over the past year, and more so in recent months, we have had numerous fly overs at EXTREMELY low altitudes of fighter jets, blackhawk helicopters, and cargo planes.  I actually have a photo of a fighter jet flying over, and as recently as June 1st, a formation fly over occured.  I ran inside and got my 12 year old brother, hoping maybe he could catch a glimpse of something to prove I wasn&apos;t going crazy at 23 years old!  Of course, my younger brother mocked me because of what I had seen.  Within 20 minutes of being outside again, we both saw a streak of light go across the sky.  From our vantage point, it moved east to west.  It was green in color, and seemed to skip over parts of the sky, as if it disappeared and reappeared right in front of us!  It covered a large distance in a matter of 6 seconds, at most.  My brother was amazed.We decided to stay outside and try to see even more.  Ten minutes went by, and then we both noticed another streak go overhead.  It was white in color and gone within a second.  We both rushed inside and were a little shaken by the sights we had seen.I coaxed my girlfriend outside late June 7th because she thought I was going insane.  It was a clear night once again.  We watched the stars slowly appear as the sun went down.  We noticed the moon to the west and saw saturn and venus closely next to the moon.  As we panned across the sky, going west to east we noticed what we thought was a star... Moving!  We could barely see it, but could easily see the movement.  It moved very subtle, very slow, and within about 6 seconds it was completely gone.Last night, June 10th, I decided to go outside and sit on our back porch.  It was around 1:15 a.m.  I noticed the green streak again!  It appeared to be moving towards the ground, in intervals like the previous sightings.  It was farther east, in the direction of Holly Springs, MS.  I went back inside, and that&apos;s where I stayed.I&apos;ve gotten curious whether or not anyone else around the Memphis, TN area or northwest Mississippi area has seen the things I have witnessed within the last week or so.One more note: The green streaks I saw also seemed to change towards a blue then an orange.", "Cigar shaped ufo , anyone in Windham area seen ufos??While waiting in the Wal-Mart parking lot, looking towards Wal-Mart a weird shaped craft caught my eye, I could not tell really what it was.

At 7:54 pm there were three of us driving in a car northbound on Pueblo Blvd. heading out toward Highway 50. I remember the time exactly because before we saw the ufo I looked at the clock in the car because we were supposed to call a friend some time after 8:15 and pick him up. We were heading out to another friend&apos;s house for a quick visit. The house we were heading to at the time was an apartment complex with a locking gate that requires a keycode for entry, at least at that time of night, though I&apos;m not sure because I&apos;ve only been there once. I think to get there you take one of the last right turns as you head from the city park on Pueblo Blvd. over a bridge that goes over the Arkansas River, which we&apos;ve also seen different looking ufos over. As we pulled in to the apartment complex, we could see Highway 50 across a small field, maybe a few hundred feet away to a car dealership with al of it&apos;s parking lot lights on.But, after we had crossed the river heading out to these apartments, we saw a few small radio antennas of some sort with a single red blinking light on the top of each, and further in the distance larger, much taller antennas with red blinking lights. They&apos;re landmarks out there, and when you see one of these at night, the same one you&apos;ve driven past over and over at night, you know what&apos;s a radio tower and what&apos;s not. Between the smaller towers closer to us, and the taller towers much further ahead of us, was an oval shaped light (like a cirlce, but with a flat top and bottom). Judging by the mile markers, it was a little more than a quarter mile away when we first saw it, but it was off to our right, about 7-8 stories above the ground. It emitted a red light similar to the lights on the radio towers, but this light was bigger, the whole &quot;craft&quot;, and was a brighter, slightly pink-tinted red light. We could not see a definite outline of a craft, just a light. The light! coming  from it seemed somewhat constant, but the way the glare shifted and points of intensity in the light shifted rapidly with much energy, it seemed like a plasma of some sort. And I don&apos;t mean like some hippy lighting effect show, I mean like looking at a plasma light bulb in which the light seems constant in it&apos;s intensity, but slightly grainy, and without the glass to hold the plasma and dull it&apos;s intensity. The light seemed to have been travelling the same direction and speed that we were. Just before we came to our turn off, the light began to descend to between 5-6 stories, leaving a semi-vertical steam or smoke trail. When it finished descending to between 5-6 stories off the ground, the  emission of the steam trail ceased and the light dissappeared. The craft descended and disappeared within just a few hundred feet of the apartment we were headed to, as we were driving just beneath this steam trail as it floated south along with the wind and descended to the ground with the wind so that the bottom of th steam trail was about 2-3 stories off the ground, and not even 60 ft. from our vehicle as we were driving out to the apartment. We heard no sound from the craft, but we were driving so if there were a faint noise we wouldn&apos;t have heard it. It was not an airplane or helicopter, military or civilian, as we have both that fly over Pueblo and especially in that area. We would&apos;ve heard the rotors had it been helicopter, as it was travelling about 60mph northbound, following Pueblo Blvd. but off the the right as you approach Highway 50. It was not an airplane, as we would&apos;ve heard the engines and no airplane I know of in use can travel 60 mph and even slow down as it descends to 5-6 stories without crashing. Besides that, this was one solid pink light that gave off a steam trail lower than 100ft. The steam trail, and I say that because it was light and not dark like smoke, was almost vertical, but you could tell that the craft descended rapidly, almost vertically, but while still travelling north. I don&apos;t ! know if  it dropped off it&apos;s horizontal speed while it descended because we weren&apos;t close enough to it to tell, we only drove up right under it&apos;s steam trail. I almost wish we&apos;d had some sort of air sensor on a long pole, because we could&apos;ve sampled the steam trail we were so close to it. If I had to put an approximate size on this ufo, I&apos;d say about 1 and 1/3 as tall as an SUV and as wide as 2 SUV&apos;s are long. It appeared to be round all around, with a flatter top and bottom, but we only saw it from one angle as it was travelling the same direction we were at about the same speed. As to the weather on this night, it was nice out, but getting pretty chilly because I wished I&apos;d had my sweater with me. There were no clouds in the sky and it was probably about 40 degrees F.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))", "Photographing aboard USS Midway.

I was about 3 to 4 miles North of Highway 85 when I saw an intense flashing light to the left of the road, about 100 feet in the air.  The flying light was flashing from a less intense light to a really bright light and did not appear to be moving.  But after watching it a couple of seconds, it appeared to start moving towards me.  I asked my wife, &quot;What the heck is that?&quot;  We both watched it approach and pass very quickly to our left, still in the air.  I was looking forward trying to drive and looking back trying to watch the object.  After it had passed us, I noticed another flying, flashing bright light which appeared to be going the same direction as the first flying, flashing bright light.  Both objects moved quickly in the direction of Highway 85 and disappeared out of sight within a matter of 6 seconds.  I could not put a size to it because there was no shape to it, just a bright flashing light.  I do not remember ever seeing that intense of a light at night before.  The entire time I saw the objects was only about 10 seconds.", "Flashing disc of red blue and white lights over Murrieta/Temecula that left with a comet looking flashI live on a hillside in Murrieta, California.  Our home overlooks a large portion of the valley below and we have fewer glares than homes below us.  I think that really made the difference in this sighting.  I was helping my nine year old get ready for bed this evening, at approximately 8:50 p.m.  I went into our 2nd story loft to open a window, and due to the pretty view, I peeked out through one of the windows.  I noticed a strange flashing object hovering over what seemed to be roughly over the Promenade Mall in Temecula, or maybe south a mile or two, over the power lines off of Route 79 south.  The object was not moving, and I watched it for at least 10 minutes to see if would reveal itself to be a helicopter, or plane.  It just stayed in the area. It was barely moving around, except for the spinning motion, going clockwise.  It could easily see white spinning lights, turning blue, then back to white, and then red and then to white again.  It seemed to wobble a few times, but remained over the area without moving away.  I had to step away to tuck my daughter into bed, and when I got back it was still there.  I grabbed my telescope and ran downstairs, but when I went to the front door, the house across the street was blocking my view.  I ran to the garage and tried to find it, but the same house blocked the view.  I went back upstairs, frustrated, and found it in the sky, but it had moved about 2 inches to the right, from my viewpoint.  Then, it flashed like a camera flash, and then I saw a yellow streak fly across the sky, moving upwards at an angle of about 45 degrees.  I remember thinking it looked like a comet in reverse.  The streak was gone in an instant.  This whole process took 20 minutes.", "Red-green light viewed over central Illinois.There was a single object. The object seen was almost orb-like in shape.  It was pulsating red and green and falling at a rapid pace before it disappeared close to the horizon. The sky was clear otherwise with only stars in view.  The object stood out considerably, and was much larger.  The pulsating color was completely different than any aircraft I&apos;ve seen in the area.  The other strange thing was the blurred almost tail-like effect that was caused while it fell. I was the only observer, that I know of, of the object.  I&apos;ve been a believer in paranormal and UFO phenomenon for quite sometime.  This even struck me by suprise, since I have never experience such an even before.", "Bright White Light  slowly moving across the skyA  friend and I were driving southeast bound on Hwy 72 towards Salem when I looked up and saw what appeared to be a  very big  bright star that appeared to be moving.  It was flying at an altitude of what a commercial plane would be and it was headed in an easterly direction.  It was flying in a straight forward manner. The object had no blinking lights it was just a contstant white  bright light.  As it got further away from us it seemed to dim down almost to nothing where you could barely see it anymore, but it still was not so  far away where you could not totally tell where it was.  We tracked the object for about 5 minutes before it dimmed down.  There were other vehicles were on the road at this time, but none of them stopped to watch.  This happened about 21:23 hours on May 20th, 2008. I am a college student that has numerous sighting around this area for quite some time. And she is a high school graduate", "Plane follows unexplained lightHusband called for me to come outside and see a plane follow something in the night sky, headed in direction of ENE.

The object appeared to be moving at the same altitude for the duration of the sighting. The object was roughly 100 feet away and likely 3-5 feet long across the side facing my friend and me. It disappeared from sight after moving at a constant rate of speed for about 30-40 seconds. The object made absolutely no sound.A group of skateboarders sitting about 25 feet away pointed out the object to my friend and me while we played catch as we did not notice it initially. Interestingly, one of the skateboarders made the comment, &quot;it&apos;s spying on you.&quot; My friend and I continued to play catch as the whole event felt somewhat surreal and there wasn&apos;t an instantaneous cohesive response by us. However, a few minutes later it grew too dark and we stopped playing catch. At that time we discussed the event and did not know what to make of it. As we walked down to the parking lot below the batting cages we hoped to see the skateboarders to ask them what they honestly thought it was but they were gone. After discussing the event, we postulated the only logical explanation was some sort of runaway kite but the seemingly constant altitude and velocity on a clear and breezeless night made that postulation unlikely to us.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

The first that went over was a large (about the size of my thumb nail) and extremely bright spherical light, then 7 elongated triangular flying objects flew over.  The triangles were as long as my thumb (held at arms distance).  The edges were illuminated and showed depth.There were 6 amber colored lights under each one of the triangles.  There was no sound.  This occurred during the fireworks display for the opening ceremonies of the United States Figure Skating Championship.  The fireworks had just started, perhaps about a minute into the display when up above the arrow head shaped craft flew over following the sphere of extremely bright light.

She is very good at creating animation using her Mac computer.  I asked her to write down the experience she had so that I could report the incident as a possible UFO. She did that for me and she also supplied me with the picture and the animation that I have attached.  The picture (lightshape2.jpg) is a representation of the object on a photograph of the tops of the two trees where the object appeared to hover.  The animation (lightshapelayers2.mp4) is her attempt to represent the shifting nature of the object&mdash;at times amorphous and without apparent boundaries of edges, at times with edges more distinct.  She says it is a pretty good representation of what she saw. We both use Macs so I hope it translates well to PC computers. Here is what she wrote about the experience:  We were being lashed by the remnants of Hurricane Noel (Nov 2 or 3, 2007-I can&rsquo;t remember the exact date but I think it was the 2nd). There was gale force wind, thunder, lightning, heavy rain. I was sitting in my computer room near the window in my second-floor studio when I noticed that there was something strange about the lightning. There was too much of it, it was like watching a strobe light, and the thunder didn&rsquo;t seem to correspond. It was like the lightning was spelling out something in Morse Code. Dit dit dit dit, etc. And it was too near, too bright and very unusual. I started to feel a little uneasy. But it was just a storm so I waited. I decided that I should turn off the computer because it was the type of weather that causes power outages. Just after doing so I sat quietly in the darkness of the room for a while. Then there was a bright flash and a brilliant light illuminated the entire yard, driveway and all the nearby area about 30 feet in every direction (an estimate). But it still didn&rsquo;t seem like lightning, and I did not want to look out for fear of what I might see. It felt strange and scary because the illumination lasted for several minutes without flickering or changing although it was clearly undulating. It was brighter than broad daylight-maybe10 times brighter than a cloudless summer day at noon. I wanted to believe that this was ordinary lightning but something scared me and something in me really did not want to know what it was out there, even though I was compelled to look. I had a sense of fear that made me want to crawl under the table. But I sat still and looked out of the north window at the yard and rooftop of the cottage next door. I could see everything clearly bathed in this brilliant white light. It was like there was a giant magnifying lamp, and it stayed unmoving and illuminated, undulating for a long stretch of time, possibly 5-10 minutes. All this time I was sitting rooted to my chair with a window in front (north-facing) and another window to my right (east facing window), both with wide-open views of the weather phenomena outdoors.  At this point in time, I was just witnessing what I thought to be a very unusual lightning storm. Suddenly the light just went out, or rather seemed to have rolled away. It was dark, save for the intermittent &ldquo;dits&rdquo; of light that I described as being regular and code-like. I felt a sense of relief-I noticed after the fact that I was very tense. During the episode I was transfixed, I could have moved but I was trying to focus with all of my senses because of the unusual nature of the lightning so I stayed seated in my chair. When the lights suddenly went out, I moved closer to the window on my right (east)- which has a parallel view of the cottage and property behind my house. I was glad whatever it was, was gone. I knew whatever it was, was strange. Then the light suddenly appeared again, brilliant as ever, illuminating everything, making everything seem like bright and flat white light, filling the sky and everything reflecting it in a bright white glow. I got a really creepy feeling and then I looked out and up over the back of the cottage, in a space like a little valley between two treetops, there seemed to be a consolidated light-ball of some sort: large, like the size of a bus maybe, round and with a concentrated brilliance that was outlined by a thin gradated line - which made the shape seem to blend with the surrounding brilliance. Immediately I thought I was seeing a UFO, then I ducked under the table, the surface of which is about a foot above the window&rsquo;s lower ledge. It&rsquo;s an old drawing board and I had it backed up to the window. Under the table I could look out at it.  I looked at it, stared at it, frozen with fear but compelled by curiosity. I was watching it and almost couldn&rsquo;t breathe. I saw it seem to change shape, as if the thin gradated line modulated, it reminded me of pixilation overlap used in film special effects to depict morphing, it changed from a round circle to a diamond shape, with what seemed like symmetrical filigree-like &ldquo;steps&rdquo; making the edges seem dimensional and not flat. It was like a ragged-edged diamond and the edges again were softly outlined by a thin gradated line. It reminded me of the Russian painter Kasimir Malevich&rsquo;s painting &ldquo;White on White&rdquo;, a painting consisting of a tilted white square on a white backgound. Only a slight variation of brushstroke allows the viewer to see the shape emerge. As difficult as it was to stare for long at the object because of its brightness, the edges of the object were very unusual and detailed, with various tiers along the edges coming forward and receding. After watching it for a minute or two I got really scared and ducked down under the table. I felt like it was a UFO type of thing, even though I kept trying to frame it within my usual knowledge and expectations, all the while &ldquo;knowing&rdquo; that it didn&rsquo;t fit into any frame of reference in my experience, and that there had to be an intelligence involved so I started to &ldquo;talk&rdquo; to it, saying &ldquo;Please go away, you&rsquo;re scaring me&rdquo; and &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to get abducted&rdquo; and stuff like that. I remember saying, &ldquo;whatever you do, don&rsquo;t hurt my cats&rdquo;. But I felt a sense of fear and panic that was undeniable. There was no thunder.  I crawled out of the studio on my hands and knees because I didn&rsquo;t want to be &ldquo;seen&rdquo; even though I already felt like I had been seen and there was no escaping it. I entered the living room where there is a large picture window facing the same direction (east) as the window in the studio with the table. I stayed on the floor. The illumination in the general area remained for some time but fright kept me from looking anymore so I don&rsquo;t know what might have happened. However, after a few more minutes the illumination dissipated, there was darkness and a few &ldquo;dits&rdquo; of light again, but then it was as if the storm had just quieted down a little, everything seemed again like a normal storm - there was regular lightning, but it was farther away and had the accompanying distant thunder, it continued to rain and the winds continued through the night. I had a feeling like I didn&rsquo;t know if I had seen what I had seen. So I constructed a still image showing the relative positioning above the trees, just to serve my memory and help me to realize that whatever it was that I saw, it was something unusual. I followed that with making a short animation as well to show what it looked like, which I think I have captured reasonably well although it is very difficult to &ldquo;say&rdquo; in film with so much whiteness. I have been experimenting with animation techniques for the last 8 years so I knew what I had to do to make the movie look like what I saw. I am self-taught and there is a certain roughness to it because of gaps in my technical knowledge.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

It was the same hue of orange as the sodium vapor street lights used in Honolulu, but larger, and much brighter. I thought maybe it was a reflection of the street lights, but after changing my viewing angle in the car several times I confirmed it was not a reflection. It was much higher than the ridge, so it was not a street light.My girlfriend was in the passenger seat, and asked what I was looking at. I said, &quot;that orange light in the sky.&quot; And she replied, &quot;oh the one that just split into two?&quot;  Indeed, it had split into two.They seemed to be hovering.

SorryIt was between 3 and 5 am in my backyard when i went to let dog out. I was staring at the constellation Cassiopeia and then turned my attention behind me, to the south west, where a very bright star was...maybe Jupiter, not sure. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw something moving from right to left..which would have been exactly in a southerly direction.Naturally, automatically i tried to see what it was and soon found a black, boomerang shaped object moving, very steadily across the sky. It had no lights and no visible features and disappeared out of sight, in a very weird kind of fading manner. It is like it flickered out. It was completely silent. The size is very hard to estimate. Since it was black I could not judge the distance or the size. My BEST estimate would be about the length of a football field from end to end. It was moving very straight. My best guess is that it would have been flying directly over the St Johns River, right on the eastern shore, moving southward. Im a few locks from the river, on University blvd W., between San Jose blvd and Powers avenue. A few days later, I went online to see if anything had ever been talked about. I googled &quot;boomerang ufo&quot; and got scared with what I found. This is EXACTLY what it looked like, except it was night time and much darker. The other thing, the most significant was this website: www.cassiopaea.org/cass/boom.htm I imagine it is a coincidence that I was staring at Cassiopaea just prior to this since I stare at constellations all the time and it was the only one visible in that direction at that time of night due to the trees on that side of my yard. But...it strikes me as odd, that I REMEMBER having been staring at that specific constellation and secondly of course, that the only time in my life I have ever seen anything like this (a UFO) was immediately upon turning away from looking at it.Please, if you can, read what that website says about contact from the constellation. I have always been agnostic but open to these things. I am a sane, normal, everyday person that never ever thought it would happen to me...as the story goes..as Ive heard people say. If you have questions, I would be happy to answer them. I could go on about the psychological nature of the experience, which in itself, was unique, but I will leave that open if you wish to ask.Im very glad this is possible to share. This is now a very real thing to me and my desire is great to see us learning what is happening.   here is a link to the page and it is the image top center - www.cassiopaea.org/cass/boom.htm", "Day time sighting of bizarre cone shaped object seen hovering aloft.Cone shaped object seen in hovering aloft for about seven minutes in the east north eastern sky about 50 to 60 degrees form location observed.

Recap:  This event was taken under investigation as a joint inquiry between NUFORC and MUFON of Georgia. Thumbnail:  (Please see original post in NUFORC data base).  This NUFORC witness reports that after a short local trip in Conyers Georgia, that a number of aircraft were observed &quot;hovering above the city&quot;.  Said aircraft had the look of &quot;fighter jets&quot;, with red, white and blue lights, were flying in pairs back and forth at staggered heights.  Upon arriving at home, witness continued to watch and counted appx. ten aircraft.  About 8:30PM, an &quot;object&quot; (not described by the witness) appeared traveling at a high speed downward as if to crash, but disappeared before it &quot;left the skyline&quot;.  Thereafter the aircraft began to clear away. Earlier separate MUFON investigation in nearby Newton County/Covington/Starrsville area:  On 10Oct07 at a few minutes after 8:00PM, a motorist in the Newton County Starrsville community (appx. 14.5 miles SE of Conyers, I-20 connecting the two vicinities) observed a fiery-like glowing orangish sphere shaped object just to the north side of Starrsville Rd., over the treetops at an unknown altitude and distance, but described as low and fairly close.  Object appeared about the size of a baseball held at arms length, including it&apos;s surrounding aura-like glow, and was moving VERY slow in a westerly direction.  The object seemed to have segments within, much like a science book illustration of a human brain.  Witness also noticed appx. 10 aircraft circling the area.  She reported it to a friend via phone, and upon arrival home contacted MUFON. This investigator met with the MUFON witness in Covington Georgia on 15Oct07, conducted an interview and visited the event site. Witness was found to be well educated, intelligent, and a long time productive resident of Newton County.  Continued investigation consisted of the search for additional witnesses, contacting the local authorities, the Georgia Air National Guard, the FAA and so forth.  No real progress was made toward a positive identification of what was observed. Subsequently, this writer discovered the above NUFORC Conyers witness report which seemed to describe the same event as that of the MUFON witness from the Covington/Starrsville occurrence. This writer contacted NUFORC Director Peter Davenport and a joint investigation was undertaken.  This FI sent an email of explanation to the NUFORC witness, and also placed a phone call to the Conyers residence.  The phone call reached an answering machine, and additional calls thereafter found a recorded message that the line had been disconnected.  There was also no response to this writer&apos;s email. We feel that an interview with NUFORC&apos;s Conyers witness is important to further the Covington/Starrsville investigation, as well as what was described in Conyers. We think that the Conyers witness may have observed the Starrsville event from afar, perhaps from a high vantage point in Conyers that might give a good view toward Convington/Starrsville to the SE.  However, until such time the Conyers witness might come forward we cannot be sure.  Could there have been a second, separate, event in Conyers?  We do not know. Anyone with information regarding this matter can contact Georgia MUFON, State Director Tom Sheets, at mufonofga1@yahoo.com  If the Conyers witness reads this..........please contact us. There is nothing to fear. We would like to conduct an interview at your convenience, and your identity will be held strictly confidential.

My experience happened in 1977 or 1978, when I was 15 or 16 years old. I was the only witness. At the time, I was a member of my local astronomical society, with responsibility for co-ordinating meteor observation. Astronomy was a serious hobby for me then, and I was used to observing the skies and being able to identify the normal kind of objects in the heavens, e.g. stars, meteors, planets, satellites, and planes. It was late, possibly past midnight &ndash; I often did meteor watches through the early hours. I was doing a meteor watch, alone, and lying on a camp bed out on the balcony in front of my house in Slough, Berkshire, UK. Suddenly there was an astonishing phenomenon in the sky of a kind I had never seen before, and have never seen since. It was definitely not an astronomical phenomenon or any description of human vehicle I know of. The object(s) crossed my field of vision rapidly, within a second or maybe even half a second, so it was moving at incredibly high speed. It consisted of two discs of light. They moved so rapidly that it was difficult to distinguish whether they were clearly defined discs or whether the edges were diffuse, but my memory recalls my perception as being that they were fairly diffuse. Although the discs were about a third or half the diameter of the moon, they were not particularly bright &ndash; certainly not as bright as the moon &ndash; but not particularly dull, either. The strange thing about them is that they seemed to be connected in some way, as the two discs seemed to be rocking or pivoting about a central axis as they rapidly crossed the skies, so that the discs would during this rocking process be alternately one further in front than the other. The angle of the rocking from the perpendicular was possibly between 30 and 45 degrees, and during the transit, the discs probably repeated this backwards and forwards rocking motion twice. They were separated by a distance of perhaps four or five times the diameter of the moon. The lights were white, and I saw no colour in them. They left no trail, and the trajectory was practically overhead, and they crossed the whole of my field of vision, until it was obscured by the houses on my left-hand side: I was lying on the camp bed facing perpendicularly into the skies. It was a clear, cloudless night. There was no accompanying sound. I did not perceive anything in the object other than these lights, and at the time assumed that these were two separate objects that happened to be flying together in a formation, but was puzzled as to why they seemed to be rocking backwards and forwards about a common axis. However, in more recent years I have wondered whether they! were bo th fixed to the base of a larger, dark craft, whose base was undergoing this rocking motion for some reason: although I was not able to distinguish any craft to which the lights were joined, because of its speed, and the state of utter shock and anxiety I was in when I saw the phenomenon, it could just be the case that I did not notice it. I shared this information with my parents, and I wrote a report containing much of the detail above, though I cannot remember after all this time what I did with the report: whether I lodged it anywhere - which I think is unlikely, as the Internet wasn&rsquo;t yet available then, and I wouldn&rsquo;t have known where to send it &ndash; or more likely, whether I filed it somewhere at home and have lost it in the course of the years. At the time of witnessing this event, I was very much a sceptic with regard to the question of UFOs: I knew enough about relativity to believe that other stars were too far away for extraterrestrial visits to be possible, given the velocity limit of the speed of light. I was simply forced to abandon my scepticism by what I saw with my own eyes. As mentioned above, I was also used to astronomical observations, and could easily have identified a very unusual but natural object, such as a fireball, or a satellite re-entering the atmosphere. I have scoured the Internet to find out whether anyone has seen anything at all similar to my rocking twin-disc UFO, but have been unsuccessful. I would be extremely interested to know whether you have ever received a report describing anything similar.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

Within seconds I realized the flashing was either rotating or coming from both ends and that the flashing was not consistent like the strobe on an aircraft.  There was no  lights or a strobe that would associate it with being an airplane and the way it was moving, very erradic, slow then fast, up , down, this was just not the way any aircraft that I am aware of can or would fly. The brightness of these flashing lights would be comparable to what would be seen from arc welding at a distance.  We watched this for about 2 minutes and then it disappeared.  We were facing northwest which would have put whatever it was above the Hanford Nuclear Reservation or very close to it.  The sky was clear and there was considerable amount of moonlight.  If you can imagine what it would look like to see the bright flashing light that has NO consistency from several LARGE scaled arc welders flying through the night sky, that is what we were seeing. This was NOT the strobe light from any aircraft, the way it was moving was unlike anything either one of us has ever seen and to recall this event has me goosebumped from head to toe.

I was trying to keep my eyes on the road, but I was also paying alot of attention to these amazing huge white clouds in the darkened sky. Amazing scenery. At one instance, I looked back up at this big cloud out to the right side of my windshield, and an intense ball of silver white light just appeared. It burst out in front of this cloud. Out of nowhere. It was not a star, and it wasn&apos;t a plane. It was a round intense ball of silvery white light that stayed in the same place for a few seconds, then it slowly took off to the left a short distance and faded out. Like it went into the cloud. A white car was in front of me, and they had to have seen it too. The distance of the object is hard to determine.

I could.  So, to be sure my eyes were not  playing tricks on me, I laid my head against the back of the sofa in a  crack and placed one hand over one eye and used a point of reference  (shingles).

They appeared to me to have small circles slightly less bright orange just inside the outer rim of the larger circle.  They moved very slowly, in a arc across the sky.  At first I thought they may have been meteors, except they moved very slowly.  They stayed the exact same distance apart for the entire experience.

It was clear the lights were part of one solid object although it was too far to make out any details of the craft. I had been living in the Seattle area for all of my 28+ years at the time including living next to the Renton airport for several years. I have seen many types of aircraft from commercial to fighter planes and this looked nothing like anything I had seen before. The sunroof  was open when she let out what I would guess is the usual reaction: &ldquo;what the!&rdquo;. I am one who looks for a logical explanation when confronted with something I can&rsquo;t immediately explain and figured at first glance it was a stealth fighter. I had seen one at about the same distance but I immediately realized that there was no sound. Stealth technology may make these planes almost invisible on radar but when I saw one it was far from silent. Also, there were only the three white lights. No red and blue warning lights that you see on a typical airplane. We both had a very eerie feeling as we couldn&rsquo;t make sense of it. When we got home that night we saw on the news that &ldquo;strange lights&rdquo; were seen in the Seattle area that night and were dismissed as space debris from a falling satellite that crashed into the Pacific Ocean. Ok, a plausible explanation except we were heading north and the object was heading from west to east at that point, and that&rsquo;s a really long way to get to the Pacific.  I can&rsquo;t imagine space debris is capable of changing direction. I have since seen footage of an old Russian satellite that fell out of orbit a few years back and was filmed by a fishing boat crew as it came down and burned up in the atmosphere. It looked nothing like what we saw. Three lights in a triangular pattern that appeared to be one object, flying low and slow with no running noise. I am one who p! refers t o go from A to B instead of A to Alien but what we saw was very similar to video footage I have seen on tv of  triangle shaped objects with three or more lights on the bottom.. The lights were evenly spaced and were moving very slowly, but being one who prefers a rational explanation,I probably would have accepted the news explanation and forgotten about it. The fact they said it landed in the Pacific when what we saw it CLEARLY heading east has always bothered me, that and I am 99.9% sure what I saw was not space debris. I have searched a couple of databases (yours and MUFON) but haven&rsquo;t seen anything else that sounds like what we saw. Enough people saw it that it was mentioned on the news but I cant find any other reports.

She said she had seen a strange, seemingly near stationary strobing light outside our west window of our second story bedroom window-probably about 15 degrees off the horizon.From the bed, I looked out the window but did not see the lights.  My wife got up and opened the blinds covering a south-facing window.  I then saw a very bright light &ndash; bronze in color.  It was flashing regularly and was very crisp and clear at the source.Our home is located in the flight pattern of an international airport and also a local community airport, so aircraft are regularly flying over our home.  I have lived in this area for over 10 years and have seen many planes both during the day and at night.  Nothing about the light I observed resembled an airplane.  I don&rsquo;t know exactly how to describe the light but it was just so different than any light I had seen in the sky before.  The size made it look distant but without knowing the size, determining the distance was impossible.  What was unique about that light was that it was so crisp, and on a hazy night, one would expect an aircraft landing light to be fuzzy at a distance.I watched as the light traveled a little above the treeline defining the horizon heading approximately south.  The light alone was strange, but after watching it for a few seconds, it made a smooth but tight turn upwards and changed direction to the north or northwest.  After the turn, the light increased in speed suddenly, and then flew out of my view.  My wife ran to the other end of the house in time to catch another glimpse of the light before it disappeared completely from sight.It is hard to judge size, distance, and speed without known references, but the object was either very small, close, and slower  or large, distant, and extremely fast.  There was no sound, so a small/close object is not likely.but the light was so crisp that it didn&rsquo;t appear to have been a known object at a distance.  if the object were distant, then the speed as it climbed up was incredible.", "Lights over Eagle LakeSlow moving metallic balloon shaped objects with burning red underside.

At first I thought it was a plane with the landing lights on, but realized the lights were far too bright and that it was traveling the wrong direction.  Also thought it was moving too fast to be a commercial airliner.  I then suspected the space station due to the size (maybe 15 to 20 times bigger than the largest star in it&apos;s traverse).  I looked away for just a second and when I turned back it was gone!

It was in the fall; as best I remember it was 1976 or possibly 1977.  I won&apos;t go into the details of how I arrived at that date - I do not actually remember the exact date. I had gone to my parent&apos;s home to pick up my son - he rode the school bus and stayed at their house until I got off from work.  They needed a few items from the grocery store (about a mile and a half from their house) and I volunteered to go get them.  My son was with me.

I asked the cashier at the store if she saw the UFO&apos;s and she looked at me as if I had two heads (or no brain) and has yet to answer,  I decided at that time not to pursue it any further. I could see no movement inside the closest craft; although it seemed as if I could see in the windows. The next day an article was in the Knoxville News-Sentinel relating a similar sighting in a nearby county by two police officers.  They described the lights as patriotic - red, white and blue.  I did tell my parents of the sighting. My mother scoffed.  My father stated he saw them all the time in the back yard in the evening when he was feeding the animals. A few years ago, I remembered that after I flashed my headlights (which I had to turn on to do so), and continued down the road that I had to turn on my headlights as it was now getting dark.

My signal corps background in the Army required me to maintain the highest level of secret clearances. I recruited for the Army in Colorado.I am a stable person in society. I spotted three brillently lite lights, seperately but within seconds of each other, in the early morning hours of 24 April, 2008. I was sitting out front having my morning coffee prior to leaving for work.Around 0610, I caught a glimpse of a bright light up around the nearly full moon and the star to its western side. This light lasted only a matter of one or two seconds and was traveling at a super rate of speed from south to north direction. It&apos;s altitude seemed to be either out in space or very near the earths upper most atmosphere. The light/flash was so intense that I had to contemplate what it might be.It was definately not a commercial aircraft, it moved across the sky far to fast. I know what Navy and Air Force fighter aircraft look like in flight and these lights moved far faster than any aircraft in the fleet. There was no noise prior to or after the sightings. There were no contrails, and the moon lite sky was for the most part clear. I know what meteorites and space junk look like when they enter our atmosphere and burn up on entry. These did not burn up, they simply appeared out of nowhere and just as quickly disappeared. These objects were brighter than any star that is visiable with the naked eye.They did not appear to be traveling a set path as would a satellite crossing over. I considered the space station crossing over and getting the reflections from the sun rising. No way. It would be a single siting and be over with. I witnessed these three lights on three seperate occations, only seconds apart.The first as mentioned above. The second followed up in the same path as the first, south to north, same exact location between the moon and a star just west of the moon. The third appeared suddenly and traveled east of the moon on a westerly to easterly direction. It too, dissapeared quickly. You could count one thousand one, one thousand two and in this time period it covered a large area of space and sky prior to disappearing.", "Large, white cigar shaped object stops above house.During a late summer afternoon or early evening I saw a large, white, cigar shaped object with an cone shaped front approximately 15 feet long in total fly and stop about 20 feet above the corner of our lakeside house for about 4 seconds then fly away southward very, very fast.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

He told me to look up and see this shooting star. Just a few seconds later he jumps up and says that its coming back in the opposite direction. I immediately jump up and see what is a white glowing, circular object dimming in and out. I couldn&rsquo;t even catch my breath, I was too shocked. It was just one light/object by itself and it seemed to be way up there with the stars. The object was shooting from star to star quicker than anything I&rsquo;ve ever seen in the sky. The light then shot off and disappeared very quickly. It came and left 3 different times. I took a minute to try and replay the images in my head when it suddenly shot back into the sky.

I went to my balcony and saw the four red lights in the sky. they were positioned in a line except that two were clustered together. we watched them for another 7-10 minutes and the top single light began to flicker and then faded out. following that, the two clustered lights also began to flicker and fade out. the final light lasted the longest and did fade out.during this time, i called 911 to tell them about, and the operator said that there have been no calls received around my area, maybe they are military flairs. the closest military base in at least 50 miles from where i live. my neighbor tried taking a picture of it, but nothing came out. my other neighbor has this event on video. what was very noiceable was how high they were in the sky. airplanes were flying below them. i say the lights were at least 1/4 of the total distance higher than the airplanes.

As soon as it stopped I grabbed my friend by the arm and told him to look. It took him a few seconds to see what I was seeing but when he did we were both in awe. It was a star shaped circular object. There was no colour or sound, just a white light. We observed this object for 3-4 minutes before an airplane made it&rsquo;s  way into the area. As soon as the airplane came into view the object took off and that was all we seen of it. I am a believer in ET life forms, but I was still in shock.

It disappeared behind a nerby house. I immeditly reconnised the object as an extraterrestial flyng sourcer as the Italian press called them: At that time the word UFO was NOT in use.

Ursa Major was clearly visible without the aid of the binoculars, but some other constellations were not.At approximately 22:55, three teardrop shaped objects, each appearing about three times the size of Mizar &amp; Alcor through the binoculars flew from West to East through my field of view.  They were in a triangle pattern, very similar to a flock of birds.  I lowered the binoculars to view with my naked eye, but the objects were not visible at that point.  I viewed again through the binoculars, and was able to re-find the objects, still moving along the same trajectory, and with the same velocity, this time just further East of Ursa Major.I went back to observing stars of Ursa Major, and approximately one minute later saw a single teardrop shaped object, exactly like the previous three, traveling in the same West to East trajectory as the ones described previously, only this one seemed to be traveling at about three times the speed of the others.At that point I went in to explain to my wife, and then came back out for another five minutes or so, but saw no more objects of that nature.I live near a private air field, and I am very aware of how a small plane appears in the night sky.  These objects were just solid white, with no blinking whatsoever, and appeared to be traveling much faster than any plane I have ever witnessed, including jets.  There was also no sound associated with the objects.

We looked through a pair of binoculars I has in my car and confirmed it did not have warning lights.

I tried to go back to sleep and then decided to get up to use the bathroom.  Upon return back to my bedroom I was startled to see that the room was filled with bright orange light.  The light was intense as it streamed through the northeasterly facing window.Shadows were cast in the folds of the curtains.  I went to the window and saw a rather large (dime at arms length) orange sphere of bright light directly ahead approximately 200 feet away viewable just over the space between the roofs of two houses on the hill in front of me.  I turned to get my glasses and all of the orange light suddenly disappeared so I immediately turned back to the window.  The light blinked on and off two or three times and then completely ceased to be visible.   I continued to watch for it out of the window but it did not return. Later in the week of 3-24-08, my sister who lives 2 streets away in the same northeasterly direction stopped by for a visit.  One of the first things she said to me was, &quot;What was up with that orange light Monday?&quot;  However she saw a more diffused generalized orange glow over a school ball field immediately in front of her house that spread over a couple of blocks and she saw it in the evening of that day. The orange light of 3-24-08 was the sixth sighting in my lifetime thus far.I reported another to NUFORC that occurred on 1-12-08 and was witnessed by more people than just myself.  I am a contactee and I converse regularly with other experiencers on an almost daily basis.  I am mentioning this because during the period of time just prior to 3-24-08, many of my abbductee acquaintances reported paranormal experiences and there was a general consensus that &quot;something is going on.&quot;   For example, one friend saw an entity at his bedside; another had a sighting, and another suffered nosebleeds after a &quot;dream&quot; visit with a &quot;man&quot; that she has not seen for many years but has come to think of as sort of a guardian angel.

Immediately I came to the conclusion that the light wasn&rsquo;t a shooting star but rather something else.  The light grew brighter for about 3 to 4 seconds, resembling a car light coming closer.  The light was not very large; it started about the size of a star and grew brighter.  I asked my date what she thought the growing light could be, she was uncertain but was quick to believe it must be an airplane.  I too thought it might be an airplane because that would be the most logical explanation.  Once the light stopped growing brighter it was motionless for a split second and then began to move from right to left in the sky.  It started on a straight course, which made me think it really was a plane or satellite but then the light began to shuffle up and down.  Moving unlike anything I have seen before.  Immediately when it began moving up and down I told my date it was a UFO.  I asked her, isn&rsquo;t that a UFO? She was very scarred and reluctant to admit something like that, but once she saw the light move in the way it did she too said it must be unidentified flying object.

I know what I saw wasn&apos;t a plane because the next day I stood in the exact same spot and saw an airplane moving in approximately the same direction and it wasn&apos;t anywhere near as fast.

I began to obseve as I walked and passes a tree that blocked the view of the cream colored one then that one was gone but I felt it was still there, as I looked the other silver one just sat there then it tilted its point downward and took off in a intense speed.  then shortly after that planes started coming from all over.

With my head hanging out of my window now I gazed at the object for over a couple of minutes as I proceeded slowly down the road.The object was triangular and resembled a Stealth Fighter. My employee riding in the front seat saw the same thing I did. The employee in the back seat had limited view of the object. The object was traveling adjacent to my truck at a crawl speed and then to a hover. It appeared dark-toned and had lights at each tip of its triangular shape. I was near 1604 East Main when I turned in the parking lot of the bank to further look at the object.When I entered the parking area the object ascended slowly to a higher altitude and slowly gained speed moving in the opposite direction I saw it first traveling in.

When I went to upload them into my computer, I noticed that the first picture had these strange cigar shaped objects around the plane. I immediatley checked the other pics, They were clear and there were no objects on any of the photos. I checked my camera and even checked to see if there was debris on the lens, there was none.

Initially, they appeared to be at 1,000 feet. They were moving about 200 mph, with one object trailing the other. Then the two bright objects began taking their own path, seeming to moving in a wave like motion, I yelled to my partner to look at them, then they moved into the light fog, which made them more noticeable due to the shimmer of round bright light reflecting in the fog. Then, they began to pick up speed, each taking two different paths, the front object rose in altitude rapidly and shot out toward Golden Gate Bridge and disappeared. The second object remained visible for about 3 additional seconds as it appeared to fly away at a lower altitude in more west then the prior. The weird thing was that the round pulsing light object seemed to get brighter in size as it speed off and dissipated into the fog. These were no traditional aircraft. Secondly, they were not spot lights from the surface to the sky, they were fast moving, silent and erratic flying craft. They did not make normal flight patterns or aerial movements.", "Red blinking light, then a dash across the sky.On Monday morning, approximately 12:30 AM, I was sitting on my deck outside. The night was warm and clear. I was stargazing as I like to do. There was a red flashing light in a clearing above the mountains. We frequently see high, transatlantic air traffic. And being an Air Force brat I always enjoy the &quot;light speed is faster than sound speed&quot; phenomena. So when I see a high aircraft I like to watch it before I hear the sound. Although, this was different. I could hear something. It was familiar. And as I was looking up to see if I had missed an aircraft passing over (because of the sound I was hearing), I saw the red light. I looked like it was heading in the direction (although very high) of where I was observing it. But each time it blinked it seemed to be getting much closer very quickly. Faster than even some of the military jets we see up here that do exercises. Then, after about 3 or 4 blinks it veered 90 degrees to the east and went so fast that it literally appeared to be just a streak in the sky. It was nearly like a shooting star. I&apos;ve seen plenty of shooting stars and satellites. I sat still for about 10 minutes trying to digest what I had just seen. Came in, drew a picture. And after talking to some people at work yesterday who have seen similar things, I found this web site. So, I suppose this is a report. I&apos;m still in awe of what I saw. I was afraid to outside last night though for a second look. :-)", "A fast traveling object that covered great (irregular) distances while blinking multiple colors extremely fast.My girlfriend and I were driving home from a SubWay restaurant when I saw what appeared to be a malfunctioning airplane. It&rsquo;s hard to stress in words how distinctly different from an airplane this was, and when I saw it my mouth dropped and I immediately pulled over to the side of the road. I live at the base of a mountain (the outskirts of the city) and was heading north-east when I saw it. After I pulled over to the side of the road and I pointed out what I saw to my girlfriend and she became as awed as I was.Now that I had stopped moving I was able to properly asses what I was looking at. It was a ball of light about four times as big as a star but smaller than an airplane light that was blinking/flashing multiple colors (I&rsquo;m talking almost every color imaginable) about 10 times per every 1 time that an airplanes light blinks. Basically, if an airplane blinks 2 times a second, this object was blinking about 20-30 times a second in alternating colors like red, blue, green, purple&hellip;etc in a hard to catch order (if any). However, that wasn&rsquo;t the half of it&hellip; Its one thing to see colorful flashing (strobe-light like) light, but it&rsquo;s another to see this object&rsquo;s crazy movement in the sky. It came from the north-east heading north-west in an irregular, non-linear path that consisted of circles and zigzags with behaviors similar to that of a firefly. It was moving nothing like an airplane/satellite/whatever, and occasionally consisted of dives that dropped the object hundreds of feet in order to regain its altitude only seconds later. At this point I was freaked out enough and decided to call the police for help&hellip; I called 911, who forwarded me to the Local Police department where they took my information and told me to keep my eye on the object. I continued to watch the object in its irregular path towards the west when it suddenly seemed to stop in one location for about 10 minutes! It seemed to stay in the same vicinity but make loops, dives and etc, all covering great distances in very short periods of time. Wanting to contact a UFO hotline, I got into my car and drove the remainder of the distance home.When I got home I did a quick search to get to www.nuforc.org and call the hotline support. I talked to someone for a good 5-10 mins about the object I could now barely see in the distance. He told me to call up friends closer to the object (that was now far west) to see if they could spot the object as well. As he was telling me this I noticed a helicopter flying over my neighborhood (with a spotlight) at the intersection I had told the police that I had witnessed the object (I don&rsquo;t know if that was a coincidence or what).I later drove back to the original place I had seem the object, where I called my friends on the other side of town. They all couldn&rsquo;t see the object because they lived more into the city and had a harder time seeing stars (because of the many lights) let alone a weird blinking thing. I eventually drove home and filled out this report as the man on the hotline had told me to do.", "I saw some lights in the back yard and grabbed my camera to take pictures. The pictures just looked black after I took them so I never really looked at them closer. I was clearing my camera tonight, and I started zooming into the black pictures and when I did, I found out that I actually did catch the lights I saw. I am sending 4 pictures that just look black, but if you zoom in you can see on strange reddish, white lights....

We were driving in a small sports car on River Rd. near Red Bridge. I saw what I thought was the reflection of my shifter light on the windshield. I realized I was seeing something reflecting on the windshield from the outside. I pulled over, stopped my car and opened the window. Just above the tops of the telephone poles was an enormous diamond shaped craft. It was so close I could see that the surface looked like the dull side of aluminium foil. The underside had two bullet shaped ducts side by side with heat emitting from them. Maybe propulsion? No sound what so ever came from this craft. Around the perimeter was a redish/pink fuzzy difused light. The craft was traveling very slow. I wondered how it was staying in the air.

This more than memorable evening developed after he and the band were finished playing for a birthday party one summer night in Freeport, Illinois, twenty some miles from our homes in Rockford.  Two dad&apos;s drove up later that night to pick up the boys and their equipment to bring them back home.  Our son and two other band members were going to ride home in my car.Incidentally, the other driver headed back home ahead of us as we had several musical instruments, amplifiers and speakers to load into my vehicle.  Shortly after leaving the area, we were back on the main highway, with mostly farmland between Rockford and Freeport.  There was very little traffic at that time and after driving for almost 15-20 minutes, I noticed in the rear view mirror, an extremely bright light coming up behind us on the highway.  I mentioned that to the boys and then stated that it was probably a motorcycle and I wished he would turn off his bright light and flip the dimmer switch. The blinding light continued to remain behind the car for several additional minutes and I couldn&apos;t believe the incredible brightness coming from this one single light.  Within a few moments, the light disappeared and I assumed the &quot;rider&quot; had turned off or stopped.However, in the next couple of minutes, the quietness within the car was broken when one of the boys sitting in the back seat literally shouted &quot;Look outside, next to the road!&quot;  The brilliant round light was now moving parallel to the car, alongside the road on the passenger side, actually following the contour and swales on the ground.  I couldn&apos;t judge how close it was to the car, but I imagined about 20-30 yards from the highway.  It was an amazing sight and our &quot;parallel&quot; visitor continued on for at least three or four minutes, staying alongside our car at a speed of about 60 miles per hour.   The next thing to happen was even more unbelievable as the brilliant round object slowly tipped sideways and then accelerated at an incredible speed into the darkness and disappeared.  The boys were really shaken up by this wild incident and I thought I should stop at the Illinois State Police Headquarters a few miles down the road, but they wanted to get straight home.

Approximately 7:30 PM -- While playing in the backyard with my children, my daughter called my attention to what she called the first star tonight -- she was excited because at this time of year it is still very light, with the sun well above the horizon -- essentially still daytime. I initially took it to be a star, located about 2 degrees NE of a crescent-shaped moon. The size seemed about right for a star, but I quickly realized that it was WAY too bright to be a star, as it was still daylight and no other stars were even faintly visible.I grabbed my binoculars to get a closer look. It appeared to be a circular object in the high atmosphere, with a dark spot in the center -- exactly what one might expect from a weather balloon with something suspended below it, such as a basket with equipment. And the brightness of the object seemed consistent with a balloon reflecting the sun.What was strange was that the object maintained it&apos;s position relative to the moon for about five minutes, which is not the behavior one would expect of a high-altitude weather balloon that is subject to strong air currents.After a few minutes of observation, the object simply disappeared in a blink. For a good minute I thought it was gone, but with more scoping with binoculars I saw five smaller points of light in the same vicinity. These were too small to be seen with the naked eye, and they were barely visible with binoculars.The mind tries to make sense of things. I speculated that a weather balloon could have exploded into smaller pieces. This time, unlike the initial round &quot;star&quot; object, these smaller points were crescent-shaped, and they drifted SW until they moved past the moon, growing more faint as they traveled.It occurred to me that a spherical object in the sky would reflect sunlight in the same way the moon did and assume a crescent shape. This suggests the smaller objects were spherical. This does not explain, however, why the initial &quot;star&quot; appeared perfectly round. Forgive me for a flight of fancy, but a flat, round shaped object -- such as a pie tin -- situated at just the right angle would reflect light across it&apos;s entire surface and appear round to an observer.I can&apos;t come up with an obvious explanation for what I observed. What I saw was certainly not an airplane. Very unlikely it was an exploding weather balloon (how could the intact balloon remain stationary while it&apos;s exploded parts drifted in the wind?). Puzzling indeed.One final observation. Seems like an odd coincidence. While observing the crescents in binoculars, a Southwest airline flying at what appeared to be a MUCH lower altitude passed right in between two of the crescent shapes. What are the odds that a commercial airline passes through the tiny window of observation -- relative to the rest of the sky -- visible through one&apos;s binoculars at just the right moment under any circumstances? Quite a coincidence.The entire sequence took roughly 10 minutes. Crescents faded from view within 10 seconds of the airline passing through my field of vision. Again, Helluva coincidence. Nevertheless, I really don&apos;t think the airline was related to the objects. Airline was low altitude (either landing or taking off from local airport), and the objects were really high.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous;  provides only e-address.

That light was way in the sky but it was across the  lake SE from me and then, and I couldn&apos;t see it very well, but I  definitely saw a low, closer hovering light fairly dim in the trees more to the  left next to the property and then what I thought might be people out  on the property with flashlights - there were lights as if from a  flashlight or helicopter surveying the ground and I couldn&apos;t tell what I saw  it wasn&apos;t very clear but it was a streak of some low to the ground  animal back and forth.  I thought maybe it was a dog at first, but it was  way too fast - maybe a mountain lion?  It caught my attention, but I  wasn&apos;t startled until the light in the trees dimmed and then flew across  several properties and was changing  color to red like a laser pointer  or something.  But then it would light up again in dim white and it  just floated around from place to place.  I got kind of nervous when a red  light got in front of my house, I woke my husband who was on the sofa  and he also saw the red light.  It didn&apos;t move, it just stayed still  from what I saw, but he&apos;d talked me into watching TV instead of freaking  myself out and later he said he&apos;d seen it move.  We went to bed after  him dismissing me and telling me it&apos;s some kid w/ a laser pointer.  I  read for a bit to calm my mind and when I turned the light off to go to  sleep - through the blinds in a room completely on the other side of the  house facing West there was a very, very bright light that was  hovering in the wooded area outside our house.  I woke my husband up again and  he agreed he could see it and although he&apos;ll never admit it could be  anything other than something explainable I could tell he got a little  spooked.  He kept whispering loud - &quot;ok, so what do you want me to do? I  see it, I see it&quot;.  The light would change from VERY bright white to  dimmer so you could barely see it and then brighten up again and as it  would brighten a bunch of tiny little colored lights would blink so fast - red blue green.   I saw this light at around 12:45 and it lasted a little over an hour.  It moved very slowly all around and lowered into  the trees and I heard noises like low whistles best way I can describe  it was a soft high pitched noise between flute and a whistle.  I had  trouble sleeping but nothing else happened after the thing left.  I didn&apos;t  move to another window - when it was out of my eyeshot, I just let it  go.  It was so bright the lights from it were coming in our window and  it was like a headlights that were moving around the room depending on  where this thing was positioned and how dim or bright it got. - This is a copy of my report to MUFON on 6/13/08.((NUFORC Note:  Twinkling star??

I kept looking the sound went away and I saw a cigar shaped aircraft with NO WINGS fly from  Northeast direction toward the Southeast.  The craft was very high but I could clearly see separation between the front half and a dark band and it looked as if the back half was separate but attached sort of like two short cigar shapes made of what I would think of a dull aluminum.  There was a large dark band at the rear of the first part.  It was really high and I could see it clearly.  No wings and it was going what I would think of as slow and I kept the object in my view  thinking I could get my cell phone and have enough time to get a picture.  I looked down and looked up it was gone it should have been in my view at least 30 seconds more the way it was moving.  If it was a plane it wouldn&apos;t have been gone that fast.  It just didn&apos;t seem to move across the sky that fast it was a clear sky.  I put my head down and looked back up in a spit second and it was gone.  The change in speed was not something a regular plane could have accomplished.   Which brings me back to it had no wings! This is the second time I have seen something in the sky from my back yard.  I saw a sphere a few years ago around this time of year.  Crazy isn&apos;t it.I am just a regular person that believes in God and as God is my witness I saw what doesn&apos;t seem to be anything I have ever seen on TV before.

The sun was setting but the sky was still blue.  Coming into to Didcott Station (1st stop from Swindon to London) my attention was drawn to a bright light in the sky.  Initially, I believed it to be the sun reflecting off a plane but noticed that the object had a very short tail (diagonally down to the right-hand side).  The tail was not long enough to be a shooting star or a high flying jet plane and the object appeared to be motionless and not streaming across the sky.  I lost track of the object soon after spotting it under cloud cover over some large chimney stacks.  I tried to take a photo of the object using my phone (5mp - pretty good) but after clicking the button repeatedly the camera would not come on.  As soon as the cloud cover came over, one click and the camera switch on.  This spooked me a little bit!

At around 10pm, one of our friends noticed a bright light moving rapidly from southeast to northwest.  There was no sound at all.  The light was not blinking and there was only one light.  It was about 3 &ndash; 4mm at arms length with a slight yellowish ness to it.  I thought it looked a little oval in shape.  It was much too big to be a satellite (I don&rsquo;t think they have lights anyway - ?).  Its path was straight as an arrow and its speed was constant.  My 16 year old son thought he could see it wavering very slightly.  If it was an airplane or a helicopter there would be definite sound and blinking lights.  As it reached the horizon there were some clouds silhouetted in the sky, I could see the light go through or above them, it was hard to tell.  Either way, there were clouds between us and the light.  So I estimated its altitude as being quite high.At about 10:20pm, one of our party noticed a bright flash to the south, about the size of three or four average size stars combined.  No one else saw it at that time.  We don&rsquo;t know if the lights had anything to do with each other or not.At around 10:30pm, we saw another light exactly like the first.  Size, brightness, speed, direction, apparent altitude, everything was just like the first, except this one was a little more to the South.  This light also disappeared over the horizon to the Northwest.Some time after, about 11:15 or so, we were all glancing up at the stars.  I then saw a flash as well, which was about the size of three or four stars combined.  It looked almost like a camera flash.  It came from the same Southerly direction as the first flash at about 30 degrees in the sky.

My friend and I were driving up foothill from los osos valley road, to go get frozen yogurt late at night. We were on our way back down foothill after getting the yogurt and I looked up at Bishop&apos;s Peak mountain.  It was approximately ten p.m. and a quarter the way up from the top was a round formation of bluish white lights.  Some of these lights were very dim and some got brighter and dimmer and dissapeared.  It looked as though they were all connected somehow, and I freaked out and told my friend to pull over somewhere. We got into a parking lot and parked under a tree, and then both got out of the car.  We walked up to a fence and stood there looking very carefully at these lights and we noticed the lights had moved to the top of the mountain.  I believe it was aware we had our eyes on it, and my legs started shaking uncontrollably, and my eyes watered.  My friend and I were gripping eachothers arm asking if what we were seeing was a ufo.  I waved at the lights, and two lights got very bright, within the string of lights.  My friend didn&apos;t want to stay very long, and he was having a hard time believing what he was seeing. I threw down my yogurt and we ran into his car, and drove back to our friends house.  I noticed my cell phone died, even though it was fully charged.  So I called my best friend, who has seen a ufo in los osos with me before, and I picked her up from her house, about 5 minutes away and drove back to the mountain, and parked in the same place my other friend and I were.  The object was not on the top any more, but it was more to the right of the mountain, again, a quarter the way down from the top.  This mountain has lots of big boulders on the top, so I dont know if it was hovering or if it was landed somehow, the darkness made it only possible for us to see anywhere between 3-10 or so lights. As I said, the lights continually changed their brightness, and this object moved VERY very different to anything I&apos;ve seen.  It seemed like it was a row! of lights at some times, and other times it was round. When it moved it spread the lights out and then they got closer together as it slowed.  Almost snake-like.

I asked a female guard if inmates here at Solano County were taken to outer spaces and they replied, &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.

I immediately noticed a large planet-sized object directly behind the flight line, appearing to the West.  I live on an air force base, right in front of the runway on the 8th floor.  My apartment has large windows in each room that face the runway and the mountains beyond it.   I viewed the object for about 20 minutes.  By 1:25 a.m., it had faded out of sight.  I used a Runton Trail Buster compass to determine its Western location. The object resembled the moon, but it was about two and one-half times larger than the moon.  It had the luminescence of the moon and did not move about quickly or erratically.  It hovered  behind the flight line, changing from a dull beige glow to a reddish glow, almost like the glow you would see during an eclipse, when the moon passes in front of another planet. There were large markings on the face of this large planet-size object.  Although I could make these markings out through binoculars, the definition of the picture was unclear when I zoomed in with my Panasonic DMZ LZ3 camera.  However, I took several pictures of it &ndash; several still photos and one moving picture, using the flight line lights and a red tower light as a frame of reference. I steadied my arm on the window sill to keep the object from moving; however, it was difficult to keep my arm completely still. I had to break away from my line of vision with the object to write out a diagram of the large markings I saw on the face of this planet.  I could only see these markings through the binoculars.  DESCRIPTION OF THE FACE OF THE PLANET:  The markings looked like the outline of a scroll-like antennae on either side of a head with an arched body.  Two lines projected out from both sides of the body, ending in two circles (like hands).  At the bottom of this body, a small projecting line ended in another very large circle (like feet).  When I kept going back to view the object with my binoculars, I noticed the picture on its face had now tilted, and the patina of the object took on a reddish glow. The tilt:   The scroll-like head changed from a 12:00 position to a 9:00 position while the large circled (feet) changed from 6:00 position to 4:00 position. When I went back to my paper to continue filling out the drawing, and then returned to the window, the object was no longer there.  I did not actually see it vanish or blink out.  I only noticed that the last time I went back to view it with the binoculars, the patina had appeared to change color, its face had shifted position to a tilt, and it wasn&rsquo;t glowing as brightly. Regarding the actual shape of the object, it was almost like looking at three-fourths of the moon.  It wasn&rsquo;t a complete circle.  It was as if the northwest portion of the circle had been blotted out by the darkness.  The edges delineating the object were fuzzy looking, where it melded into the surrounding darkness. I have seen this object twice before.  The first time I saw it, it was at 11:00 p.m., in a more northwesterly direction.  It was more prominent then.  It also glowed a little brighter and appeared to be a little larger than it was tonight.  Then it appeared to be three times the size of the moon instead of two and a half times the size of the moon and much lower in the sky.  I viewed it for about 15 minutes.  At that time, it had actually sunk down behind the mountain range, northwest of the base.  However, I thought it might be some kind of lunar eclipse until I noticed the moon&rsquo;s position the following night and how different it looked from what I had seen. The second time I saw the planet-size object, it was at 4:30 a.m.  It was located in the same location, northwest, directly over the mountain range.   It slowly sank behind the same mountain range it had sunk behind before, during the previous 11:00 to 11:30 p.m. sighting.  This time I woke my husband up (who completely denies the existence of UFO&rsquo;s).  He thought it was the moon, but the moon appears higher up in the sky in a more southerly direction and glows differently than this object glowed. Due to the consistency of the location of these sightings, I believe there may be some sort of alien base within the mountain range to the northwest of the flight line.", "cross shaped object with blue and white lights hovering at very low altitude vanishes quicklyThe event occurred on a calm June night around 11:00PM, 2008 while I was driving home from a baseball game. My brother, who was a passenger in the car, was telling me a story as we turned off into my housing development. I reached a smooth bend in the road and happened to look up and saw lights behind the trees.Knowing that there is an airport nearby, I thought to myself &lsquo;that plane is flying really low&rsquo;. Continuing through the turn I kept my eyes on the lights slightly hidden behind the trees for about 6 seconds.Reaching the end of the turn I could see the lights a little bit clearer as there were fewer trees and noticed that the object appeared to be hovering but was clearly some kind of organized pattern of lights. I focused on them for about another 4-6 seconds trying to determine what it was because sometimes planes appear to be still even thought they are moving. I thought this was strange because it was really low and somewhat resembled a large TV antenna with lights on it. However, I take this route every day and have never noticed this before.We finally reached the point where there are no trees and the object was in clear sight. Knowing that I have never seen anything like this before I abruptly shouted to my brother, &lsquo;what the heck is that&rsquo;? He looked up and was apparently as confused as I was. I got about 4-5 seconds of clear visual while my brother states he only got a glimpse but he too got a clear enough sight to confirm what I was seeing. We were both intrigued by how low and stagnant the object appeared to be.About 20 yards down the road was a side street with a cul-de-sac where I quickly went to get a better view. This only took 10 seconds or so to get turned around to get a better a look. However, by the time we pulled down the street the object was completely gone. We could not believe this. Judging by where the object was there is no way it could have completely disappeared. Even if it was a plane we should have had clear visual of it at the cul-de-sac.The object itself was clearly a cross shape. I saw a long series of lights, maybe 5-6, down the middle with two at the tips of the cross ends. They looked to be blue and white with a clearly larger blue light at the intersection. My brother only stated how strange it was that there were so many lights.As for me, the entire sighting was only for about 15 seconds with an unfortunate 4-5 seconds of clear visual. I am still trying to think of what it could be like a toy plane, an antenna, a plane, fireworks.  None of these seem to make sense.  I did have my window down and did not hear any noises like a gas powered engine or boom. Anyhow, it is really exciting because I have no clue what we saw.I myself am an architect. I have two professional degrees, a master&rsquo;s degree and work at an architecture firm. I have always had a fascination with the paranormal and U.F.O.s and, honestly, have always wanted to see one. Much of my education focused around forensic architecture and engineering so I find the whole debunking side of paranormal investigations interesting.My brother is a teacher at a Catholic school.  He has three degrees and master&rsquo;s in philosophy.", "An object flying by one minute then kust disapeared in a clear sky.On this date (6-2-08) while fishing in Charlotte Harbor in Florida we observed an object in the sky.I was fishing with two other men, no drinking of alcohol.I am a retired Police Detective, and served 4 years in the Air force, one of the other men a retired business man and the third currently employed by a large conglomerate.One man noticed the object and then I noticed it and said, &quot;That plain looks strange; it looks like its flying backwards.&quot;Then we all three seemed to notice that it seemed strange so I reached for my binoculars and looked up again and it was completely gone.The sky was clear, blue and there were no clouds although a squall had just passed about five minutes earlier.", "i was outside and i waslooking at the sky when i see the lights in shaped of a triangle and it hovered slowly from south to the north.i really do not belive in aliens and UFOs but this case was really wierd. i was outside and i waslooking at the sky when i see the lights in shaped of a triangle and it hovered slowly from south to the northernwest.", "disk-shaped aircraft with colorful lights seen over Disney&apos;s Hollywood Studios and Epot .A lighted disk-shaped object was seen over Walt Disney World.

Ventura, CAFirst witness statement This began at approximately 9:40 p.m.I was sitting with my husband in our hot tub and happened to glance to the sky.  I did not look directly up, but just raised my eyes slightly and looked toward the Northeast.  I noticed a chevron-shape flying across the sky.  I thought it was birds because of the formation, and because it looked like there were independent objects creating the formation.  But it was dark outside&hellip;and unless they were iridescent birds that happened to be getting a reflection from the moon, I don&rsquo;t know how they would be lit up.  I said to my husband, &ldquo;What is that?  Birds, or a UFO?&rdquo;  I said it very casually, because I really didn&rsquo;t know WHAT I was seeing.  He said, &ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s a B2 bomber running a test,&rdquo; (as we have military bases around and sometimes do see this type of thing.  But we didn&rsquo;t really see lights, just simply illumination.  Then, he said that it was moving much too quickly to be an aircraft.  A few seconds later, while we were still wondering what we saw, there was another one.  This was appeared to fly in the same flight path of the first, but its shape was slightly different.  It was more of a flattened chevron, while the first was a very triangular shape.  These both flew in the direction from the West to the East. Within what seemed like a minute, but I don&rsquo;t know for sure as there is not a lighted clock outside, a helicopter flew by.  The helicopter also looked like it was flying in the same flight path, although it may have been lower.  It was definitely slower and noisy, whereas the first two objects were silent.  About eight minutes later, we saw another one.  This one looked farther away to me, and it flew from the Northeast toward the Southwest.  This one seemed more like the first in its shape.  We saw this one for what seemed like a longer time &ndash; maybe a total of 15-20 seconds.  Approximately five minutes after that, we saw another one.  This one also flew from the West to the East and we were able to see it for about 12-15 seconds. While we were staring at the sky trying to figure out what we saw, or see more, or who knows what, we saw several regular aircraft.  They all moved a lot slower than what we saw.  We also saw some satellites that appeared to be moving fairly quickly.  However, because of their blinking, it is hard to determine how fast they were moving compared to blinking.  Second witness statement: On the night of May 24, 2008 at approximately 9:40 pm, my wife and I were relaxing in our hot tub, looking up at the sky in Ventura, CA.  Suddenly, my wife said, &quot;What is that?&quot; and I looked up and saw a chevron shaped &apos;thing&apos; flying through the sky. We live near the coast in Southern California, so the &apos;thing&apos; was coming from the ocean, moving west to east. It was moving very quickly, faster than conventional aircraft that we see regularly in our area. The &apos;thing&apos; was in the shape of a &apos;V&apos;, or a chevron and was made up of single lights or dots, probably 8 in total.  About a minute after seeing the object, another identical object moved across the sky in the same direction, following the direction of the first object.  It looked identical and was moving along the same direction. We heard no sound and saw no conventional contrails from aircraft which appear to be at a similar altitude. Approximately 5 minutes later, we both saw another identical object moving across the sky from the North to the South.  It appeared to be the same shape and moving the same speed as the previous &apos;things.&apos;    We sat and pondered what the objects were for approximately 10 minutes when another &apos;thing&apos; flew through the sky along the same path and at the same rate as the first and second &apos;things.  We continued to look into the sky for an additional 15 minutes or so and did not see anything else that resembled the first sighting.  The objects appeared to be moving at a higher rate of speed than conventional aircraft, and were completely silent in their movement.", "Burning Embers Sighted in Sky Near TucsonI was sitting on my front porch facing South on Monday June 9, around 8:00PM, gazing out to the West at the remnants of the sunset against the Tucson mountains. An orange light in the sky appeared against the red-orange-green of the fading daylight. The light was relatively stationary over the West part of the city (about 20 miles away from me) at about 3,000 ft in the air. And so I assumed that it was an airliner on it&apos;s landing approach to Tucson International. A few things about the light, however, caught my interest. It appeared to be too orange to be an aircraft landing light and it seemed to be positioned too far to the North of TIA&apos;s runways 11L/11R to be on the final approach leg to one of those runways (the lines of descending lights on Tucson&apos;s Western horizon at night are airliners landing on these runways).After about 2 minutes a smaller orange light broke away from the original light and after a few seconds the two lights casually faded out . The manner in which this happened made me think of a small plane on fire and a part breaking away from it before falling out of the sky, yet I heard no explosions or saw no burning embers fall to earth. Still, the novelty of this event inspired me to wait around a while to see if I could hear any police sirens or breaking news reports about a small plane crash over Tucson. As I was doing this I kept my eyes on the Western sky to see if anything else appeared.After about 15-20 minutes I became bored and went into the house to get something. About 5 minutes later I returned to the porch and resumed my scanning of the Western sky. The sky was now a bluish-green horizon turning to the blackness of night as I spied another similar orange light to the South of the original one, this one farther away and appearing to be at a much higher altitude . This light only appeared for half a second before falling fast like a tear drop and disappearing. I stayed outside for about 30 minutes after that and did not see any other similar events. When I finally went inside, it was night.I wonder if anyone else in the city saw this?  A few things to think about: Davis-Monthan Air Force Base is situated in between my house and the airport. I am a former pilot and have never seen this type of thing before. It could have been a flare drop at the Barry-Goldwater range in the desert to the West of the city, yet it seemed too close for this; it appeared to be in front of the Tucson mountains from my frame of reference. It could have been space phenomena, i.e. meteorite activity, yet all of the meteroite entries into the atmosphere I have seen have been very fast an angular.", "slow flying huge object near airforce base.this was a pretty huge craft. bigger than a 747. nothing like i have ever seen before. had a bright white like on the front of a triangle shape and was zig zagging in the air very slowly. when the front light wasnt visible the bottom of the object had 3 glowing red circles on each side of the triangle. this wasnt any type of plane. object made no noise.", "bouncing ufoMe and my girlfriend were just driving down the street, when this circular object shot down and bouced off the ground maybe 1&apos;&apos; in front of the car. it appeared to be white but considering the rate of speed it could have been silver. this is a residential area and there were a few people outside, but nobody else saw this except for me and my girlfriend.

Grand Junction, Colorado has a busy airport with lots of jet traffic so seeing aircraft is a very common occurrence. As we walked the short distance to my house I spotted a very unusual craft flying and pointed it out to Debbi. This craft appeared to be approximately 140 ft. long, approximately 50 feet wide and nearly 40 feet thick. The craft had no lights, markings and no control surfaces. It was silver on the top and sides and appeared to be flying at approximately 150 m.p.h. as it approached our location. The craft approached our general location and gradually slowed to a hover. We had to look up to see the object at about 65 degrees above our heads.As best I can estimate, the object was perhaps a quarter of a mile (south) from our location and stopped flying and began to hover about half a mile (east) from our location at perhaps 8,000 foot level. Grand Junction is approximately 4600 above sea level and is surrounded by mountains that reach the 10,000 foot level 12 miles to the east. Craft was flying from west to east in direction. The craft made no noise at any time during flight or hover. The weather was clear and had scattered puffy cumulus clouds from 8-11 thousand foot level. Air traffic was light on that day. Craft was between the airport and the usual traffic pattern for the airport. No planes approached the craft or airport during observation.Total observation time was perhaps 20 minutes. At first we watched the craft fly toward our location then after passing our location it slowed to a stop and began to hover. After a couple minutes I went inside and obtained a pair of binoculars to see the craft better. It was easy to see with the naked eye but since I could not see markings, lights or control surfaces I was sure binocular would show some kind of control surfaces. After I brought the binoculars back outside I used them to see the craft with lots of detail. The binoculars were easily able to see lots of detail and confirmed that the craft was slowly rocking side to side; the craft had no control surfaces on the back or sides, no visible vent holes or windows or light fixtures. No markings of any kind. The texture of the crafts skin appeared to be similar to silver metal but no rivets or visible joints. It had a distinct division from top to bottom and the underside was shadowed from sunlight with a line half way between top and bottom with sharp edge in the middle of the craft running from front to back. The back was wider than the front but was very similar to the front of the craft.I have about 200 hours as a student pilot but have not been active in aviation for nearly 10 years but love aircraft; this was no aircraft I have ever seen before. I am retired from California state service as a psychiatric technician and currently work part time for the state of Colorado in the same capacity.My assumption is and was that this must have been some kind of experimental unmanned craft; perhaps a small electric powered gas filled craft. I was unable to understand how the craft flew with no noise and the only way it could hover without noise was if it was filled with gas. It was not a conventional design because the power source for flight had to be inside the craft but there were no signs of vents or rudders or elevators. A rotating jet of some kind inside the craft with vents that close up seemed the only possibility to me based on my limited knowledge of lighter than air craft.I have no memory of seeing the aircraft power it self after reaching our location and after some twenty minutes the clouds obscured our view of the aircraft. A general description of the craft would be a streamlined, smooth surface elongated clam shape. Stopping a craft near the approach pattern of an airport, behind a cloud seemed very foolish to me at the time. No reports heard of that or other sightings. Reluctant to mention the sighting because have no reason to believe that it was other than a man made experiment craft, but just not sure what it could have been.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

Traffic started to slow &amp; it became dark, as I looked out my window I realized that the sky had gotten very dark very fast, and people were stopping their cars, pulling off to the side of the road.  I looked up and was surprised at the sight I saw.  Hovering above us was a huge, very dark  almost black, object,chevron shaped, very large and covering not only the road but buildings on both sides of the road.  The sky was completely blocked out it was that large an object and although I am not sure exactly how high up it was, nothing could be seen around it.  Dark gray/black underneath...silent, not a sound did I hear from it and moving extremely slowly.  There were some lights underneath, but I did not count them or take note of any color.  To me they were just bright, but small lights. People were pointing up, and some were out of their cars or nearly stopped in the roadway.  This object continued moving forward slowly along Route 9 East, heading towards the Route 9G intersection, East.  It sped up a bit, but never any sound could be heard and it disappeared heading towards the town of Red Hook.

We were playing basketball in the driveway of their house for about an hour, and people began to leave. We were about to go inside when I noticed an object moving through the sky. It looked like a large satellite, and it was moving at a constant speed. Being a pretty big ufo enthusiast myself, I pointed it out and we all started watching it. It soon started to make wobbles and turns that no satellite or aircraft could have made (it was way too high up to be a plane). I was wondering if it was my eyes playing tricks on me when it completely stopped in the middle of the sky. It hovered in one spot for about 40 seconds, and in that time it grew extremely bright. At that point we all knew it was no satellite we were looking at. The object started moving again and flew into the distance. There were 5 of us watching it by now, and we called another person who lived down the block to come outside and see what was going on. We soon saw another object in the sky, and very faint, smaller dots appeared around it. The dots shot off in different directions, some moving extremely fast and some slower. One big dot stayed stationary. As we watched these dots (especially the big one) they began to change colors and it almost looked like they would split into 2 dots and then reassemble. One of the people I was with saw a red object leave the biggest dot and shoot towards the ground. All of us saw very faint shooting star-like objects flying by the area of the biggest dot. A HUGE orange object soon flew through a small area of the sky in a very shooting star-like motion, and we all saw it. At this point there were six of us and we decided to get in the car and drive about a half mile away to a place where there was less light and more open space to watch. We relocated to a parking lot with a field next to it, and we watched the objects that were still in the air. We saw some movement but not as much as before. We noticed that in the far corners of the sky there were flashing dots. Pretty much every direction you turned you were able to see something in the sky. Then, the big one. My friend went around to the other side of the building we were parked by to pee. He saw something in the sky and called all of us over. It was an object hovering in the air with extremely unusual lights. This one was much, much closer than any of the other things we had seen, and was actually only about a hundred feet from the ground from what it looked like. We ran over and watched it as it started moving one way, completely changed directions, and then completely turned around again. It flashed extremely brightly at least 3 times and then began to display very different patterns of lights. It almost could have been mistaken for a plane&apos;s lights at one point, but the lights kept changing and the object was moving very strangely. It disappeared over the treeline. After this object we saw 3-4 plane-like objects move overhead, about 5 minutes apart from each other. They all came from the same direction, all were silent, and all of them headed in the same direction towards the first object we saw. They had blinking white and red lights on them but the amount of lights and the speed they were traveling was unusual. Me and a friend saw one final object, WITH blinking red and white lights, fly in the same direction. We thought it could be a plane but I watched it carefully just in case. When it passed where we were standing it began to move up and down as it was flying, making weird movements that planes do not make. Overall the entire experience lasted about 2-2 1/2 hours. These were definite UFOs, we all saw them. It was like absolutely nothing I have ever seen before, and the same goes for the 5 credible witnesses I was with. I&apos;m sure other people saw these also, as some of these objects were not subtle at all. Again, these objects moved in ways planes cannot, in erratic, jerky movements. However, they were definitely under some kind of intelligent control, as some seemed to interact with each other. Each of the 5 people I was with will tell the exact same story if asked, and we all saw what we saw.", "A huge orange ball over Lake Hills in Renton WA, that turned into a triangle over Boeing field and disappeared.Driving south on 405 towards Renton my husband and I saw a huge orange ball of some kind hovering over Lake Hills.  My memory is not vague, I will never forget feeling if what ever it was dropped (it was still at the time) it would blow away all of the top of the mountain.  It started moving towards the lake and instead of turning to go up to our house, my husband slowed down and we watched as it slowly went over the lake, down over Renton Boeing field, then in a heartbeat it turned into a triangle and disappeared.  Not up or down or sideways, just disappeared.  I told my neighbor and she laughed at me.  Days (maybe a week) later she said there was a huge crowd (I think in PA) who said they all saw the same type of thing, which was reported in the newspaper.

And when I am outside I have a tendency to look up to view the jets fly by.  Kansas City airport has aircraft fly out all the time and I usually say to myself &quot; Well that should be me.&quot; That approximate night, I looked up and saw the clouds.  They were normal no big deal.  Then the clouds illuminated just a bit.  One of 3 lights came through them, the lights rotated and went back up into the clouds.Nothing else has happend but I rarely go out and check anyways.  Not a big thing on the top of my list. It could be something else like a helicopter.  But by my estimations.  One of the lights could probably fit two or three heli&apos;s inside.

I observed in the far distance a dot, and noticed it was the only &quot;star&quot; in the black sky.  As I watched, it came toward me and seemed to grow larger.  Suddenly, an incredible long rectangular craft hung directly over my head.  The only color I could make out was a blaze of white lights entirely covering the front of the craft.  There were small red and blue/green lights on either end.  The craft made absolutely no sound, and was close enough that I could&apos;ve counted every light.  I felt no fear, but stood transfixed as I waited to see what was next.  As quickly as it appeared, it had vanished into the sky. It was awesome, and I can&apos;t get the image out of my head.

My bed and my sleeping side are right next to the window, which at the time was wide open. Out of the corner of my eye I could see lights moving. Just like the posting from Barberton, Ohio I also live very near an airport as well as several smaller airports, the blimp hanger and an army arsenal. At any given time there is something flying over our home and we&rsquo;ve become quite immune to lights and loud jet engines. However what caught my eye was the erratic flight pattern. I immediately told my husband to turn off the T.V. so I could hear the plane. As stated before we have become immune to planes overhead but have also established a very discerning ear to plane types and sizes.My husband then looked out the window and was as startled by the lights as I was. They seem to be moving slowly back and forth in a weaving pattern and eventually moved in closer. I would say within a mile from us. His words word &ldquo;what the @#%$ is that?&rdquo;   The lights were in a cross pattern with several down the middle and two to three running left to right. I can only remember the lights being white and thought to myself this is unlike any landing lights I have ever seen. We both jumped out a bed and my husband ran out into the field which is behind our house. But within the 5-10 seconds it took us to get out of the house the object was gone.I was ready to chalk this whole thing up to a strange plane from the recent air-show until my husband pointed out the one thing that didn&rsquo;t add up, we heard nothing the entire time, just the crickets.", "Cloaked lights in the treesIt was in November 1983, my husband, who is now retired from the Navy, was stationed at Naval Air Station Oceana in Virginia Beach, VA.

There were no other cars on the road at the time and it was around 5:00 p.m.  My husband said that he looked at the trees and saw no lights.

And I was in a hurry to get into my house because there was lightning just north of me in the next county.  But when I got out of my car.  I caught this glow from the corner of my eye. I turned south toward the glow. It&rsquo;s color was unusual, like if it were white, red, yellow, and soft and bright all at the same time. It came closer, very eerily. At an unusual pace. I heard no sound coming from this aircraft.  Just gliding almost felt like it was rising and moving towards me at the same time. And once it got right above my head, the glow disappeared, and all you saw were about 6 or 7 lights moving in a horizontal diamond shape.  I felt paralyzed with fear but pushed myself to get closer to my house. The colors of the lights were different and I couldn&rsquo;t tell what they were, just colors.

The closer we came to the lights originally bright white, they were orange and very bright.  When we drove to the top of the hill, I realized that the lights were stationary, spaced equal distance apart and about 200 Ft off the ground and not moving.  The small farm where it was hovering (making no sound at all) looked like all the buildings were on fire the light was so bright. We stopped the car turned off the engine but left our lights on, and I opened the window.  We could hear the sound of the large snow flakes land on the car in clumps but the huge black triangle was making no noise.

Before the stars started to come out, I was laying on the ground watching the sky when a saw a bright spot.  I assumed it was a planet, so I spun my telescope over to spot what it was.  It seemed to bright and too early.  At first I wasn&rsquo;t even sure it was moving. In the eyepiece I saw a sphere, fairly bright, and neutral colored glow.  I though something was wrong with the lens because there was something that looked like a long string extending from it, with a glowing reddish light on the end, it looked like there may have been a light where it connected also.  The string seemed to swing back and forth on the bottom of the sphere as I watched. This object moved across the sky for about 10 minutes from about the South and West a bit, heading north.  I estimate it only crossed about 15-20 degrees of sky before it vanished.  It&rsquo;s path wasn&rsquo;t consistent with a pass over of the International Space Station that same night, so I&rsquo;m unsure if this was some other sort of object, maybe a satellite or weather device.  I doubt the object is of any importance; I just have not been able to find any other astronomical reports fitting the description of what I saw.", "It was probably a meteor, but while viewing the International Space Station we saw something unusual.My son and I were outside tonight to view the International Space Station as it passed overhead. At approx. 8:55 central time we spotted the ISS. Almost instantly below it a light flicked into view and shot across the sky. Shot is not really the correct word. It did not seem very fast. It was very unusual that we saw this possible meteor at the same the ISS came into view. This meteor was also perpendicular to the ISS. Another unusual thing is I thought meteors usually entered the atomsphere from the east heading west. This one entered low from the north heading south. Here is the viewing info for the ISS from the NASA site ISS Sat Apr 12/08:54 PM 2 min 24 degrees max elev 11 degrees approach above NNW 24 above NE This might help to solve this small mystery. My house blocked out most of the mystery lights travel, so I am not sure how far it went. I can tell you from the time it appeared it was steady and not blinking and it traveled straight across the sky, not appearing to change in elevation at all.

At first the object appeared to be an ordinary much like a planet or star in the night sky.  The spherical object was clearly visible and if estimating the size based on distance would have appeared to be the size of a quarter. The object began to move slowly south, doubled in size, and a golden constant glow began to intensify around the object. The object did not have flashing lights like other aircraft.  At first the object&rsquo;s movement can be characterized as a slow pendulum swinging from side to side.
