["Red lights flying in the skyI was in my room last night, when my sister and her boyfriend come running in telling me to go look at the window. So when i went to see whats going on, there was these little littles flying around the sky, at first i thought it was a simple plain, but it get switching directions, and obviously a plane couldnt do that. It would change speed also, slow, then stop, then go back to fast. After watchin it a for a while, there was a big &quot;thing&quot; that past right beside my house, i first me and my sisters boyfriend just stared and thought to ourself, oh thats just a helicopter, The lights were blue red and white. But after it was a bit further from my house, it picked up speed, and the noise disapeared completely, and he left makin a wiggly path.", "recorded a white light getting bigger, smaller, brighter, and dimmer moving throughout the  N-NE-S part of night skyI, ((name deleted))., was on a road trip from Arizona to visit my brother in New Mexico on Thursday, early morning, September 23, 2004, 04:23 a.m.  My two friends and I were traveling east bound on U.S. Highway 10.  We had just passed the exit northbound for Safford, Az. about 5 miles west of a small town called Bowie, Az.  I was sitting in the back seat behind my friend ((name #2 deleted)).  I started to gaze out the window as we all do on road trips, when i noticed a bright, white light in the north part of the sky.  At first I thought it was the North Star, but quickly realized that it wasn&apos;t because it was moving while getting brighter and bigger, then dim and smaller.  I quickly grabbed my camcorder and began filming.  The object, when i first saw it, was in the north part on the sky on the driver&apos;s side of the vehicle.  The object was moving side to side and getting bigger, then smaller, etc.  At 5:11 a.m., the object moved from the north side of the car to the south side of the car while traveling eastbound.  At 5 :19 a.m., the object moved back to the north side of the vehicle.  The sun was starting to rise for the day, and i kept recording until the sun completely rose, and I could no longer film the object.  It was 5:49 a.m when I was no longer able to record the object.   ** Will not send copy of sighting until contacted by investigator. **  ((name deleted))  (O)- -  the object passed the car w/ visible light and sound - this side - (O)  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I   Car   I           1 I         I           1 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- - - - (O)((NUFORC Note:  Designs made in text do not survive the transfer from an e-mail program to a database.

I am a private pilot of small aircraft out of NJ as well as a military aircraft buff. I am highly familiar with the NYC sky, aircraft, military aircraft and flight patterns. Now that I have given you my credentials I will explain what we saw while sailing 4 miles south of the Verazzano bridge just 4 days after the WTC disaster. You could document my being there because besides the coast guard there couldn&apos;t have been more than a handful of boats in the entire area. This is what we observed: From my positions sailing from the Naval ships docked at Earle to Keyport NJ (east to west) we saw a perfectly shaped reflective &quot;pill&quot; shaped object that was positioned like a blimp standing on its end. The sky was perfectly clear with a light North to Northwest breeze blowing. The object was absolutely stationary, seemed to be at an altitude of 10K to 15K feet and the approximate size of a blimp. However it looked nothing like a blimp acted nothing like a blimp and I am very familiar with the many blimps in our area. We were extremely upset that entire sailing trip seeing first hand the devistation that had taken place with our own eyes and smelling the acrid smoldering of the WTC all day. We were a bit shocked so the sighting didn&apos;t seem as spectacular as it might have at another time. So, after observing this thing for some 45 min plus the sun lowering seemed to illuminate or reflect twilight making it more and more visible. It then did something that really amazed me. It started to move slowly (relatively slowly depending on its actual size and elevation) and smoothly across the manhattan skyline and straight up the Hudson river (North) at the same altitude until it dissappeared. This thing didn&apos;t move an inch and then she just moved with utter perfection directly AGAINST THE WIND. Not a sound and defied everything I knew about aircraft and proposed military aircraft. I know that the military was flying high altitude CAP at that very time and did not seem to be at all interested in this giant thing hanging over NYC.", "Fast moving (UFO)object over BerkeleyI view it thru a live view-cam from UC-Berkeley...http://sv.berkeley.edu/view/index.html  from 1:37PM to 1:40PM of 9/20/2004(MON)!

These lights lit up five different times over the course of an hour and fifteen minutes. The first time there were what appeared to be two or three amber lights lined up with one red light and then one amber light separate from the line formation. The second time and third time there was only one amber light which pulsated for about two minutes each time while remaining in exactly the same spot on the horizon. The fourth time there were several amber lights clustered with one red. The red light moved horizontally towards the south slightly after all the amber ones faded out. The fifth time they were clustered again the same way without motion, but much further away (possibly over Sun City or the Peoria Sports Center. I approximate that the first three were probably over Glendale or even close to Arizona State University West Campus. Each time they were lit up for quite and extended period of time and very low in the air over the horizon. I have witnessed these lights on three separate occasions over the last two months. The first two times were over the West end of South Mountain.((NUFORC Note:  Please see other reports of similar phenomenon, submitted by the same witness, for Septebmer 13 and 22, 2004.

Taking advantage of this, my wife and I decided to take a late evening stroll. This would have taken place between, I guess, 10.30 - 11.30pm - although,unfortunately,I wasn&apos;t wearing a watch at the time.We left the house in Brixton, and finished up in a small park nearby on the Brixton/Stockwell border. Lying on the grass, looking up at the stars, my wife, ((name deleted)) started asking the names of some of the things we were looking at.Many years ago, I had a fleeting interest in Astronomy, and enough of this remains to be able to identify things like the Pole Star, and a few of the planets, so I gamely dived in, doing my best. I had made a couple of convincing astronomical stabs, when I noticed what I took to be a flight of birds, very high above us. They were obviously white, because they were reflecting the lights of the city, magnified by the pollution of the last few hot days.I wondered aloud  what sort of bird could fly so high at night, and what it would use for navigation. As we continued watching, the &apos;blobs&apos; suddenly resolved into three tiny objects (I could have fitted all of them on my thumbnail) like big triangles with a smaller tail behind.They flew in a diamond formation for a few seconds, and then one of them broke ranks and moved to a position diagonally opposite the other two. This movement was really extraordinary; I have never seen any aircraft perform it.The object moved across the sky extremely quickly, and in an absolutely straight line, as if being pulled on a wire.A moment later, the other two UFOs joined the first, and flew on for another few seconds, followed by two pairs of wildly curious eyes on the ground. As we looked, the three objects then flew straight into each other to form a ball, then split apart again, flying off in different directions. Finally a third one streaked straight up, away from the other two, in a crazy &apos;stunt-flying&apos; manoeuvre, flipping and twisting, as if showing off to the others. We lost the first two UFOs at this point, and after its aerobatic performance, the third object seemed to slide off into some low cloud or mist, and we lost that one too. The whole experience lasted no more than thirty to thirty five seconds. I am forty-two years old and work as a videotape editor, my wife is a forty-year-old TV production manager, we are both extremely qualified professionals in an industry that positively encourages cynicism and suspicion. We are not given to flights of fancy, and certainly did not wish for a close encounter of the first kind on a late-night walk round Brixton.However, we are utterly unable to explain what we DID see. It certainly wasn&apos;t no weather balloon, tho&apos;!  As an afterthought, I must mention one last thing, if only as a foil to the unidentified aircraft&apos; enthusiasts among us. Thirty seconds after this extraordinary display, a REAL plane went by, and I thought it lumbered across the sky like an airborne steam-train after the extraordinary aerial ballet we had just witnessed. I noticed that even though the plane was flying comparatively low, there was no reflection from the streetlights whatsoever. Judging by the size of my UFOs, they were tens of thousands feet higher than that plane, yet they were lit with an orange light that I misinterpreted as streetlight - this can only mean that they had their OWN light source, i.e. they were glowing.How many glowing planes have YOU ever seen?", "Brite White and Red lights Have Video taped it.Very Brite lights ummm it would turn iether all red or all white and it would become really brite then little and back to brite. it would disapear and end up 10 blocks from were it was in about 4 seconds. i have a video tape of it. its about 10 to 15 min long. it shows everything.((NUFORC Note:  We will request a copy of the tape.

She is studying cloud formation, and weather prediction, so we routinely watch the skies daily, and nightly. The sky was clear, although it was a bit hazy, as the sun did not hurt our eyes to look up. I pointed at 2 objects in the sky, and she soon located them as well. They were very high up, as I am not good with distance, I would say higher than I have ever seen a bird, but yet when I saw them I said &quot;look at how high those birds are&quot;. She had said that they don&apos;t look like birds, as they were shining. We did not hear any engine sound, and observed that these objects were flying in circles around eachother in perfect sync, slowly. After watching for about 5-8 minutes, these 2 objects left their circular pattern, and one turned away flying straight North, which as we watched went directly above our heads, and the other followed within 30 seconds of the other, again staying in perfect sync, and distance of one another. Once these objects were directly above us, we could see a different angle of them, and noticed that their southeast corner or side was shining as the sun was shining on them. It was at first thought to be white, then we noticed it was a silver color when the sun hit them. I have seen very few birds fly that high, and this was even beyond that. We live over a direct path of airplane flight, and during this time not a single airplane was in the area. We also live in a flight area of what I believe to be Military airspace, as the Military base is not far from here. I can just about guarntee that this was an unidentified flying object.

On a Friday night a buddy and I were sitting on the front steps of another friends house, waiting on him to get home from eating out with his parents.  As we sat there talking I noticed a humming sound that sounded different from any airplane that I have ever herd before.  I looked up toward the sky (southeast) towards Birmingham and notice three lights in the sky above that formed a perfect triangle.  The two on the right were smaller in size and would have formed the base of the triangle.  The one on the left was larger and would have been the apex of the triangle.  The apex light was white and the two smaller lights were white with a red tint.  Since I was taking my private pilot ground school, we had learned that red was on the left, green on the right, and white on the tail.  I was trying to make sence of the lights but it just wasn&apos;t right.  The lights were moving towards us from the southeast heading northwest.  If the lights were on a plane, the plane would have been flying sideways.  I then got my buddies attention and pointed the lights out to him.  As we watched the lights slowly move across the sky, I was telling him if,that is a plane, it is very low and we would hear it, and that the direction of flight would be different than the lights.  The house that we were at is up on a hill and from our position you can see the lights of Birmingham in the distance some 12-15 miles away.  To the southwest of us about 1 mile a baseball game was underway at parkwest and you could hear the pa being annouced at the game.  I notice a plane had just departed from BHM and was climbing out towards the north in a slow arc.  The plane was very identifible as an F-4 phantom recon aircraft that was based at BHM.  This was identified by the two bottom stobes that we saw all the time in our area.  As the F4 got closer to the objects above us, the objects slowed and came to a complete stop.  To get an idea of the spacing of the objects overhead, they were about the width of an adults outstrected hands in the sky (2&apos;from the apex to the base.)  The two objects that formed the base were about 1&apos; apart from each other.  As the F4 got closer, the two objects that formed the base began to separate from each other, widening the base to what appeared two be 3-4&apos; in the sky.  They slowly started to move to the southwest which is a 90 degree turn from the original direction.  As the moved the gatherd speed and instantly streaked across the sky leaving a white line that dissapeard as fast as it appeared.  As soon as they were gone, the largest (apex) light slowly started in the same direction (toward the ball park) as did the other two.  It too started to build speed and in a blink of an eye streaked across the sky and left an identicle steak of light behind it and was gone.  It would remind one of a shooting star.  From out position on top of this hill, you could see 15 miles.  So we were able to follow these light all the way across the horizon.  The F4 continued its approach and made a large circle back towards Birmingham.  My friend and I just looked at each other in disbelief and asked each other &quot;did you see that&quot;.  We told out friend what we saw and his parents.  They just looked at us as if we were crazy.  The next morning I went to my private pilot ground school at the birmingham airport and asked my instructor, who was a F4 pilot at the time if they scrambled any F4&apos;s last night to check out what we had seen and he said he didn&apos;t know.  This has been on my mind ever since and I felt the need to write it down.  If anyone else has had a similar experience I would like to read about it.Thanks((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We stopped by a river to fish around 7pm, and I decided to rest a bit, and have a smoke break and watch my wife fish the river.The sun was going down over the mountains, and the sky was clear. There were some faint stars becoming visible and I looked up towards the northeast, over a mountain and saw an unusual looking &apos;star&apos;.I say &apos;unusual&apos; because it wasn&apos;t a &apos;whitish&apos; color but more of a whitish/bluish color, about half the size of the north star.I watched this object for a minute, then realized it was moving very slowly, what appeared to be coming towards us.  It was difficult to estimate the distance or altitude of the &apos;star&apos;, but I would guess it to be at around 7500 AGL, and I can&apos;t even guess at the distance. I am a commercial pilot and have been flying for close to 30 years, so I know what aircraft and other types of objects look like.Anyways, about maybe 2 minutes later, the object is getting brighter, again with a bluish tint, and it appears to coming towards us.

I&apos;m probably mumbling someting while watching this thing for another minute, and then, suddenly, it shot straight up and disappeared.It was one of most unusual objects I or my wife have ever witnessed. There was no noise from the craft, and where we were fishing, there was no sound at all, we could not even hear the sound of the river, since the water was so low, so, it was dead silent out.I would estimate that we watched it for about 4-5 minutes total.The sky was clear at the time and no other aircraft flying in the area.", "cigar shaped ,white silver object  with dark ports on side hovered  breifly then dissappearedI was jogging along  the Galloping Goose trail when I stopped to let some cyclist pass,while they were passing I looked up in the sky-the moon was still showing  with many of its feature in evidence.

At about 20:30 some of our classmates noticed what appeared at first like a satellite in the sky.  My attention was drawn in the direction of the object and  I began to observe the object through my binoculars thinking as well that we were looking at a satellite. It was travelling at a high rate of speed . At first it did not raise any suspicion because that is what one expects from a satellite. But very soon this changed due to the fact that it was tracing a somewhat erratic flightpath as it crossed the sky from about where  sagitarius was at that time of the night (which was at a relatively low angle)up to the region in the sky where the constellation andromeda was located.  I would say that it accomplished this  in about 25 seconds max. A strobing light sometimes emitted from this object which appeared to be at such a distance that not even my 10*50mm binoculars could resolve some discernable shape.  Additionally, the object emitted a greenish light. The object made no sound of any kind.  Now as it reached andromeda, it suddenly made a tight turn and at that moment I noticed that a second object came into view.  It appeared to be racing to meet the 1st object and as it gained on the first object, I noticed that they both began to decelerate at a very steady rate until both were flying at the same speed.  Suddenly the first object began to rapidly accelerate and as this occured, the angular distance between the two increased and at that point I could only follow one of the objects.  I continued following what I identify as the first object as it headed due north now when suddenly the second object closed in on the first as it came into my field of view in the binoculars.  About 2 seconds passed when abruptly I noticed that a third object had now come into my field of view.  The 3 then continued on this norhterly course together until they disappeared behind a hill and I could follow them no more. Now I want to say a few things regarding this &quot;potential&quot; sighting. Firstlly, I have been fascinated with aircraft all of my life since I can remember being alive.  I go to airshows several times a year and have seen many different types of military aircraft in action. Military aircraft are to my knowledge very noisy vehicles.  The vehicles that I witnessed this night made absolutely no sound whatsoever. Secondly to bolster my 1st point, I would like to state that the objects accelerated rapidly at least twice that I can remember and not once was there any sound nor the appearance of the prominent flame that I could associate with that which is emitted when jet aircraft engage their afterburners in order to command the  impresive rate of acceleration that these vehicles displayed.  Thirdly, we live in the San Francisco   Bay area.  It is very active with air traffic given the two major airports which are  located so close in proximity from one another (literally right across the bay from one another)  The notion that the military would conduct such risky maneuvers in such an area of the sky that is already rife with civilian air traffic is in my opinion not viable unless one is willing to accept that the military does not take the issue of civilian air traffic safety seriously.  If we are to then accept that maybe these objects were military jets flying well above the civilian air traffic corridor, let us say perhaps above 20,000 feet, then these jets would have had to fly at the speed of sound at the very least in order to cover the aforementioned area of the sky  and they would have surely generated a sonic boom.  But as  I say, not a peep eminated from these vehicles.  conversely, if they had been flying at a lower altitude which is the only other explanation that could explain the large sky coverage executed by these vehicles in short a short period of time, then surely, unless these are military jets with a sophisticated new propulsion technology, they would have definitely made a lot of noise. I cannot definitely say that what I saw were craft from another world, but they sure did not behave in any way that I could attribute to modern military jet aircraft.

In the distance over the skyline, about 30 degrees from the horizon, was a slightly oval-shaped glow that had about the same size, color, and intensity as a full moon being obscured by clouds. It could not have been the moon, however, because it did not change shape or intensity at all, as would have been the case if it were being obscured by moving clouds. Moreover, the moon that night was a half moon. This object just sat there in one spot, unchanging for the entire time I viewed it.

As I neared Davenport, I was about 10 miles west, I noticed a small silver object at about 8000 ft in the air, that was straight North of Davenport.The object was going slow, and then in a burst of speed headed straight South and slowed and stopped somewhere over the Davenport area. As it slowed, it turned red and had a slight bounce to it. It settled to a stop and continued to glow red.  After several seconds it accelerated and headed back North and within a few seconds it was out of sight, also when it accelerated it turned from red and back into a silver object. This year, 2004, I again went to Chicago for the labor day weekend. I examined the map of the area that I saw this object over and learned that the Rock Island Arsenal is right directly south of Davenport. Our so called leaders have assured us that we are in danger of a dirty bomb attack, this could be true, and instead of being made in the Mid-east, it might actually be from the Midwest.

I must reiterate that it seemed very distant and at first glance appeared to be a planet shining very brightly.

A radar tower blinked red directly below the object, only the tower was closer to where we were parked and the object was at a very high altitude and many miles away.

After another hour the light got faint as if it were moving away from out spot, it got brighter for a short time moved about erratically then begin to get smaller and smaller until it faded altogether. The following half hour my friend and I observed two more occurences of the light appearing very dimly a good ways above the surrounding hills then disappearing from sight. I was completely blown away by this because the light emitted a glow that looked more akin to a flash light shined through a fancy diamond, rather then the light a star produces. I was also in aww at the fact that it stayed relatively in the same place for a number of hours then began to move and eventually got smaller and smaller until it faded completely.((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witnesses may have observed a celestial body, perhaps a twinkling star.

We were all very surprised that it had been shining so brightly and then suddenly disappeared.  The time was 6.35 PM.

It looked as though whatever it was was going to crash. There were other cars around me including a cop car who was stopped on the side of the road with two cars/van that had I think had had a fender bender.  I looked at the other cars around me to see if anyone else had seen it, but no one stopped or signled me.", "Fireball burned meAs i arrived at my home. I got out of my car i heard a loud roaring noise i looked up and i bright fireball shot across the sky only a few meters above me, the heat was so hot that the next day when i awoke my arms were burned. A scar now remains and has not faded over time.((NUFORC Note:  Probably not a serious report.  If an incandescent meteor had passed close enough to the witness to scorch his arms, we suspect the burns would have been the least of his concerns, since the resultant shock wave generated by the meteor almost certainly would have killed the witness.

What appeared to be right above us (between a 85-75 degree angle from where we were standing) was a white, sort of round object in the sky.  Ifigured it was a weather ballon or a star, but it was just an hour before the game started in broad day light.  We had brought binoculors and i look to see what it was, it was tremendously high, much higher than the plane that past by, so it was up there, then i thought it was a sattle light, but ive seen satlites in the sky, but only when it was really dark, this was large enough to see during the day.  A few other people saw it also, i let them look throught the binoculors also, they didnt know what it was.  But it just was in one spot for the longest time, then after a while, it was move, but very slowly. As i keeped looking into the binoculars, just wonerding what it was, it appeared to be round, it was hard to tell it it was moving in any way, but i noticed a dark spot in the middle, my uncle descibed it as a donut shaped object, and it was clearly shinny in the binoculars reflecting the suns light or something. The last i saw of it was when we went into the dome, it moved from the place from where we first saw it to a good distance if you put your pointer finger sidways torwards the sky, it moved the length of your pointer finger (mine is around 3 inches).  It was amazing to see, then my unckle told me about this site and that other people witnessed it!!  So i hope my information was helpful.", "Dark oval object photographed over San FranciscoI was cleaning the lens of my camera. I was trying to clean off a very small smudge mark on the lense, so I took my camera outside, pointed it straight up into the clear blue sky where there was nothing , and snapped 2 random shots, 2 seconds apart, in the exact same place in the sky so I could then take my camera back into my office and look at the photographs to see if the smudge marks were gone. They were, but in looking closely at the photographs to see if the smudge was gone, I noticed a small dark speck at the top of the first photo. This is a 6 million pixel high-res digital camera and I zoomed in on the object. Upon doing so, It became clear that this was some kind of flying object, sort of an oval in shape, and by the amount of deep zooming I did, appeared to be very large. The second photo showed nothing but empty space. I have the photo if anyone wants a copy, your guess is as good as mine as to what this thing was. I have also emailed this photograph to ufocntr@nwlink.com", "Three white lights in a triangle formation moving west over OmahaIt was around 10:00 PM and i went outside onto my friends back patio to cool off.  As I was laying there I looked up at the sky and saw 3 white lights in a perfect triangle formation.  I stared at it to see if i could see any flashing colored lights to indicate an airplane, but it was just 3 white lights moving at the same speed and not changing formation.  As it went out of my site of view I still laid there thinking about what it could have been, and then about 5-10 minutes later I saw an airplane go over and it looked nothing like what i just saw.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

I was born and raised in Honolulu, and have spent a lot of time outdoors looking at the night sky.  I am sober; I don&apos;t use any drugs and seldom drink.  Over the years I have seen a quite a few things I could not explain in the skies above Oahu. I&apos;m glad to have a place to share them here.  At the times these things happened I was either alone, or with one person and it was wierd not to be able to talk about them. ABOUT THE TIMES AND DATES, THE FORM HERE DOESN&apos;T FIT.  THESE THINGS OCCURED BETWEEN APPROXIMATELY 1994 AND THE PRESENT AND VARIOUS TIMES AND LOCATIONS ON OAHU.  MOST WERE ONLY WITNESSED BY ME BUT ONE OR TWO WERE WITNESSED BY OTHERS. First of all the most recent thing was in the ocean outside Waikiki.  This occured approximately around 2002 or 2003.  On more than one occasion, I saw lights I could not explain in the ocean outside of Waikiki.  I saw these from Kaimana beach on the eastern end of Waikiki at the foot of Diamond Head.  There were yellow lights.  They did not behave either like airplaces or boats.  They were above the water. If I remember correctly they looked like flares (Although they were much larger, larger and brighter than stars or airplanes).  Their movements made no sense.  If I remember correctly, they burned brightly in one place and then sank slowly and disappeared before they hit the water.  They were perhaps a mile or more out to sea, seemingly directly out from Kaimana.  I saw these bright yellow lights on more than on occasion.  If I remember correctly there were more than one in a row.  My friend, a social worker, also saw then and we were freaked out. Perhaps around 1994 I saw the most spectacular thing.  It was twilight at Queen&apos;s surf in Waikiki.  To the West, out to sea from Makakilo and Waianae, hundreds of feet up in the sky, I saw a spectacular display.  Fluorescent green squiggles appeared high in the sky, one after another.  They would fade and more would appear.  This went on for a while.  It looked like someone air brushing designs on a T-shirt.  This was NOT the &quot;green flash&quot; people sometimes see in Hawaii after the sunset.  In spite of the fact that thousands of people should have seen this, I found no mention of it in the media, and I checked. I think I also checked somewhere like Bishop Museum which has astronomers and people like that.  No one else reported it.  One friend speculated that it must have been was rockets or missiles launched from the military base on Kauai [which would probably be Barking Sands].  This occurance was spectacular,unmistakeable, distinct and went on for a while. At other times, I&apos;ve seen lights in the night sky that seem to behave in odd ways if they were to be aircraft.  This could be their movement, or brightness.  Most of these I&apos;ve seen from Kahala or near Sandy Beach.  Perhaps some from Waikiki.  I don&apos;t remember the details that much now, just thinking, that light isn&apos;t moving correctly for an airplane, or it looks too big.  If I remember correctly most were yellow light, or perhaps white. Somewhere in the early or mid nineties, I saw the most incredible sights at Waimanalo beach in eastern Oahu.  These may well all be natural.  I just thought they were spectacular.  On this particular day, I saw an awesome rainbow coming straight down from a cloud to the sea.  About sunset, which was taking place on the other side of a mountain range, a sight appeared in the eastern sky about where the sun rises.  This on the horizon was over the water.  Black rays emanated from this spot, like a reverse sunset.  Lots of people saw it, they just looked transfixed, but no one said anything, strangely. Combined with the rainbow and something else I&apos;ve forgotten, the energy was intense that day.  It was special.  I would be grateful to know what that was, if anyone knows. Then, between about 2000 and 2002, I saw one more thing.  I was near Punchbowl.  It was probably between about 3 and 5 in the afternoon.  This cloud came overhead, but it was not like any cloud I have ever seen.  It seemed unusually radiant and important.  It resembled a city in the sky.  I was transfixed by it.  I remember I wanted to call an aquaintance who is spiritually sensitive and religious because I thought she too would understand that something was afoot.  I don&apos;t think that was an ordinary &quot;cloud.&quot;  I&apos;ve wondered in it concealed a UFO, or something else. That&apos;s all I can specifically remember at this time.  I&apos;ve noticed other reports on this site of strange lights over the ocean outside of Waikiki that are like my stories.", "my reason for entering this site is to ask rather than state that i have seen a ufo,i acquired a new digi cam and decided to go and try it out taking a couple of pictures of the family and then the town i stayed in, i ventured back home,uploaded the pics on the pc and found one with a(something in the top right hand corner,i would just like to know what it is, be it plane chopper or ufo,it doesnt really matter,i am just curios.((name deleted))((NUFORC Note:  Photograph received by NUFORC.

We were enjoying the scenery when one of our party noticed a craft that seemd to be hovering under a cliff. The craft was cylindrical in shape with no obvious doors or windows. The color was some sort of metalic but it&apos;s difficult to describe it because looking at it hurt our eyes. (As in some sort of camoflage). Suddenly we heard a sonic boom and 3 fighter jets flew over, in what seemd to be a tight formation. They passed over us about half dozen times. All of us were very afraid, both of the noise and the low passage of the jets. When the jets had finally gone the craft left. It passed directly over us. It made no sound but we all felt terrible pressure in our heads and all our watches stopped. About a half hour passed until we felt strong enough to come down from the mountain. The fighter jets might have been from the U.S. but we are not entirely sure, a large Russian fleet has been manovering on the west coast of our country for a week now, they have not given any expalnations about what they are doing there. There seemed to be no markings what so ever on the jets.((NUFORC Note:  Report does appear to have been submitted from outside the U. S..

From approximately 20:25 to 20:40 on 9-13-04 myself and one other guard witnessed four amber colored lights fading in and out in perfectly straight lines appearing one after the other. One light would fade in then the next would fade in next to it. Then the next would appear until there were four in a row; then the first would fade out and reappear in line on the other side of the others to continue the line eventually all fading out in order of appearance. First they lined up parallel with the ground and next in a 45 degree angle from the ground aligning upwards. They were completely stationary while lit. They did not appear in exactly the same place each time although in the same relative vicinity. They were below the top of South Mountain but above the ground. I checked out that area a few days later and could find nothing but a residential area and what appears to be an unmarked city water reservoir. I could find nothing that would emit these types of lights. I could not find any roads on that end of the mountain (northside on west end). My conclusion was that these lights would have had to have been approximately 150-250 feet off the ground. Occasionally the lights would flash very bright. A few minutes later fighter jets were flying over and helicopters appeared searching the mountain. On my investigative journey there were three helicopters patroling the mountain with spotlights. This may or may not be related. I saw the same exact thing nine days later on 9-22-04 at the exact same time of day. The same guard was working. He said that earlier in the day (he works an earlier shift which overlapped with mine) he thought he saw something triangular in shape which was transparent and sort of blurry. I can not vouch for his day time report; I can only say that he told me about his day time sighting before we saw the evening lights on 9-22-04. This for me provided some validation. All sightings were witnessed below the mountain top almost due South of the I-17 freeway bend (turns from North/South to East/West). I approximate that the lights would have been above Elliot Road and 27th Avenue roughly.((NUFORC Note:  Please see other reports of similar phenomenon, submitted by the same witness, for Septebmer 22, and October 20, 2004.

The object changed direction, it turned more to the Southwest, but stayed in a tight formation, which is why (without our eyeglasses) we are not certain if the object(s) were one large one or several smaller ones.

It was a very clear night and the stars were easily visible all the way to about 30 degrees above the horizon where the sky became more orange as in dusk. (With a little light pollution thrown in from nearby street lights but certainly not enough to obscure our vision from where we were) I was just lieing back when almost immediately I saw a small oval, like a straight  small bean, red object (uniform brightness,red in colour) travelling fast directly above and behind my head.I had to twist as i jumped up to keep it in sight and i quickly saw that it was travelling very quickly!. if it was as far up as it appeared to be, as in almost like a satellite, it was obviously way too fast. I had seen satelites and recognised loads of them as a youngster then and many since, but never have i seen any travelling this fast. Likewise I had observed loads of aircraft at night and during the day due to the fact I took a keen interest in old WW2 aircraft and jets etc so I knew their behaviour fairly well. This was travelling at a speed which would suggest an aircraft which was a lot lower, yet it appeared to be very high and there was no sound.Luckily I was able to grab my friend and direct his view to the object, with a pointed finger, as it continued to streak accross the sky in a straight line. Then Just as he said &apos;Yes&apos; to my &apos;there! can you see it?&apos; question (by this time the object was almost into the orangey part of the sky and i thought my friend would miss it) it suddenly zipped left, right, diagonal up down etc (it was so quick we barely managed to maintain a view on it so i cannot accurateley describe its movements from memory).

Then we noticed several yellow lights, and a few blue lights, and a red one which was also very bright. We watched from 2am until 5:30am. We saw many different things. The very bright blue one  (the first one) we saw had something that looked like a beam from it, and the only other one that did was the red one. The red one was the closest and the last one we saw. They all moved in eradic motions. Up and down, and then left and right, and then they would go in circles, and also do zigzag and diaganol movements. Many were in a triangler formation, and then some were in lines. At least one of the triangles were connected to another, and there very well may have been other patterns but we were caught up in the excitement.

It immediately kept my attention as the the lights on this aircraft would change drastically. At first, it can only be compared to the waving of a firecracker. As it curved in the sky small bright lights would expand out into a wild flickering trail and then it would compact again and as I exited off the freeway into my neighborhood, I was compelled to follow it as long as I could. It was high enough for me to keep a constant visual. As I caught up to it slightly, it would dim down to just the red light almost going out completely only to come back strong again. The last time I saw the white lights expand-out I was closer and so it was more defined, appearing that the lights were attached and in a half oval shape ( very Spielberg-ish ).

I guess it didn&apos;t dawn on either of us that this could be a ufo. We actually were just discussing the aircraft and how strange it looked. There was a gondola-like structure (round) which hung underneath the black aircraft.. I thought it might be a stealth plane, but knew they had no such gondola. We could actually see many people moving around in the gondola that were far enough up that they looked minute in size.It was, as I said a huge craft.We thought that the gondola-like center could possibly move up into the ship.

I had stopped my truck just a short distance before reaching the end of my road to adjust my seat since my son had used the truck the night before and had repositioned it for himself. This is when I first saw the light. I didn&apos;t think much of it since I see planes all the time. After adjusting my seat I continued driving a short distance (about 60 ft.) before reaching the stop sign where I&apos;d turn left (east) to go to work. Once I stopped at the stop sign I noticed something unusual about the light...now there were about 8-10  lights real close together in a arch or 3/4 shaped shaped round pattern (there were lights inside the &apos;arch&apos; too) . I thought this is weird. Then these lights went in reverse, forward, up and down and were blinking at an extremely rapid pace...or at least much faster than a plane light . The lights were blinking independent of one another..not all at the same time...each point of light about the size of a round pencil eraser and were about 30 degrees above the tree leval. They looked like they were close to the beach even though I couldn&apos;t tell for sure since a wooded area faced me. I thought &quot;Oh my God...what is this&quot;?!! Then they slowly drifted below the horizon. From my position there are woods facing me just across the road where I was stopped which extend southward for about a mile or less...beyond that are subdivisions. The beach/Gulf of Mexico is only about 6 minutes south of my home and I work about 3 minutes from home. The fire station is in between my house and work. I asked one of the firemen who comes regularly in the store where I work if he&apos;d seen these lights. He just made fun of me and laughed about me seeing an u.f.o. Funny thing is I never said it was an u.f.o....I just said they were strange lights which moved in an erratic pattern. Now here comes an even weirder part to this scene. I had a dream just before waking up that morning about visiting my Mom in the hospital. She has been deceased since 1996. I don&apos;t recall any conversation in the dream. however I remember feeling tired in the dream and decided to lay down on the lounge chair (in the dream) that extends out to form a mini &apos;bed&apos;. I was laying on my side facing the wall when I felt a hand touch the back of head. Then the hand touched my upper back. Then I felt these hands and arms scoop under my body and lift me up VERY gently. I never felt any fear. What I felt was a VERY LOVING male presence caring for me. When he lifted me up it felt as though it was completely effortless...like there was no gravity beneath me...I guess like a floating sensation even though I could still feel these arms beneath my body. Then the dream ended. I woke up, dressed for work, got in my truck and WHAM...the lights appeared!!

Faded out.I am a first officer for a regional airline. I fly an aircraft called a Do328 JET.  I flew a one-day trip on the said date, from our hub to Des Moines, and back the next morning. It was approximately 10:30pm, and we were flying our 32 passenger regional jet westbound at 29,000 ft. It was an absoutely clear sky-the overcast was below us, and we could only see stars above. I had turned down the cockpit display lights to look at the night sky. It&apos;s amazing how many stars you can see with the clounds below you blocking out all the ground lights. The aircraft was on auto pilot, as it always is in cruise, and we had approximately 30 minutes remaining until our destination. I was focusing out my side window (right side of the aircraft). Our cockpit windows are curved, so the visibility is great. You can see up, down, forward and back just by looking out the side. Anyway...I was focusing on the night sky. I have seen quite a few shooting stars lately, so I was looking up at the night sky in hopes of seeing one on this night. I noticed that if you use off-center viewing, which we are told to do at night- you can see many more stars than the normal &quot;bright&quot; ones. It is amazing- millions of them. Anyway, I slowly started looking toward the horizon, and I stopped on two stars that were staggered kind of horizontal from one another. One was &quot;higher&quot; than the other, and they were staggered. I have absolutely no idea why my eyes stopped on these out of all the stars in the sky. They were not the brightest, by far, nor were they the dimmest. Just two average stars. And they were stars- not airplanes, not lights colored any different than any of the other million stars in the sky. I looked at them for probably three or four seconds (estimating of course)and to my complete amazement, the one in &quot;front&quot; (the &quot;higher&quot; of the two) started moving. And not gradually- there was no gradual acceleration- it was like someone flipped a switch, and this &quot;star&quot; started moving. And a moment later, the star behind it did the same thing. As if it was saying, &quot;wait for me!&quot; The two stars moved at rapid pace across the sky- I looked over at my Captain to get his attention, but he was updating his company manual, using a personal light that we each have built into our side panels. I looked away for only a second, but decided not to bother with him. I looked back up at the sky, and they were still there, moving across the sky. Two lights, that looked absolutely IDENTICAL to an average star, travelling as a pair, still staggered, just as they were before they started moving. The total distance the moved was from approximately 20% above the westerly horizon, the direction we were travelling, to just aft of straight above our aircraft, which is a huge distance. My point is, it&apos;s not like it was a night illusion where you stare at a light and after a while it appears to move. This was not like that. The lights moved almost half was across the sky. And to reinforce what I was watching, the two light came to a complete and SUDDEN stop. No deceleration, no gradual change. They went from a fairly rapid pace to a complete and obvious stop. The entire episode lasted, if I had to estimate, 20 seconds. At this point, I was still staring at the &quot;stars&quot; wondering what exactly I was seeing. I didn&apos;t want to take my eyes off of them again. They were now stationary, and straight up from us, in relation to the sky. As I stared, BOTH lights went from their &quot;normal&quot; brightness, and slowly faded out to nothing over the course of approx. another 10 seconds. They both faded out int the exact same manner, as if controlled by a dimmer switch. I realize this is a very wordy explanation for a sighting (or whatever you want to call it), but it was absolutely abnormal. I see aircraft fly by us daily, day and night. This was not in the normal operational altitude of a jet. It was, to use a general term, definately up in &quot;space.&quot; It absolutely blended in with the stars, and originally was stationary. Why did I choose to look at these two particular stars out of the millions available? I have no idea. That&apos;s what really intrigued me- I thought, after it happed- holy cow- I&apos;ve never really spent any amount of time really looking at the stars....and I spend a minute or so doing it tonight and I saw THAT????? It was an extremely odd sight. The very mechanical staring and stopping, the fading of the lights simultaneously when all the other stars around them did not change, and especially how the second light started to move in the exact speed moments after the first one. That&apos;s what really did it. Aircraft that approach us head on, with a relative closing speed of close to 1,000mph can take minutes to pass us on a clear night. These two lights covered almost half of the entire night sky in probably 15 seconds or so. And the fact that I took my eyes off of them, and came back and they were still there proved to me that it was no illusion. I was not scanning the sky hoping to see something odd--I did not imagine this. It was very very odd. I hope this is helpful to anyone interested.

Figuring it was a plane, I grabbed my camera just to see how well the zoom would work at that distance, and lined the light up near the center.  When I lowered the camera, two more lights had appeared to the right of the first light, with one being distinctly further back, forming a triangle pattern.  The first light moved behind some trees, while the two newer ones remained hovering for a few moments.  Then, the one that was more distant that had been at the center of the triangle began moving to the left as well, before disappearing behind the same trees as the first one.  The third and rightmost one had begun moving as well, and I managed to take some photos of it as it moved to the left.  As the final light flickered behind the same stand of trees as the first two, a fourth light suddenly appeared near where the middle light had been.  This light only hovered for a few seconds, a minute at the most, before it vanished as suddenly as it had appeared.  This was at approximately 9:24 pm.  The entire time I described what was happening to my friend, and continued to talk to him for approximately ten minutes afterwards, at which point I began writing this report.

My neighbor was outside on the phone when at approximately 8:05PM, she saw a strange light rising from the horizon. She called me immediately to come out and look at it with her. Looking South by South West, a single white light was traveling straight up from the horizon. While we were watching it, (what seemed to be several miles away), we noticed a second light, then a third until we had counted eight in all. Each subsequent light seemed to be a mile or so behind the one before it. The fifth light in this formation was larger than the rest and glowing red. The sixth light was much closer to the red one than the others, and seemed to be &quot;dancing&quot; around it. There was a light cloud cover starting at approximately 30 degrees above the horizon. We watched until the last light passed behind the clouds. Elapsed time: 10-15 minutes. In doing some research, I found an article about a sighting being called the Estrella Lights (West Metro Phoenix Area, June 14th, 8:40PM) which is similar, but in this sighting, the lights were in a horizontal configuration and much closer together but did have a red light in the midst of the formation.", "Two orange lights in the dark Bronx  skySept. 2003 Bronx, NY.

It was moving south at the pace of a low flying airplane (reasonably quick), but it had no flashing lights and made no sound.  Because of this, I assumed it was VERY high up.  But I wouldn&apos;t think a plane that high would move quite that fast.  After watching it for a couple of minutes, it began to dim.  I watched closely as it faded to complete invisibility within about 20 to 30 seconds.  At this point it was still near the highest point in the nights sky, according to my vision.  In other words, it was nowhere near the horizon.

From where we were it looked about 50 feet up. I have on film also what i can only call an explostion of light just above the object. I did not see this at the time.

My 2 dogs started to scratch at the door rather aggressively, which is unlike them (Lhasa Apso is a small, long-haired dog).  I assumed they wanted to go outside to the bathroom. So I gathered their leashes, and walked them outside of my condo. As the dogs did their business I stood by the side of the entrance way to my condo, I scanned the sky as I always do every chance I get. I have seen several UFOs since November 18, 2001.  I have seen Boomerangs, Flying Triangles, and Orbs.  They seem to fly by every November during the Leonid Meteor Showers, and if you want to check for your self, just do an Internet Search for the phrase: Leonid Meteor Showers Boomerang UFOS . I was conciously thinking about the fact that I do not have my video camera with me, and what I would do if a UFO appeared in the sky. Just as I completed my thought a LARGE Triangle swooshed from behind the Condo and sort of stopped mid air as it was traveeling North.  I have seen Triangles before, but this one appeared to &quot;Fall out of the Sky&quot; as if I was seeing a Triangle Constellation of Stars just fall from the sky and sort of &quot;Bounce&quot; in mid air.  This Triangle pulsated and changed size aproximately 3 times..... It pulsated and got bigger, and then bigger, and then back to it&apos;s &quot;Original&quot; size......  and then each &quot;point of light&quot; seperated from the Triangle Formation and became indpendent lights in the sky.  At this point the almost looked like they could be 3 Big Birds or something in the sky playing tricks/dancing... and then Swooooosh..... off they went....

I seem to live in a major hotspot in direct path to the Stanford University Sattellite Dish.  I am about 10 Miles north of Moffett Field (NASA/USAF BASE).  What made this sighting unique (to me) was the surreal feeling of observing it.  I have been having lots of dreams of UFOs lately and look for them whenever I venture outside at night.  To be thinking about a UFO and then see it swoosh over you is a very un-real feeling dream like feeling.  Especially since I have seen them several times before, and have been having surreal/lucid dreams of &quot;flying triangles&quot;. I know what I know, and if you take the time to research the phenomena of these &quot;Boomerang&quot; and Triangle Craft appearing during the Leonid Meteor Showers you will to.  I have this overwhelming urge to encourage people to look up in the sky during this years Leonid Meteor Showers if they want to see that UFOs are real. This sighting lasted no more than 10 seconds. As the disappeared from my site, I ran inside to get me wife, (who has witnessed several sightings of Boomerangs, and Triangles with me Since November 18, 2001).  We both are having recurring dreams of Triangle Crafts, and other anomalies. My wife came outside for a few minutes to see if the craft would re-appear, but no such luck.  She went back inside, I stayed outside for another 30 minutes or so. I did observe 2 &quot;Shooting Stars&quot; , and what appeared to be strange looking clouds and/or chemtrails in the sky where I saw the Triangle Craft.

It looked like a light source was illuminating the inside and outside of a cloud. It had a slight double trail of light.  The shape (of the light) and color never changed which made me confused.  It was moving across the horizon much faster than any plane.  It was declining in elevation steadily as it moved across the sky.

They lasted for 3 minuted then vanished into thin air.", "3 dim trianglular lights on a black trangular base moving slowly low to the ground over Toronto W to E.It was Victoria Day weekend in Canada...the Saturday Night and my friends and I were out having a few drinks (yes we were *slightly intoxicated*).  After leaving a Bar around College and Bathurst in downtown Toronto we ending up in a children&apos;s playground of a school near Harbbord &amp; Bathurst.  3 males and a female and we where having a cigarette when the female member of our group said &quot;Hey, check out the seagulls&quot;...Since I am an avid amateur ornothologist I immediately lookup up (so did the other 2 males).  Instantly we all recognised that they were NOT seagulls.  All our impressions of the object/s vary slighly including altitude and size.  My perception is as follows:  What was originally percived as seaguls were actually white occolating/slightly-glowing triangle shaped pads (flat on the bottom but seemed to be wobbling, which originally looked like wings flapping to the female who first spotted them/it).  The 3 slightly glowing triangles were in the formation of a triangle - this made it hard to tell if they were 3 seperate objects or all part of the same object.  Indeed it was a dark moonless night with almost no wind at all (I could lite a match and it&apos;d burn to the end).  The Object/s were moving from W to E (direction of the wind) at a low altitude (again, our perceptions differ).  To me it appeared to be about 100 ft (twice as high as the city tree tops and standard Seagull hight) and there was no noise.  Although it only seemed to be moving about 10-15kph there didn&apos;t seem to be enough wind to propell anything at that speed.  The 3 glowing triangles never varied in distance from each other - which led us to believe they were attached/tethered to each other or perhaps there was a large dark object (we could not see anything between the smaller triangles though it could have been a very dark object against a really dark sky) and the smaller triangles would be at the bottom 3 corners of the black triangular base. We watched the entire time, from when it was first spotted (directly above our heads) until it dissapeared into the eastern horizon (about 1.5-3 minutes).  We had lots of time to discuss between us what were were looking at.  2 thought the object was more like 500 ft up.  1 (the female) thought it was just at tree level and I figure it was twice tree level (about 100-130 ft)- I am into bird watching, amateur astronomy, amateur aviation and amateur meteorology aswell as entomology...so if it&apos;s in the sky I have a good idea about it...I&apos;m also an excellent judge of distance and hight. From my perspective the size of the object (if it was around 120 ft) is: each glowing triangle was about 3 feet square and about 13-18 feet apart from each other. Lastly, the next day (Sunday of that long weekend) I saw a military jet moving from west to east along more or less the same path as the object from the night before.  There were no airshows going on in the city and it is unusual to see a jet fighter over Toronto otherwise.  The jet was moving fairly slow. I tried to report this to MUFON at the time but they didn&apos;t have website reporting and I never received the reporting form from them as promised over the phone.

I decided since there were no mosquitos evident to sit on the front porch. It was a beautiful clear sky and the full moon hadn&apos;t come up yet. I could see many stars above and since we do not live in the city, the lights of the stars were clear.  I could see the glow of the lights of the city of Belleville to the south of us.

Then went inside to get his binoculars.  When he came out and viewed the object with the binoculars he noticed its unusual shape. &quot;I determined that it was shaped like a snow angel with a pointed head, that is it was an elongated object with four fan-like projections at its sides.  The pointed head had a blinking light.  As it approached its colour changed to white.&quot;  We then called our son out to view this object in the sky.  He confirmed the same shape that we had both observed. It was moving from west to east and heading right over our house.  All three of us viewed this object coming towards the house and its shape and size.  It seemed to be  a glowing cloud with a flashing light.  The &apos;angel&apos; shape was glowing and you could see stars through it.  However at the &apos;pointed&apos; end you could not see stars through it.  We also noted 5-6 aircraft all heading the same direction around the object.  Some did appear to be circling the object.  The object was considerably larger than any of these planes. Approximately 9:15pm-9:20pm, the objects light stopped blinking.  But, the cloud &apos;angel&apos; continued to move towards our house (easterly). At this point (approx 9:25pm) Gordon went back into the house.  My son and I stayed out to watch this object.  It was now almost directly over the house.  I had the binoculars and watched as a bright circular orangey-yellow object flew out of the cloud.  This object was about the size of 1/4 of the full moon.  The object headed directly north at a much faster speed than the cloud had been moving.  The object appeared to be about 1/8 the size of the full moon when it reached the stars that make up the Big Dipper. It reached that position in the sky in about 30 seconds.  The object then turned 90 degrees and headed back west.  It disappeared moments later.  The cloud disappeared within 5 minutes of the object leaving it. All planes then seemed to have left the vicinity when we looked for them again after the object disappeared. All the ones we had observed around this object that is. It should be noted here that at no time did we hear any noise from this object.  We could hear and see the planes, but, not this other object in the sky.

Had no sound, didn&apos;t exactly land in my sight, but I&apos;m pretty sure it did!We were driving between Holopaw and Melbourne, on 192. It was a beautiful, bright, sunny Sunday, my husband, said &quot;I see a UFO&quot;, I said, &quot;Where?&quot;, as I was scanning the sky. And there it was, a ball, looked like a pewter ball, falling gently down from the sky. As it was falling, the lower part was beginning to flatten out slowly. Out of the top, it looked like it could have been some sort of antenna, but it was a different material than the rest, a white grainy hard material. As it was lowering closer to the earth, it was wobbling gently, and at the same time, constantly changing shape. The antennae, or whatever, was coming out of a tufted material from the top.  And at the same time, the color of the whole craft is changing to a bright silver, shining and glinting in the sun, and perfect, still revolving, no imperfections, no lines or marks. By now, the bottom is completely flat, perfectly flat, and out of the top, the antennae, has changed to show 3 perfectly round, large windows, or glass, which showed the beautiful, blue sky, through them. I was scrutinizing, to see if any being was looking from the window or glass. But saw no living being only this perfect object. By this time, it was perfectly perpendicular to the ground. It was about a couple of feet from landing when it stopped, in mid-air, and whisked off to the left, still ground level, white sand was blown from under the craft, and we were moved from the sight. Looking back from the front seat of the car, I saw a white gate to the left of the craft which opened fast. It seemed to have been made of the same white, grainy material that the &quot;antennae&quot; had been made of, before the transmutation. Now, looking at the road ahead, leaving this sight, the road looked like it was going to a perfect point ahead. After seeing this spectacular occurrence, we were both wordless and in awe, and I thought, this was the last day of life on earth. I said to my hubby, that maybe we should report this to the police to alert who knows who about this for the safety of the world, but he said we would be locked up, for sure.

There seem to be colored lights on it; red and white predominate; sometimes orange and green appearas well.

For the past month or so, it has been in the low north-northeast sky.  Several of us go outside to look at it regularly.  I have been wanting to report this for some time, because I find it fascinating; but I guess I felt foolish and tried to rationalize it as a balloon or a satellite, even though I know it is not.

I was driving west just passing Brookpark at Ridge Rd. and saw the triangle in a banking-type manuever. It was quite clearly backdropped against the sky, and I saw the VERY bright lights at each point with a subdued somewhat pulsating red light in the center. It was approximately 10 to 15 degrees above my straight-ahead line-of-sight and almost directly in line with my car, and seemingly only a couple miles up. There were more than a few vehicles also traveling around me, but I was too fixated on the craft to notice whether anybody else was also observing it. It banked to the south and traveled at a relatively slow rate, while I was able to keep watching it out the window. It was a starless night, at least in that location due to light pollution, but I could still make out the low, thin profile and the lighting beneath it. As I was still viewing it, I passed a tree line at the same elevation obscuring the view, and as I cleared the tree line, it was no longer visible. I have seen the Triangle type before in the late 80s on my way home to Connecticut, where it was amazingly low over the highway traveling at an exceedingly slow speed. The entire highway was apparently watching it as well, as we were creeping along and there was no place to pull over for the people stopped on the side of the highway.

I have lived from europe to asia and fought in the VietNam as a marine for two years. I have flown on several different aicrafts and seen many things, but the phenomena I witnessed that morning on Aug.2,1996 is nothing I have ever expierenced before.It all began when I received a doctors appointment for my dad at the VA medical center, Indianapolis on Aug.2,1996 12:45AM.  I followed their directions on how to get there, as I have not been there for several years.  I was travling south on I-69 approaching the Fishers exit when I observed a dark grayish object about 1/4 mi. to the west.  I backed off the cruise to about 60 mph and I thought it was a blimp, like ones that are used when a new business opens.  I thought perhaps the wind might blow it to its side so I could read what it might say.That&apos;s when I noticed that it wasn&apos;t tethered at either end and it was lumpy and seemed to wobble.  I then realized what it was doing. It was doing,it was raising itself up verticle from a fixed horizontal position in the sky, (Like raising a dirty dime up on a table with a magnet,and leaving it balanced on top. Once it was on top it immediately began to glow white inside, (Like a dim light bulb becoming brighter for a fraction of a second and then dimmed again or pulsed). When it did this I could see inside and there was a dark grayish matter at the bottom, (It was offset to the right of center).  As soon as the whitenss was its brightess it moved to the left (South) in a perfectly straight line about a 1000 ft.I thought it was going into the cloud to hide, but it didnt,it went in front of the cloud. Thats !! when I could better judge its size and distance.It was approximately 250 in diameter,it was about 50 ft. above cloud ceiling, and approximately 1-1/2 to 2 miles west of my position. When it was moving in front of the cloud I immediately noticed the left side of this perfectly circular object was disappearing (There was a slit an opening in the sky in front of the cloud)it continued into the opening until it completely disappeared. While I observe this event I felt time slow way down, almost to a point that it stopped. It felt like driving into molasses and being hit with novacaine.  I know this happened because I began to worry, (I have not worried like that since the last firefight I fought on football island in VietNam in 1969). I began to worry because I could not turn my head, but I still nad my peripheral vision and the Fishers overpass was there and we were going to hit its coluums underneath.Thats when the object completly entered the opening and disappeared and time resumed to normal and I had control again.I said outloud &quot;Hell lets do that again&quot; and it didnt even wake my dad who slept through the whole 8 to 10 seconds of the event.I turned the radio on to hear the news,but nothing was reported, not even later on the t.v. evening news. The next day Aug.3,1996 I read a article in the Indianapolis Star Newspaper that the National Weather Services Doppler Radar Station at Indianapolis had detected unusal rings on their screens the previous day and reported they reported to the news media that they didnt know what would cause such a phenomena, but they did received two reports of birds taking flight all at the same time together.On Aug.5,1996 I called the NWS station at Indy and reported to two meterologist what I had witnessed that morning.I answered their questions and we decided to meet and view the rings on the radar screen.When saw the rings I said &quot; Thats not birds&quot;, and the meterologist stated &quot; No thier not, we know that now&quot;. I went home and never discussed the event again, except with a meterologist at the North Webster Station. This station was constructed about a year later about 23 mi. from my home. Its called NEXRAD for next generation doppler radar because it is linked with all other dopplers to one main office in one location. The reason I choose to speak about it is because I spoke with a gentleman who is a pilot and he told me about an event when he flew into an opening some 30 yrs. ago.We both believe that our events are directly related and we are only seeking scientific explanations.The one thing I do know is that it left its calling card! and the next time this pattern of rings first begins to develope we have about 3-1/2 hrs. before the softspot opens and it arrives and departs through the opening. I believe N.O.A.A. knows this and thats why hundreds of doppler radars are viewed at the same time at one main location.((NUFORC Note:  We assume the date is correct.

The terrain is sage brush, pockets of brush/aspen trees and rolling to sharp cliff hills and canyons.Our method of hunting is to leave the truck at 3:30 am and climb to near the top of a 1,000 ft. ridge and commence hunting at daybreak.On 10/14/04 we were about half way up the ridge at about 4-4:30 am in the dark, we stopped for a breather, sat down an looked across the canyon at the steep ridge on the other side, this ridge has sheer drop offs of volcanic rock, has no roads and in most places it is to steep to walk. The outline of the ridge top was visable in the night sky. We then observed a light just below the ridge top and soon another light a mile or so futher up the canyon also just below the same ridge top. We commented to each other how in the heck did someone get up there its impossible! The lights were about the size and color of a small headlight, soon the lights started to move much the same as a butterfly, up, down, 90 degree turns, the movements covered about a 400 yard area back and forth up and down. They changed from a yellow headlight color to a greenish color and occasionaly a redish tone, the light farther up the canyon sometimes would split into two lights and then come back together into one.We looked at them with our field glasses and it just made them look bigger but not different. We observed this for about 20 min. to a half hour, the light across the canyon went dim and then out, the light further up the canyon continued, going from one to two lights then it moved to the top of the ridge, turned very bright and larger and then went out. that was the last we saw of them. After daylight came we hunted till about noon and met up with our 35 year old hunting partner who hunted the upper end of the ridge we were on, after talking hunting for awhile, we mentioned did you see the lights on the far ridge, his comment was, what the h--- was that, as it turned out he observed the same thing we did except that due to his position he was not able to see the secound light at the head end of the canyon. As a note it should be mentioned that the lights did not give off a beam of any kind so as to shine on the ground, nor was there a beam of any kind going to them such as someone playing a joke with a laser or other device.((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))Dear Peter,This is getting more complicated all the time and the sad part is I don&apos;t have the time, however I can&apos;t seem to leave this alone until I have all the facts straight, correct and no stones unturned so that I may properly retire this incident in the archives of my mind.I will re-submit my original report or add this as a footnote, let me know which, and how to do it.There were actually four of us in our hunting party, one hunter did not see what the other three of us saw so I considered him irrelevant to our sighting and omitted him in the report.  The four hunter who was the last to leave his vehicle (10 m. behind) also had the longest distance to hike in the early darkness. He would be cutting across the ridge diagonally below where my partner and I had just come up from. He is also 35 years old and very physically fit. (two 35 year olds, a 61 and 63 year old). At the time us old-timers were taking a breather and noticed the strange  lights across the canyon, I noticed and remarked to my partner &quot; there is Ron&apos;s flashlight&quot; it was only on for a moment, then a few minutes later I noticed out of the corner of my eye his flashlight again. He was just about where I thought he would be in the dark morning. My partner never looked over on either occasion and he has since told me he was so keen on the lights across the canyon that he didn&apos;t bother looking. Normally we do not use a flashlight but generally carry one in case its needed. I guess something stuck in my subconscious about the look of his flashlight appearance as it was just a very small area of bunch grass/sage brush that lit up on the ground, and I didn&apos;t see the flashlight bulb itself, it all seemed pretty normal at the time because his body was probably blocking the flashlight bulb itself, but as I thought about it days later,I called him on the phone and I mentioned to him that I had seen his flashlight come on a couple of times that early morning. His answer to me was &quot; I didn&apos;t have one with me that morning&quot;. My only answer to this is that it was part of the strange light occurrence and the lights followed him up the ridge with enough distance behind him that he never saw them, he also stated that he never stopped and turned around as he had a long way to go before daylight.  He is a very serious non joking sort of young man that I have known most of his life, he has a degree in construction management and runs many large construction projects. I guess the part that raises the hair on my back is that it put the &quot;flashlight&quot; about 200 yards from my partner and I.I suppose you can now put me in with the crackpots, but I will always know what I sawas well as two of my hunting friends.61 year old (me) self employed owner of mfg. co. for 28 years63 year old self employed custom home builder most of his adult life35 year old new truck fleet salesman35 year old construction project manager( fish hatcheries, bridges, highway projects)Regards,((name deleted))p.s.

This really peaked his interest, so we stayed out for a while to see if there would be anymore of them.By now it is approximately 12:00-12:15.He spotted a formation of at least 30 of these craft,hard to determine number because so many and moving in a wave like formation.After this formation passed us silently moving Southeast, we noticed from the backside they didn&apos;t appear as bright.This formation moved in a wavelike pattern at a pretty good rate of speed.We noticed after about 15 seconds it blended in with some wispy clouds in the area.I stayed out for about another half an hour,but didn&apos;t see any more.", "4 equidistant unexplainable lights/spheres over Prescott Valley, AZI was only able to see one of them, but the other people in my car could see 3 others. At first we had thought they might be planes as we go to a flight school, and are very near an airport.  But because we are so familiar with airplanes something just didn&apos;t seem right, as the objects had no blinking lights.  Planes have two blinking lights on their wings (one green one red) and one on the tail. They appeared to be about 400-500ft in the air and about 35 degrees with respect to the ground.  They also appeared to be very small spherical objects.  The 4 equidistant objects were in a straight line which appeared to increase in altitude from left to right. They seemed to be moving with us.  It was very cloudy for AZ, and just before a storm.  There was also some lightning.  We had just left a movie and were on Glassford Hill Rd. Approaching HWY 89A when we first saw the lights. (At least that is what I would call them even thought they seem to have more of a substance and may have been metallic as the one I was watching seemed to change colors, which I reasoned to be because of the setting sun).  One of the people in the car (an Aerospace Engineering Major) saw them seem to disappear in to the clouds (which also lead us to believe that they were not airplanes).", "Shiny rotating cylinders flying over VegasA couple of co-workers and my self were having a smoke break on the fourth floor of our parking garage. The garage is open, and we were looking out into the open sky since there were no tall buildings obstructing our view. Then we noticed about 5 cylindrical objects grouped closely together, and were slowly coming our direction. The weird thing about them was that they looked metallic and shiny, occasionally sparkling. As well they were rotating quite quickly, but moving very slowly. One of the objects broke off from the group and moved slowly upwards and left this wispy white trail. It was a typical beutiful day in Vegas with no clouds, so there shouldn&apos;t have been any wispy anything. I sort of forgot about this for a while, but then I saw this TV show which showed these same objects, and said they were UFOs - the photo shown on the show was taken by a airline passenger flying over the pacific.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

After a few seconds we found ourselves both staring at the same place in the sky for a minute and commenting to each other it was a strange feeling about that one particlar spot that kept making us glance up to that point in the sky. I joked that there was probably a U.F.O up there that we couldn&apos;t see with our eyes, but could more or less sense. I got our camera and snapped a couple of pics. of the cloud bank and sure enough when I downloaded them to the compter something showed up, I&apos;m not saying I was right but there seemed to be a presence up there getting our attention.

She told us that she saw a UFO in the sky.  I was very skeptical when approaching.  I really did not expect to see anything.  However, there was clearly something to see in the sky to the West of our location. Our Daughter went in the house to find the binoculars and I went in to find the telescope and camera.  My Wife watched it while our Daughter and I went into the house.  When we came out, it was still there and was visible with the naked eye and very distinct when viewed through the binoculars.  I could not focus on it through the telescope nor could I find it in the viewfinder of my camera.  There did not seem to be enough light from the object to get it on the camera. The night sky was dark, but very clear.  The moon had not risen yet.  And there were no visible clouds in the sky.  Two airplanes were visible in the sky, but appeared to be flying lower than the object in the sky and the size of this object was much larger than the airplanes. The shape of the object, when viewed through the binoculars was like a cigar shape in the middle and 4 jetting protrusions curving away from the cigar like center.  Also, when looking through binoculars (7x50 power), the overall object looked to be gaseous in form.  However, it never lost its shape (I watched it for about 30 minutes).  The color was a gray to white, but of course this was about 8:45 pm and dark outside. The only other way I can describe the color was that it looked similar to viewing a comet, but of course the shape was not typical of a comet.  The tip of the object, on the cigar like center, had an intermittent flash that would occur about every 30 seconds.  This flash was not visible with the naked eye, only through binoculars.  The flash was like that of a dimly lit star, but as the object moved slowly across the sky (toward the East), the flash stayed at the point on the cigar portion of the object. When the object was almost directly overhead, it appeared to move further away (higher in the sky).  It became fainter and harder to see.  Even looking through the binoculars, it held its shape but became smaller and dimmer. At this point I went in the house.((NUFORC Note:  Result of earlier missile launch.

I am from Chicago, and live in a flight line for Midway airport in Chicago all my life, so I know planes, hellicopters, etc, from other things.  Plus, have spent the last 12 years in Special Forces in the Navy, so I know that too.  We were at the beach late, waiting for the time for my flight out of Ft. Lauderdale, just relaxing and spending time together before I had to leave at 01:30 hours.  We were laid back on one of the life guard tower platforms which are closed and on an angle, unlike those in Chicago, Cali, and other places, where there are stairs.  Anyway, we had not been drinking; she was just asking when I would make another trip back.  We were looking east across the ocean, talking and thinking, and that&apos;s when a single, orange light caught my eye in the distance.  I asked her, &quot;Is that a light house of some kind?&quot;  But it did not move at all like one would.  She looked and we stared at it, and she wondered as well.

It moved slowly and quietly towards us and to the south of us and then just went blank.  We looked at each other and laughed, almost dismissing it, until she looked north along the beach and we saw 5, yes five more of them just hanging there, north, off the ocean coast, and yes, the city was still alive, espcially since spring break for colleges in the country was just starting.  They too hung there, quiet, motionless, however, none shown direct light, only an ambient glow.  3 faded out!!!  Just there, then gone, and then approx. a mile or less away, one appeared and then the other.  No speed, no streaks, just there one moment and then gone.  We were freaked.  We walked up the beach a bit to see; each one looking at the other in quiet wonder and disbelief.  In 10 minutes they were all gone....no flashing lights, no tail rudder lights, no sounds.  Just there and then nothing.  We spent the next 45 minutes in travel, plus the next days via cell phone conversations asking each other, &quot;Did you see what I saw?&quot;  We both agreed that we did.  I am not crazy...don&apos;t do drugs, quite intelligent, and however I DO believe in other life out there (only a fool would think this would be made for just only us [hence a lot of wasted space]), but I cannot ignore what I saw.  This to me was a change, and when I would read other people&apos;s stories about sightings and think they were crazy, well, then I must be just as well.  Take it for what you want, but I was an aero-structural-mechanic in the miitary originally, and did the other thing later...I know aircraft, this was none we have, or anything else.

The top was an indescriminate shape, neither round, nor square, but has mass like a crumpled up bunch of aluminum foil.  The second part in the middle was square and segmented like 4 or 6 silver lady fingers.  There then was a silver line going down a hundred feet or so, and I couldn&apos;t see what was hanging on it but it was a small white dot. It hung in the air for around 10 minutes and then when I came outside from a store 5 minutes later it was completely gone.  If I had to say what it was my first impression would be a long distance travelling ballon, like the ones millionares use when they try to travel around the world.  But the top of the craft had no distinctive sphere shape and was not at all like that.  Perhaps it was a survelliance craft of some sort?

I went to look for a disposbale digital camera but they were expired.  I went to use my video camera but my battery was dead.   There was no noise associated with the lights, helicopters from the base are usually audible from where I live when flying at that approximate altitutde,  I came back every so often to check if the lights were still there, at approximately 4:10am they had either moved off into the distance or were gone as I did not seem them as clearly as I had when I first noticed them.   I had not been sleeping that night.  I also had trouble getting my dog in the house, because  he was sick from too much Thanksgiving Turkey, and was grazing on the grass in the backyard  and did&apos;nt want to come in, which is unusual in itself as he is normally onedient and comes when you call him.", "A bright flash of lightning the craft appeared while sitting in my missing daughters room, contemplating where she might be..;..the object appearer during a lightning flash while I was sitting in her empty room.the craft was silver ,triangular in shape and I believe it had 7 circular windows on the side. unknown alt., unknown size. the windows emninated a yellow light frwithin.

About a year to a year and a half ago while standing outside of my house, I happened to see from almost directly overhead a bright object, slightly brighter than a star crossing the sky at quite a pace. The light was almost constant but did seem to fade in and out as it passed. I&apos;ve been an avid aircraft enthusiast for many years and I can tell you this thing was moving.I estimate the altitude at between 80,000 and 100,000 ft OR HIGHER!. My reason for this estimate is the fact that this craft made virtually no sound and that I could see a contrail in dashes. It appeared that the craft was so high that its contrail was being illuminated by the SUN. I feel that this craft was right on the edge of the terminator from its location. The contrail seemed to have an even pulse. Also the aircraft was heading Due North (Not your typical satellite path). I could ascertain this from the fact that I can see the Big and Little dipper clearly from the intersection of streets I live on. I estimate the craft crossed approximately 30&deg; of sky in approx. 10 seconds. The craft did not waver or fluctuate in course. It flew perfectly straight to the North. The only reason I am making this statement now is to see if anyone else may have seen a sighting like this in the North East. I do not believe this craft to be of alien origin but I believe it could be the Aurora.((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not specifically state that to be the case.  Satellites generally do not leave streams of material behind them, and they do not cover 30 degrees of arc in 10 seconds.  If the object was, in fact, being illuminated by the Sun, it must have been very high.  PD))", "Bedroom invader, forced to flee.I am a UFO researcher, and have seen several UFOs myself.  However, this is not a UFO report as such, but a humanoid sighting instead.As I stated above, it was approx. 01:30 hrs. on a Fri. night in August.  I was in bed with my wife trying to go to sleep, having only been 5 or so minutes after turning out the light.  I was fully awake, I am a trained soldier, I know the difference, seeing as penalties are stiff if you fall asleep on watch.  I suddenly felt a presence on my right side,and heard some whispering to me, and looked over to see a grey.  At first I thought the whispering was my son, however upon answering, and looking to my right, I saw the entity.  I do not believe in the ETH, and being a christian I recognized it for the demon it was, and rebuked it in Jesus&apos; name and it immediately left.I realize that you don&apos;t believe this way, therefore you will most likely ignore this report.

More like a cats eye on its side.  In inner parts was a muted white color.  Like an illuminated jelly fish.  However, the most amazy part was the ring around it like you&apos;d see on Saturn.  The ring itself was very bright white.  Off in the distance I could see the moon and in comparisons this object was larger and much closer.  I pulled off the side of the road to watch it even more.  For a while it just seemed to hover.  Then it lowered somewhat in the sky and began to move north west.  As it moved away, very slowly, it turned and when it turned it changed shapes.  As if I was seeing it from a different angle.  There were other witnesses because the highway was busy and I&apos;m sure they had to see the same thing however no one pulled off the road like I had.  It was moving away from me so I decided to head on home but for at least another 10 miles or so I could see the thing in my rear view mirror.  Not as close of course as it had been when I first spotted it but it stayed there until I was out of sight.An Army Ammunition facility was near where this craft moved over and then turned north west.  The reason I know the proximity of this facility is that my husband works there.I have never witnessed seeing anything unusual in my 53 years.  Seeing this was VERY amazing!", "The object first appeared low in the WSW as a fuzzy &quot;star&quot; about as bright as Jupiter or Venus. Then I saw that it was elongated horizontally with dimmer blurs of light above and below the central bar of light, which through 7x binoculars showed as a two part bar. It was about 1/3 the size of the moon. The end of the bar to my left (SE) was more pointed and there was an occasional pinpoint flash of light just to the left of the point. The object rose slowly and when about 45 degrees up it seemed a bit over 1/2 the size of the moon and had more structure. It was like diffuse almost back to back curved parentheses crossed by the two part bar. It was travelling in a direction perpendicular to the bar. by the time it reached the zenith it was dimmer and to the naked eye was just a blur, though structure was still visible through binoculars.It moved slower than any satellite I have seen. It made no sound. the sky was very clear and full of stars, with just a few left-over cumulus clouds. Sunset was 19:27 and moonrise was 20:30, though the moon was behind a hill from here at the time of observing this object.

Mac OSX, Mozilla browser). 1. July 14 midnight Saw a dim satellite or other orbiting object travel from SW to NE overhead at typical satellite speed in a clear sky (clear for Toronto, that is). The only notable thing about this was that I couldn&apos;t match it to any entry on the Heavens-Above! website for satellite spotters. But it wouldn&apos;t surprise me if a lot of junk floating around up there isn&apos;t mentioned on that site. 2. July 14 0005 Saw another very dim &apos;satellite&apos; overhead travelling northward. Average satellite speed, but still in a clear sky and just vanished after a couple of seconds (going northwards so it wasn&apos;t entering Earth&apos;s shadow). For ten or fifteen seconds after that a small dim point of light, same brightness, seemed to pop up for an instant in the same general area, then popped up again in a slightly different part of the sky (i.e. less than the palm of an outstretched hand). This happened seven or eight times and reminded me of an optometrist&apos;s test for blind spots. The flashes of light were so faint I have to admit to the possibility that my eyes were deceiving me, although I definitely saw the moving object that started the sequence off. 3. July 14 0010 Saw a brilliant spot of light (Venus x 2 in magnitude) travel from NE to SW, covering about the 60 degrees of sky visible between buildings and trees in a fraction of a second, seemingly at the same altitude. Possibly just a meteor or re-entering space junk, but notable for the fact that it was just slow enough to be seen as a point of light rather than a streak and also for the fact that it didn&apos;t leave even the hint of a trail as one might expect for such a bright light. As I say, not particularly exciting but may correlate with information provided by others.", "Craft vanishes after crossing the path of an aeroplane.Whilst viewing a normal plane up high in the sky this object came into view, which at first appeard to be a plane but had no vapour streem, it crossed the path of the plane i was first observing then as a small cloud (which obscured my vision for about 5 seconds) had passed by, then the object vanished unexplainably.I have never reported a sighting before and this makes me feel a bit silly but i know what i saw - if it was a plane then it was no ordinary plane, it behaved like no other! the closest likeness i can relate it to is observing a satalite in the clear night sky and just as it passes over this thing dissapears, plus it was a clear sunny day with a blue sky and only a few clouds and this object was a bit larger than a satalite as i did not have to strain my eyes to see it.", "triangular object hovering over power lines.On the morning of October the 6th and 7th at 5:00 a triangular shaped pbject was seen hovering over the power lines on hwy 109 before you get into Lebanon.This object has 3 lights, 2 on the front and one at the back.

It was right after dinner, the sun had been down for an hour or two.  Through the living room picture window, I noticed a bright light hovering--actually descending slowly at about  70 degrees until it reached the horizon.  It seemed to light up the ocean below it and it glowed intensely.  Then another bright light appeared in the same place high up in the night sky and began to slide toward the first one. I called them to the attention of my family--who continued watching TV.  So I went outside, on the balcony, and was surprised at the brightness of the two lights (the picture windows had darkly tinted glass).  I looked at them and decided they were the perfect subject to test some new Kodacolor 400 ASA film I had just purchased.  I was into photography then and had a nice Minolta. I shot between eight and ten exposures bracketting around a second each.  I am attaching two I recently scanned. In a matter of half an hour there were five bright lights hovering over the horizon, as you can see in the top photograph. The little vertical lines under each light are the result of my moving the camera slightly during exposure.  The photo below, which may be the first one in the series, accurately reflects their &quot;shape&quot;. My father, mother, brother, sister and brother-in-law came out to see them.  We all wondered what they could be.  Helicopters?  The night was silent but for the murmur of the rolling waves.  My brother-in-law went to the piano and played the five first notes of the &quot;Close Encounters&quot; theme by John Williams. We saw the neighbors coming outside also and asked them what they thought the lights were. The lady said we should tune in the local TV news at eleven. &quot;They will have the answer,&quot; she said. In about 45 minutes the lights went back up into the sky.  One at a time, but faster than they came down.  We want inside to watch the news but they were not mentioned.  So I called the NBC station and they didn&apos;t know anything about any lights.  They suggested I should call  Tyndall Airforce Base--which I did; but no one there had an explanation for whatever it was that we saw. The next morning I asked everyone if I had dreamt the thing about the lights.  No, I hadn&apos;t.  But nobody really wanted to talk about it.  I kept insisting.  My father said: &quot;We&apos;re near the Air Force Base.  They test things all the time.&quot;  For a while I showed the photos to friends and told the story.  Then they were put away.  I just came across them again and scanned those two when I went looking for family photos for a web page project. I&apos;m sorry that the files are big, but if ever resolution mattered, it&apos;s in these cases,  no?  I also have the negatives which may contain more picture information.  Any one interested in this?  Any one knows what we saw?((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "It was very early morning and I was delivering papers.

Friday&apos;s restaurant in Freehold, NJ.  The restaurant is located on Route 9 South, just north of the Howell border and slightly south of Route 33.  I keep a journal where I noted having arrived home around 10 PM, and kept a receipt from the restaurant that shows the time we paid as 9:41 PM.  It is about a 15-20 minute ride home from that location, so the time this occurred is extremely accurate - between 9:45 and 9:50 PM. As we left the restaurant and proceeded southbound on Rt. 9, we noticed very strong headlights, very low in the sky and to the south of us, that appeared to be coming directly at us.  They were no more than 10 or 20 degrees above the horizon, and appeared to be slightly to the right (or to the west) of Rt. 9.  The lights were very bright, and we were at first concerned that a commercial airliner or two was heading right at us, because the height and angle of the lights suggested it.  As they got closer to us, we began to think they were from two or more helicopters.  Over a period of about 3 minutes or so, the lights continued to approach directly toward us as we crossed over into Howell. We were no more than about a mile or so into Howell, and sitting at a red traffic light with dozens of vehicles around us on both sides of the highway when the craft crossed directly above us.  They (or it) was probably 300-400 feet or so above us, and about the size of a large helicopter (troop transport size, I would guess).  All the other cars around us could see what was happening, and many opened their windows as we did to listen, or stick their heads out and get a better look.  My wife and I were stunned, since they (or it) was completely silent, and there was no downdraft or other phenomenon to suggest wings, rotors, or propellor/jet propulsion systems of any kind.  The forward speed seemed to be something you would expect from a slower moving helicopter (30-40 MPH?), and just as they got over us they turned 90 degrees (but not sharply, more like a drift) and headed to our west (paralleling Rt. 33, but a mile or two south of it). I don&apos;t know why, but I am hazy on what kind of shape it was, or if in fact it was one or two separate vehicles.  Part of that is the passage of time, and for some reason I didn&apos;t really note it in my journal, but it was also difficult for me since I was behind the wheel on a major highway and the lights being thrown off by this &quot;thing&quot; was blinding.  My wife only remembers this entire incident with the same level of detail as me. I know the exact date when this happened because of having read an article yesterday on MSNBC.com which discussed how sightings of &apos;flying black triangles&apos; are on the rise, and that they often appear over urban centers or major highways and make no effort to disguise themselves.  When I recalled what we saw, I put in some search terms on Google (something like &quot;UFO Howell Freehold New Jersey&quot;), and was brought to the NUFORC.org site.  When I scrolled down looking for reference to what I had seen, there was an entry describing the exact same thing at the exact same time from someone who was slightly further north of us.  The description of everything matched exactly, including the flight path taken by the object(s).  It was a perfectly clear, cold night as described by that writer. When I looked back in my journal to that date, there it was!  I also ran a search of the archives for the Asbury Park Press, which is the major daily newspaper in the area, and the one and only paper that would probably have reported it if anyone contacted them.  Nothing came up in that search. I am astounded that literally hundreds of people were out that night and saw all of this from a major highway, and it was not widely reported that I know of.  The reason I don&apos;t remember every detail, or didn&apos;t freak out about it was that we are used to air traffic over our house all the time from the many military bases in the area, and we just assumed we were seeing something that was out for a test flight and wasn&apos;t really supposed to be seen so up-close by the general public. I have an engineering background and work for the State, so I could appreciate that what I was seeing was some new technology I had never seen before, but automatically assumed it was military in nature.  It never occurred to me that so many other similar incidents had been reported by so many other people, including law enforcement types, etc.  Either I saw something otherwordly (which never really crossed my mind that night), or had seen evidence of some military technology which was far-beyond anything I had heard of before.  What doesn&apos;t make sense at all, is that the &apos;pilots&apos; seemed to be doing everything in their power to be noticed rather than remain covert in any way.  I would love to talk to other drivers who saw this that night, and find out what their impressions were, or what else they might have seen in terms of origin or destination.  Someone else also reported it in Pennsauken, New Jersey about 20 minutes earlier and that is about 40 miles to the southwest, so it must have been moving pretty quickly if it was the same vehicle(s) that night. I feel privileged to have witnessed this event, and wish I could find out more about it!", "Triangle UFO with red and white lights over Phoenix AZWe were driving on 60w going to 10w to 17n in downtown Phoenix to our hotel room.

There was no noise it was silent. It appeared to be hoving or moving at a real slow pace. There were 2 airplanes flying around the craft appearing to inspect the huge UFO. The planes looked like ants compared the huge craft. Because we were driving on the highway, we lost sight of it as we drove to 17 north to exit at dunlap ave in Phoenix az. Traffic on the highway appeared to take notice too as we slowed down to 55mph. A police car was next to us observing the UFO with us.

I can&apos;t be positive about the shape except that it was a lot longer than it was wide. It had 3 red marker lights in the shape of a funny triangle. It must have been about 300 yards long @ least.

WE are a mile outside the Rock Hill, SC city limits.It was clear and there were many stars visible. Toward the S-SE, I saw a faint blink of a light high in the sky. I watched &amp; 10 seconds later, saw it again. There was no sound. I looked through my binoculars &amp; told my husband to look in that direction &amp; saw the blink again. Through the binoculars I could only see the light blink. I could not see any outline of an object. Several commercial airplanes flying at high altitude flew over as we watched. The flash seemed to be much higher than these. I switched to my monocular nightscope &amp; continued watching the flash, which came every 10 seconds. Through the nightscope, I was able to see many more stars &amp; got a fix on the flash&apos;s position based on 2 stars close by. The light moved slightly to the East, stopped, moved to the west, then north. It made several more moves, then moved due east &amp; out of the area with the 2 stars. It was soon out of view because of trees &amp; my roofline. A minute later we saw with the naked eye, a dim object moving south to north along the same area of sky. It moved out of sight. Another couple of minutes later we saw a similar object moving north to south on the opposite path. I watched it with the nightscope &amp; it suddenly flared up very brightly &amp; then dimmed until I could hardly see it. It moved out of sight. These 2 objects appeared to be satelites, except for the flare-up. After that, we observed 3 meteors in that same area. (The Orionids are visible now) I have watched every night since &amp; have not see it again. The next day a high altitude plane made many Y-shaped contrails across the sky. I actually watched as it cut off the contrail to connect the Y. This happened for 2 days in a row. I don&apos;t know if there is a conection or not.Our Bio info is as follows: I am a 47 yr old SCUBA Instructor. I also was in Civil Air Patrol while in high school &amp; earned my observer wings. I have flown in many types of aircraft &amp; spent a lot of time on Air Force bases. I have lived under the flight path of Charlotte Douglas International airport for 14 yrs. I saw my first UFO with my family when I was around 10 yrs old. My husband is a corporate exec in the IT field. He is very analytical &amp; tries to reason through sightings like this, but was truly stumped &amp; a little un-nerved by this.((AMENDMENT TO ORIGINAL REPORT))ammendment to previous report on 10/22/04This is an ammendment to my previous report dated 10/22/04. I got the times mixed up on the 2 objects that were a few minutes apart going in opposite directions. They were right after dark on Oct 15th. The object that blinked every 10 seconds was between 10 &amp; 10:30 PM &amp; there were commercial aircraft flying in the same area of sky during the sighting but the object appeared to be much higher in the sky. After reading up on satelites, I believe the 2 objects were satelites, with the one that flared being an irridium flare. The 3rd object, however, has me stumped.((END))", "Colored lights near Brandenburg KentuckyOn the night of September 10th at around 22:45-23:00hrs my wife and I were on our back deck in Vine Grove Kentucky, enjoying our hot tub and looking at the stars with our oldest son when I noticed a bright colored light to the west north-west.  My son got our telescope out to get a better look, the object was definately closer than we first thought, maybe 20-30 miles which I know is very difficult to judge at night. The light continued to change color probably twice a second from red to green to light yellow to light blue and repeated.  The light was stationary in comparison to our deck, the treeline, and the stars for 10 minutes or more, then it began to slowely move to the north and west and was visibly moving in comparison to the surrounding terrain and stars in the sky. We were able to view this for another 10-12 minutes as it moved north west until it was obscured by the neighbors trees. It was about twenty degrees or so above the horizon and was brighter than any surrounding stars in the western sky. The light never pulsed or faded, it remained brightly illuminated but continued to changed color as previously described which is what caught my attention and thought was so odd. I&apos;m a private pilot and airplane owner with close to 500 hours logged in the last two years approximately 50-75 hours at night.  I am familiar with GA and commercial aircraft anti-collision markings at night as viewed from the ground and while in the air.  I have also been on active military duty for the past 18 years and am familiar with military aircraft markings and operations.  I have to say this was deffinately not marked like any civil or military aircraft that I&apos;m aware of to date. I would have placed its location or direction of movement near Brandenburg Kentucky or perhaps slightly to the south west. The weather conditions were clear with a slight haze and no moon. I called Louisville tower watch supervisor to see if they had any aircraft in that direction on radar, they did not.  I also called Godman Flight Operations (Ft. Knox) to see if we had any military activity to the west of post, again the answer was negative, though he did say that the Brandenburg 911 office called the previous week asking the same question due to some calls they recieved from residents complaining of bright lights in the sky. (No further information was available).  I have no idea what we saw, but I know that planets don&apos;t remain stationary, brightly change color, then transition across the sky from south to north west against a stationary background.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and he sounded quite credible to us.  He is a retired member of the military.  We suspect that he may have been witnessing the very bright star that currently is in the western sky, which gives off a very prominent chromatic display, although that is just a guess.

Outside, directly overhead in a daylit, clear blue sky was an oval shaped object, silver in color, very high up. I&apos;m not sure exactly but it seemed to be lower than jets fly but a lot higher that small planes are seen. It made no sound and did not move in a horizontal plane. It had a large white light in it&apos;s center with four smaller colored lights around it. The white light would come on and off very slowly, once every few seconds. While the white light was off a colored light would come on and then turn off as the white light came back on. The colored lights came on in a repeating sequence around the center light. We watched it for about 30 minutes and saw that it got somewhat larger and then smaller as if it were moving slowly up and down but never side to side. We went into the house for a few minutes and when we came back out it was gone.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The lake was called Hay Lake.  Near Whitney ON(South Algonquin District)  We had arrived there that night. Around 10 - 11pm, we had decided to go out to the lake side to start a fire and stare at the stars.  We never lite the fire. The sky was crystal clear.  We could see all stars. The hill sides across the water were definitely easy to see reflecting off a moonlite lake.  We walked down to the water line from our cottage around 9:30- 10-ish.  When we had both noticed that a red-ish and oval shape was hovering object above the land across the lake and near what appeared to be &quot;Lower Hay Lake&quot;.  This thing moved in a weird way from right to left and up and down. Best description agreed by us both..........- Oval-ish and round looking.- It&apos;s body seemed to be glowing different colors from red to orange and yellow in a pretty smooth but fast (changing) pattern.- Separate from the body&rsquo;s changing colors, was a noticable light that seemed to be shining below and moving around like a search light looking towards the ground and land around it.  ((name deleted)) described it as flickering a white light.- Movements were odd.  Mostly in one place but hovering in a way that no man made craft could ever do.-  It was the largest thing in the sky other than the moon.  Like a dime and the moon was a Silver Dollar. This thing did its dance in the sky for what seemed to be 15 - 20 mins.  We (((name deleted)) and I) debated over what &quot;it&quot; could have possibly been.  In reality over 5 solid min&apos;s guaranteed, and I am now here reporting this in hopes that someone else might have seen something there that night aswell.  I will never forget it.  I am stumped and at a lose to explain it. Listen, I am a Software Executive and my wife is a Pilates Instructor.  We are not crazy, nor are we big sci-fi movie buffs.  We honestly saw something that spooked us enough, to not want a fire put on. Our logic was that since its completely secluded up at the cottage lake, if we could see this thing clear as day, than it could easily see us if we had we put a fire on, no problem.  So hell no to the fire.", "Slow moving, bright light, with no flashing lights.I always try to do some sky-watching on weekends, and on this night, there was the usual air traffic in and outbound to the Salt Lake City airport. I did witness one satellite heading from north to south, but it was kind of faint, so I did&apos;nt pay much attention to it. After about a half hour after that, I decided to call it a night, but, as I was about to head indoors, I looked up one more time, and caught site of a single light heading from the south to the north. This light was about 5x brighter than that of the satellite, and quite a bit nearer to me, I would say at about 25-30,000 ft. I know it was not an airliner, as there were no flashing or strobe lights seen. I witness a lot of aircraft in this area, as I live almost right under the local AFB and SLC Int&apos;l flight paths.

We are at 171st and 94th Ave. From our view they appeared one above the other with a third light further south. They slowly moved to form a perfect diagonal line, then one by one they just disappeared. We watched for about 20 - 30 minutes. Then, a few minutes later we saw one red light reappear and this time it only lasted a minute or so, then disappeared. Have read other reports and see many descriptions of the lights forming a triangle. I would guess these sitings are more directly underneath the lights than we were. The whole time they pulsated - getting brighter and softer. With binoculars they looked like lights with rays coming off the top and sides but that could be due to the binoculars.

My son pointed out a bright light in the sky. It looked like an airplane at first; a very bright one. Then we saw an airplane pass under; two very different things. I thought it might be a satellite burning out through the atmosphere. It had a tail with a bright end.  It sloped up from bottom left to top right. As dusk came closer, the tail continued to grow.  It kept the same position in the sky; left and right, that is.  The tail then split into two distinct trails. The only way to attempt to describe the length was if you extend your arm all the way; the tail was about one inch long; way up in the sky.  Other cars were watching the same thing.  We could see them looking up, too.  As night fell, it disappeared.  I am not into UFOs or anything.

PD))", "Object   with crescent-shaped &apos;nose&apos; flew in direction of the opened side  (i.e. with pointed ends of crescent leading)While sitting in my car in a parking lot in downtown Lawrence I happened to notice an unusual aircraft heading in a north easterly direction.  My training is in cognitive psychology and I no doubt lack the background and vocabulary to describe this object in precise terms, so please bear with me.  Fortunately, my training and background  did provide me with the good sense to sketch the object immediately after seeing it. The overall shape of the object was roughly similar to that of a crescent wrench. The end-portions were like different sized semi-circles, with the one at the nose being smaller and perhaps less &apos;closed&apos; than the one aft.  The portion connecting the two crescents, or the &apos;handle-part&apos; to continue the crescent-wrench metaphor, was oblong--perhaps something like a cigar, the extreme aft portion of which extended slightly into the inside of the crescent and was rounded. The end &apos;points&apos; of the aft crescent seemed to have rounded objects attached or were perhaps rounded themselves as if there were engines (?) or something at those points.   I cannot estimate speed or altitude reliably.  I might hazard to guess that it was roughly the same size as a commercial jet.  It appeared to be a dull black or dark-grey colored-- not the shiny metalic surface of commercial jets.  It did seem to have a noise of some sort, but it wasn&apos;t very loud and I did not notice any visible exhaust or vapor; however, I don&apos;t recall now if the sky were overcast or not, which perhaps could mask a vapor trail (?).   If it were, it must have been below any significant amount of haze or cloud vapor because I could see it clearly.  Although it was 6:22 pm, it was still early enough to be seen easily.  I did not notice any lights.  The object moved outside of my view after a few seconds (10-15?) due to buildings around me. What struck me as odd, was that the semi-circle or crescent on the front was opened in the direction of travel, i.e. the &apos;points,&apos; if you will, of the semi-circle on the front of the &apos;fuselage(?),&apos;  pointed in the direction of travel. Perhaps this is not unusual in aviation today, but it is counter-intuitive to the casual observer. I should also note that Lawrence is about 50 miles or so south/south west of Kansas City Internationl (MCI) airport.  We are also about 100 miles east  of Ft. Riley, a military base. I assume that this is some kind of new military plane or something, but  the fact that no one else I showed my sketch to (non-military, non-aviation folks such as as myself) had ever seen one made me think I should report it.  I also did a google search and was interested in the account of the engineer from Huntsville, AL who posted on your site in June of 2003.  I was very interested in comparing my sketch to his if what I describe here is not a currently identifiable aircraft.", "white, caterpillar contrails over Los Angeles CountyI witnessed white contrails in the eastern part of the sky shortly before sundown.

It was around 2:45 - 3:00 AM when the event took place. I had recently come home from a friend&apos;s house around 2:30 AM, after playing guitar and drinking coffee. Everyone at my house was in bed sleeping and I was all by myself. I realized that there was a storm brewing up in the sky, and being an avid storm watcher, I decided to stay up even later in hopes of seeing a few good bolts of lightning. I sat on my front porch watching for about 10 minutes and there wasn&apos;t much lightning except for one miniscule bolt. The sky looked as though it was full of energy. Greenish grey clouds were to my left and pinkish grey clouds to my right; the sky was completely overcast with no stars.  I sat there longer hoping the best was yet to come for the thunderstorm. Wihtin another minute or two, out of nowhere, a tremendous bolt of lightning shot down from the sky, one of the biggest I think I&apos;ve ever seen, lighting up everything around me for a split second. Deafening thunder crashed across the sky almost immediately after the lightning struck down probably only a couple of KMs south of my porch, and south of the town. I sat on the porch very excitedly and didn&apos;t take my eyes off the sky. Within a minute or two of the lightning, something else caught my attention in the sky. In my periphereal vison I spotted what first appeared to be a couple of shooting stars, falling into my view from behind the roof of the porch. As I looked on, I was able to focus on the falling objects as they suddenly started to slow down to a near halt. I quickly realized that I wasn&apos;t quite looking at shooting stars anymore, I was looking at two orange, horizontal ovals, both with noticeable dark oval rings that contained more orange within. The orange was dull and dark looking, as the objects appeared to be flying through the cloud cover. After the objects slowed down from falling straight down into view, they began to change direction at impressive speeds and impossible angles. At this point though, I couldn&apos;t quite tell if I was looking at two separate objects or just one. Both ovals flew perfectly side by side and in sync and the long sides of the ovals always stayed horizontal, even when making hairpin turns. After a couple of impressive turns, the ovals both made a sudden turn at a crazy angle and started to head Eastward to where the lightning had bolted down. As the ovals raced accross the sky, they drifted apart from one another and I  knew then for sure that I was watching 2 separate craft. After splitting up, one changed direction mid way and started to travel upward, while the other continued on an angle accross the sky and upward. As the one went straight up, the other climbed to a higher altitude on an angle and quickly made a sharp inverted angle turn back towards his companion (West). Just like they had it timed to the milisecond, the two objects intecepted one another and the object flying upward made a 90 degree turn on a dime and at the exact moment it intercepted its friend. Both objects then continued back in tandem, West accross the sky at very quick speeds and made one last turn-on-a-dime, zig-zag pattern turn before they decided it was time to bolt back North over the top of my house. The objects flew away at an fast speed and in a straight line. Before they disappeared the objects made a very loud, very shrill, hawk-like squeal, immediately after which, they picked up immense speed. Other than this squeal noise, the objects made no other noises whatsoever. The objects maintained the same colour and shape and didn&apos;t have any blinking lights. They flew like nothing I&apos;ve ever seen before. The objects appeared very shortly after the lightning had struck and seemed to fly around the perimiter of appriximately where it had struck. Not to mention the energy emitted from a bolt of lightning as big as I saw would surely be able to attract something&apos;s attention from miles away. The event lasted approximately 30 - 45 seconds. All details and drawings are as I documented directly after event took place, as I couldn&apos;t sleep too well after that.((NUFORC Note:  Please see the illustration provided by the witness on our homepage.

We had aligned our telescopes and were initially looking at the milky way with naked eyes.  I was looking nearly straight up into the constellation of Cygnus when I noticed a flashing object. It first appeared like a twinkling star, but I saw that none of the adjacent stars were twinkling.  I kept watching and distinctly saw a flashing/strobing object at extreme altitude and not changing its position.  I told my two friends and they also saw the light.  I got my 10x50 binoculars for a closer inspection.  It appeared to be a blue-white square object that flashed on and off.  It was probably reflecting sunlight and it was flapping back and forth like a stiff flag in the wind.  I then tried to observe it in my 8 inch telescope, but was unable to find it due to its intermittent nature.  I scanned for about 2 minutes with the telescope, then looked with naked eyes again and it was no longer visible.  Because it did not change location relative to background stars, the only thing it could have been is a geostationary satellite; however, I am not sure that these types of satellites have any significant motion to cause the somewhat aggressive flashing and flapping that I saw.((ADDENDUM #1 FROM WITNESS))Addendum to 9/17/04 reportThis is an addendum to my report to your database from yesterday.

We pulled into the parking lot of the bar and noticed 3 people standing in the parking lot starring up at the sky.  When we got out of the car we saw the 4 distinct red lights in the sky.  Three of them were in a triangle formation and one of them was out of formation.  They moved apart very slowly and each one eventually dimmed away until their were none.  My friend and I got back into the car and turned on a local talk radio station.  That is when we heard the announcement that the lights were F-16 afterburners lighting up.  This makes perfect sense because August 19-22 is the weekend of the Chicago Air and Water Show.  It&apos;s amazing to see how convincing the lights are.  We thought we were in the twilight zone... many people all standing around stopping what they are doing and looking up at the sky.

I am a former military policeman and though the items seemed like flares, I just watched News Channel 5 in Phoenix and they showed the videos of exactly what I saw. I know this occurred exactly at 1900 hrs because I looked at my watch and then timed the disappearance of each light from the right to left (north to south) until they were gone.", "Many fighter jets flying towards UFOthe object was cirlce and a bright light.

I am not sure I can even describe it.  It had rained all night and was still raining, so I drove her to school. It was pitch dark, rainy, and maybe a little cloudy (hard to tell in the dark).  We are driving down a coulee in the country on a county gravel road.  Right in the bottom of the coulee, suddenly these six elliptical &quot;lights&quot;, all in a row, about windshield height, appear out of nowhere.  I thought they were faintly yellow.  My daughter thought they were white---not really bright, sort of like headlights in the fog brightness, but different shape.  We both braced because we thought we were going to hit something.  Then, just as suddenly, they seemed to go over us and were gone briefly.  They reappeared one more time in the same way as we went up the hill and then we never saw them again.", "The object was white and in the shape of a V-- it was very large, and moved fast across the skyWhile watching the eclipse around 10:30 pm, there were a number of shooting stars (or what we thought were shooting stars) going from one side of the sky to the other. We were amazed by them, until we saw a bright white V shaped movement off in the distance.

First, I would like to say something about my background. I was 59 years old when I observed the UFO. I have a Masters degree and was a Professor of Art for two decades , before I resigned to operate an artist studio. I am now a commodities transporter, a professional driver. My wife and I are an owner/operator team of an express truck for a trucking company based in Florida. We deliver loads throughout the United States and Canada. Being a rational person, I have been unable to explain what I saw in this report, only that it was indeed unidentified. To the best of my knowledge, this incident occurred on October 14, 2002 after we had picked up a load in California.  This trip was to be an all night drive, so sometime around midnight, we turned off of Interstate 15 in Utah, and turned unto Interstate 70 eastbound, heading for Denver, Colorado. In the daytime, the first 50 miles of Interstate 70 is one of the most beautiful drives through a canyon on the interstate system, but at night, this can be one of the lonely stretches of highway in the US.Anyway, it was around 1 or 2 o&apos;clock in the morning, I was driving the truck through the Fishlake National Forest area, just west of Joseph, Utah. My wife was asleep in the sleeper, so I was driving in the cab by myself. I was winding my way through the canyon pass. All I could see was the canyon walls, as my headlights swept across them.Then I saw a green light about 50 yards down the road. My first thought was that it was a transformer, of some sort. When, suddenly, this green light passed over my truck. The green light appeared to be a horizontal triangle, with beveled edges. I couldn&apos;t see anything around the light. It was pitch black, and there were no other markings or lights. Since this happened so quickly, and due to the fact I was still going 55 miles an hour through a winding canyon pass at night, I could not stop the truck, to see where the object went after it passed over my truck. However there was one observation that I was able to make: the object was quite small, no wider than my truck. In other words, if this was a flying vehicle, it appeared to be big enough for only one, or two, occupants. Finally, I would like to mention that I have driven this stretch of interstate twice since then. Once in 2003, and once in 2004. Both trips occurred during the daylight hours. Neither time did I see anything on the highway that resembled what I saw on October 14, 2002. All I saw was a winding stretch of interstate and miles of beautiful canyon walls.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was facing east while resting my head back on the side of the hot tub. I was staring up at the starts as I do frequently. I noticed out of the corner of my right eye, something moving south to north from behind a tree. It looked just like medium bright star but moved steadily across the sky. It was not a passenger jet, it was way too high and had no blinking lights at all and was moving faster than planes at that altitude move. I see heavy air traffic on a regular basis and this didn&apos;t look like any of it. It reminded me of a waterbug gliding on water. I followed it across the sky, I&apos;d say it covered a distance equaling if I held my arms out above my head as far apart as I could. I thought maybe it was the ISS or something however a few weeks later I saw something even more strange. I was again in my hot tub watching the stars only I was facing north and the objects were moving from east to west. This time they looked the same, like medium bright stars but there were three of them. One obviously running and two that were pursuing the leader. The lead light was not moving in a straight steady line it was maneuvering and the pursuers were reacting. The lead pursuer was probably half the distance between the first and last object. They formed a triangular formation. These objects also reminded me of water bugs. I wondered if the objects may have been fighter jets since there are  plethora of military installations within 100 miles of my home. These craft had no blinking lights either, and they had to be at an extremely high altitude, it seems unlikely that I would be able to see jet afterburners that brightly.

There were four separate sightings of this light, which appeared high in the eastern sky very close to Saturn. Each sighting lasted approximately 5-10 seconds, and spanned a total period of about 10 minutes. The unusual light (or object) was similar in appearance to the red dot that is produced by a lazer pointer, but brighter and larger. It appeared to be rapidly falling in an &quot;s&quot; shaped pattern, almost as if it was weaving in and out of the clouds. However, this description is somewhat inaccurate since we were able to view it clearly through the heaviest parts of the morning mist/cloud cover, even when Saturn (and everything else) was temporarily obstructed from our view. I am not sure whether this could have been a reflection from some sort of dust particles, since the sun was just coming up on the horizon. However, I have been star gazing for a while and have never observed anything this unusual. If anyone else witnessed something similar, or has any idea what it could be, please post it, as I am totally mystified.", "Around 11:30 I was outside in my backyard when I noticed a very bright red light in the sky west of my location in North Phoenix at a medium to high altitude.  At first I thought it was a commercial jet, but it was not moving, just hanging in the sky-absolutely still and much to high and to bright to be a helicopter.  I awoke my girlfriend who came out to see it, she could not make any sense of it.  After a minute or so it began to pulse; going from bright red to a faint transparent red, then back to bright red.  The glow was crisp and had a pureness to it; there was no haze or distortion at all.  I went to get the phone to call a friend to take a look at it from his location when my girlfriend called me back, the light was gone, she said that it began to flicker rapidly and that it just disappeared with no trace of movement.

It was not moving, it was perfectly still.  I went inside to make a call to NUFORC and the object was gone when I came back.

Since we were close to an Air Force base at the time, I went into the station and asked the clerk to come outside and look.

I was out our home in the county line road between Coweta and Broken Arrow Oklahoma. I had stepped out the back door facing a pond behind our place and witnessed a very large winged animal/huminoid creature gliding about 20 yards high and about 30 yards away fromme. It was traveling at a very slow rate and was coming from the front area of our home across the norther part of our lawn moving west by northwest. My discription of this winged creature; long with a thin human shaped torso, moth or butterfly shaped wings extended but not moving or beating, rather gliding. It had a wide dark grey colored human-like face and peered diectly at me as it crossed the yard. It had very large dark eyes. It had I guessed at least a eight or nine foot wingspan. It apeared to be covered with a hairlike folical. It seemed to have a sort of high ridge or dorsal spinal rise behind the haed and wings. I guess it was extremly light-weight for its size.I tried to rationalize the was my imagination playing a trick on me and returned inside halfwittingly joking with my ex-wife telling her I just saw a &quot;Skilly&quot;.

She was going to leave and go visit her sister in Coweta about then and left out the same door. She returned a few minutes later claiming she came face to face with a nine foot tall creature with a red oilish skin and huge red glowing eyes. She was extremley shaken and histerically crying. I heard movement on our front porch after calming her down and finally getting her discription of this thing. I noticealso about a quarter mile across the county line road in front of our home a red light in the pasture. Looking through the screen I saw at first what I thought a police or fire truck lite. Looking closer through the screen I saw a broad silver flattened doom with a red blinking beacon directly center top. My ex was still horribly shaken and I started to go again out the back door possibly to confront this intruder. At that time I recieved a phone call. I answered and a voice sounding as if it was modulated on a radio frequency started speaking with me. I would tell me such as where I was born, where I had been, then in great detail alot of personal facts. The voice was also using what seemed an older type of Englich which I have seen written such as terms in &quot;three score and fourty et. It made some extremly weid prophetic statements. I became Irate and told whoever it was I would have them traced and arrested. I hung up and it rang again. I removed the plugin and set the phone with cord on the kitchen stove. We had our two children with us, a three yeasr old boy and two year old girl. I was becoming extremly concerned about our safety. A very heavy amonia smell filtered into our house causing my eyes to water heavily. At this time the phone rang again. I glanced and saw the phone still unhooked sitting on the stove. I told my ex-wife the we were going to get the kids between us and move directly to our car behind the house. I grabbed a big kitchen knife and we did as I instructed after I yelled loudly that I would butcher anyone or anything in my path trying to stop us on our way to the car. We saw nothing as we exited our home and got ourselves in the car. I drove to her mother house in Coweta. I returned the next day. No sign of anything, footprints, vandalism et.I really question why this happened to us. It was extremly freightening and I questioned my own sanity when I heard the phone ring after unplugging it.

While I watched the unmoving light, another light appeared to approach the hovering light from the south-east (left) at approximately 2 degrees above the tree line, at times passing behind the branches.  This light moved relatively fast and appeared to veer back off to the left before reaching the hovering light.  I&apos;m not sure if I saw red and green aircraft warning lights on the bottom of the moving light, as it dissappeared behind the trees and I was focusing mainly on the hovering light. I briefly walked away from the window to fully shut off the sink faucet in the bathroom across from my bedroom so as not to wake my parents up, and when I returned to the window the hovering light had appeared to have shifted to the left by a few degrees, although I could have been standing at a different portion of the window.

Oct 2nd. 3:23 - 3:30 pm. St. Louis, MO. Object hoovering in the sky with flashing light.I was walking the dogs with my lady friend when I just by chance glaced up into a clear blue sky when I noticed an object flying from what I would say was the North heading roughly south-southwest. I noticed it due to the massive light source it was putting out. At first I dismissed it as a reflection off a planes hull. I looked up at it again and noticed that the light was still flickering even though it was in motion. I know that when you see a reflection from an aircraft, its really only from that angle. As it continues to move the reflection should change until the craft no longer is at the angle for the light to reflect. As this object continued its path, it was still flickering a very bright light. Originally when I noticed the object, it was to the right of the sun and even after it passed and was now to the left there was still this very bright flashing light. This is the reason why I continued to watch. If it were a reflection from the sun, it would have long since past the point of reflection. Anyway, as I watched the object and since it was so small I would say that is was well above 40,000 feet, but the weird thing was that there was no con trail. I continued to watch it and as I did, it began to slow down. I would say that this object had crossed 2/3&apos;s of the sky when it came to a stop!. I could not beleive what I was seeing. My lady friend had seen it moving but continued walking on the trail and didnt see it stop as I had. I tried to find someone who could verify what I was seeing, but the only person around was about 100 yards away and he had his child with him so I didnt want him to think I was some nut. Anyway, I ran with the dog to catch my friend. There was a short distance where I could no longer see the object due to a wooded area. I wanted to catch her so that I would have a witness to the craft stopping in mid air. I caught up to her and had her hurry though the wooded area to the clearing so that we could both see it again and upon arriving at the clearing, I could no longer locate the object. There was still about 1 mile or so of trail that we had to walk and I looked in the sky to rest of the way. I cant help but to think that if I had stayed where I was originally at, I could have seen what happened to the object. I dont know if it just took off on the same course or flew further into the sky or what. I know that this sounds crazy and all, but that is what I saw.

The objects appeared to be round/possibly spherical with one edge that appeared dark or fuzzy at times, and red at others.  The objects also appeared to change shape from time to time.  We watched the objects for 5-10 minutes when they stopped, still in formation.  Immediately we noticed another small bright object heading from north to south in the general direction of the group.  This object moved much more rapidly than the first four when another object appeared behind this object moving faster still.  Just as the two were about to converge they both made abrupt, instantaneous turns in different directions, then looped, curved, and zig-zagged until both slowed and stopped momentarily.  At this time the initial group of four began to move again.  One object headed off rapidly and disappeared towards the northwest.  The other three objects moved together in a constantly changing formation toward the south.  At this time a bright blue object appeared directly overhead, and as we wathched this one, another reddish-white object appeared approximately 1-2 degrees east of it.  We then watched as 3 of the initial 4 objects disappeared to the south.  The red and blue objects headed off in different directions but we did not notice where as at this time several objects appeared in rapid succession heading east to west very rapidly.  One of these objects appeared to have a long, maybe .5 degree line of very small and very bright objects trailing, leading, and then circling the central object.  We witnessed one more object come in on the original path of the first group of 4 objects, travel a very erratic path and eventually disappear towards the northeast.  The weather was clear and sunny with a very light breeze.  The entire event spanned approximately 45 minutes.", "Many moving constallations  flash and disappear into the dark rift of milky way2 friends and i werefinnishing a walk through the desert in Spirit Sands near Carberry. One of us &quot;knew&quot; to look at the sky, and saw a light that appeared to track across the sky simmilar to a sattelite.  However, it was not moving at first.  After we paid attention to it, it began to shift.  First in a straight line, then beginning to slowly arc, gain speed, and then flashed and dissipeared into a dark spot in the sky. We speculated that it as the light of a sattelite solar pannel reflecting from the sun.  Dismissing its arc and suddden dissapearence untill a second (from a different part of the sky) began tracking to the same spot where the light had dissapeared.  Multiple other lights were seen behaving the same way eccelerating and dissapearing into the same dark spot in the sky.  It was at this moment we realized that the sark spot in the sky was the Dark Rift of the Milky Way.  the lights notibly the first one was &quot;hiding inside a constilation&quot; in the place of a star only it was a different radience than the others. this location is adjacent to Shilo, a military training area that was recently training soldiers abroad{example, hunderds of Germen troops} I find it not irregular to see lights in the sky especially outside the city&apos;s light pollution, however SENSING to look at one portion of the sky, get others attention and then after all people focus at this spot it began to MOVE.Our experince was unique but was also part of a UFO flap in the winnipeg area during the WEEK of reports Aug 8-15.

And 1 above the four, as the first 4 disappeared another single light appeared south of but at the same altitude as the previous lights.

The sky was crystal clear, with no cloud cover and the moon was not visible which made viewing the stars ideal. At around 10:30 PM EST, a very large triangular shaped object began to move very slowly above us, we estimate around 10,000 feet, but it was hard to tell, due to it&apos;s size and there was absolutely no sound coming from the craft. The object traveled over Moosehead Lake and as it shrunk from view just across the lake, it began to climb straight up, then it began to reverse direction in an arc like motion and head back in the opposite direction across the lake. There were 3 very large, glowing gold lights on the object that were stationary and no other lights or blinking lights were noticed. The object disappeared out of viewing range once it crossed the lake. This was the most unusual and large flying object any of us had ever witnessed. One of the witnesses flys helicopters and planes and is an expert in aviation and even he remarked that he&apos;d never seen anything like it and could not even guess what it might have been.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

It appeared to hover without any motion. I looked for blinking lights like on airplanes, but saw none. I was in Burnsville, MN looking at it in a southward sky.

Telescopic instruments would&apos;ve been helpful! =)", "I wasn&apos;t going to fill out a report at all but I have had 2 sightings of 2 different objects in 3 days! I was outside working at about 1:30 pm and I looked up to watch a commercial jet liner passing overhead when I spotted a glowing &quot;orb&quot; (sphere?) behind and above the jet. The object was glowing quite brightly. It was hard to judge altitude on it. the object was traveling north/northeast and it was moving at least 10 times faster than the commercial airliner which was headed due north. I heard no sound from the object but the jet that was flying over probably would have drown out any sound from it anyway. The object left no contrail and I saw no other lights on it except for the glow from the object itself. It flew a straight and level course until I lost sight of it.", "Three white hang glider shaped objects in clear blue sky flying in a circle, counter clockwise moving in and out of a tight formation.3 white hang glider shaped objects traveling in a circle, like a slightly tilted farris wheel. The objects moved in and out of a loose triangle to a very tight triangle formation. As the objects kept cirlcling counter clockwise, at the 12:00 position the furtherest 2 objects would completely dissapear, then as they reached the 10:00 position, they would reappear again. I don&apos;t know  if they could have been some kind of kite? If this had been at night or any place else I would have thought maybe they were advertising something, but there is NOTHING around to advertise. Also, for some reason, as I was intently watching these strange objects I never once mentioned to my husband what I was seeing. He may have noticed them, but if so, he isn&apos;t the type to admit it or talk about it. What I saw has been on my mind for over a month now so I decided to report it.  Also, because of the mountains and hills I couldn&apos;t tell if they were small objects close by, or large objects far away. Also difficult to tell if they were large and very high in the clear blue sky, or small and low. This was my first time in the Hat Creek, Lasson National park area, so maybe this is something common that I am not familiar with, I just don&apos;t know.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

The driver thought it was a satellite moving but suddenly it approached the car extremely fast and took position beside and above the car, perhaps 1-2 meters away. The object was the size of a small car and very bright and totally illuminated the car on the inside. The driver stepped on it and the object followed up to a speed of approx. 100 mph. When the car approached a few houses close to the road with street lighting, the object gained altitude - perhaps to 50-150 meters. About two kilometers later, the object suddenly turned left and crossed a fjord ca 4 kilometers wide, and took position above the drivers house. The driver arrived about 20 minutes later and the object was still above the house. Driver and passenger went inside and brushed their teeth, intending to go to sleep. As the object was still outside, the driver then went out and took some pictures with a digital camera. The object was bright and multicoloured. The photos are not particularly clear, probably because the shutter on the camera closed because of the bright light. However, some lights in a triangular shape can be made out on one of them. The driver in question is my wife&apos;s cousin and the passenger his girlfriend. Contact me if you are interested in contacting him or getting more info.", "chevron sighted off I95 north of Baltimore MDWhile driving southbound on I95 (rate of speed around 65 mph) about 10-15 minutes north of Baltimore I spotted on the left hand field of vision a formation of white lights in a chevron shape. the lights were bright but not exceptionally brilliant. From my vantage point in the drivers seat, the lights were approx 30 to 40 degrees above horizontal. They initially were above the tree line. It was a CLEAR and UNMISTAKEABLE formation of lights in a chevron pattern. I believe that there were four lights on each leg of the chevron. I judged the apparent size as subtending an angle approximate to the width of 3 fingers held together at arms length. After approx 15 seconds the chevron was blocked by roadside treeline and I lost sight of it. My recollection is that I noticed at the same time airplane lights in the same area of the sky.", "Possible Weather Balloon?Walking south approximately at sunset, a stationary object was seen in the south/southwestern sky. Unknown altitude, but seemed to not be of very high altitude. It appeared to be near or south of the vacinity of Albuquerque Sunport Airport, normal air traffic was witnessed as well. It was very bright, altough at first thought it may be a planet. However, after arriving home and watching from my window, it was becoming brighter. I went outside, saw a neighbor with camera and telescope. He saw it as well and took pictures. It appears as possible weather balloon, semi-roundish upsidedown cone shape, with series of cylindrical objects attached to sides and &quot;ropes&quot; hanging from it, holding something at an apex.

If I were looking at a car on the road, I would guess it was going about 60 mph.  The triangle shape was clear, but there was a hazy, soft fuzziness about the object. It did not make any sound.  The lights were not clear and sharp. There weren&apos;t any clouds in the sky. Several visible stars, but too much light in the city to see many.

It was the summer of 2001 and I lived in San Diego.  Once or twice a week I would come down to the Imperial Valley and hang out with mith my friends and family.  There is a Navy base there and an airport, so we&apos;re all used to seeing plains in the sky.  That summer though there seem to be this big influx of activity.  It would always occur between 10pm and 1:30am sometimes later.  We were big smokers and chatter bugs, so we&apos;d be out all night long smoking at chatting away.  My budy and I had seen our share of &quot;UFO&apos;s&quot; before; living near a Navy base.  Anyway, It all started one night when we happened to a small white light seemingly drop straight down into the sky off to the east of his house.  It stopped for a second and then shot off south and dissapeared.  Then another did the same thing only it appeared further south and shot off north.  Then the eastern sky was repeatedly being adorned with these small white lights dropping in and then shooting off.  Three, four, and five at a time, and in different directions.  We started getting all excited and I went in to grab my camcorder.  I pointed the camera at the occurance and hoped.  It was very dark and the lights seemed far away.  I also shot a plain, a helicopter, and a planet that was in the sky that night for brightness reference.  After about thirty mins or so the event died down.  I remember thinking to myself &quot;I wonder if they are directly above us too.&quot; I looked up and sure enough one drooped in right over my head and then shot away.  It was the last one we saw that night.  Apon later review of the tape everything showed up except for the stange lights.  There seemed to be an awful lot of static in the picture as well.  This dance of objects went on durring many of my trips.  Never quite as dramatic as the first night, but we came to regard it as &quot;The Show&quot;  We would show other of our friends when they&apos;s hang out with us.  Sometimes when coming down the mountains from San Diego I&apos;d be able to see them, and I&apos;d call my friend in the Imperial Valley.  We&apos;d both watch them from either side. Telling eachother what we were seeing as sometimes one of us would lose sight of it or them. The other major one we saw was very similar sounding to some that I&apos;ve read on this sight.  We were out one night waiting for &quot;The Show,&quot; and dissapointed we disided to go inside.  My friend even coaxed &quot;them&quot; by saying out load in a humoring tone &quot;We are going inside now!&quot;  And took large exagerated steps towards the door.  He then realized that he had to put out the trash.  As he rolled then trash container out to the street I looked back at him to see his jaw drop.  &quot;What?&quot; I asked.  &quot;Come here&quot; he said, &quot;look at this.&quot;  I walked slowly over to him, expecting that what-ever he had seen would be gone by the time I got there.  But to my surprise he pointed out a rather large seeming reddish orange glowing object moving extreemly slow and low off in the distance.  It appeared to be on the other (west) side of the city.  We followed it as it traveld north east.  It was strange, seeming to grow and shrink, or rather brighten and dim.  Being night time that&apos;s all I could gather of the shape.  It would even stop at times, and then continue.  It also would blink out and then reapear about 10 to 20 degrees further north east.  As it was now dirrectly north of us we gaged it to be somewhere between Imperial and El Centro.  It began flashing more quickly now, and seem to drop a couple glowing balls of light that seemed to float down like a flare or feather, waivering back and forth and getting dimmer the lower they went blacking out completely at 50-100 feet. It began blinking faster and faster and dopping more and objects until it just kind of went out looking like when you throw a cigarette out the window of a car and it hits the ground.  Just a bunch of light fading embers, then nothing. I&apos;m sure I wrote too much, but this is a collection of UFO sightings right?  I wish I had more specific dates for you.  I&apos;m going to check my old tapes, and see if I can figure it out. I was 19 at the time going to Comunnity college in San Diego, and managing three stores.  My friend was a pizza delivery boy 26 and going to Community college in Imperial.((NUFORC Note:  Dates are approximate.  PD))", "Triangle UFO? Check this out - NOSS Triad Satelite system - Naval Ocean Survailance SystemLooking for satellites, as I like to do and was lucky enough to see the Naval Array again.  This is 3 satelites that are strategically placed to remain in formation as they travel.  They are usually in the formation of an isosceles triangle.  They appear to have a light at each tip as each satelite reflects the sun, like all satelites do (Well, at least the normal ones the public knows about).  It moves slowly across the night sky and eventually passes out of view.  In my area it is usually moving from the NW to the SE.  We consider this a great thrill to see the Naval Array as it is something so different to see... 3 satelties moving in formation with no sound.  It is quite alarming to see for the first time because it really appears to be some kind of craft, BUT, you can still see the stars behind it as it passes by... so it seems as though the craft is invisible except for the lights (which are really the satelites themselves).  What appears to be a UFO is really 3 satelites traveling together in formation.  Very cool thing to see if you get the chance.  I have tried watching for it each night, to come up with some kind of schedule of when it passes over, but so far have not been able to document anything routine, it seems to be hit or miss.  Still a nice astronomical event to see and worth waiting for, and witness how our technology is advancing into the future.

As these craft glidded acros teh air above us, they seemed to be flying in a triangular formation. Each appeared to be the size of a full moon.

I know for a fact that this was no shooting star because i have seen many myself.  this was very fast and the way it changed colors and just dissapeared so quickly and the other thing was that it seemed to be close to me in distance.  being at night it may have been a few miles away.  it occured so fast that i couldnt see any shape but it had no sound to identify with.", "triangular shaped bright white object with flashing lights and one red light.Triangular shape that changed direction but did not move from the area.

It was so loud even the dog, who was hunting chipmunks under the railroad ties, looked up. I stepped out from the porch and looked north toward the sound. I saw, at a fairly low altitude, a long white shape-it could have been a plane with short wings. Just above it,picked out by glints from the sun, were two shiny, gold colored orbs. I wondered if somehow I might have seen a distortion of helicopter rotors, but they seemed to be orbs. The combination was soon lost to sight in the blue of the sky. It was not traveling very swiftly, but I guess the white made it easier to disappear in the sky.

Could also not really tell difference in the light with or without bino&apos;s except when it flamed/faded out.

The second sighting was 20 minutes later, it was much much higher up in the sky, we saw it in a boomerang shape, again no lights no sound, it just seemed like the city lights were making it visible and there was no top light due to the lunar eclipse. it seemed to have a dot on each wing. The third sighting was about 30 minutes after that and it was in a triangle shape, flew over our heads and then did this amazing maneuver in the sky, it turned while the dots rotated, a bit mind blowing to see an object do this. then again it faded into the night.", "high flying object in near earth orbitSeptember 09, 2004 My wife and I were out on our patio tonight in Racine, Wisconsin (about 20sm south of Milwaukee), at about 8:35pm.   A beautiful night here in Wisconsin.  I had spent the early morning installing solar patio lights, and my wife wanted me to come outside and view my handiwork first hand.  After viewing the great job I did installing the lights, she looked up at the clear sky and said...its beautiful, look at all the stars!..     I then noticed one object that was moving at a VERY high rate of speed.   Its altitude was very high.  I am a pilot with over 12,000 hours experience.   I know the characteristics of aircraft and how they behave.   This was no aircraft.  My wife and I both watched the object as it moved from WSW to ENE....and then it turned 90 degrees left (North) and maintained the same rate of speed. It made the turn------------- instantaneously.---    I mean like a 90 degree turn that you would draw on a piece of paper.  No aircraft that I know about can do that.  As a member of AMSAT,(www.amsat.org) I also know satellites and how they perform.   Satellites don&apos;t make 90 degree turns either.  There were no NAV lights or strobes, just a rectangular structure that was dimly lit...not a glow.   In fact when it went by, I pointed and showed my wife and said look honey a satellite...and then about 6 seconds later in the blink of an eye.....it turned 90 degrees North and disappeared from view within about 20 seconds.I am no stranger to the night sky.  I have built homemade telescopes and have enjoyed the stars and messier objects for at least 15 years.  The &quot;seeing&quot; or turbulence in the air was non existent as none of the stars appeared to &quot;flicker&quot;.  Our position in observing the object: We were facing North, looking up between 75 to 80 degrees towards zenith.  If I had to estimate the altitude, I would say..Low earth orbit, as for speed, I think it would have crossed from horizon to horizon in about 14 seconds.After the object made the 90 degree left turn, North, the object never decreased in Luminosity, but with distance in the atmosphere, the amount of &quot;air&quot; we were looking through, made the object shimmer.  So to try to make this description easier, My wife and I picked up the object on its trajectory at the 75-80 degrees from the zenith...and after its turn North, it shimmered out of view at about the 40-45 degree point from the horizon. Unrelated to this sighting, I have seen 2 other unexplained sightings.  One a black triangular object with white lights on each underside corner, in Plattsburgh, NY in 1993 on the shore of Lake Champlain, at an altitude of approximately 100.  Each of the white lights was drawn-- in and out-- towards the center in a circular fashion.  The lights did not propel downwards but just lit up&amp;.sort of like the lights on the old disco floors. Those lights were circular in dimension.    Since I was outside at 0230AM&amp;.hanging a discrete HF antenna (dipole) in the trees behind the apartments, as it approached there was no noise, and no moon. I became very frightened and ran back towards the apartment building approximately 200 feet away, through about 2.5 feet of snow. Plattsburgh, NY receives lots of snow.    As I got to the back entrance door&amp;the lights extinguished and the object moved North, at a very slow speed.   I did not know to check for missing time as I was unfamiliar with the term at the time. The other instance was when I was flying a between KSYR and KPLB (Syracuse and Plattsburgh, NY) also in 1993 at FL250.That object even turned its luminosity on and off, with our selecting our landing lights, on and off.  Boston Center even acknowledged, no traffic within 200 NM and NO night Aerial refueling in the Military Ops area just NE of Syracuse and up into the Adirondack mountains. (KC-135s with Getty call signs) So the captain and I never repeated the story to the company or anyone else.  But we found it to be very odd.  The Unidentified object left our 1&apos;oclock position at a high rate of speed toward our 6 oclock position.  I never saw a structure, but the light trailed away a rapid speed. Weather that night....We were on top of an overcast layer....no moon.  Anyway, I have had some interesting occurrences.  Thanks for listening.", "3 light tight formation, @10X speed of satalites,with changing formation.8:07 PM EST.Three lights that appeared to be three satalites moving in perfect formation, as if they were attached, at extremely hi speed:around ten times the rate of a visible satalite.

I glanced up and saw a fairly dim shape, like the wings of an old-style plane, rectangular and wide, moving overhead, but without a nose or a tail. The size was approximate to that of a plane flying over head, the hieght it would be when approaching a nearby airport, but it seemed MUCH higher than that. I couldn&apos;t hear an engine of any type, and it was moving FAST, over head and gone in the distance in under 15-20 seconds, disappearing into the haze on the horizon. It was moving east/south-east. I am in Woodland hills, and it was almost directly overhead, a bit to the north, and passed the length of the San Fernando Valley, then out over what I assume would be East L.A., maybe Glendale and then over San Bernardino. The color was a pale greenish-blue, but NOT glowing - a faint color.  The thing that set me off was that there were no running lights of any kind, no identifying shape. I always look up at the sky when I go out at night, to look at the stars, the moon, and when I saw this, I kept waiting for it to become recognizable, something I could explain. I still can&apos;t explain this. My gut reaction is that it was some very large orbital object, perhaps the international space station, but it seemed far to large for that. Please note that my sighting time is estimated at 2:37 am. It took me several minutes to look at a clock. The time could hve been anywhere from 2:35 to 2:40. I can be contacted if someone thinks this warrants more investigation.", "Bright green object races across the early morning horizon one week after 9/11.I had gotten off work at 3am,  I am a nurse, and was working at a local hospital. When I got home I found I had forgotten to leave a set of keys to the drug cabinet, that were in my pocket.  I changed clothes and headed back to the hospital.  As I was merging onto I-17 frwy, there were at least 3 to 5 other vehicles in close proximity to mine. When all of a sudden from the north west corner of the sky a bright green circular object quickly passed overhead in front of me headed towards the southeast. Being exactly one week from the 9/11 event, when this object first caught my attention, I thought that maybe it was a missile attack being directed at the city.  Apparently, the other drivers that saw it did too, because we all slammed on our brakes.  What I thought was strange about this thing was that it&apos;s color never changed in intensity, or faded like you might see with a meteor coming through the atmosphere.", "A craft hovers noiselessly over witnesses in 1965, in Southwest Iowa, is photographed by 2 photographers, photos stolen later.I have purposely kept this story to myself for 40 years, but remember it like it was yesterday.I was a teacher in a 3 town School District in Southwest Iowa. One day at school all the kids were talking about seeing a UFO that hovered over the gymnasium as the crowd came out from a game.  The same UFO later followed the away teams school bus and the bright light that shown on the bus forced it to pull over. Behind the bus were many parents cars and the chief of police of the away teams town. They were all witnesses.That same night, one of the cheerleaders and her boyfriend were chased by this low flying noiseless craft shining a bright light on them. On arriving at the girl&apos;s house, the girls family came out into the yard to see what the light was,, all of these people were witnesses.My friend and I were both teaching at this school, and decided to go out the following night and take our cameras and tripods and see if we could witness what everyone was talkin about. He and I were both very level headed people who did not drink and were born skeptics.We drove along a &quot;river road&quot; that was west of Tabor, Iowa, next to the Missouri River. This placed us only a few miles from Offutt Air Force Base (headquarters of the Strategic Air Command) on the other side of the river. As we drove north on the River Road, my friend and I saw what we thought was a greenish yard light at a farm, but then noticed it was moving toward us at a rapid speed. we stopped and got out of the car and began to place our tripods, to take pics.  As we prepared to shoot the pics the UFO which had been traveling south approx. 100 feet off the ground shining a bright blueish green light over the ground, abruptly shot up at a 45 degree angle and behind the river bluffs. When it did this there was no sound except the rush of air around the object.  We got in our car and drove up a bluff road to see if we could  find it at a higher vantage point.  We didnt see anything of it and drove back down to the river road, talking about what it could be. We were out of the car, talking by the  road side, when i noticed to the south, a light moving slowly from east to west in the sky at about  1030 high in the view. It was moving slow then it fell almost at the speed of a falling star,, leveled out and began to move slowly north up along the river banks of the Missouri River. My friend and i immediately set up our cameras, and it continued moving North and just slighly (less than 1/8th mile) to the west of us.it passed us and continued north and during that time my friend and I both took 5 or 6 photos.  then it once again changed directions moving East, for a bit then shoot up almost instantaneously at a 45 degree angle and behind the bluffs again.My friend and I went home to his darkroom and developed the photos. We both had images of the UFO showing arrangements of lights and a vague shape of the UFO.  The next day, I took one of the photos to school. When i had the students in class who had seen the UFO on the nights before, i asked one student who had seen it close to go to the board and draw what he saw on the board. He did,, and then i showed him the photo I took. I asked him if that was what he saw. He enthusiastically said yes it was. All the students who saw the photo that day said that it was what they saw. And his picture looked like my photo.A day or so later, my friend called me and said that his home had been broken into and that the negatives and photos had been taken from his darkroom. Also, his camera had been opened and a roll of film taken from it. (that film was unexposed, but was taken also and the camera left laying open on his workbench) A short time later, the one photo I had disapearred, and my friend and I were kind of in a state of shock. We never talked about it again.  I thought many times to tell the story to someone, but, i honestly had a fear to tell it until this time. Its like something told me not to talk about it, you know? I think that there is something very odd about the fact that out of hundreds of witnesses and very reliable ones at that,, the school bus driver, the crowd coming from the gym, the chief of police of Sidney Iowa that followed the bus  home, teachers etc, it is very odd that this story did not ever get out because i have looked for it in various ways, wanting to know more but being afraid to talk too much. Now Im retired and wish to tell the story, i have a lot more detail, for instance, at the time the school bus stopped, one set of observers said the UFO hovered over the bus and the bus stopped on its own, but others said that the light was so bright the driver had to pull over and the cars behind all took to the shoulder to see what was happening.  My feeling and my friends feelings at the time was that it was something secret that was being tested by the STrategic Air Command. But all these years have gone by, and theres never been any aircraft developed that could do what this aircraft did. The rapid descent and ascent, passing so very close to us, with the river bluffs at our backs, with no echo, no buffetting of prop like a helicopter would have, only the whoosh of air sound,, as it passed, not loud at all almost a whisper. Its been a mystery to me all these years, but I definitely know that there are at least a hundred other people who saw the same craft over a 3- 4 day period. I wish that I had the date exactly, I dropped this from my active conscious thought, as soon as it got too creepy with the film and photos being taken. I can send you a drawing of exactly what it looked like, if you are interested. I would like to know if any of the other people who witnessed this have reported it also. Im not using my friends name, because I know that he,, like me, was not anxious to talk about it.  But now I want to. I dont know how to answer about having an investigator contact me, it asks if  I want that, I dont  object to that, lets put it that way.   thanks.((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to the witness for his sharing this report.

I&apos;d just like to know what it is. Tonight my girlfriend and I were leaving our apartment in Bellefonte PA and heading towards State College, about 15 minutes away. As we topped a hill, we noticed an odd disturbance in the sky. I thought at first that it was the twin landing lights of an airplane, flying through thin clouds (there are numerous flight paths over central PA). There were two elongated, grey-white luminous bands, surrounded by a gently glowing white haze, something like this:  . . . . . .. . === . === . .. . . . . . where == are the bands and the periods are the haze. Anyway, I thought it was an airplane over some clouds. But I soon realized that it didn&apos;t appear to be moving. It was not very bright, and it reminded my girlfriend of a comet. Indeed, aside from the funky geometry, it DID look like a very bright comet (like a milky star, as Hale-Bopp looked, at its brightest magnitude, for example). But unlike a comet, it was moving very slowly across the sky (we parked the car to watch, and I tracked its movement against a church steeple). It moved from the southwest to the northeast, roughly, and its speed resembled that of a slow cloud: perhaps one degree of sky per minute. Several planes flew overhead during this time, and I was able to compare them both in terms of motion and appearance. There was no resemblence at all. The object was gray and nebulous; the planes were clear and their red and green lights were perfectly visible. Stars were also visible overhead and all around the object; although there were clouds on the horizon, the sky above was very clear. As we watched the object for approximately three minutes, it very slowly began to disperse and fade. The parallel luminous bands became splotches, and finally the whole thing degenerated into a slightly luminous cloud approximately the visible size of my thumb held at arm&apos;s length. The past-full moon was just rising, though it was mostly obscured by clouds to the south east. Those clouds and the moon were purple and yellow, generally, and I did not have the impression that the object was illuminated by moonlight (though I can&apos;t be sure). As the object faded and became more cloudlike, we drove to a darker spot to watch it, which we did for perhaps another 8 minutes. I telephoned by brother in Louisiana, and asked him if he could see it (I was hoping to decide if the object was in space, in orbit, or in the atmosphere). He could not see it, but reported strong light pollution. By this time, the object had faded to the point that I would not have noticed it, had I not been looking. It was still perhaps 10 degrees from directly overhead and very dim, visible to the west and drifting east. My girlfriend and I continued our trip to State College, and when we arrived, clouds obscured the sky. The clouds cleared perhaps 20 minutes later, and there was no trace left of the object. I have no reason to believe this was anything other than some odd weather or astronomical phenomena, but neither of us has ever seen anything like it. Any ideas?((NUFORC Note:  Result of earlier missile launch.

It was around 6:00 P.M., and me and my girlfriend at the time were sitting out on the porch of a third floor tenement, these type of apartments are common in the Providence, RI, area.I was facing towards the east, at a distance of about 2 miles from the ocean. I noticed three bright lighting groups out in the distance of about 1/4 of a mile or so to the left of where I was sitting, At first I thought that it could be airplanes, but the objects just stood still, so I knew right away that they were not airplanes. Being that they were motionless caught my attention a little, but at that time I thought that they were just helicoptors.The lights being unusually bright, as well as not moving, kept me looking at them just out of curiosity, just wondering what they were doing there in a group like that, it was just unusual and something to look at while we were sitting there on the porch. Then the lights seperated in different directions, and one of them was heading straight towards us.By now I was standing up and looking hard at this bright object coming at us, needless to say I was now at a more heightened state of curiosity than before, however, for a brief moment I still thought that it could be just a helicoptor, but being that I was on a third floor apartment which is about tree level high, making the object eye level to us, and due to the fact that the object was not very far away at this time, and making no noise, got me staring very intently at this thing coming right at us, by now I knew that it could not be a helicoptor, but I was saying what the hell could it be?  I kept watching as the object approached, (moving very slowly I might add), until it was right in front of us, at a distance of no more than 30 feet, yes, VERY CLOSE to say the least.The object passed right in front of us completly at EYE LEVEL, making NO MISTAKE about what it was that we were seeing. It was diamond shaped with a bright white light in the front, a bright red light on the side, and another bright white light in the back. (I never did get to see the opposite side but I assume that it was the same as the side that I could see). It made absolutely NO SOUND whatsoever, and being THAT CLOSE I was amazed.I honestly started to wave at the object in a welcoming gesture completely unafraid for some reason, hoping that I would get some sort of response from the operators of the flying diamond, however I got no type of recognition that I could see, I was disappointed at that.The object just kept on moving ever so slowly until it just went to a distance of about 1/2 of a mile or so and then just disappeared. I have only told a couple of people about the sighting, and one response was that I was seeing a stealth bomber, can you imagine not hearing a stealth bomber at 30 feet away? and not recognizing it? one would have to be blind and an absolute idiot!  Also I was told that I saw a helicoptor, same reasoning, I said to the people that I mistakingly told, &quot;did you not hear what I said that I was only 30 or so feet away from it?&quot; (now I tell no one, this is the only outlet that I have used in many years, keeping this information in is hard)  Since that time I have seen two more sightings, but none as dramatic as that one because of the amount of time that the incident took (around 30 minutes), and also the distance that I was to the sighting, making it as sure as I am about anything that I can see. I am glad to have this chance to get this off my chest, for it is not healthy to keep something like this in, but one cannot talk openly about this type of thing without people saying some stupid remark, so I just keep it to myself.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "small star sized light moving at high rate of speed, NOT a meteor!  Too fast for satelliteAt about 10:10 on Thursday night, Sept. 30th I went out on my deck and looked up in a westerly direction, and just at that moment I saw a star sized light, not unlike a satellite moving from east to west through the Lyra constellation at a high rate of speed. It also slowed down at one point and then sped back up until no longer visible. This whole incident lasted about 3 seconds.  This was NOT a meteor (or falling star),it actually appeared to be ascending.   I also felt that it was much to fast to be a satellite, unless we now have a new generation of high speed satellites that I&apos;m unaware of. Also, most satellites I see are moving in a general north-south or south to northerly direction, from my viewpoint and this was as I stated, east to west. Since it was over so fast, I actually shook my head and found myself saying. &quot;did I actually just see that&quot;??  It seemed odd but I guess it could&apos;ve been a satelite?((NUFORC Note:  Satellites do not move with the angular velocity across the sky that the witness seems to suggest with his description.

Slowly moving east then gone!The date was July 6, 2000. An easy date to verify since it was the date of President Clinton&apos;s visit to Missouri University here in Coloumbia, MO. It had just become dark. I was on my bicycle and was peddling west on Wilks Blvd. just north of Columbia Collage.  I stopped at 8th street. As as I crossed 8th street I noticed a very bright light in the sky, slightly to the south of my location but north of the Missouri University complex and the downtown business district.  It was like a helicoptor search light and seemed to be at about two to three thousand feet altitude. However, there was no red or green running light, or strobe light; and there was no noise!  I then noticed there was a second, similar bright light at least two football fields to the south; and a third similar, bright light at least three football fields to the east! The lights formed a huge triangle in the night sky. My first thought was that they were very quiet military helicopters hovering over the sight of President Clinton&apos;s address to the nation from the university campus. Then I noticed that within the huge triangle the stars were blotted out!  There was a huge, apparently solid object hovering in the night sky over the city of Columbia, Missouri!  There was a police car parked on 8th street and as I started to go toward the squad car the three lights in the sky started moving in tandem slowly to the east. The police car started moving north towards me and I tried to flag them down; but they evidently had been dispatched and they paid no attention to my attempt to stop them. The lights at the tips of the triangular craft never changed in color or brightness.  There were no other lights or distinguishable characteristics visible or audible to me. As I peddled to the south to maintain my view of the UFO I looked down the street and when I looked back up and it was gone!  It just disappeared!  I had heard of Art Bell&apos;s tales of big black triangles in the sky and WAS a complete skeptic of the phenomenon. I was a grade school teacher. I am an ex-special forces medic who became a chiropractor (PCC, 1969).  I don&apos;t drink, smoke or do recreational or pharmaceutical drugs.  I am a well read, 65 years young &quot;health nut&quot; who takes very good care of my self. I have flown and jumped from many different aircraft. I have a good sense of what I observed.  I  believe that what I saw was not created by our then-current or now current human technology. SOME VERY INTELLIGENT ENTITY IS OBSERVING US; just like we observe our flocks and heards!  I hope we don&apos;t get treated by them like we treat our plants and animals!  We had best straighten up our behavior and fly right... The consenquences of our acts could be frightening.

It was still dark, just the barest beginnings of dawn.  Very quiet.  Northwest Austin, rural area, very little artificial light in this neighborhood. Saw two soft white lights in the southern sky moving in straight line at steady pace northward.  I assumed it was an airplane but there was no sound, and this is not any kind of usual flight path I&apos;ve ever observed for commercial flights. As I watched, I realized it had the appearance of a triangle, which my logical mind doubted, but as I kept watching, there was no doubt. I had read a bit about black triangles (just enough to know that they had been reported); this was soft silver, giving appearance of rounded edges (not points). There was no sound at first.  Later, I thought I heard a soft constant roar (like a distant ocean) following it, as it came nearer.  After it had passed, the sound was associated with it, not with something behind it or following it. Four or five lights became visible as it got closer.  Two were colored, soft red and blue or green, blinking.  The two white lights seen initially were soft and constant.  This thing wasn&apos;t hiding. I observed it constantly for at least 30 seconds.  It never deviated from a straight path.  Its speed did not change.  Its path went directly over my location. I cannot describe its elevation in feet,  having nothing to compare it with besides commercial airplanes.

It was a beautiful black night and the stars were bright.  I looked up and saw an extremely large bright star and told my daughter that I had never seen a star there before and especially that bright...about the time that my daughter looked to see it, the brilliant light seemed as if a dimmer was turning it off.  I kept thinking about that event.I did not sit outside most of the summer because of the heat, but then we started having nice nights in September so I would sit out and talk on the phone or just look at the wonderful stars.  We live on a mountain ridge and can see the lights of town below to the right, but to the left and straight ahead are mountains and forest.I never expected to see another event like I had in the Spring, but my eyes flew open when I saw not only one bright star but five popping bright in a flame stitch pattern right below the handle of the big dipper.  They popped one right after the other then seemed to dim after a couple of seconds.  Two airforce jets had just flown by low in the sky, they seemed to be circling over and over again and I know that they do practice around this area...in fact, there were lots of aircraft in the sky that night...I thought that this was strange.  Two nights later I saw two bright pops, then they dimmed as the others had.  Then I looked over and I saw a single glow from afar and it seemed to last for several seconds...I remember thinking...what&apos;s this, it&apos;s staying bright for so long?  The same night I saw a regular looking bright star moving pretty fast, low in the sky.  I watched it for several seconds.  It was traveling from North to South...I was looking for blinking lights of some sort, like on an aircraft, but there were none...just the bright star moving at a fast speed, then it just disappeared!  About three weeks later I saw exactly the same event, the fast moving star except it was moving from West to East.All of these sightings were fairly low in the sky.I asked my son-in-law if anyone from his work had seen anything like this and he said that they hadn&apos;t mentioned it, but he said that a few years ago that he, a doctor friend and some others had witnessed some bright lights over a scout camp.  I asked him what he thought it was and he said that it was a mystery.I am thinking surely someone else has seen such.

All of a sudden above us appeared a triangular shaped craft that had five disk shapes on the underside that appeared to be softly glowing.  Not like lights but more like a soft glow.  The disc were much larger than airplane lights.  The aircraft moved very quickly in a southwest direction and suddenly there was a single soft circular shape that moved in the opposite direction of the triangular shape.  Both moved very fast without any sound and as quickly as they appeared, they disappeared.", "Dancing lights in the sky for more than 20 minutes in a populated DFW skyline.At approximately 22:15 I went outside my house to smoke a cigarette.  As I glanced up at the sky I saw a light that appeared to float across the sky.  At first I thought it may be a plane, but it&apos;s brightness dimmed and the object turned sharply and shot across in a different direction and dissapeared.  Immediately after, two more objects came into view and seemed to fly in tandem and then they circled and shot away.  As I kept on watching these objects seemed to dance in the sky in the same general area.  It was cloudy, so I thought they may have been birds, but the more I watched, I could tell they were flying in front and behind the clouds while illuminating brightly and then dimly.  Some appeared to be triangular in shape, but only when at their brightest.  I watched for a couple of more minutes and saw up to five of these objects dancing around the sky.  I was facing north west from my home and distance was very hard to judge, but it appeared they were in the proximity of the DFW airport.  I did not want to be alone in the sighting, so I called to my wife to look, she was asleep, but I still called to her to look.  It took her a couple of minutes to shake away the sleep, but the objects were still there.  After she began to see what I pointed to, she was asking if they were planes.  I saw a plane flying and pointed out that the plane was moving at about 1/3 of the speed of these objects and that the objects flight patterns were erratic at best.  What amazed me even more was that the intensity of the brightness seem to come in phases.  It was difficult looking through the clouds, but there were definitely five at one time that appeared, danced around each other and moved at high speeds away from each other and together.  I watched with my wife for about another 10 minutes until I decided to get my digital camera.  It was dark, so nothing came out, but I wanted to try anyway.  We watched for a total of about 20 minutes until I was positive that what I had seen was not an illusion or my imagination.

Meteor showers, Planets, Northern lights, Helicoptors, military aircraft. I&apos;ve seen some pretty spectacular meteors. Even one that hit the earth. I know aircraft &amp; stuff in the sky.About 2 minutes after I said I&apos;d never seen a UFO my wife said &quot;is that one?&quot; I thought she was kidding. The kids got pretty excited. I looked up to the west. What I say sent a chill up my spine. 2 dark red oval or surf board shaped objects traveling side by side. They looked like two sets of eliptical wings like a WW 2 Spitfire but no fuselage. It looked like they had some kind of internal glow or lighting. A rust red or dark orange. I thought it looked like they had some kind of geometric pattern on the bottom that mimiced the eliptical shape of craft. Maybe a light or window. My 9 year old daughter thought on of them tilted a bit and she could see the top and it had some kind of structure like a box on the top.They seemed to be in formation. Traveling very fast straight east. No sound at all. We get a of approaching air traffic for Mpls, St Paul Int airport. Pretty high up here. I know they were not any   They apeared to get get kind of close and then make a sharp 30 degree turn.No slow down what so ever. They made about 3 or 4 of these quick course changes and were headed straight north. With in 3 or 4 seconds they were compleatly gone. The whole event lasted maybe 10 or 12 seconds.We all compared our notes and had seen the exact same thing.I&apos;ve seen a lot of stuff in the sky and knew what I was seeing but I&apos;ve never seen any thing like this. They manuvered like no aircraft I&apos;ver ever seen and were incredably fast. It was pretty amazing.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

It sat above the trees stobing and pulsing shifting from blue to green to red to white to orange. It appeared to be rotating.... I waited 15 minutes untill I was sure of what I was looking at and I could obviously see that it was moving ... I went to the building next to where I live and got my friend Mike to witness what I was seeing. Hes a skeptic so the first thing out of his mouth was  &quot;thats an airplane&quot;, andhe got argumentative about it. Then I told him how long I had been watching it and he was watching it very closely and said &quot;Thats not an airplane&quot;.It was at that point that witness number two arrived.... We watched this thing as it moved plused shifted in color and looked at times like it was splitting itself apart in seperate llights it then dropped behind the trees as two what I think were fighter jets moved in on its position then it took off leaving a trail of white light in its passing...", "8:30 P.M. EST August 31, 2004-resembled airplane explosion in atmosphere to unaided, naked eyeI had been talking to my sister on my cell phone outside around 8:30 P.M. Tuesday, August 31, 2004. I was the first person in my family to see the shape in the sky around 8:35 P.M. EST. I watched the shape for several minutes, which upon first glance resembled an exploded airplane to the naked eye. It never once seemed to be a comet or round object, but I could tell it was very high in the atmosphere. There was a distinct long, white, horizontal bar in the center of what looked like &quot;debris&quot;, or &quot;white light&quot; radiating from the bar. Watching it five minutes later with binoculars, the shape had moved north and the &quot;debris&quot;, or &quot;white light&quot; had dissipated enough so that the white bar had disappeared, and the &quot;debris field&quot;, or &quot;white light&quot; had separated into two very distinct halves. I had spoken to an older sister around 9:15 P.M. EST who lives in Florida, and she did not see it. The shape had continued to dissipate and move north toward Canada, then due east toward Pennsylvania until it had disappeared altogether around 9:30 P.M. EST. Please remember that much of my own account was seen by the naked eye. The moon had not yet risen, so it was fairly dark outside. My parents had used a telescope and binoculars through most of the observation whereas I had not.((NUFORC Note:  Result of earlier missile launch.

Extremely low altitude. Extremely slow speed. NO SOUND! Observed at close distances.I was listening to Peter Grabiel&apos;s new video on MTV as I walked out and stood in the cool, crisp, night air of mid-October. The East Texas sky was clear and, as usual, filled with millions of twinkling stars. I could see the Dairy Queen sign that stands beside HWY.8 and was watching the extremely light traffic as it moved east and west along the highway. As I looked further east, just past the huge, blue water tower that stood between me and the highway, I noticed a pair of lights. I assumed it must be a special heavy hauler rig and I waited anxiously for it to pass by the water tower so I could get a better look at it. The lights were above the normal flow of traffic, but I never suspected that they were high enough to be flying and the &quot;truck&quot; was moving very, very slow. As I waited for it to pass the water tower and reappear, I assumed that it must have pulled over...The lights that I had been observing west- bound, at just under a half-mile, was now traveling south-west. As it manuevered around the water tower at about 1800 yards distance, I could clearly see that this was an aircraft. It&apos;s altitude was less than 35 feet and at it&apos;s present speed it would be directly above my head in about 15 minutes. My camera was out of film but I had a M-1 carbine with a 30 round clip full of tracer rounds. I went in the house and got it. A line of pine trees marked the boundry where my backyard joined my neighbor&apos;s yard. 45 yards beyond those trees lies the street that runs in front of his house. The craft was now above the old boat factory, about 300 yards, and as I watched it float, ever so slowly, I saw a bright-white light come on which was located directly in the center of the bottom of the craft. I flipped the safety off of the carbine that I was holding as the UFO approached the street which runs in front of my neighbor&apos;s home. Directly above the street, the rear of the craft came about as it again, changed it&apos;s direction and followed the street west.I am now sixty yards from this craft as it floats through the air so low that the orange reflection from the newly installed amber street lamp was clearly visible on it&apos;s shiny, brushed aluminum appearing skin. NO SOUND! NOT A WHISPER!!NOTHING! It was moving so slow, I had to stop moving to make sure that it was not hovering. My neighbor&apos;s home is a low, ranch styled home about 80 feet long. I observed the craft through the pines that joined our yards as it moved over his home. As it centered his home, about 20 feet of the craft extended beyond each end of his home, giving it a length of 120&apos;.I readied my carbine and aimed at the center of the bright-white light.The bottom of the UFO was flat with a slight hump toward the rear of the craft. It had a light on each of it&apos;s three, rounded corners. These outer lights had the old, yellowish glow, like older vehicles. The top-half of the craft was rounded and egg- shaped and reached a height of at least 15&apos;-20&apos;. I moved across my neighbor&apos;s yard and as I stepped into the street, I observed the craft pass directly over a family&apos;s home, and comparing the two, the UFO was 60&apos; across the rear and was about 15&apos; across it&apos;s nose. I didn&apos;t shoot at the UFO . Those tracer rounds could have bounced off of it, stuck in one of my neighbor&apos;s roofs, and could have burned their house down. I watched the craft as it stayed it&apos;s course and went out of sight.At the time I witnessed this UFO, I was a conveyor mechanic for a government contractor. I&apos;ve worked on air bases all over this nation and there are no aircraft available in our arsenals that can hover 30&apos; off the ground without making a sound. If a human being stands within 60&apos; of any hovering aircraft made on this earth, with the very latest, most advanced, technology known to man, that human being WILL hear that aircraft!! This sighting makes nine UFO sightings that I&apos;ve experianced over the years while living in East Texas. These entities are real, people. What I&apos;ve described here is true. That craft was just as real as the 1985 Chevrolet Silverado that&apos;s setting in my driveway. I hate these things. I hate what they&apos;ve done to peoples lives. I hate the way they can come and go and stalk us. If they are so damned intelligent, then they know what they are doing to us is wrong. Make no mistake about it, I will pull that trigger to stop the threat!!", "Slow moving light rises, fades, disapears, then falls straight down.Last night I saw a strange hazy tricolour light moving slowly southward moving slightly up towards the atmosphere. I watched it for about 40 seconds. It was bright enough for about 30 seconds then it started to fade and go dim. For about 5 to 10 seconds it was lights off nothing to see, then something lit up bright blue and fell straight down. It was weird was it a sattelite, airplane, secret government aircraft, alien space ship, and then a meteor? I do&apos;t know just letting you know. Plus I have seen about five other weird sightings in the last month. These include lights moving up down and all around and lights going from a stand still to really really fast, lights moving in weird ways and then going out, and weird sounds like hummingor vibrating. I know somethings up there and I am sure you do too. Well keep watching the skys and have fun.", "Driving home from work one evening late around 2am on hwy 44 evansville indiana I noticed in the night sky a strange light. It looked so out of place that I kept my eye on it as I drove towards it down the highway. It was about 5 miles away from me moving very slowly. I turned onto I 65 towards my home which would cross the path of this light.I was looking everywhere up in the sky for it until it came into full view crossing the road infront of me. It was gliding along treeline height. I was amaized but also not afraid for some reason and I flashed my lights on and off at it. Iwatched the triangular shaped object floated noiseless over the road before my  car. I then pulled into a church parking lot and got out to watch it float maybe 15 feet over the treeline. It had 3 white lights on the triangle points and one larger one in the middle. It was smokey black and did not seem to be reflecting the streetlights from the church parking lot. NO sound came from this object. It flew towards Evansville north side. After 4 or 5 minutes I could not see it anymore because it was creeping over the trees. I have never seen a UFO since but have had 3 other strange experiences which I feel are UFO related.", "&quot;Armageddon&quot; or &quot;Deep Impact&quot;  type fireball cruises over South DakotaOn 9-2-04 at about 22:43 my wife and I were watching tv inside our house when my wife said &quot;hey, hey, hey, look!&quot; and was pointing out our living room window which faces due North.

We were watching these lights when we saw a bunch of quads(four trax atvs) there were two lights that were following them and hovering over them until they came quite close to where we were watching the lights, we asked if the people on the quads saw the lights too but the first two quads did not see them but the third fellow saw what we were looking at and panicked, he went to get his family from their camp site and took them home fearing that they would be abducted by the lights!  I saw the lights again in the same area a few weeks later and they were doing the same thing! dancing and bopping all over the night sky and I starting thinking twice about going out fishing again...there has been a number of sightings on our island for as long as I can remember and I believe the sightings to be from out of our world.thank you for you time.", "A bright star made right-angle turns without deceleration and sped down over the horizon.My wife and I were viewing the stars outside a friend&apos;s home on a hilltop in rural Maine.  I was watching a medium sized bright yellowish star moving slowly in a straight line from East to West directly overhead and was trying to determine if it was a plane.  It appeared to be as far away as the stars. I asked ((female name deleted)) to look and we both watched as the star, just a steady bright light with no blinking, made a perfect right-angle turn towards the North with no deceleration whatsoever, travelled for around 10 seconds in a straight line Northward, and then made another right-angle turn Westward, travelled in a straight line Westward for 5 seconds and then accelerated and zoomed towards and over the horizon. At no time did we see sparks or any sort of trail like a meteor would make.  It was just a yellowish star doing something I couldn&apos;t since find any way of explaining.", "~ Last night at around 9:30 big bang at the front door. Sounded like someone ran into the door? Or if someone threw a basket ball at it. Dh &amp; I look at eachother and say &quot;what was that?!&quot; I put the light on and see nothing. Open the door and find nothing. Thought about this later and related this sound to a sonic boom, which we are familiar with here in Florida. ~ Go outside on my back patio around 9:45 and see a bright light in the dark sky. I first just assumed it was like a transformer &quot;blowing&quot; or lightning but it was a constant light--not up in the sky though low to the ground. Not like the flashes transformers or lightning typically causes. It stayed lit up for about 3-5 minutes. The night was also a clear night. ~ Hearing something up on my roof like running back and forth. Initially I thought squirrels but these squirrels would have to be hmmmm...20-30lbs to make that kind of ruckus. No kidding it sounds like a child running up on the roof. ~ So, I go out for the day today. I am pulling out of my neighborhood and see a street sign knocked down about a block away. It isn&apos;t bent down more like &quot;sawed&quot; down. ~ Turn out of subdivision and head down fairly busy street.

Was causing my digitial cable to reset and lights to dim and annoyed me. I went to see if my cable &amp; power line were sagging due to the weather, it had been raining and the sky was full of clouds as the remnants of one of the hurricanes passed over. As I looked out my window I saw in the distance a very intense almost neon blue light flashing against the sky.  Each time the light flashed everything electrical stopped.  By my approximation the light appeared to be coming from the Perry Ohio Nuclear Power Plant (approx. 25 miles away).   The light &quot;flashed&quot; just like lightning except it looked like it was orginating from the gound and reflecting up against the clouds.  The last flash was the most intense lighting up the whole horizon and included red and orange as well as blue light and what appeared to be a fireball.  After that no more lights and no more power disturbances. Apperently others saw the light and reported it on the radio next morning WTAM 1100.  I thought it would be good to report the power interruptions as well.  I called the power company the next day to see if anyone else reported power distrubances in my area and they would not tell me.

It definatelly was not lighting.", "Approximately 10:45 PM on September 1, 2004 I observed an object moving from east to west while looking out my bedroom window which faces south. This object was following the usual flight patter for aircraft going to Los Angles International Airport. However, what caught my attention was the color and brightness of the object and that it had no flashing lights like many aircraft do. The object was an orange color and seemed to be about twice the brightness of the other aircraft in the sky. I observed it for 2 minutes as it moved from the east to west in the southern horizon. Approximately halfway across the sky the object seemed to have stopped. I then observed the object though my window screen using 10x binoculars. The object didn&rsquo;t appear clear due to my screen being dirty, so I went out to my balcony with my binoculars and observed it there. This time I got a much better look at it and could not see any aircraft or shape in the bright orange light of the object. It appeared like a bight star about 5 times the size of the surrounding stars. Its color was that of hot burning coal, being that of a light orange color. While I observed it, the object was motionless and appeared to be hovering in the sky. I observed very closely thought my binoculars and this object didn&rsquo;t move or drift at all. I could tell that it did not drift due to its distance from the background stars. After 2 minutes of watching the object hover, it ejected a much smaller object about 1/10 its size. The second object was the same color as the first object and appeared to be about half as small as the background stars I was viewing though my binoculars. It appeared to fall straight down from the first object and left a streaking orange trail as if fell which then disappeared the farther it fell from the first object. This smaller object looked like a falling hot coal or ash, like someone would see at a fireworks display except there was no smoke or flame, just an orange glow. It might have been possible that there was another object in the streaking trail when the first one was ejected. It was hard to tell due to the glow of the streaking trail. I followed this second object as it fell for about 3-5 seconds. In that time it fell about half the altitude of the first object. I then looked back up at the first object to see if it would eject more objects. The original object didn&rsquo;t eject anymore objects but this time it appeared to move towards the northwest. It moved slower to the northeast than it originally moved when it was going east to west. As it moved it went over the roof of my apartment and I lost sight of it, so I went downstairs to the parking lot to see if can follow its movements. When I got down stairs and looked to the northwest it was gone. The object when first sighted was probably 3-4 miles to the south of me over the cities of El Monte, CA or Temple City, CA and then it moved north over Arcadia, CA where I was located. It was very hard to tell the size of the object or its height. I estimate that it was about 3000 to 4000 feet in altitude. However, it was very hard to tell its true altitude or the size of the object since it had no shape except that of an orange glowing light. Its speed was from what appears to be 100 MPH to zero.  It traveled about as fast as the background aircraft traffic when it was moving. There were numerous background aircraft traffic to the south of its position along the usual LAX landing patterns. Also there is the smaller El Monte Airport to the south about 5 miles away with mostly light private planes flying out of it. However, there were no background aircraft near the object itself, just in the distance several miles away. This object and the second object made no noise during the whole sighting. When I first saw this object I simply thought was the standard aircraft that fly in the area. However, it was the brightness and the color of the object that got my attention. Observing it made me think that it was something other than an airplane or helicopter. First I thought that it was a balloon that was on fire, especially when I saw the other smaller object dropout of it. I thought that it was a burning ember falling from it and that it might land on someone&rsquo;s house and set it on fire. Then I thought about it and realized that this light showed no flames and that if it was a balloon on fire that it would have burned up very quickly.  If it was a helicopter then I would have heard noise from it and it would have drifted a little even while hovering. This object made no noise and didn&rsquo;t drift in the slightest when hovering. The light it emitted hid the shape of whatever object it was. Whatever this object was I don&rsquo;t believe that it was any conventional flying aircraft.", "The object appears to be very bright. The shape is consistant in three of the photos.I only saw the object when I got back to New York and viewed my photos.There are four photos with the object .

Usually I noticed it around 2 or 2:15 am (while I was working at my home computer, I am a writer and so is my husband) and it would be noticable for about 30 to 45 minutes but since it was early in the morning I have usually gone to bed before it disappeared. However, on Monday night 10/12 it disappeared before I went to bed.  I might add the weather was good and no other stars were visible in the sky when we have seen these lights. After the first sighting, my husband up out of bed to see it/them. The object(s) appears on the Gulf water side due East and Southeast over the Bolivar Peninsul/ Texas City area.  You see a belt of lights parallel to the horizon seeming to rotate around whatever it is, changing colors from white to yellow to green occasionally with a red flash.  Normally it hovers in one spot moving ever so slightly but last night 2 of them appeared at the same time. At first they were a good distance from each other then one moved to be in tandem with the most easterly one and they were close to each other high over the roof top of my neighbors home but I have no idea how high they were, I would say extremely high.  On Monday night the one that was there was kind od darting around slightly before it disappeared. I am concerned and I do not know what to do; because as you may know there are many petroleum refineries here in this area and the salt dome oil storage is underground at High Island not far from here. I guess I am worried these might be some sort of spy vehicles but they just seem so unusual that I cannot believe others have not seen them and I have to think the US military and the Coast Guard would be strengently guarding these refineries, so why have they not seen them? We tried to get some photos but our camera is not good enough for this type photograpy.  We do have a telescope and we are going to adjust it today so we can possibly see something in the next few days.((NUFORC Note:  We suspect Venus may be the object.

About 19:40 (CET) I saw 6 bright, orange lights moving across the sky with a huge speed. It is hard to say what was an altitude of these objects, they were moving from east to south. The objects were seen for about 5-6 seconds and they just flied into  Space. Some people on the street shouted: &apos;Did you see that?&apos;. So they must have spotted the lights too.The crafts did not fly in any kind of formation, there was no sound or other unusual activity.

A sphere with a glowing, bright, red light hovered over a tall, 13-story apartment building across the street from me. I saw at least 50 people on the ground pointing at it. The craft, which was very small - about the size of a car, hovered for about 30 seconds over the apartment building and slowly moved towards me overhead while it was ascending. The hotel is the Holiday Inn in Grand Rapids.", "large triangle shaped blinking lights and red circle of light over charleston AFBI was sitting outside waiting for a freind when I noticed about 8 white lights blinking in the distance quite far off. I thought wow thats a lot of airplanes at once, but as the blinking lights moved closer i saw that they blinked in a pattern, a huge triangle pattern. one light blinked at the top and then 3 or four blinks down the sides simultaneossly (spelling). this thing was huge and it moved toward the air force base. when it reached about the edge of the military property line it changed direction and instead of moving toward me it headed right towards the flightline and center of the base. I was on a cell phone with the a freind and she pulled up to see the top of the triangles blinking light before it disapeared behind a row of trees 2 steets away. It was high up enough that I could make out all the lights it, even though it never got on top of us,but it was not way up either. I would say about the level planes fly when they are mid level in the sky. it should have been low enough to be heard! they lights moved across the sky together never geting farther or closer apart so I kow they could not be a bunch of different planes. Well my freind and I stood staring into the sky and about 2 minutes after it disapeared a red circular light came from almost exactly where I had seen the triangle last, it moving swiftly our direction. It was solid red never blinking and it was at about the same level as the triangle in height. If it was a plane It would have been audible. It flew at the same level as planes in the sky that night that were clearly heard. this is where this gets military. I am at the far end of the base and I only hear planes take off when they are fighter jets. right when the red circle was overhead of us, we heard fighter jets or jet take off, the roar is loud and unmistakeable. as soon as we heard the roar the red light just was gone, blinked out. it did not zipp off or continue flying it was just gone. like someone turned out a light. I wanted to call military authorities but then I did not want my husband to be blacklisted or something. We are not a fighter base, but my husband says we have a few for defense purposes.  I think it is odd at the timing the fighter took off, and that it made the red circle go away. I have not slept all night long and i watched the news and no one said a thing. this triangle of lights was huge maybe a half mile across, and the red circle was about the size of an airplane. Large not the usual size of the blinking or non blinking lights on a aircraft, the light itself was as big as a plane. I think the red circle came from the big triangle. also odd was the fact that there were a number of airplanes in the area, so many so I commented to myself about it before this happened and then directly after it the sky in are area was completly empty. no more planes. I dont know if that is relevant or not but it stuck out at me. that the once busy sky seemed empty when these other craft arrived.", "Bright white flashes by the Radio and TV towers in Fort Wayne, IndianaNear the group of radio and TV towers there was an awesome flash of white light.

I was walking from the garage to the house and looked up and noticed a bright silver or alummium color cigar or blimp shape object in about a 45 degree angle going really fast across the sky from the N.E.tO the S.W. for approx 10to15 seconds  the sun was really shinning on the object caught my eye,I was home by myself there was none of my neigbors out side at that time. It was something I have never ever seen before .It was not a plane it went really fast,no trail,made no sound. I was thinking about this all day and hope someone else may have seen this object and this would help you.", "I was visited by at least five alien men in 1985This is an old story, but one I feel I must tell to set the record straight.  The recent death of Betty Hill has convinced me that people are interested int this subject, and since I have something to add, I should go ahead and tell the whole story.  I was fifteen, and after the ten o&apos;clock news went down to the beach of our rented summer cabin, as was my habit, to go have a cigarette.  I saw a light on the horizon, hovering over the waves, but was not too bothered by it.  But I felt somehow drawn to it, and kept walking towards the light.  Then, at once, I discovered I was over knee-deep in water, at a fairly low tide.  I hurried back to the beach, in which the light started climbing, slowly, but surely, towards the sky.  Then, a couple other objects shot down, and the group of them begans to bounce around the coastline, up and down, with every once and awhile one coming in close.  By this time I had climbed the stairs and was watching from a lookout, joined by my father, who was poo-pooing the whole idea, though he did not have his glasses, and could not come up with a reasonable explaination for the lights he DID see.  After a long time of observation, one by one, the lights shot up straight into the sky, like a bottle rocket,and we went back to the cabin.We went back to the cabin, and I went to my room, but I couldn&apos;t sleep.  I fell asleep reading &quot;The Great TV Sitcom Book&quot;  What happened next I have no way of proving or disproving, but in my heart and my mind I know that it DID happen: I awoke, after sleeping a short time, and heard a noise on the porch.  I went to the window, and saw at least five bald headed men wearing long, black jackets, waiting at the front door.  As I watched, the porchlight went out.  They were trying to open the front door, and as they did, the porchlight faded and so did my recall.The next morning I awoke as if I had had nightmares, and hadn&apos;t slept well.  Bruises and soreness were present, yet it was a few days before I associated it with that night.  I was in a bit of a fog.  I walked many times to the lookout, where I watched this craft, but had no clear knowledge of why.  Later on I went home and tried to put the whole thing behind me.  Obviously I haven&apos;t.  I can still see the five men, light glaring off thier bald heads, trying to force their way in to the cabin and knowing that I had no choice in the matter", "I saw a distant light while going somewhere.I was in the car with my dad going to an event, when ahead in the distance I saw a light over the Santa Rosa Plataeu. I pointed it out to my dad but he didn&apos;t think it was anything. I don&apos;t know the shape of the craft as it was to far away to tell. It was around sunset. I know it wasn&apos;t an airplane because it didn&apos;t seem to move.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

My oldest daughter came out to see what had now gotten us all looking up and as she turned to look around, out of the corner of my eye, i see something streak acrossed the sky heading north , as I watched it another was passing it coming south and I ran for my camera (digital powershotA300) I stepped back onto the deck and notice that 2 of the stars that had formed the circle were now missing, my husband told me it was coming back , as i turned to see it, the second one zipped so fast past it was  a split second. I turned back to the formation and noticed that the 2 emty spots were no longer emty. I took my camera and focused on the middle of  the formation and snapped a few pictures, as i did so, the middle object seemed to lower its self,  the entire formations seemed to shift  from east to west   and stood still again a bit closer. I took a few more shots and all stayed to watch but myself and daughter, we loaded the shots onto the computer and i sketched the formation on my paint program, as i pulled up my photos  I could see only one clear view of what was there and it in no way looked like a normal aircraft or a star, it was boomarang shaped with a row of lights around the outer shape. At one point while looking at the formation, there was a bright flash of red that seemed to go to one of the smaller crafts in the circle.  At 4:30 am all came in to see the picture and to agree on sketch, we all went out to look again and it was completly gone!! we were in the house for only about 60 seconds and all went back to look and found nothing! myself and my son ((name deleted)) kept hearing a high pitched  tone in our ears which kept me up till dawn. Since that night we have all looked to see if we could be wrong, that it may have really been stars and the formation has never been seen since!I should mention that it was mostly clear skys with only a few high shreads of clouds. the sky seemed particularlly filled with stars, since we are in the city, its rare to see it such. This is not our first siting ,but is the only one that left a photo to prove it! If you have any questions feel free to contact me.((NUFORC Note:  We have requested copies of the photos.

Two blue-green objects, looked like stars as well but 1/2 the size as the white ones.  All four appeared to be &quot;floating&quot; with random movement between the two white lights as all four headed toward the east together.  The blue-green lights were moving back and forth between the two white lights, which were side by side, but did not appear to be tethered together in anyway.

I was driving toward the sunrise. They were very bright, metallic looking, almost as if there were four very bright lights on the bottom of the object.  They looked as if they were maybe a mile away from where I was, although that is hard to determine because I don&apos;t know how big they really were.  The objects did not move and as I got closer, they got larger. As I was stopped, I saw them in the same position and used a tree as a measurement to movement.  They did not move.  I continued to watch them for at least 5 minutes.  I pulled over to take a picture and they disappeared out of thin air.", "Stationary piercing bright light over Hunter&apos;s Crossing Publix drifted over Devil&apos;s Millhopper.On September 15, 2004 at around 10:30 pm my friend was traveling west on Millhopper Road. There was no moon. It was a clear night right after hurricane Frances. She stopped at the stop light on Millhopper and 43rd street. She saw one piercing bright light about the size of a double pencil eraser(at arm&apos;s length) above the Publix store. It began to move at a steady speed in a straight line going NW. It stopped above the trees at the Devil&apos;s Millhopper non-public entrance. She lost sight at this point because she had to continue in traffic.She estimated the speed of the light at about 20 mph. The height of the object was about two pine trees tall. The observation lasted about 8 minutes. She saw no other colored or non-colored lights and no shape or shadow behind the light. She heard no noise, felt no breeze, and no one else on the road seemed to notice it.", "was starlike and moving from star to starwe saw the first one as a light similar to a star moving at a speed of about slightly faster than an airplane going from south to north. few minutes later we saw a second on going in the direction opposite to the one before it and then it stopped and faded away. less than a minute after that one disappeared another one was seen following a road discribed by stars(it was going from star to star.).", "I saw an object with bright lights in the sky , at first i thought it was a airplane.But, it looked wird like it was a flying car, with it&apos;s headlights spaces exactly like a car.It was also &quot;driving in the air&apos;. The sky was pretty bright for 9:15 pm.i could also see another craft in the air, and this was a plane i know. Because of O&apos;hare there are a lot of planes in the sky all the time, and that is how i know that this craft lookes starnge. Also, as i was looking at it, it disapperared completely. On moment it was there, driving/gliding slowly in the sky, not very hight and not very fast, and he next it was gone! completely in one second, in a blink of an eye. But, the oher plane was still in the sky, i waited for  couple of minutes, looked around in the sky, but it did not appear again. also, i know it is pretty cloudy today, but the clouds were too high and the plane too low to disappear into the clouds. And the lights completely disappeared. Also, there were no wing lights or any other lights other than the front headlights.I call it a UFO, because to me it was  an Unidentifed Flying Object (UFO), whether it was a conventional UFO or not! What is a conventional UFO? Also, i never did see the shape of the craft, which was weird because the sky was pretty bright, and i could see the shape of the plane behind.", "On this night, I noticed a cylinder shaped illuminated object in the southeast sky. At first I thought it was a portion of the moon with the rest being onscured by clouds. At second look, I realized that it was a clear night and there were no clouds. I realized that it was some type of object that was moving slowly across the sky from southeast to northwest. I watched it for about 5 minutes before calling my 14 year old son outside to look at it. We watched it for another five minutes. The object was lit by a clear light that was constant. No blinking or other lights. It moved horizontally across the sky at a very slow speed. Towards the end, the light seemed to slowly diminish and it just faded away.((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witness might have observed a contrail behind a high-altitude aircraft.  Just a guess.  PD))", "Multicolored disk across the street.I was five at the time that I saw the craft, so memories of the incident are hazy. I was in my house when I decided to walk around, there was nothing to do. My house has a small room in which people take off their coats and shoes and put them away, the entryroom. I walked into the entryroom and approached the window to the side of the door. The windows are tall and thin and are to the sides of the door, and have a white lace-like cloth over them. I pushed the curtains asid to see any traffic. There&apos;s a tool factory in front of my house across to street, with a small wooded section blocking the factory&apos;s veiw. In a large central brak in the wooded section is where a disk shaped craft slowly crpt into veiw. The craft had multicolored lights to its side, which didn&apos;t seem to shine like a beacon, yet there was a definite shine to them. The craft, as it was disk shaped, had a side to it where the lights were atached, streching all around the craft. The craft did swirl a bit, and I can remember a soft beeping noise, like when you dial-up onto the internet. After about twenty-five, thirty seconds, the carft dirfted the west, where i wasn&apos;t able to see the craft agian, do to the width of the window.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Friday night the stars were just beautiful and bright, as usual on a clear night.  Saturday night we went outside and sat on the deck looking up at the stars then we went inside to get ready for bed.  My husband got up at around 3AM and went down to the kitchen and a few minutes later he was hollering at me to rush downstairs because there was something in the sky that wasn&apos;t there before, EVER. (My husband grew up on this farm so he is very familiar with all the surroundings).  I rushed downstairs into the kitchen and looked out our bay window, there in the sky, it seemed so close, a very bright luminating light.  I looked down at my watch and it read exactly 3:15AM.  It just stayed suspended in the sky getting brighter than it would slowly fade to where you could not see it all, but you could see a cloud or some sort of haze as to where it was, than all of sudden it would re-appear, stay very, very bright for about 15-20 min. than fade away and than you could see the haze for about 3 minutes than it would re-appear.  The same process over and over again.  Than off to the east my husband tells me to look left there is another one.  However, this showed multi-colors and was further away but it would fade and come back like the other.  Oh, also when we stood there very quietly there was this humming sound in the air like being at a power plant.  Another thing was, that our dogs would not go outside, but the dogs at the nearby farms were barking just a bit different than normal.  We went outside, got on the roof, walked down the driveway just watching both of them,  mainly the more luminated one because it seemed so darn close.  We watched the whole time until they even left.  The sun started to come up all the stars slowly started to disappear as they normally do, but these two lights stayed until 7 AM.  They slowing lifted into the sky, it took them approx. 1 hour to where they were completly out of our view.  The whole time we just kept saying &quot;I do not believe this,  I can not believe this.&quot;  But once daylight hit and all the other stars left we knew we have seen something.  We told eachother that we wouldn&apos;t tell anybody because they would think we were nuts, but we told 2 people and they said &quot;Oh, you were probably still sleepy and didn&apos;t know what you saw.&quot;  But we knew what we saw so I had to find a website to tell to somebody.((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witnesses were observing celestial bodies.

I viewed it through a lens with 78x power and it looked nebulous ,rather cloud like. I went in to get binoculars and it apparantly moved Eastward quite quickly and had lost much of its shape. The Moon was rising and I figured it was only a cloud reflecting Moonlight. I told my wife about it and said at first I thought I&apos;d spotted some thing strange in the heavens but felt foolish as I factored in the Moon.

Close to the moon as it traveled across the sky. We were watching it for 3 minutes. Then the orange glowing light stopped and it was just stationary for about 30 seconds. Then, suddenly I saw a plane coming. Looks like a military jet but no sound. It has 3 dim white lights. One on the right wing the other on the left wing. The 3rd light was on the nose of the jet plane. As this jet plane (I&apos;m sure it was a military jet but it didn&apos;t make any sound?! And my view was as if i was looking at the bottom of the plane so kinda look like triangle becaue of the 3 dim white lights.)It was moving very fast and as soon as it passed the orange glowing light, (the Orange light was higher than the jet) the orange glowing light started to get smaller and smaller. It was so tiny but i could still see this orange bright light until it disappeared. There were 6 of us who saw this. Me my wife, my two daughters (ages 8 and 6) and my wife&apos;s step mom (who saw it first). Amazing! I couldn&apos;t sleep.

Made mental notes of the weather and temprature in order to get an idea what conditions would be like for the weekend.Off to the west i noticed what appeared to be military craft of some sort doing manuevers.After watching for about 3 minutes i noticed there was no way any known craft could make that kind of speed from dead stops and those tyes of angles being flown.I decided it wasnt worth wondering about any longer because i had to get up in a couple of hours to go to work.I went and layed down and went over the weather conditions in my head.I noticed that it also appeared to be a full moon and was attempting to remember the last full moon in order to figure out if it was on the incrrease or the decrease. then i remembered that me and a hunting buddy had a full moon out the previous weekend when we were night hunting. Didnt make sense so i got back up and put my face against the screen to get a better look.I could make out one full globe with a dull shine and the edges of two more in a triangular position. At first i was thinking it was a big weather ballon and it was descending over head. This thrilled me to death and i was hoping to get to see what type of gadgets they used for collecting data and reporting a downed balloon.Looking more careful i noticed that it didnt move at all and there was an outer &quot;rim&quot; this was all one object! A true sense of reality clicked in.This wasnt lil green men! This had to be a military craft with &quot;silent propulsion&quot; it was real! I was standing there looking at it! Then i was terrified, it hadnt moved and any technology of that scope would also be able to know i was standing in my bedroom observing as well.

I didnt argue the idea. I didnt want anyone to know... god forbid if i saw something i wasnt sposed to.Amazingly it was probably a few years later that UFOs were big TV stuff and there was also a report of a lady,daughter and her mother in a car out on Dayton hiway in Liberty county a9around the same time i think i saw what i did) who was exposed to hi radiation and had burns to prove it.They swore they saw military heliocopters around this thing. It even bleached the road where it had crossed!!! I knew then that i had did the right thing by not reportiing it or making it into a big deal Or going outside to take pictures or signal the stupid thing to hover down and pick me up! I never made jokes about UFOs again and I never wish to see another one.I do know it was real and im totally convinced it was military. We didnt live but approx. 40 miles from a major airport.Theres no way someone couldnt see these things.This may sound stupid or made up or who knows. After this long a dont really care.

I was a stringer for NBC news and shot the landing from the dry lake bed.I left Edwards Air Force Base and headed back to the San Joaquin Valley on Highway 99.Late in the afternoon, I saw something that looked to be a dark spot on the sun.I pulled over and got out my binoculars. The sun was too bright, so I waited till the sun started to set. Soon, the dust from the earth allowed my binoculars to see what cannot be anything but UFO&rsquo;s. First there was the large round ship that I could see with my naked eye and gave me the reason to pull over, (thinking it was a sunspot). When I looked below the large ship, I saw six smaller ships lined up three in a row, like on a dice, all at 45 degree angles. Next to these &ldquo;dots&rdquo; was a long dark bar (like a pencil) that was twice the length of the large sun spot ship. All these items were stationary is space between earth and the sun. I did an experiment to see if I was just seeing things. I positioned myself in front of distant telephone poles and placed the UFO&rsquo;s directly behind them.  I watched as the group slowly dropped at the same rate as the sun. They started above the telephone wires and as the sun set they ended up below the telephone wires till they all sunk into the horizon. These things had to be huge since they were not even close to being on earth and dropped into the horizon at the same rate of the sun.

It just came out from behind the tall trees, rising up, alot of colored lights, not a star, nothing like a star it happened so fast I can hardley remember now or right after what I saw, but it was there, like a christmas tree and I saw it mostly from my binoculars at magnified close up.  It is almost like I can not remember it and so soon after?  I saw something, something that was filled with alot of colors, flashing like headlight, only one of the two? flashing? rising up behind the tall trees.  I live in the mountains, a apt complex. I have had missing time or where I was one minute in one place and than something happened and I was much further along on two occasions and on another like some type of time change, but in the same place. I have also had like something like out of body but more like spirit travel, where I instantly and with no notice, begin to feel I was traveling underground, to NY, on to a UFO and I saw three beings, military blanket on the first floor, computer panel circular room on second floor.  Another time, the same type of expereince of travel, where again I was very relaxed but not really asleep, traveled again but this time on a rocket, much faster, landed like a ufo would land  one two three very easy and fast, and I found myself inside a  dome  enclosure.

I knew it was not a plane or a helicopter or a satellite or anything else I am familiar with seeing.  It was definately a UFO and I am 100% certain I had an alien encounter of the second kind.  I was so certain, I also quickly sketched its shape so as not to forget.  I am very excited to ascertain if others in my area were out and viewed the same thing as I am very certain of what I saw.((NUFORC Note:  We will request a copy of the graphic.

At first, I thought it was a group of military helicopters, as they seem to use a white strobe as their only marking at night (at least, I see these from time to time).  Looking at it, though, I noticed that there must be a huge cloud of helicopters, then... because there were a LOT of white flashpoints of light; spread over a really what looked like a huge area.  Also, it was perfectly quiet.  I went back in, and got my wife to come out too, so she brought our son and 1-year old daughter outside (I had to make sure that I wasn&apos;t the only one seeing this).  My wife and 4-year old son saw it too (my wife was pretty awestruck, like I was... my son was just freaked out).  It may have been one of the freakiest things I&apos;ve seen. The whole thing, from when I saw it to when it was too far for us to see, probably lasted about 5-10 minutes (I wasn&apos;t really watching the time).  Whatever it was passed to the south of us... most likely just to the south edge of Lincoln.  It didn&apos;t change direction or anything like that. Thinking about it, it looked a lot more like flashbulbs in a dark stadium than strobes.  They were flashes of white light, but the certainly didn&apos;t strobe from the same place.  There was absolutely no discernible shape or pattern that we could see. I couldn&apos;t say that there was any opacity to it in any way.  With no noise, and no shape... not much of anything remarkable other than so many white flashes of light, and such a large area.  It was very strange to us. I checked with the local FAA control tower this morning, and they hadn&apos;t had any reports or picked up anything strange.", "Light turning on and offWhile I was out in my backyard last night between 8-9pm, sitting in my jacuzzi and looking up at the sky, I always notice shooting stars. But last night for the first time, I was looking at the sky and I saw a light turn on for one second and then turn off. I thought it was my vision even though I have perfect vision but I kept looking for it again in the same area. Within a 20 minute period, I saw the light about 7 times. It would turn on for one second, then turn off for about 3 minutes. Have you heard of anything like this? I have never seen something like this in the sky before. Could it be a stationary satellite that flashes once in a while? Looking forward to your response. The size of the light was like a bright star.", "I witnessed an elongated, triangular aircraft moving at a very slow speed approximately trenty feet above the Redwood trees.On the night of September 17, 2004 at approximately 11:30pm, as I was driving home, I witnessed an elongated, triangular aircraft that was traveling the opposite direction.  It was continuously moving a very slow speed, approximately twenty feet above the Redwood trees.  I made a u-turn and followed it at about thirty mph in my car, for almost two miles as it flew slowly northward in a straight path.  There were cars behind me so I pulled to the curb and I watched it for a couple of minutes to see what it would do next.  It continued northward for about two minutes, then made a gradual turn and headed south, in the same path and manner as it had previously gone.  I rolled down my window so I could hear what kind of sound the aircraft had, which was only a low humming motor sound.  I turned and followed it in my car for about three more minutes, when it disappeared from my sight over the trees.  I could only see the bottom of the aircraft because it was traveling so low and the top was not illuminated.  What I saw looked like it was made of galvanized steel, with a ridge from front to back on each side.  The bottom was flat and there was a red light on each of its three points.  There was a green light on the right front side near the red light in the front.  The green light only flashed twice when the craft was headed north and I couldn&apos;t see the green light when it was headed south.  The red lights gradually faded, but never went completely off, then got bright again, about every two seconds.", "I was traveling from Lubbock, TX to Cee Vee, TX (Cottle County) and 17.4 miles from Matador, TX, on Friday, 10/08/04, and I saw a large triangular object (2 lights, space, 2 lights, then two lights below and in between the top sets.  It sat in the same position approximately 1000 feet (hard to judge just after dark, but this is approximate) off the ground.  I drove toward the area and it stayed stationary.  I pulled off the road to view it and it was as though they turned off their lights.  It just disappeared!   When I got to Cee Vee, my nephew reported that several friends of ours, hunting on one of our farms, had seen three lights (separate units) over the farm, and they took camcorder pictures of the event.  On Sunday, October 10th, I viewed their pictures and it was unbelievable!  I told them I thought I had seen the &quot;mother ship&quot;.  Their lights changed alternatively white to red.

The sky was clear with lots of stars.  The Antalya airport is located within about 50 miles of the site.  There were numerous planes seen in mid air approaching and leaving the airport mostly in SE/NW direction. None of the planes approached the beach where we were located.   The object, however flew directly over us and disappeared behind our hotel.  It flew from SE to NW, over the sea and then over land, where its view was obstructed by buildings.Description:  Its shape is hard to define: it looked like a diamond or a stingray while somewhat flat at the front.  At some point it seemed to be made of soft fabric and its sides seemed to slowly move up or down, as if slowly changing shape.  The bottom part had numerous lights that were much dimmer than the stars in the sky.  I would estimate the size as that of or larger than Boeing 747.  But with the shape closer to B2 bomber it had to be quite big.  No wings, however.  Can&apos;t say if it was a single object or a formation - did not have a chance to see it long enough.  Speed: approximately 250 mph.  Height: I estimate 900 feet.  Again these are only estimates but if this were a 747 or 777 it would be possibe to see detail of the fuselage, windows, side marks etc at this height.  The object made no sound at all, or at least anything that could be heard above the noise of the surf.  It did not occur to me to report it to local autorities.  My family and I saw the object very clearly, however, if not for my daughter, I would have never noticed it.", "it looked like a cloud with a light behind itObject was first observed high in the western sky at 21:20.  At first I thought it was the moon behind a cloud but I realized the sky was clear with many stars and the moon was just rising in the eastern sky.  It looked like a very small cloud with a light behind it.  I could not make out any shape but was aware it was drifting very slowly directly east.  Went to get a pair of binoculars and my wife and son.  Through the binoculars there was a distinct shape with a more pronounced light shooting south out of one of five arms (for lack of a better word).  The shape looked almost like a starfish with four of the arms evenly distibuted and then a fifth arm protruding south with the light coming out of it.  This shape could only be made out while looking through the binoculars and the entire object faded out of sight as it drifted directly overhead into the brighter sky (the sky gets bright to the east of my house due to a mall to the east).  It was odd that the light seemed to be facing out of the object like a headlight on a vehicle but yet the object was moving or probably just drifting to the east.  My wife and son observed the same exact thing.  It was visible for about 30 minutes.  Really curious if anyone else in eastern Ohio observed this.  It was not very bright and looked like a cloud with a light in or behind it, but maintained a very distinct starfish shape as it drifted/moved which I do not think a cloud would have done.((NUFORC Note:  Result of earlier missile launch.

(Its movement was similar to how a fighter jet flys over a city during an air show, except there was no jet sound or boom.  The object was mostly round with possibly a flat rear section.  At first I thought it could be a shooting star, but the size was too big and I have never seen a shooting star change directions.

At apx. 9m we took a break and all 6 of us went out onto the back deck.  I noticed a strange site in the sky.  It looked like two very large stars shaped like rectangles and lightly covered by a cloud.  It was a completely clear night with no other clouds at all.  The &quot;stars&quot; seemed to be pulsing slightly and the &quot;nebula&quot; surrounding them began to grow larger and disperse over the next 15 minutes.  We observed the &quot;nebula&quot; cloud consistently moved north east.   And then interestingly enough, we observed at least 3 &quot;shooting stars&quot; within the same 15 min. span.  We saw at least 5 other small aircraft flying in the same vicinity. At first, we discussed whether it could be the moon in cloud cover but the sky was clear and the moon was to east.  Then we discussed how it appeared to be an explosion in the higher atmosphere (50,000 to 60,000 feet).  One member of Zen (the band) is an experienced pilot and flight instructor and it was through his experience that we arrived at these estimates of distance.  His comment was, &quot;in all my years of flying, I&apos;ve never seen anything like this.&quot;  We wondered if it could possibly be a large passenger airplane enroute from Washington, DC that had exploded at that altitude (maybe a terrorist event).((NUFORC Note:  Result of earlier missile launch.

It was about the size of a star (maybe a little bigger), but it had a brightness almost that of the moon. At first I thought it might be a meteor or something, so I stood to watch it. I realized it was moving toward me, and as it did, the one bright light became smaller lights. There was also a flashing red light. It continued to get closer, and I thought it was a very low flying airplane. However, I suddenly realized it was making no noise at all, and I found this very odd. I am nearly positive that it stopped and hovered, although I cannot be entirely sure. As it did, I could make out the outline of it. It appeared to be about the shape of a bowler hat. The lights were around what would appear to be the brim, and the dome part was dark, but I could make out the silouette against the night sky. I suppose this dome part could have been my imagination, but I&apos;m almost positive of what I saw. Before this, I was still under the impression that it was an airplane. I certainly was not expecting to see this shape, and it instantly gave me chills. Suddenly, the object made a sharp 90 degree turn and took off to the south. This, to me, confirms it was no aircraft that I&apos;ve ever seen before. The way it turned, it was so smooth, and very quick. Before, as it came towards me, I could not see the speed with which it moved, but after the turn, I could tell that it moved very quickly. I walked toward my back yard so i could see it through the neighboring houses, and I watched it dissapear over the tree line to the south. Something that may have just been coincidence: I could hear several dogs barking off to the south, which I thought sounded like what I had heard about other UFO sightings.The thing about all this is, before tonight, I really did not believe in UFOs that much. I thought people who saw them were crazy. Tonight left serious doubt in my mind. I&apos;m writing this less than an hour after the event, so it&apos;s still completely fresh in my mind. I will swear on anything that I&apos;m not making this up.

They said they only saw it for about five seconds but as soon as my sister saw it her mouth broke out in small blisters almost like ulcers. Like I said, we&apos;ve seen it many times over the years, plus other kinds of UFO&apos;s, but the last time we saw it was around the beginning of this summer, about the middle of June. This time it was my sister and me, I was driving, coming home from a friend&apos;s house, probably around 8 or 9 PM, and there was one over the cemetery again. This time we decided to follow it. As we neared the cemetery, heading east, the object started to move off at a high rate of speed, to the NE. I turned down another street heading N, which has a school, I stopped in the middle of the road because we could see that there were two other objects, like the triangle, forming a larger triangle. I started to go forward again and this time all three disappeared in maybe two seconds. As I stated, we&apos;ve seen many kinds of UFO&apos;s. The triangle, sphere&apos;s, cigar-shapped ones, lights that just hovered, and so on. We&apos;ve also become accustomed to having bruises we can&apos;t explain,my sister&apos;s mysterious ulcers, blood on our bed sheets and pillow cases, and blood on our clothes. I also know that one night I had a very vivid dream about being in the middle of some woods and seeing a UFO above me and when I woke up there were dead leaves in my bed that weren&apos;t there the night before.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We will attempt to put the witnesses in touch with a local investigator.  PD))", "5 black orbs ,in formation, gather into one egg shape form and fly off at 20 miles an hour ,at 3 thousand feet.I came outside to view the morning sky,the clouds etc. after checking for anything that moved, like planes ,some birds, i turn right above me just about and there was about 5 or 6 black dots about aprox. 3-4 thousand feet, as i made a double take and deciding it looked unusual,a formation, that didnt move,but suddenly they formed into one shape ,perhaps eggshaped, hard to say exactly. Before it did this , each one pusled a  light that surrounded it, then instantaneously became one and moved at about 20 miles an hour towards the south east,towards where the sun was already 20 degrees or more in the sky. I was the only one to see it take shape the others that looked couldnt figure out what i could be. One person said it might be a weather ballon and laughed at me after i said i doubted that since it was first 5 dots that formed into one shape. It might be a coinsidance but i felt that it detected i observed it and questioned what it was. This seems to be my 1st sighting. I feel it was orbs that joined together. However maybe it was alien craft ,with super small aliens?? who knows . ... please notify me if anyone else had seen this craft on that day.((NUFORC Note:  Second report from same witness.  PD))", "Several UFO&apos;s, one bigger one flew right over the car.Approx. 9 pm on Sunday night, my friend and I (we&apos;re both college students, both in our twenties) happened to notice 4 bright lights perfectly aligned in the sky, brighter than stars and seemingly in some sort of formation. We found it odd and began to drive further out into the country to get a better look. As we drove, the objects began to break formation, one even shot fairly quickly straight up into the sky. This left 2 of the objects, which had begun to blink red, green and white lights, remaining in the formation while the other two headed off in opposite directions. Even more intrigued, we drove out to a country road and parked the car, fascinated by what we were now seeing... the 2 crafts that had taken off were now inexplicably back, as well as a few more... all in all we believe there were at least 8 of these at varying points in every direction of the sky. At this time, they were all blinking, hovering (sometimes flying) and spaced at intervals, yet didn&apos;t appear to be much bigger than what an airplane flying by may seem to be.  Also at this time we were still trying to convince ourselves that perhaps these were some sort of strange airplanes or military crafts (though I&apos;ve never seen an airplane that could shoot straight up into the air, and there&apos;s no reason why 8 of these blinking objects would be patrolling the sky)...This continued for approx. one and half hours, at which time one of the objects which was low in the sky began all of a sudden to increase greatly in size, and took the appearance of a large ball of white light (Much bigger than a planet, and definitely in our atmosphere). It began to move quickly directly toward where we were sitting in our car on the side of the road, and as it approached it was very low, about tree line. There wasn&apos;t any noise except for a sort of low chugging sound, no emissions from the craft and no seeming way to propel it. It flew directly over our car and I got a good look at the underside of the craft, which I can only describe as a sort of rectangular shape with 3 bright white lights in a row (much like a large traffic light flying over the car, except all 3 lights were white.) Also on one side of the craft was a small blinking red light, and a green one on the other. After this craft flew over us and continued on, the other crafts began to blink sporadically and almost resembled faint strobe lights. *It should be noted,too, that during these few hours all of the crafts were alternating between hovering in the sky and flying around, so that at times some seemed to be dangling from strings in the sky, some seemed stationary, and some had no pattern at all other than to fly back and forth.* Awed by this sight, we decided to go out the next night (last night) as well and look for these objects, and sure enough they were there again. This time, though none of them came down to our level or flew over our car, 3 seperate crafts at about half hour intervals went from being small, blinking things to the large white lights that we first saw the day before. Each time this happened, the object would go from being small and blinking, to large and glaring, and then fade back to blinking and ascend straight up into the sky. All three were in the North-Northeast sky.", "Bright flash lightens up night sky, object fires across sky at unbelievable speed...On Sunday night, October 24, 2004, at 23:27 I was driving through Ashland County in Ohio around mile marker 197. I was in a van on I-71 heading towards Columbus. All of a sudden the entire sky turns bright. So bright in fact, that it looked like the middle of the day. This &ldquo;flash&rdquo; of brightness lasted about 2 seconds before the sky faded to dark black again. Although the moment was brief, I can recall certain aspects of the event. First off, I was staring into the horizon and/or just above it since I was driving (about 85 mph). I immediately thought to myself that a serious lighting bolt just dashed across the sky. But I also thought that never before had I seen one light up the sky like that. As I was thinking that, it immediately occurred to me that there were no clouds in the sky at the time and that I had not seen other lighting activity. As I was thinking this I was leaning towards the driver&rsquo;s side window to look outside and up. As I did, I noticed a black/dark, long tubular object (I couldn&rsquo;t guess its size/length) &ldquo;take off&rdquo; from with the middle of the sky. The term &ldquo;take off&rdquo; is used lightly here. There was no slow and steady acceleration. Instead, it looked like it went from 0-300 in 1.0 seconds. The only thing I could see was that it went in a West/Southwest direction. And the only reason I could see what direction it went in was because the sky was still slightly lit up, but fading fast. In it&rsquo;s wake, this object left what could be quite normally explained as a jet stream (??), or the white, long cloud-like formation we see planes leave in the sky. But this stream was different in the fact that the outer streams were a bright fiery red/orange. The middle of the stream was white. These bright red/orange streams hung in the sky for about 5 seconds before they turned to white streams and simply faded away like thin clouds. I should explain that the reason I didn&rsquo;t follow the object was because my brain knew it was too far gone. If you would have seen how quickly it jettisoned across the sky, your brain would also have &ldquo;known&rdquo; that it was visually untraceable. Therefore, I focused on the &ldquo;stream&rdquo; above me. I called the FAA around 01:45 on Monday, October 25, 2004 to inquire about others who may have reported something similar. The person I spoke to mentioned that he saw &ldquo;numerous&rdquo; reports on his way to his desk that had been filed tonight regarding this event. He mentioned that they will be following up with the National Weather Service to see what other explanations may be available. He was quite interested when I told him about the fiery stream and the object appearing out of nowhere. He also said that it could be a meteor, but that meteors do not usually behave in this fashion. I can understand lighting, and skies lighting up, and even meteors (although I&rsquo;ve never seen one that close). But what I can&rsquo;t understand, and this is the reason I&rsquo;m reporting this, is that the object I saw &ldquo;took off&rdquo; from within the middle of the sky. First off, how did it get there? Second, why did it take off immediately after the bright flash? And lastly, but more importantly, how the heck does an object move across the sky at that great a speed?((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor.  PD))", "cone changing into a circlethere was one object changing from cone to circular shape. it had white lights on the top then red then blue then green going down in a stripe pattern when in a cone shape. then it would turn ito a circle that was surounded in white lights and the center had red. within the center of circle a white light going dim then getting brighter every so often. it had itself placed as one of the stars on the big dipper and you could see it almost hovering to try to keep itself in that place. in binaculars it would change into the cone when it had drifted to far from the spot it was trying to stay in then return to circle when it was back in place. on the bottom you could see a hazy trail like it was fumes from whatever was holding it in place.((NUFORC Note:  Possibly Venus??  PD))", "Shooting star?While star gazing, I saw what appeared to be a shooting star. A fireball that appeared for under 2 seconds, then was gone.", "That&apos;s NOT the moon!There had been a lightning storm, the power was out, but the storm was over. We saw the full moon rise from behind the mountain, and someone said &quot;Look at the moon&quot; It rose so fast we knew it was not the moon. It was a very bright orb in the sky. moving quickly toward us and dancing around in jerky movements. Two of us ran outside to see better. It came closer, was very bright and gave off shadows, but no noise. We stood there awhile, I don&apos;t know how long. There was a feeling of awe and peace, but after awhile it came really close. The color went from orangey to whitish blue. Next I remember, I heard our other friend who had stayed inside yelling &quot;come back come back&quot; and the light slowly withdrew. We went inside and told him it was all right. The thing withdrew and danced off into the distance, then moved erratically and went straight out away. The clock was stopped, all power still off, so we don&apos;t know how long this took. It was really wierd and has stayed with me all these years, but I&apos;m not really sure of the date so the date and time are uncertain, only that it was in 1977 at Owl Head Ranch in the Tortilita Mountains of Arizona", "Triangle CraftA bunch of friends and myself went out camping on McGregor Lake, to get away from the city and enjoy the beautiful weather.  Right when we all laid-down underneith the stars, we started looking for falling stars and satilites.  Immediatly I saw a 3 point formation (triangle of lights, star size) move across the sky.  They were a bit larger than satilites, and didnt break from their triangle formation.  The craft made no noise, and flew from West to East.  Later on about 10 minutes later, the same craft or another of the same style flew over head, going south to north.About a month later I saw the same craft, but at 8pm.  I was in town and in my car at an intersection.  The craft flew over head from the north turned and headed east, away from my car.  The craft, unlike the previous two, had beams of light connecting the points of light on each corner of the triangle.  Like the craft had side doors along the length of each side and they opened, and a soft peach colored light glowed off the sides, then the stopped, then did it again.I just talked to a friend of mine who saw the 2 craft during our camping trip, and he saw 2 more just this last week (september 9th, 04)((NUFORC Note:  Witness does not indicate a time for the event.  We suspect the witnesses may have observed the three satellites, which fly in formation, and which we believe are part of the U. S. Navy &quot;NOSS&quot; satellite program.

It did not move or make a sound.  May have been 1 mile away.  We had just exited on 31st (?) heading south from Lake Shore Drive to head back north on LSD to find parking for a Fire game.  The craft was South West from this location.  There were no other craft visible in the area.  It appeared to be 30-50&apos; in diameter but there was no point of reference.  The shape seemed to be circular as if it were a very short hollow cylinder shape.", "Triangle of lights moving in a straight line across the Agean Sea almost west-to-east.We were aboard the Royal Clipper sailing from Losinj to Hvar on Friday, 20 August 2004 at 22:15 CEST (GMT+1) 44d06m09s N 14d44m06s E, looking at the beautiful starfield afforded by the view just behind the bridge. Maritime regulations require the front of a ship to be dark, so the view of the sky was quite good. We&apos;re suburbanites, and we don&apos;t get a good view of the sky including the Milky Way all that often. The only real issue was the haze: it had been a hot, muggy day, and the haze limited viewing to about 45 degrees from zenith. We were counting meteors (and a good count, too: stragglers from the Perseids?) when my eyes caught two lights almost directly overhead. The two lights were on the same line of flight but offset from one another. I&apos;m not good at magnitudes, but the lights were not that much brighter than most of the stars in the sky. What was obvious was that they were white and steady (did not twinkle like stars or blink/flash like aircraft navigation lights) and they were definitely headed in the same direction and staying the same distance apart. The two lights were about as far apart as 2 quarters held at arms length. They moved across the span of my fist at arms length in about two seconds. I figured this was a pair of fighters in formation except for the complete lack of jet noise. Then I saw the third light moving alongside the trailing light making an isosceles triangle about as long as it was wide moving in the direction of the narrow vertex. Again, the three objects maintained their spacing the whole of the time we watched. The ship was on a heading of 148.2 degrees magnetic (based upon the magnetic compass under my right elbow), and the object appeared to be headed toward about 110 degrees on the horizon. We lost the object in the haze at about 45 degrees from zenith. My darling wife saw the object as well. (Amazing I could get her attention given I had laryngitis and couldn&apos;t speak above a whisper.) She says that she saw the stars between the three lights blink out as they went by, but I&apos;m not so sure about that. The eyes can play tricks, and I&apos;m not certain that that &quot;blink out&quot; wasn&apos;t just the effect of ones eyes dealing with moving objects against a non-moving field. Of course we were alone on the foredeck during our sighting. Several people joined us just as we lost the object in the haze. Darling wife dived into the bridge to get our location and heading. My sense was that these three lights were very high up and resembled the Space Station or satellites I&apos;ve seen in that they were moving in a steady straight line. My first notion was that this was the NOSS satellite constellation. However, that system would be in a polar orbit. These objects were moving almost west-to-east ending up on the horizon at about 110 magnetic. I&apos;ve been searching my resources for another three-satellite system that goes west-to-east, but I&apos;m not finding one. So here we are...

I&apos;m a wanna-be astronomer - I don&apos;t know the names of constellations, but I know what my sky is supposed to look like.That&apos;s the only reason I even noticed. When I focused my binoculars on the ones that didn&apos;t belong, it was very difficult to estimate the altitude.  If I were to guess, I&apos;d say it hovered at about 500&apos; - 1000&apos;.  The object was not obviously solid, and appeared nearly the same color as the sky.  As it went overhead it had a more discernable shape, a &quot;dim&quot; triangle with a light at each point and one light in the center. It appeared slightly darker, but remained a close match to the sky color. After about 5 minutes of watching, the craft quickly accelerated from it&apos;s position directly over Bedichek Middle School at William Cannon and South 1st to what was probably about 500 mph or faster and didn&apos;t appear to change altitude - it was observable for another 5 to 6 seconds, and traveled directly over my house in a West (slightly SW) direction. When it moved, there was absolutely no sound.  It was palpable, though, felt almost like the air became thick and humid, and there was a barely detectable &quot;electrical&quot; smell in the air. about 1 minute after the ufo sped away, an aircraft (normal jet from Austin Airport in a normal pattern) passed over", "Band of red and white lights.

I noticed a strange formation that seemed to be a gathering of small dark objects. As it passed directely overhead, maybe 2 thousand feet or less, they gathered into one object ,hard to tell if it was rectangle or circle, it continued to fly due east . If they were birds then how come they gathered so close? I kept an eye on it as it reached the bay ,seemed to be going 20miles an hour. I&apos;m reporting this incase someone had a better look then me . I tried to find a north calif reporting center for ufos and only found south calif. Since i listen to Peter Davenport on Coast to Coast i decided to send it to you. I&apos;ve never seen birds bunch so close, perhaps they were higher up in the sky ??? and it was a optical illusion? I doubt it, because it seemed to me as it approached towards where the sun was rising ,it was clear to be on object.I felt they were probe that gathered into one shape and where heading towards east bay.

Towards the beginning of the show, the Mexico City sitings are highlighted.  One of the video camera shots is of multiple (approx. 15) UFOs clustered in the sky.  What I noticed was that the UFOs, if you connect them like dots, make the shape of a radar antenna.  They did not mention this on the show and I am not aware of anybody making this observation before.  Have you seen this or noticed this before?

Thanks, ((name deleted))", "strange lights follow automobileWhile milking the cows one night my father saw 3 bright lights hanging in the sky northwest of our farm. He began to watch the lights as he worked, as they appeared to move periodically then stop. He said he first became aware of feeling there was something feeling in the air which made him look around and see the lights.The light were togather but were not connected.They woud seem to be in formation,as in a triangle, then they would move into another pattern, or would just mold into another triangle with the lights in different places.It seems that there was a slight coloration in two of the lights, but it was subtle color.    Our farm sat on a pretty high hill and had good perspective of the surrounding area,and these lights did not seem to have much altitude.  After finishing the milking my parents brother and I got in our truck to go have a closer look at the lights. The lights were possibly 3/4 of a mile northwest of our farm so we went west to the first road north all the while the lights were clearly visible.  It was maybe 200 feet in the air, and moved from west to east as we approached.  This is a very primitive area of small farms, mostly having an incandescent light on a pole for a yard light if any outside light at all so there was no light contamination from man made sources.   We approached the lights  from the south, and were still to the east of it.  When we got as far north as the road would allow we turned west to get as close as possible.  It was then the lights seemed to get interested in us.  The lights moved east until they were parallel to us.  The movement was fairly quick and noticable, then as we drove slowly west on the road the lights moved parallel to our movement.  We would stop and watch the lights,and they would stop and hover.  The lights were perhaps 400 yards north of us and still roughly 200 feet in the air,but we heard no sounds coming from that direction.  As a matter of fact there was no sound of any kind to be heard. The very air around us seemed to deaden all sound even muffling the sound of our trucks engine. We drove to the next road then turned back south to the highway. The lights continued west for a short distance then turned south  with us only not quite coming to parallel with us this time.  We drove slowly watching the strange lights hoping it would not go away before we got to my grandparents house.  The lights did not come all the way to the highway but was still near enough to be seen clearly when we turned back east onto the highway.  When we turned east the lights turned east with us,but staying three or four hundred yards north of the highway.  The lights stayed with us until we reached my grandparents, but they were not home, so we drove another 1/4 mile up the highway to my aunt and uncles farm where we found my grandparents also.My father went into the house asking everyone to come out and look at the lights. There were 11 people all told with six adults four teenage children, and one younger (8) child.  We all watched the lights for another twenty minutes or more as they hovered in the sky periodically changing shapes,or patterns as though in a silent vacume,devoid of all night sound  you would have on a night in the country,no bug,no farm dogs barking,no cattle bawling....nothing. This was more troubling to all these farm people than the strange lights itself. Finally the lights just left.

It first had red and white blinking lights, then about an hour later, it had red, blue and white flashing lights.  It had three white lights under it with what appeared to be a red circular, glowing light under it.  Approx an hour later, we observed another red and white object, which appeared to be circular in shape.  Approx an hour after the second appeared, we saw another that appeared to be circular in shape and also had red and white flashing lights on it.  My daughter noticed that the three were in a triangular formation  shape...one on the right, one on the left, and one in the middle.  About 30 mins.after we saw the third one, a fourth one appeared.  This one also appeared to be circular in shape with red and white flashing lights on it also.  The first one was the largest of the four.  We sat and watched all four of them.  At times they would move to the left, right, up, down and even in circles.  We never heard a sound of any type.  They never moved fast.  The first and largest one disappeared first, just vanished.  The second one went slowly straight up and as it did, it&apos;s red and white lights turned into a golden color.  It went up and as it did, it got smaller until it actually ended up looking like a star and then just vanished.  We didn&apos;t stay outside too much longer after this, due to the fact that one of the two that remainded started slowly getting closer to us.

I do love to look at the sky on a clear night as we live in a rural area of south jersey and there is no light pollution. I am a real estat agent and familiar with the rural farmland area of this county.  There is a flight pattern for planes and they are usually u very high, look very small and move quickly along. We are just about 50 minutes from Atlantic City and Philadelphia Airports.  There are small airports in nearby towns.  I am familiar with the military planes that fly lower.  Two days a go on a clear October sky, as I was driving home from a late appointment, I was admiring a bright light that just seemed to flicker larger than most stars, thinking it was a plane, I tried to focus on it.  It never moved for about 10 minutes.  All of a sudden, it started to move very slowly, very far up, slower than the planes that passed it.  All of a sudden, it quickly moved down just over top of my car and just hoovered.  The shape was more triangular, but I could tell it wasn&apos;t a plane.  It had bright yellowish lights.  I heard no sounds as you do a plane.  It left lightning fast high into the sky and a second craft did the same.  I really had no idea what it was and figured it was just some new military craft.  There were about 4 other cars on intersecting streets, but I did not hear anything else about it. The next day at midnight, I was out at a charity dinner and on my way home. I saw the same two lights in the sky.  They didn&apos;t seem to be moving at all.  Planes passed high above them.  All of a sudden, they both started  moving slowly. They did not hoover over my car this time, but slowly moved along the sky and then moved directly down, not at an angle as a plane would.  My car radio did not work this time; all stations were static and when I got home, my power had been interrupted and I had to reset my clocks.", "TWO SIGHTINGS OF UNEXPLAINABLE LIGHTS OF DIFFERENT ORGINOn Sunday October,17th my two sons and i were traveling to Wabash,IN. and witnessed what we believe to be two ufos. We were driving and had just turned off of state road 22 eastbound onto county road 1350 heading north when we immediately noticed an extremely bright white light hovering just a little to the right off the road about the height of what a small plane would fly. Ruling out that it was&apos;nt a plane (since it was not moving) and seeing other aircraft in the vicinity, we kept our options open to see if it was moving towards us, it was not. As we continued to get closer we could most certainly tell that this was no aircraft with wings. This object appeared to be very large with a very bright intense white light that we could see some five miles away. Looking straight up in front of us wwithin a quarter of mile, it just vanished. The light had just completly turned itself off. We all three said practically at the same time, &quot;hey where did it go?, it&apos;s gone&quot; We were amazed at what had just happened. This is just the first one we saw. We continued to talk this over with each other for the next 7 to 10 miles i would guess approaching our turn onto the Miami-Wabash county line. When we were just about to turn right (this is in the Mississenewa lake area) we saw out in front of us a somewhat dim amberish orange light appear out of nowhere just about a half to a mile out in front of us. I stopped the van at our turn and we watched this light which seemed to be traveling at a super slow rate of speed for around 30 seconds. Once again, this light just semmed to turn itself off as quickly as it came on. That was it. I just have to say that i have seen unexplainable lights like this before when i would be driving alone over different periods of time but, never have i seen two different sightings on the same night within minutes of each other and having two other witnesses with me.

It almost looked as if something was shining a bright light on it for about 2 or 3 seconds.  About 30 seconds after they were no longer visible, an object(s) came from the north going south.  My first thought was a meteor, but then realized there were several lights.  Second thought was an airplane, but it was moving very quickly, seemed to be high up, and seemed to be very large.  There was a cluster of three or four lights, different colors but not sure what, followed by two small lights.  One light following was directly behind the cluster, the other was off to the side and rear.  This one appeared reddish.  There was no noise and it was moving too quickly to be a normal jet. The following night at the same time, 9:25 PM, I saw two orangish lights following each other from directly overhead, curving around south and then quickly to the west.

I was otherwise pre-occupied and didn&apos;t really sit down and talk with her about it until last night. She told me she was driving to the gym that day. It was late afternoon, perfectly clear sky and plenty of daylight. She was moving slowly in traffic when she caught something out of the corner of her eye. She looked up and saw what she believed was either a large private jet or a small commercial jet. The unusual thing is that, flying about two plane lengths ahead of the aircraft, she clearly saw what appeared to be a small silver ball. The plane and the object flew along a straight flight path. Judging from my daughter&apos;s descriptions, it appeared both were at around 10000 feet, flying perhaps a couple hundred miles an hour. Nothing erratic, just a smooth trajectory across the sky. She had them in clear view for less than a minute. However, during that time she saw the sun glinting off both the jet and the object. They maintained their relative distance from each other but my daughter was convinced that these were two discrete objects and not connected to one another in any way. Again, judging from a drawing she made, I estimate the object was no more than 10 feet in diameter. My daughter is a pretty level-headed young woman.  She said this was like nothing she had ever seen before.

He pointed above the trees, about 45 degrees up to a fuzzy but distinct patch of light approximately a degree in diameter. As an experienced amature astronomer my first impression was that it was the moon heavily obscured by clouds. I dismissed that idea since the moon would have been just rising in the east and this object was only a few degrees SW of corona borealis. Plus the sky was completely cloud free. I said to the guards that I was baffled and had never seen anything like it before. It resembled a comet but without a tail. At first it appeared stationary. The water display began, but I was more interested in this object and kept checking it out throughout the display. It passed through corona borealis slowly in a straight line. I would guess it moved about a degree a minute. As it moved it changed shape from what appeared to be elongated to more or less spherical. It also gradually and steadily diminished in brightness. I continued to track it until about 9:25 PM EST by which time I could no longer detect it. By that time it was entering the constellation Cygnus which was high overhead.

After they were out of viewing distance another single blinking light comes across the sky. 3 times did this ufo let off a light that lasted about 5 seconds each time and it was a orange redish glow that only shot upwards. That was it but remember during all of this it is cloudy no stars are visible.", "2 Orange Ovals fly at great speeds and making hairpin turns while surveying energy field in thunderstorm near Ottawa Ontario.April 21st, 2004. It was around 2:45 - 3:00 AM when the event took place. I had recently come home from a friend&apos;s house around 2:30 AM, after playing guitar and drinking coffee. Everyone at my house was in bed sleeping and I was all by myself. I realized that there was a storm brewing up in the sky, and being an avid storm watcher, I decided to stay up even later in hopes of seeing a few good bolts of lightning. I sat on my front porch watching for about 10 minutes and there wasn&apos;t much lightning except for one miniscule bolt. The sky looked as though it was full of energy. Greenish grey clouds were to my left and pinkish grey clouds to my right; the sky was completely overcast with no stars.  I sat there longer hoping the best was yet to come for the thunderstorm. Wihtin another minute or two, out of nowhere, a tremendous bolt of lightning shot down from the sky, one of the biggest I think I&apos;ve ever seen, lighting up everything around me for a split second. Deafening thunder crashed across the sky almost immediately after the lightning struck down probably only a couple of KMs south of my porch, and south of the town. I sat on the porch very excitedly and didn&apos;t take my eyes off the sky. Within a minute or two of the lightning, something else caught my attention in the sky. In my periphereal vison I spotted what first appeared to be a couple of shooting stars, falling into my view from behind the roof of the porch. As I looked on, I was able to focus on the falling objects as they suddenly started to slow down to a near halt. I quickly realized that I wasn&apos;t quite looking at shooting stars anymore, I was looking at two orange, horizontal ovals, both with noticeable dark oval rings that contained more orange within. The orange was dull and dark looking, as the objects appeared to be flying through the cloud cover. After the objects slowed down from falling straight down into view, they began to change direction at impressive speeds and impossible angles. At this point though, I couldn&apos;t quite tell if I was looking at two separate objects or just one. Both ovals flew perfectly side by side and in sync and the long sides of the ovals always stayed horizontal, even when making hairpin turns. After a couple of impressive turns, the ovals both made a sudden turn at a crazy angle and started to head Eastward to where the lightning had bolted down. As the ovals raced accross the sky, they drifted apart from one another and I  knew then for sure that I was watching 2 separate craft. After splitting up, one changed direction mid way and started to travel upward, while the other continued on an angle accross the sky and upward. As the one went straight up, the other climbed to a higher altitude on an angle and quickly made a sharp inverted angle turn back towards his companion (West). Just like they had it timed to the milisecond, the two objects intecepted one another and the object flying upward made a 90 degree turn on a dime and at the exact moment it intercepted its friend. Both objects then continued back in tandem, West accross the sky at very quick speeds and made one last turn-on-a-dime, zig-zag pattern turn before they decided it was time to bolt back North over the top of my house. The objects flew away at an fast speed and in a straight line. Before they disappeared the objects made a very loud, very shrill, hawk-like squeal, immediately after which, they picked up immense speed. Other than this squeal noise, the objects made no other noises whatsoever. The objects maintained the same colour and shape and didn&apos;t have any blinking lights. They flew like nothing I&apos;ve ever seen before. The objects appeared very shortly after the lightning had struck and seemed to fly around the perimiter of appriximately where it had struck. Not to mention the energy emitted from a bolt of lightning as big as I saw would surely be able to attract something&apos;s attention from miles away. The event lasted approximately 30 - 45 seconds. All details and drawings are as I documented directly after event took place, as I couldn&apos;t sleep too well after that.", "On the night of Sept. 2, 2004 at 8:20 pm.  There was a cloud formation with flickering lights shaped in an arch. Then these fireballs of red and orange in color started to appear.  They would reappear then disappear.

The camp was held in Santa Monica / Malibu mountains. This camp was only a Friday to Saturday night sleepover, returning late Sunday afternoon. At the time this event happened I was about 10 or 11 years old. Most of the kids in the camp were a similar age, give or take a couple 3 years up or down. In any event this would make the year about 1966 or 67. The night that this sighting happened, I and a small group of kids my age was walking back to the camp sight, which was a ranch where we bunked. I and a bunch of other young campers had just come from a scary story telling sessions by the camp counselors. We had all sat around a camp fire, maybe 50 - 60 kids as they told us these stories. When the session broke up we all headed back along the trail by which we had came . This was a tree line trail where the trees, pine I think, were a least 75- 100 or so feet high, maybe even taller. The elevation where we were at in the mountains was about 6500 feet. I remember this because the counselors told us the air was going to be very thin up where we were going when started the trip. It was very dark, but you could see by the star light okay. We might have had a flash light, but of that, I&apos;m not sure of. What happened next though I am sure of. I was walking back to camp with about 6 or 7 other boys about my age. The rest of the group with the counselor were spread out on the trail in front or behind us at some distance, but none were close enough to been seen, but could be heard. Suddenly, some one in our group spotted a bright light in the distance through the tree line. We all thought it was a star, but someone said it way getting bigger. As we watched this light get bigger and bigger, very quickly, say in about five second or so, it went from looking like one of the stars in the night sky to a giant dark triangular shaped craft zooming directly over our heads in what appeared to be 2 - 3 hundred feet above the tree line. It was huge. It was close. It made all most no sound, but it could be heard, like a whooshzz sort of sound, but definitely extremely quite for  how close and large it was. The bottom of it was line with circular colored lights, I believe red, yellow/white, blue and may be green. They seemed to be flashing a bit. As it passed over our heads we tracked it. Even though up close we only got a good 2-4 second look up close at it from front to back you could see all the detail in it. It was big like a football field. It disappeared in the distance in another three to five seconds, looking like a star again and that was it. We all turned to each other and said  &quot; wow, we just saw a ufo!&quot;  Strangely enough I don&apos;t recall us talking about it to much back at camp and I don&apos;t even recall if I ever mentioned it to my dad. But I can tell you this, to this day I can still see it in my mind as clearly as if it happened yesterday. I know what I saw. As a side note about 15 years ago a friend of mine gave me Whitely Stribbers Communion book and told me I should read it. I really had no interest in it, but one night I felt strangely compelled to start reading it. I suddenly came across a passage where he starts describing the object I saw that night. I have since come to find that Art Bell has seen the same object. The thing that is most interesting to me was the time frame when I saw it, the mid 60&apos;s, and where, the Malibu mountains. I mean that still pretty close to a big city. I have never seen anything since, but I have had two freakish events I kind of relate to that incident. The first is, I was house sitting a place in Mar Vista California around the time I started reading the Stribber book. The girl whose house it was, was a film editor. Before she left on her trip we were partying a little at her house. In the bed room she had big sliding doors. Now I admit we were a little drunk but she swears she saw a ufo looking up from her bed through those doors while we were talking. She got very scared. And for some reason, I to seem to get unnaturally scared.  For the next week as I house sit at her  place I could not go to sleep before dawn. I was terrified every night. The second event was about 5 years ago. I thought I woke up and saw a gray alien, the ones with the big eyes standing by my side of the bed. My girlfriend was asleep. I got the distinct impression that he (why do I think it was a &quot;He&quot;? ) was surprised I woke up. I got mad and I punched him in the face, then I suddenly fell back to sleep. When I woke up the next morning, I thought that was a strange dream. Some how I&apos;ve always thought that these event&apos;s were connected, but the first one is the only one I can be sure that happened.", "Bright lights and shaking New South Wales Australia 6th December 2004My partner woke up at 4am eastern sumer time today after hearing our verandah sliding glass door shaking. when she got up I looked out the window in a half asleep stete and thought it was dawn already as there was a light on the horizon out side. i rolled over and went back to sleep but my girl friend got up and stod on the verandah looking into the fogy morning light but after 10 min it faded back to darkness. Now when I got up at 5:30am to drive into Sydney to go to work i was listening to tripple J fm radio and this strange phenomna was mentioned on the breakfast show with Robbie buck and a truck driver and another woman from the NSW mid north coast rang and said they saw a btight light and shaking foundations like earthquake but I cant find anything about it since. then when my girlfriend drove home tonight naer Werington in western Sydney she saw a bald man with tall pointy features on a motor way overpass his mouth wide open staring at the trafic where pedestrians should not be .It freaked her out and she ran the police reporting a suspected suicide but realy thought he looked like an alien. has any one seen these lights or herd the reports i heard on the radio this morning.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Back in the Nam I was part of a LRRP unit. LRRP stands for Long Range Recon Patrol and it consisted of a team of 6 men. a Team Leader, Asistant Team Leader, Medic, Engineer, Weapons Specialist, and Radioman. I was out with my team in IV Corps in the Vietnam Jungles. We had humped through the boonies all day and we set up an NDP (Night Defensive Perimeter). We took turns sleeping and keeping watch. At about 01:45 I heard movement ahead. My bro Levin heard it too. We woke up the other 4 men and we all readied ourselves for the upcoming contact. Suddenly we saw it... an alien. In real life. My stomach sank as I saw the creature. It looks like the modern alien... a grey human with a long face and large black eyes. It gave off an eery glow. Anyway, my friend Boltach raised his weapon and fired. He hit the being in the head with a short controlled burst. A brilliant blue syrupy fluid splattered the trees behind the alien. Just then we saw a dull light in the sky. Back then, we had a device called a Starlight scope. Only special operations had them. It is a lot like night vision. I focused in on the light in the sky and at that moment two more lights appeared. They formed the shape of a perfect triangle. The light at the top circled the two below in a figure 8 and zipped off. The remaining two seemed to collide and both zip off in the same direction as the first light. That night two other LRRP teams in our AO (area of operations)reported in the same activities. We called into HQ and they said they were having radio problems and would be offline for the rest of the night. We linked up with the other 2 teams for security reasons and shared our encounter with them. 4 of the other men with me on my team that night were later killed in various engagements in the war and I haven&apos;t been able to get in contact with anyone from the other teams.

I was wondering if maybe you know what these lights were.  With my back to the ocean, the light appeared just a little to the left.  It was high in the sky. About cloud level at maybe a 45 degree angle from me.  It was round about the size of your little finger nail held out at arms length.  The light first appeared by itself for about two seconds then another light seemed to come out of it like almost instantly to the left.

As the object rose up the light became brighter and very large.  The ship was about fourteen miles off shore and the light about ten miles from the ship between the ship and the land.  The light became so bright that no man made object at that time could have been powered by batteries that would have given off that amount of light.

It flew up and along the port side the ship at a height of around one hundred feet.  It was grey in colour, I could see red, green and a yellow lights flashing in sequence anti-clockwise around the circumference of the disc.

Directly above my bed are three windows with 12&quot;x&quot;12 glass panels. The television was to the left of my bed. Suddenly, my attention was drawn to the floor approximately four feet from the desk my television was on. What I saw was a beam moving very quickly in small circles in one concentrated spot on my floor. The circle motions it made were not perfect, the best I can describe them as were &quot;wobbly circles&quot;. The beam was solid, pure solid light and approximately an inch wide...it was fairly thin. The color was a pure white with somewhat of a blueish tinge around the outside of the beam. The beam itself was bright, but did not seem to emit any light beyond its edges. My room was NOT filled with light, only this beam. I was able to watch for about 5 seconds before I fled my room in a state of total panic. I was not able to tell exactly which of the three windows the beam was aimed through, but assuming that had it beamed straight into my room onto the wall parallel it would be 90 degrees, I would estimate that it hit my floor at a diagonal angle of about 60 degrees. When I got downstairs, I looked outside to see any evidence of a craft (I have never to my knowledge witnessed a UFO) and there was none. There were no aircraft of any kind besides high-flying commercial planes. I did not tell anyone in my house about what I had seen.

The figure had NO discernable features in its face, no clothing, no hair. Just a round head and human like torso were all we were able to make out. It was impossible to make a height estimate. It was for certain INSIDE our house, not a reflection from outside. The sighting of this &quot;being&quot; lasted 3-4 seconds.

I assumed at first it was a low flying aircraft on it&apos;s approach to the airport coming from the EAST. I thought this was an aircraft possibly in trouble due to the speed and angle of descent compared to most other aircraft that are approaching Orlando&apos;s airport.

What reminded me of booster rockets off of a shuttle or a multi staged rocket left me to believe at first that this was some sort of secret launch that went awry or a secret shuttle mission that launched however, I knew that all shuttle launches during take off execute a pitch and roll immediately out into the Atlantic so as to be far from land in the event of an emergency. Keep in mind,, I still don&apos;t know how far the object was in the sky relative to where I was. Even know I can see the shuttle burn from a day or night time launch from Orlando, the distance would be too far from the cape to see individual rocket boosters fall off. These 2 objects that broke off did not emit any light but the light from the Original object was enough to see these two objects separate from the original at the same time and leave a trail of what looked like white smoke. So far still no noise. Then, 3 seconds after the 2 mini objects broke off,,, a light so bright started to shine everywhere. It wasn&apos;t blinding like the sun,, however, it shined brighter. It lit up the whole sky and the neighborhood, brighter than the 12&apos;oclock sun. I stood still and was able to continue looking at the source of the light. The object was still in the same spot in the sky. I thought this was a nuclear blast of the air burst type however, the light kept shining for about 35 to 40 seconds. This light wasn&apos;t vibrating or sporadic,,, like you would see in fireworks,, or a flare or a meteorite in the sky. It maintained a constant candlepower without the strobing effect. I remember looking all around to see if this light was concentrated in a specific area. The whole sky and everywhere I looked,, this light was shinning. If it wasn&apos;t for me knowing where the object was in the sky,, it would of been hard to tell where the light source was coming from directionally since it appeared to be coming from everywhere. After what seemed like 40 seconds,, this light shrinked back to its source in the sky. The strange thing was that the brightness of the light remained the same while the area it was covering started to shrink back to the object. It took about 5 seconds from when it started shrinking, until all you saw was the object still hovering in the same spot in the sky. Then within a second, this object shot right back up into the atmosphere at what appeared like light speed. It left in the opposite direction, not directly up, more like up and eastward at an angle. The trail it left didn&apos;t appear to be smoke. It was more like the trail you would see if you waved a kem-lite in front of your face in the dark from left to right as fast as you can. It took off so fast without noise that it left a light trail for about 2 seconds. According to local radio stations and the local CBS TV affiliate, (www.local6news.com) hundreds of people in Orlando that were traveling to work or on the road reported the blinding light. Most witnesses said it lasted between 30 to 50 seconds. Some drivers were running through traffic lights because they couldn&apos;t tell if the lights were green or red. A meteor scientist from Brevard county on the east coast said he witnessed the object that morning and gave coordinates that put the object directly above OIA. (Orlando International Airport)", "3 laser red lights forming a triangle and at times a straight line traveled west to east slowly. after 20 minutes one disappeared.  AnoWe saw the lights over Tinley on August 21st so we have been looking alot more at the sky lately and have our phones programmed to call each other if it happened again.  Tonight it did just that. Three bright (laser-like) lights coming from the west and traveling east at a slow rate of speed.  I received the call when they were directly over my house.  There was enough time for me to go out see them and then run back in and get my camera and binoculars and take some pictures and video as well.  The lights were initially in a straight line from my perspective and slowly transformed into a triangle.  They seemed to continue in a triangular pattern although their reletive positions changed throughout its eastward course. As I watched their eastward progression with binoculars the triangle seemed to have its peak pointed north and the base to the south.  The top south light seemed to move down quite quickly and become lower in the sky than the light that was initially lower than it.  It then disappeared and only 2 lights could be seen.  There was no sound.  I could not see any structure around or between the lights.  Because there were clouds and no stars visable, I could not tell if anything was visable through the triangle. Just now I came back in the house. At 21:25 I received a call that another single light was coming from the west.  It could be seen due west above the house line moving on a course east northeast.  This single red light flew over the house and as it approached a 1:00 position it was lost in the clouds.  These clouds appear to be very high as there has been alot of air traffic seen this night and all planes visible. This occurrence of a single red light traveling from the same direction as the previous 3 was the same situation that occurred August 21, 2004.", "I saw a shiny slender object in the sky while driving north on 435 at about 7:30.  There is a large Bayer factory next to the highway, and in the distance, past the smoke stack, I could see the object in front of some clouds.  It looked like it was really far off in the distance, however it was very distinct, anyone looking could have seen it.  The airport is some distance away further north, so I am not ruling out it was an airplane.  But, it didn&apos;t look like it was moving.  After I changed lanes by about Front Street, I could not see it anymore.  Just seemed strange, I could not see any lights on it, the whole thing just seemed to reflect in the morning sun.", "Many lights of different brightness combine, get brighter and disperse.It was the night of the total lunar eclipse. My best friend and I were out looking at the sky waiting for his wife to come out of her grandmas house. I noticed these two bright lights about 1 mile away above the tree line. The lights were verticaly aligned with on another. The top one was alot brighter than the bottom one. There were also about five or six others hovering around the top one but they weren&apos;t all that bright. The top one slowly lowered itself to the bottom one and when it touched it, it got brighter. The top one rose back up to its original spot and the bottom one was gone. Almost like they combined. After the brightest one was in place the other little ones all moved in to combine with the brightest one and it got even brighter. After a couple of seconds we seen a bunch of streaks shoot from the light in all different directions so fast we barely seen it. As soon as that happened the brightest star dimmed back to its original brightness. Then another not so dim light appeared below it like before and the whole thing repeated for about 30 minutes. We then seen alot of airplanes or jets flying in that direction, i&apos;d say 10 or so. Suddenly the light got real bright and then shot in all directions and then we saw what looked like glitter all over the sky in the area. The lights never appeared again. At least not that night. There were 7 of us that seen it by the end and we were all in amazement. This all happened north of Mansfield.", "I saw a triangular shaped object having one white light of each corner on the Halifax Nova Scotia harborcam on 10/27/04 around 1917 EDTI saw a triangular shaped object outlined by three white lights on the harborcam of the http://novascotia.cbc.ca web site.

I was on my way to an evening class.  I exited Cumberland Parkway onto I-64 ((CORRECTION BELOW:  I-65)), about 15 miles north of Bowling Green (or 75 miles north of Nashville).  I was travelling westbound on this 6 lane stretch of highway;it is  generally a N/S highway but this stretch from the Mammoth Cave Area to BG is east/west; traffic was moderate.  I saw in the sky in front of me what looked like three military jets.  There is often air traffic from Fort Campbell to the west.  The three &quot;planes&quot; were close together, but all three seemed to be going in different directions.  They were about 1/4 to 1/3 up from the horizon. Because they were low in the late afternoon sky it looked like they were illuminated by the sun.  It was a mostly sunny day.  Two of the objects looked like planes moving directly away from me, i.e. also travelling westbound, because they looked like little reflective, vaguely diamond shaped points of light.  As represented by the scale of my hand at arm&apos;s length from my face, the appeared to be about the size of wooden matchheads, about 10 inches apart, and both at the same height;  the third object just looked like a short contrail line (maybe 1 inch long on that same scale, in a horizontal plane, and appearing to be moving to the north, VERY SLOWLY. They were quite distinct and quite bright.  I thought little of it, but the odd thing was that they seemed to be together, yet going in three directions.  Actually, the two  diamond objects, I observed, did not seem to be moving at all, but the line object was moving to the right, ever so slowly.  They were directly in front of me and quite bright, thus easy to watch continuously.  After about 10 minutes the diamonds still had not moved, but now the line, which didn&apos;t change shape, started moving back towards the diamonds.  After 10 minutes I knew that this was something that I could not explain.  I did notice that the objects were beginning to set like planets or stars.  Perhaps they were satellites, but were very fixed, except for the line one.After about 20 minutes, I stopped at a rest area right before my exit, to see if I could talk to someone else about this phenomenon, or corroborate what I saw.  I asked one man, and he noticed it and saw it for a long time as well.  I also asked a trucker and he hadn&apos;t noticed it.  By this time it was getting close to sunset, and the objects were too low in the sky to see. When I got to class, the professor was tardy and I took the opportunity to ask my fellow students if any of them had seen it.  Only one man, who came along the same route, saw exactly the same thing that I described, although he though that the thin &quot;line&quot; object was spinning.  He also agreed that the two diamond objects were in a fixed relationship, the one to the other, while the other object moved back and forth. Does anybody have any explanation for this?((CORRECTION FROM WITNESS))Correction to my entry - I-65 and not I-64Was listening to your show tonight and checked an old entry I made.  There is one typo.

I was walking my friend to his car which was parked at our garage located in the back of our home. Crossing the back yard I had happend to look to the southern part of the sky. That night the &quot;Northern Lights&quot; were visible in the sky. As I looked to the South part of the sky, I noticed 2 bright red lights flickering in the distance. They seemed to be only a few blocks away, could have been miles, but they seemed close. I pointed it out to my friend, and we watched it for a while. He said it was a plane, but I said it&apos;s moving way to slow, maybe it&apos;s a helicopter. But there were no other lights on it. Just two red lights that would blink or flash one after the other. My friend told me to stop talking about it, because he had to drive 40 miles alone back to his home. I don&apos;t know what it was, but it was awesome.", "Myself and my partner at work were standing outside smoking a cigarette and we were watching an airplane fly over head when we oticed a second object in the vacinity of the airplane that appeared to be a bright orange light, similar to what you would see as the sun rise reflecting off a metalic object moving across the sky. It had no vapor trail as did the air plane, and it changed direction once or twice and then disappeared. There were no clouds for it to fly behind, just clear sky. the event lasted about 5 - 10 seconds. 30 seconds later it reappeared in a slightly different location behind its initial direction of movement, stayed stationary and vanished yet again.

I had been walking for approx 1 hour and approaching the village of Vernhan Dean.This is a small village with a few street lights.I noticed a bright orange light that appeared stationary,it was partly shielded by a tree i assumed it was a light on top of a pole or mobile telephone mast. As i walked and got nearer the object, the tree no longer impaired my vision it then began to catch my eye, the colour was bright orange and glowed like a ball of flame.It had appeared stationary, however it then began to move quickly vertical and horizontal passing overhead, it was difficult to tell how high or close it was, there was not any noise associated with the object,it appeared to travel very smoothly and without effort.I had a very powerful spotlight with me and decided to direct it at the object, to my amazement it instantly vanished.

Its shape was rectangular, with a dark line dividing it in half, almost like a kite. At first its color was a faint blue. It did not move in a straight line, its trajectory was erratic, dipping and rising quickly back up. It flew close to the horizon. About five minutes after it vanished, it came back again, traveling north to south like it had before. At first, it was rectangular and blue like during its first passing, but the &apos;kite-like&apos; appearance changed to a simple white star-like point, and continued south.

The lights came to my attention as I was exiting my driveway at around 4:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time, although, I simply disregarded their existance at first as the area that I was viewing them was just 3 miles away from Selfridge Air National Guard Base and to have planes and various other aircraft fly over and around this area are typical on any given day.  I proceeded to drive to a local cafe which had a drive through window and continued to notice the two lights that were fixed in the northern sky. The food order that I had placed took a considerable amount of time (about thirty min.), and I became to be interested when I noticed that these lights could not have been from aircraft as they had stood completely still for slightly more then a half hour. After I collected by food I intentionally drove to a dark secluded parking lot in Harrison Township which is just outside of my mount clemens where I had initially observed the lights, and I parked and gave careful consideration to their continued existance.  Upon closer observation and comparision to various stars that appeared in the same area as these lights I could see that ALL of the stars that were in the sky were so lacking in their brightness in comparision to the lights that I had now been observing for an hour that there was no way that they were anything except that of being man made in their nature. After about two hours of careful observation the lights still remained in exactly the same location as when I first observed them, fixed very high into the northern sky. After the two hours of my time had passed, I tired and retreated for the night, last viewing the lights at around six a.m. eastern standard time.Bio of the observer:  The observer who relayed the above account is ((personal information deleted.

Some distant lights caught my eye. Though far away the lights were quite bright. Unlike aircraft they were moving about independently, up and down and at angles, and in circular motions. There appeared to be 3 white lights which would fade to a blueish color [also independently] around a reddish,orange center light. Since I was the only one to see it I kept it to myself. However the next morning I heard on the radio that others had seen similar lights very early that next morning in what would&apos;ve been the same basic area. [I94/I275] The radio station was 104.3 FM and if memory serves there also a brief mention on the TV news, channel 2.

It also drifted to the west in a hover from about mile post 165 to the east end of town.  Then the rotation stopped and the craft moved straight North.  At this point I had pulled off to the side of the road and got out of my truck.  the light were shaped in a Trapezoid formation with a spot light in the center that would come on  intermitantly.

As i told you we continued to see extremely heavy air traffic coming in from the south appearing to be at different alititudes.We drove toward the south then i stopped off of hiway 287 on 488, there was another aircraft coming toward us. I watched it with my binoculars. As it passed over i could clearly see a single triangle shaped aircraft with a white light on each corner and a red blinking light on the right tip.A green blinking light on the leftThe more i think about the aircraft at malakoff, if you took two of the single aircraft and connected them where there should be some kind of thrust output,then turned it sideways that would be exactly what i saw at the roadside park.I stated that the malakoff aircraft had 4 white lights, all the others had 3 lights, maybe when they docked with each other two of the lights on the rear are covered up by something.Then again maybe the single triangle aircraft were usaf stealth fighters following the aircraft i described at malakoff,tx.", "3 motionless red spheres of lightWitnessed three balls of red light in the southeasterly direction in the sky.

It was a warm and sunny day with clear skies all around.We heard a loud steady noise coming from the top of the hill (similar to wind blowing through a pile of irrigation pipe commonly used at that time). We ran to the top of the hill where the noise was coming from but did not see any irrigation pipe anywhere. We were standing in what seemed like a very strong wind blowing straight down on us and the noise was coming from above us. The pasture grass was blown flat as if you would hold a leaf blower down to the ground. The area that was being affected was about 30&apos; in diamater. As we stood there mystified as to what was causing the noise and wind, it started to move to the east away from us and  subsided. We did not see any object in the sky. I really do not remember thinking about this to much but it is something that I have never forgotten. Several years ago I was having a couple of beers with a friend of my that was there that day. I said to him &quot; Do you something that we have never talked about?&quot; and he replied &quot; You mean that day we went fishing?&quot; and he refused to discuss it further. It seems strange that he would know exactly what I was talking about almost forty years later. I talked to a meterologist several weeks ago and described to him what we heard and felt and he did not seem to think it could have been a wind shear.

At first I thought it was a spotlight pointed skyward and reflecting off the clouds. But I soon noticed that it appeared to be more than one light. The lights would converge and get slightly brighter. Then they would shoot outward spinning in a counter clockwise motion then coming together again before repeating. It looked to me that there were four of these lights. The lights were soft, diffuse, white in color and would become elongated the further they moved away from their convergence point. My wife saw this also, she called the local police to see if anything was going on in the area but they said no. We live in the country just outside a small town. I did not see any beam of light coming from the ground like you would normally see with a bright light and I would assume you would need a powerful light to illuminate the clouds as these clouds were very high. The only variance I saw with the lights was that sometimes the lights appeared to shoot farther out after coming together. My wife said she thought the lights changed shape slightly but I could not tell. This lasted for about 20 minutes. To be honest I have no clue what these lights were, I wondered if they may have been coming from above the clouds. Anyway, although there is probably a natural explanation for what we saw, we thought it was strange and having never seen anything like this before we wanted to report it.", "UFO visits in Tinley ParkOn October 31, 2004 I was sitting inside my house when my little brother came in the house yelling about UFOs outside.

A few degrees above the horizon I saw what appeared to be a &quot;falling star&quot;, i.e., a streak of white light moving downward. There was another white light just to the right of that, which I assumed was a star or planet. However, a few minutes later, I saw a series of lights in the same area of the sky that behaved oddly. I had traveled about five miles farther north, and it seemed that the lights I witnessed were now closer to me, i.e. somewhat larger and brighter, and a little higher in the sky. First, there was one light that seemed to be stationary, but appearing slightly larger than Venus on a clear night. What got my attention was that suddenly a second light appeared beside it, separated by a little distance, then a few seconds later a third light appeared, the same size, brightness, and distance apart, so there were three in a very straight alignment, parallel to the horizon. Next, the light on the left end of the formation dimmed and went out; it took about 1/2 second to fade out, it didn&apos;t just blink off. As soon as it had gone out, a fourth light appeared on the right end of the formation, so there were three again. It was exactly the same size, brightness, and distance apart as the others. After a few more seconds, they each faded and dimmed out, one at a time, in sequence from left to right. After that, nothing.

I crossed the hall and looked out her window and saw three lights, triangular shape with one light at the top and two on the bottom, drifting slowly across the sky. I told her it was a jet, but she said &quot;no, they were doing something strange a moment ago&quot;.  A minute later, the lights stopped moving and then began to flash (white flash) one at a time with the brightness of a flashlight right in your face.

I thought: &quot;Wow, what a beautiful star, and it&apos;s sparkling! When I looked at other stars, they all were dim, and so far away, and motioneless. And this one was alive. As I kept watching, I realized that it was moving slowly and rays of light of different size came out of it. It looked like a miniature lightning, only it was not dissappearing. I couldn&apos;t see the shape of it or details of the craft, I could only see the rays of light, stretching far out of it.

I turned and saw about 8-10 objects in the Northern horizon moving up and to the east.  Just to the Northwest of these lights was a low hanging strange like smoke that moved in the same direction of the lights.  I watched lights for about 30 seconds, thinking they where balloons.  Then I went into my house.  Immediately upon entering my house I received a telephone call from a friend of mine that lives on the second floor of my building, come outside on the patio immediately.  By this time, her son was on the patio as well as my neighbor that lives directly below me.  We began to watch these 10-12 of these objects in the sky.  My friends looked at them with binoculars and we quickly decided that they where not balloons but some type of light.  They seemed to launch from somewhere on the horizon and move up and to the right.  We watched this set of lights until they we could no longer see them anymore.  This went on for about an hour.  I would say we saw a total of 4 sets of these lights.  We where so amazed with the lights and the strange looking fog on the horizon that we failed to take any pictures.  Living near DFW airport we are use to seeing lots of airplanes.  We did not see airplanes last night, we even joked because we saw airplanes flying in different points in the sky.

As I often do, I put on our TV in our room which helps me to get to sleep. As I watched a National Geographic special I became groggy. Knowing that keeping the TV on all night bothers my wife, I grabbed the remote and switchd off the TV and quickly fell into a deep sleep. In what seemed an instant after doing so, I was awakend by my wife who questioned me as to &quot;where I was&quot;. My immediate response was &quot;in our bed&quot;. My wife then explained to me that she awoke because she sensed that I was not in bed with her. She then stated that she searched the whole house and even walked to the guard house in her pajamas of our community to see if anybody had been permitted to drive to our residence to pick me up. She was told nobody had come into the community. Upon her return, she burst into the room and found me in our bed. She stated that my car was in our driveway, and that my walllet, cell phone and money was just as I had left it in our kitchen when we went upstairs, which further upset her. She knows me well enough to know that if in fact I left our home for some reason, I would have taken these items with me. We do not live near any stores or establishments that one could walk to. As I awoke, she further explained that the covers in our bed on my side looked exactly as if I had pushed them down and left the bed. Realizing that she was not kidding, I informed her that I just turned off the TV and fell asleep. She then reconfirmed that she searched our entire residence and that I was not physically present. I glanced at the clock and it was about 2:30 am when she stormed into our bedroom and awoke me with this shocking news. I tried to comfort and console her at this point and confirmd that to my knowledge I had not left our bed, not even to use the bathrooom. Not really sure what had happened, we went back to bed. When I awoke, I asked her to confirm what had happened and that either her nor I were dreaming. She confirmed it. Somehow, I do not think either of us actually accepted this event as reality because we awoke and did not talk about it. As a believer, I felt that I needed to let soembody know and help me to understand what might have happened. So I searched the web and found this site to report incidents. I called and was instructed to file this report as I am. I consider myself of sane and sound mind and am a local business owner. I was also instructed to have my wife file an incident report which will be done first in the am. I am aslo willing to have this event scrutinized by any means required to validate it including onsite investigation, cameras, lie detectors anything. It almost seems like something out of the Twilight Zone and I feel more confused than anything. I am not sure what really happened, the evidence has it that I was some how physicaaly missing form my home for 45-60 minutes without my knowledge. I was told to examine myself for any marks, and did not find any. However, from the base of my throat to the middle of my chest it is mildly red, as if I had been exposed to the sun. I can tell because when I press teh area, a brief mark apears such as when one gets a sunburn and presses the afected area with a finger. The rest of my body is unaffected.

It was approximately 3:30 pm in the afternoon on a beautifully clear fall day, I happened to notice what appeared to be a black object moving toward the north at a speed I would guess to be from the distance from where we were to be about 100 mph. It appeared to be about 500 feet above the ground. I quickly ran out the front door to get a better look, as my dad followed behind me. As we viewed the object from the street to get a better view, I shouted back to my wife to bring my binoculars out. When we arrive on the street, the object had almost slowed it&apos;s forward motion to a stop, and started a slow but steady upward motion to the south / southeast, but a more stright up motion than anything.As we were viewing this object, another object came across moving in the same northerly direction, about the same speed, but this one did not slow down or change direction. The objects appeared to be black in color, and from what I could see, ( as the objects appeared to be about a mile to a mile and a half from where we were ), each looked to be like two very big &quot; black donuts &quot; overlaping each other with something attached inbetween. They made no noise. The had no lights. The color was more than black, it was like the absents matter. My father and I viewed this one object through my binoculars until it accended out of sight, as a small black dot thousands of feet toward the Gulf of Mexico which is about 50 miles from our hometown.The rest of the story.....I call the Regional airport in Lake Charles, (a larger town just east of Sulphur) and ask to speak to someone in the control tower. Well to make a long story short, I was told that you could not talk to them, and So I then asked the person who had taken my call if he could ask them if they had spotted anything unusual on their radar. He called back to inform me that &quot; even if they had, they could not tell me &quot;!!! But,they did give me a UFO hotline number to call. Well, I  called  and got a recording to leave information...which I did. I never received a return call on this.I guess in all, the most disturbing thing about this to me was the fact that it seemed that my dad, wife and my mother and I were the only ones that saw this that afternoon. The people that I told about it acted like &quot; yea sure....&quot; ???  Since then, I have been very selective with who I share this story with. NUTS right ??  My dad nor myself use alcohol or smoke. My dad is in his seventys and I in my fiftys.At the time I saw these, I guess one of my real concerns was that these could be some kind of remote controlled bombs floated in from the Gulf of Mexico, as we do live in an area with oil refineies and other plants. Of course, this took place before 911 in New York City and the government was not as alert as they are now.

The sky was not totally dark yet, I would say it was about 20-25 minutes before max darkness.  When the Space Station was approx. 60 degrees above the eastern horizon I observed an extremely bright light develop rapidly about 5-10 degrees to the left (north) of the Space Station and apparently slightly below the equivelent elevation of the Station.  The light developed rapidly to a brightness about ten times the magnitude of Venus, about 4 or 5 times the brightness of a landing light.  It lasted for about 4 seconds and then rapidly dimmed to a glowing pinpoint as it traveled very slowly from my right to left.  The trajectory appeared to be about 10-15 degrees apart from a line directly between me and the object, I could not tell if it was coming toward me or going away (although my initial impression was that it was coming toward me), and I estimate it&apos;s position as somewhere over northern Montana. It continued to dim and vanished as it moved slowly.  It appeared to move much more slowly than a meteor, although the shallow angle might account for that.  It was the brightest thing I have ever witnessed in the sky other than the moon or the sun.  I have witnessed many meteors but my first remark to my mother, who saw the object also, was, &quot;what the hell is that?!&quot;  I thought it might be a module that, according to the NASA website, would soon detach from the Space Station and burn up in the atmosphere, however that would most likely appear to be UNDER the trajectory of the Station, and I doubt they would do it over a populated area.

Was there any crash during this time frame near Santa Barbara?  WJS reported 11-10-04", "We were driving in a car going south on us1. just south of the airport i said look at that.

After spotting the pulsing light that seemed somewhat orange-white, I observed that it moved up and down, in a zig zag, moved to the right and left, sometimes hovered.  For about 15 minutes my father and i discussed the strange movements over the telephone while the craft zipped around.  The craft was high above the treeline, probably in the area of aircraft flight patterns.  It was also observed the craft became stationary for some time when for some reason, aircraft traffic increased.  At least 7 flights passed in the area of the sighting.  It started to look like a regular junkyard in space.  If this was a military flight, I&apos;m impressed with the technology.  If this was something extra-terrestrial...why didn&apos;t the other aircraft seem to be aware of it?", "Glowing white circular object seen in the Florida Everglades around 1980.This incident is one of two. This occured near the Everglades Nat&apos;l Park. Me and a friend were having a night time picknick in the Everglades Parks. There was no road, I drove a 4x4 truck east fm US1 into the Everglades. We saw what appeared to be a Glowing White circular object traveling parallel to the ground about 6-7 feet off the ground. It traveled very slowly. I would estimate around 15-20mph. It was not a meteor, it was going way to slow. And it was not on fire, just glowing white light. It felt as if it was inspecting us. It emitted no sound. We watched it go by and we later left.

The one on the right dissappeared, the the one on the left. About two minutes later, 3 more lights appeared horizontally in the same area. All were stationary and very bright. As one dissappeared on the right, another appeard on the left. No more than 3 were visable at a time, but 5 lights eventually appeared, all positioned horizontally. It was odd, that afterwards, we saw what could have been 3 jets(blinking lights in the sky, followed by the sound of jets once they moved), hovering around the area. They spent approximately 5 minutes flying around the area of the bright lights, before heading south and out of the area. We saw a similar appearance last night, but the three lights were lined up vertically and we have seen the same thing numerous times repeating the same patterns since January.", "Fire balls in the sky, form triangle, lasted 5 minutes.

What was strange about 45 minutes later another fireball appeared South east, just one , it also lasted about 5 minutes. I took pictures on my digital camera and have night vision video on both sightings , In the video it appears as a white ball, when you look in the sky it looks as tho they barely move, but when researching the video it is moving all over the place at at times it looked as tho it was right on top of the screen. In the pictures the camera captured the light movement which is very interesting. I blew the photos up on the computer and in some it looks like they wrote something.

However, it slowly faded away to the point where it was no longer visible and then it slowly returned to its intense light.  It then slowly faded away again and never came back.

When he pulled into the driveway, he drove all the way to the rear, near the barn, where I was, and told me to get in, that we needed to go around the row of trees that bordered the north side of his property so that I could &quot;see the lights&quot;.  He seemed urgent, I got in and when we drove around the trees there were the lights he was talking about. Seven bright yellow-orange lights arranged in 2 groups.  The left group was almost a straight line of four lights, the right group of three lights was slightly seperated from the other four, and was triangular in shape.  The lights resembled sodium street lights in color, but very intense.  We observed these lights for what seemed like four to five minutes, through binoculars that my son had in the car, as we are waterfowl hunters also.  Through the magninification of the binoculars the lights were very visible, and appeared bright form edge to edge, being circular in shape.  This was odd, as most light sources are brighter in the center than the edge.  After approximately four to five minutes, the lights began to go out from right to left, one by one.  The last remaining light stayed bright for about 30 seconds, then slowly dimmed from view.  The lights never moved, and seemed to be hovering over the farmland.

We were just outside city limits of Bemidji Minnesota traveling north on Hwy 89. We noticed a weird set of lights over a field, but since we only make it up that way about twice a year, we figured it may be a new radio tower or some form of tower that had been errected since we last passed through. As we got closer to where the &quot;tower&quot; should have been our conversation changed from &quot;hunting&quot; to what that could be in the sky. we came to a point where we were directly across from it. It was a clear night and there was no structure reaching to the sky, just 3 lights hovering above the ground. The lights were in the form of a triangle, and were all white. The reminded me of club lights, because they were tumbling. They never left the shape of a triangle, but they were tumbling, as if spinning from top to bottom. Like if you were to take a popcan and make it tumble top to bottom, from end to end. What was really cool about that is that when the lights would tumble they were as if there was a... that&apos;s it, a better description would be a light house. There would be a beam of light that would shine out and then it would be more soft, then beam of light. It&apos;s been a while I can&apos;t recall if they all tumbled in unisyn, or if they tumbled independent of each other. The craft itself you could not see, but you could see that there were 3 distinct points on it. It was like a triangle, or a flying pryamid.

The sky, then, was unusually clear (meaning that any stars were visible at all; I certainly couldn&apos;t see anything in the sky dimmer than major stars, e.g. satellites).  I noticed a hovering red light in the distance -- a helicopter, maybe a plane.  Then, two points of light entered my field of view almost directly overhead, travelling from west to east.  My first thought was military aircraft, because the points, which were yellow, were travelling in tandem with a constant distance between them.  Then the points of light veered away from each other somewhat before coming back together, essentially flying two gentle arcs before returning to their previous arrangement.  I realized, as the lights vanished (not exactly over the horizon, but out of view), that they were travelling far faster than aircraft.  That&apos;s it.  I&apos;m writing this because the lights seemed unusual; I&apos;m certainly not conviced I saw UFOs.

Grand Prairie is a suburb of Dallas.  There are always planes flying around and I enjoy watching their lights at night.  This night was different than any other I had evr witneesed. I looked toward the east-northeast over Dallas and saw a star configuration of three stars perfect aligned, one above the other.  I noticed on either side of the middle star and equidistant on each side of that star, two objects which I could not discern as they were so far up. The objects appeared to pulsate with a red,blue,and white or silver lights which were lined up vertically and in that order.  I thought it was odd that they did not move as planes do as I see so many from my neighborhood.  As I stood and watched these objects, I noticed they started moving in what appeared to be a lateral fashion in quick motions.  They moved in step with one another. After watching these lights for several minutes, I went a got my wife, my 14 year old son, and my cousin who was visiting us to come see if they could tell me what they saw.  They were all astounded by these lights as well.  They witnessed what I did.  No one had any explanation. The three stars aligned vertically were probably part of a constellation but none of us had ever seen pulsating or alternating lights in a constellation before.  That what led us to belive that we were witnessing something unusual.  At least to us it was.  The objects appeared much larger than the vertical stars.  It was just impossible to tell how far up in the sky they were. I hope I have described this to some degree of specificity.  Never in my life have I seen such so this is my attempt at a description of unknown objects. We watched them for approximately an hour and then went back in the house.  I tried taking a digital photograph of them but the pictures did not come out as the objects were too far away.((NUFORC Note:  Based on the description, we suspect that celestial bodies would have to be ruled out, before we could conclude that the objects were, in fact, genuine UFO&apos;s.

Looking directly up at it, a blue-green light on the left tip, a white light on the right tip and white light on the top or front tip.

She asked me and I quote &quot; DO you see this or am I going crazy?&quot; As I starred up certain clearing through the trees revealed the enormous size of this what appeared to be huge disk. I looked out toward the horizon as this thing appears to be lifting higher, it was then that I realized that as far as I could see in any direction, only the edge of this craft could be seen, and none of the low light left at dusk. I retrospect, there was no sound, no wind, and to this day, I still cannot recall another car coming up this busy road. It was if there was only myslef and this stranger from the VW.

This object was flying not as high as commercial jet but not as low as private small aircraft. The reason I know this is because shortly after the sighting I saw a commercial jet flying northwest of our location and about one minute later we saw a small private plane traveling east of us. This object was really moving much faster than both of these aircraft. The circular lights that made this formation were not like regular lights, there were no center of brightness the whole circle was evenly lit. There was no sound coming from the object it seemed to just be gliding across the sky. I wondered if it was maybe a balloon but then little before it disappeared the formation of these lit circles changed, they seemed to form an almost circular shape.

I don&apos;t know if Jupiter can be seen with the naked eye as it is past Mars and further away than Venus. But I&apos;m no sceintest either. Whatever it was it sure looked cool. Just wish I could have had a telescope to see it better.", "Strange lights hovered low in the sky then accelerated quickly from Longmont CO to Boulder.I feel stupid reporting this - may be nothing. i observed strange lights that appeared to be hovering in a rural part of Longmont, CO (SW outskirts) for approx. 10 minutes from the time i irst noticed it (approx. 10:25 p.m. MST). the lights were red and white and seemed to twinkle and pulsate, giving it a tumbling appearance, but remained stationary from my perspective, while driving. as my  heading took me nearer the lights, it began to accelerate and head off to the south towards Boulder.  it remained low in the sky (can&apos;t estimate) until i lost it in the distance. before i lost sight of it, it did appear to change direction and move to the west. i live near a small airport, so it could have been an airplane, HOWEVER i see those all of the time in the evening and none has ever prompted me to report it!  then again, i could be totally nuts (i&apos;m not). thanks", "a look-through aircraft a la &apos;predator&apos;I&apos;m a danish citizen, and the observation happened as I was on a vacation in Greece. Being a reporter I felt, that I had to report it to some &apos;professionals&apos;, and I&apos;ve tried that, but learned the hard lesson that nobody really cares.On the first of October 2002 on the isle of Folegandros, which is situated in the south-western Cyclades, I observed a strange aircraft while I was lying on my back on some coastal rocks a little south of Karavostasi. It moved south at a relatively slow speed at an altitude of about 3000 feet.The craft was completely transparent.I want to point out, that I have often seen how aircrafts under certain weather conditions seem to blend into the sky - even a clear blue one. However, living in cold Denmark you go out and splay yourself in the sun as often as you can during summer. The beach I use is one mile from the Int. airport of Copenhagen, so I&apos;ve studied aircrafts a lot lying on my back. I first noticed this one as it ploughed through a lowhanging white cloud. I was puzzled by it&apos;s shape, which I could see as a shadow on the &apos;belly&apos; of the cloud. It looked like a big fat cross, the nose and wings round like the shape of a trefoil and the body rather plump and short. I thought it might be some kind of veteran aeroplane, so I waited for it to emerge from the cloud. When it did, the &apos;mouth&apos; of the cloud seemed to start whirling like a washing machine, and I was shocked to see, that the &apos;thing&apos; coming out was completely look-through or invisible apart from a tiny blurry outline much like that of a soap-bubble.The background sky was blue with fleecy clouds, and I could see these clouds right through the plane.As it passed over me, and I was struggling to keep my eyes on the ghostly thing, it cast a shadow on me too. After a very short period I simply couldn&apos;t see it anymore. And when I say &apos;see&apos; I mean the blurry outline. And other comparison I could make would be to the entity in the movie &apos;Predator&apos;- it was that kind of effect.I think I might have seen a socalled black project craft.", "two story rectangle flys low and silent over the city of FlorissantOn 1-5-02 I was driving home from a friends house on HWY 67 (Lindbergh Blvd.) Traveling South bond towards the City of Florissant border with the City of Hazelwood approximately 1 mile from HWY 270 and within 5 miles of Lambert International Airport.  I noticed a Florissant police officer had a motorist pulled over to the right of the road and was walking back towards his cruiser.  He was looking up towards the sky near a grocery store with his mouth wide open. I started to look towards the direction he was gazing and that is when I saw the object.  It appeared to me to be a two story rectangle with very large windows on the side of the object.  It appeared to be very dark or black in color.  I did notice some lights but can&rsquo;t tell you the exact place they were situated on the craft as it was night and very hard to tell where the edges began and ended.  The exterior lights were bright and seemed to have a bluish hue to them like you see on some of the newer BMW or Mercedes cars.  The object was flying nearly directly over the Schnuck&rsquo;s market (grocer)  at approximately 100-200 feet ( very low like a police helicopter height ).  The object was almost silent, maybe a slight hum as it flew in front of my car. What caught my attention in the short time I saw the object was that the interior of the object was dimly lit up enough that I could see inside the windows I described above.  I couldn&rsquo;t tell much detail other than the interior was massive.  I would estimate the total size of the object to be the size of a football field.  I make this assumption because it nearly spanned the entire roadway ( 4 lanes plus a turn lane ) as it crossed my path.  The strangest thing about my encounter was that as it floated by I noticed movement in one of the rear windows.  I can&rsquo;t say how many total windows there were on the craft.  In the one I saw into, it looked as if a person was moving from the inside towards the window to look out in the general direction of me and the police officers car with its flashing lights. I didn&rsquo;t report this story initially to anyone except I did tell my friends and my now wife the next day after my sighting.  About 3 years later I happened to be watching the Discovery channel and saw a documentary that had several police officers from Ill. Talking about witnessing the same object on the same day a few hours after my encounter.  I have since given my statement to a local videographer  (WWW.DBARKERTV.com) who did some interviews with Melvin Knoll, and the P.O. in Illinois.  Mr. Barker has recently done a video interview with me as well about the incident.", "Red, green and blue horizontal lights, up to five crafts - not in formationI was outside taking the dog out - it was a clear night and I started looking at the stars.  I noticed one around the little dipper that was twinkling very brightly.  Then I realized it had different colored lights blinking so it couldn&apos;t be a star.  It was stationary though.....I looked around and spotted more.  I went into the house to ask my husband what he thought.  He agreed that the one by the little dipper was unusual. He said it definitly had different colored lights on it and it was not a star.  At one point I saw up to five but then some clouds rolled in and only 3 were visible.  They stayed in the same spot for over 1 hour - then I went to bed.  They had red, green and blue lights blinking on them.  They UFO&apos;s were too far apart to be in any formation.We do have an an airport pattern that runs over our house but these were not airplanes.  They were very high up in the sky but stayed in one spot. They were not stars as the lights were different colors and blinked at different times and the lights were in a horizontal line.  I did not see an outline of the craft so I do not know it&apos;s shape. Both my husband and I tried to locate the objects with binoculars to try to get a better look but couldn&apos;t.", "oval ring of lights hovering, moved vertically and fastSitting out on the front porch with a few friends at night.  Looked up at an odd oval formation of lights hovering over the rooftops across the street.  Friends tried saying it must be a blimp or helicopter.  I reminded them that a blimp would not be that low and we would hear a helicopter.  There was no noise and the lights seemed to rotate around the vessel as there was a small gap that kept reappearing at regular intervals.  Within a few minutes the item moved vertically and quickly away.  We wanted to tell someone but figured no one would believe us.  I keep looking ever since for more evidence.  It was a beautiful display.", "Round white object near Salinas freewayAs we were driving south on Hwy.101, we spotted a round, white object in the sky over some one story commercial buildings alongside the freeway at the Boronda Rd. exit off to our right. It quickly seemed to move off horizontally in a westerly direction, as we drove southbound away from it. It looked like it may have been about 500 - 1000 ft. high and about a mile or so distant from our position. It&apos;s possible it could have been a helium balloon, but it looked round and seemed to travel quite quickly, despite the apparent lack of wind. I lost sight of it as we continued driving further away. I looked at my watch and noted the time and also the location of where we were at so that I could report it.", "UFO&apos;s moving at unknown speeds across the skies with lights of different colors.((name deleted--Witness #1)) was outside and he yelled to ((name deleted--Witness #2)) and myself to come outside.

It had to be about a 5 mile distance in a straight line. After he called us outside, we stood there and watched this UFO (and antoher one we believe, the third thing we saw we&apos;re were sure it was just a jet)  fly around in the sky from the W to SW side of the sky. At some points that it was just hovering, it was shining some very bright lights in a spinning motion.

I lost sight of the flashing light so i decided to go and get my siter, on our way back we were passing right by the Sheriff&apos;office, when we noticed a flashing light that was not very high, we thought it was a helicoper but there was no sound, then suddenly the whole light changed to red and it was flashing quite fast, it moved towards the city and we lost it.", "Very dimly lit six object formation traveling north to south at extreme speedsI was sitting outside with my wife discussing the days events and planning the next week, when from the north my eyes noticed movement.  I thought initially that it was a meteoroid as it was that dim and moving that fast.  When I focused and started tracking the movement it became clear that there were 6 distinct dots in a diamond formation very dimly lit moving at extreme speeds.  The objects traveled across my viewing area (aprox 40 degrees) in less than 2 seconds.  There was no sound.  I have no way to determine the height of the objects but they were traveling on a north to south trajectory.  I am sending sketch of formation via email.", "Two triangular craft, hovering lowI was on my way to work, a little before 10:00 p.m., driving on a residential street in Pinehurst. I saw two sets of lights in triangular patterns, each set had two red lights and one white light.The lights were steady and very bright, they did not blink or vary in intensity. The lights were hovering, motionless and very low, seemingly less than 50 feet above the treetops. At first I thought the two sets of lights might have both been connected to the same structure, but I then saw one set slowly drift a few feet , while the other set remained in place. I rolled down my window and slowed down to about 5 miles per hour, trying to hear anything, but there was no sound. My first thought was they may have been helicopters, but I&apos;m sure I would have heard the chopper blades, as low as they were. In the darkness, I could  make out the outlines of dark-colored structures above the lights. I&apos;ve always wished I would have waited to see what happened next, but not wanting to be late, I drove on. The next morning I thought about calling the local paper or police to see if anyone else had reported seeing this, since it happened in a residential area with houses all around, but was too embarrased.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "Lights and strange sounds awaken couple. Details defy an ordinary explanation.At 3:50am, my girlfriend and I were awakened by a noise and light coming from above the house. The noise sounded like the hum from a balast on a flourescent light. The light was blueish. We don&apos;t have any flourescent lights and the hum or reverb from the sound could be felt throughout the room. The noise and light repeated 5 seconds later; 5 seconds later it repeated again.

It was moving straight and level at about 2000 ft above the ground.  It was dull gray (pewter) in color and made no sound.  It had no appendages like wings or tail.  The visibility at the time was very good.  We were about a mile or so from Lake Michigan in southern Michigan and I expect the object was moving from south to north in a line parallel to the lake.  The lake would have been to our rear.  It was at about a 45 deg angle from us and appeared oval in shape, somewhat like a dull gray metallic football.  I speculate at this time that if we could have seen it from other angles that it may have been a disc.  I estimate the size to be about 100 feet long.  It had no lights.  It was directly in front of us when we first saw it and it continued in a straight line until it was out of sight.", "LOOKING FOR OTHER WITNESSESI am looking for ANYONE who saw or has any information about the formation of amber lights that danced and appeared over the areas of Melbourne, Frost Proof, Lake Wales, St. Cloud and Yeehaw Juntion.

They would come together and separate. Once one light came towards us and than flew away.  This lasted the whole time I was talking on my cell. About 1hr.", "Object in the night sky.The sighting took place at roughly 11:45 PM on Friday October 29 near the junction of 730 and what is locally known as Bobos crossing (I believe its county road 4668). We had set up camp at a bend in the river maybe &frac14; mile from the highway.  It had rained earlier that day and there were still a few clouds hanging around but you could clearly see stars. There were three of us there that night sitting around the campfire and there wasn&rsquo;t any alcohol involved. Probably an hour before the incident took place we were all witness to a low flying helicopter with a spotlight surveying the area. That was not uncommon, a few years back there was a prison escape in the area and the convicts were on the run in our area so they were searching like this before as well. Of course we were not without firearms so we kind of got a little excited and readied ourselves. After about forty five minutes things kind of died down and we went back to the usual campfire conversation.  Ten or so minutes later a rumbling noise could be heard in the distance, well more appropriately described as that of a diesel in the distance (which would be fitting since we were near the highway). We no longer heard the rumbling sound but we did begin to hear a humming noise in the opposite direction. We started to look around because in that direction there was nothing but trees and open space for a good &frac34; of a mile. You could make out the moon reflecting off a metallic object in the sky just above the tree line. Natural reaction was to grab the guns but as we did it was starting to move towards out position. As we sit gazing into the night sky the object positioned itself above our camp site maybe 100ft up and it paused for a brief moment and then proceeded to change directions and headed off towards the south at an alarmingly slow pace. The rest of the night we were all on high alert, sleeping would almost seem nearly impossible. I was first to wake in the morning and it was a trying experience to say the least. Well, we decided it would be best if we packed our things and headed home. As we were driving towards the gate that would open the way to the road we noticed another helicopter flying over. I&rsquo;m not real educated on military aircrafts but from what I&rsquo;ve looked at online it appeared to be a CH-47 Chinook. I do see a lot of these in my area though; I believe there is a place where they do training and whatnot with them near Newark. I am a bit skeptical about our sighting, being that there are a few air fields in the area plus were a hop skip and jump away from Carswell Air Force Base (or whatever it is called now). Not much was said about the incident after that day, who would believe it?", "Fast light approaches me and I shoot 2 Quicktime clips of it passing overhead while driving!While driving home from work early 11-25 at approx 3:30 am PDT, it was partly cloudy with patchy fog that was illuminated by a nearly full moon. I was driving westbound on I-80 freeway and turned off at Truxel Rd and was turning south (left turn), heading back over the freeway.When I straightened out the wheel, from the direction I just came from, I noticed a very bright unusual looking whitish amber colored light up in the sky. I estimate it was maybe 400 to 500 ft up. at about 35 degrees up from the horizon. At about a distance of a mile or so yet down the freeway. My first thought was its just a helicopter flying low over the freeway. Then I looked for the usual blinking marker lights around the big light which didn&apos;t look like anything I&apos;ve seen on a helicopter before. That&apos;s when things didn&apos;t add up in my estimations of distance and speed and relative size of a chopper. I could pretty much see that the light was too large for a helicopter at that distance and it was closing fast. The light itself was not the usual bright spot light, with its search light spot ray pointing downward. More like it was the entire craft itself.I remembered I had my digital camera with me and realized I could take a picture of this thing. It was in its case and I become really excited as I fumbled with the bag losing precious seconds trying to negotiate a moving vehicle and open my camera case at the same time. I slowed down to maybe 10 mph from about the 20mph that I was up to crossing the overpass. By the time I got my camera out and rolled down my window so as to not get flash reflection, it had caught up to me, I stuck my camera out the window, turned it back behind me and up. I immediately saw the bright light in the view finder screen. Holding the camera with both hands and trying to keep it still I pressed the button but the flash didn&apos;t go off as I expected so I just thought it &apos;misfired&apos; and I pressed again. Neither time did I get a flash. I must have batteries too weak to fire the flash on my camera I thought and then it dawned on me that I didn&apos;t hear anything like a helicopter. This thing made No Sound! Then when I got home I pressed &quot;review&quot; on my camera and to my surprise it started playing back a video of what I saw and was trying to take a picture of. I had inadvertently captured 3 seconds of it in two very short movies of it. It turns out In my haste to get a picture I must have turned the mode selector button on my Kodak CX7300 past &quot;camera&quot; one notch to &quot;Video&quot; mode.  Although the video is shaky and brief you can slow it down in Quicktime by manually dragging the playback head back and forth to see the light&apos;s path overhead relative to tiny more stationary lights below it.I counted a total 22 frames of the object spread out over two seperate clips in a timeframe of 2.5 to 3 seconds. I actually saw it for almost 30 seconds total.Note that my date on the file is correct the actual right time was never set on my camera.", "flying silver cylinder objectSept 26, 2003 6:45-7:15 P.M.

The pureist silver I have ever seen, almost like a mirror. There were 15-17 people present and all of us saw it.From my location it was about 75 to 80 degree angle. As it passed from our view into clouds, the sun could be seen reflecting off of it until it passed completely from our view.", "I saw round solid color objects flying in pairs in daylightWhile heading back home from my friend&apos;s house, I happened to look up in the sky. It was almost dinner time when I was heading home. I looked up to the sky as I was walking home and something caught my eye right away. Since the object was very high in the sky, I had to check my vision my looking at nearby objects such as a tree to reset my eye focus. Then I looked back to the sky and saw the same thing. I saw tiny objects flying in formation heading south, parallel to highway 101. They were solid objects and were not omiting lights. They look like small metalic balls with different colors, flying in formation. They flew in pairs. About 5 total. One flew alone in front and had a pearly red color while the other 4 flew behind it and was a pearly blue color each. The four that flew beind flew in pairs so when you looked at them, you would see the red ball infron by itself, two blue balls behind it, and two more blue balls behind the first pair of blue balls. They were moving and was heading somewhere, not hovering in one place. There was no sound and no trail behind them to indicate it was a high flying aircraft. If it were high flying aircrafts, there would be a distinct siloute, an airplane shape to it. Usually, when you see high flying planes, they either have smoke trails behind them or they fly solo. These balls flew together without any trails left behind them. That was the first time I saw UFOs. Later on I saw a UFO sightings show called &quot;Sightings&quot; and saw a story about a similar sighting. They described the exact same thing I saw; the color, and the formation. Everything was exactly what I saw. The sighting on the show was dated around 1920 to 1930. At that moment, I knew that it had to be real since I just saw something that someone else saw more that 50 years ago. It couldnt have been military because I don&apos;t think that the airforce from the 1920s would be flying in the same formation in the 1990s. Also, the sighting from the 1920s was seen in a diferent state I was in. I hope that if anyone out there saw the same thing, the same flying formation and color, they should speak up so it can reinforce what I have just said. The more sightings there is in different areas, the more credible it will be. Also, i&apos;ve continued to research and watch shows on UFOs and havent seen any story of sightings similar to mine. All the sightings describe the same thing, triangles and lights. Mine was different and I still continue to wait to see if there is anymore sightings like mine.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "Several craft at one timeMy daughter, granddaughter and I were pullng in my driveway. My granddaughter got out of the car and started shouting for us to hurry and get out.  There was a long object with white lights on it in the western sky.  As we watched the object changed into two white lights and one red one and looked like a plane.  As it headed toward us, the glow of the lights made it easy to see that it was disc shaped.  At the same time there were lights in the northeast that looked like stars that were playing with each other.  Then  after the disc passed there was an object with three lights in formation that also passed directly overhead going in the southeast direction. There was no sound and it floated.

We thought we could see them flashing red, blue and green. When I zoomed up in on them I was shocked to see that they were pulsating like a welding machine and had red, blue and green flashes. As I zoomed to high power with my digital camcorder you can see a definite counter clockwise rotation and the objects slowly moved upwards from just above the trees up to the 11:00 position. This took at least an hour and the objects flashed intermittently as if communicating with each other. We watched them off and on through the night and at one point there were as many as 8-10 around us with 5 or 6 making a draping effect from the sky down to the top of the trees like a fishing line going to the water. They were east of us in the direction of a microwave tower which is about 3 miles away. Like cars waiting at the gas station. It was strange to say the least. I made a tape of it and took it to work. None knew what it was but we knew what it wasn&apos;t. It wasn&apos;t swamp gas, ball lightening, an airplane, skylab, and I don&apos;t think they were sattelites or planets.

As we drove past the gravel pit, we saw a huge, very bright light among the hills of gravel.  It was about the size of a small house.  The light was white and very, very bright, but it did not illuminate the surrounding area or make much of a glow in the sky.  We were all in awe and my mother slowed the car almost to a halt as we starred at the light.  Then, as we watched, the light &quot;shot&quot; at us, three balls of light in quick succession.  As each one hit the front of the car, we heard it make a boom sound on impact.  The car jerked with each impact, but I later learned from my mother that there actually was no impact, the jerks were her frightened reaction to the sight and sound of the impacts.  Although the &quot;shots&quot; made a big noise as they hit our car, they did not jerk the car at all!  My mother sped away and we drove the rest of the way, (only 1-2 miles) into Stoughton.  We stopped at a gas station that was on the right side of the road in those days, almost right accross from the A&amp;W root beer stand.  We all scrambled out and looked at the car.  There were no marks of any kind, nothing to show that it had been hit by those balls of light.  We were all shaking and drove home.  We told my father and the rest of the family there what had happened.  To the best of my knowledge, no one ever reported the incident to the police or anyone.  It was simply too fantastic.  No one would have believed it. I have always been very sorry that my parents did not alert the authorities at once.  Perhaps someone else could have seen it too.  Throughout the years since then, my sisters and I will recount those events to each other from time to time; just to make sure it isn&apos;t something we dreamed.  My mother too(now dead), always remembered it just the way I have recorded it here.  It was not, strickly speaking, a UFO.  It did not fly when we saw it.  But, all these years later (it is now October 2004), I still have no better understanding of what it was then we had at that time.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "While observing the lunar eclipse from the Courtyard Marriott parking lot (off of Coliseum Dr.) moments ago, I had my first UFO sighting.  After lowering the binoculars I was using on the moon, I glanced directly overhead and saw two quasi-pinpoint objects moving in not quite parallel directions from north to south.  The twin objects were about half-a-fist-at-arms-length apart.  They covered the angular distance from zenith to about 30-degrees above the horizon in about five to six seconds.  The objects disappeared behind a layer of high cirrus to the south. The objects were not exactly spheres of light.  They had a bright-white central pinpoint of light surrounded by a thin faint white halo that seemed to scintillate just slightly.  The halos were probably less than half a pinky fingernail in diameter.  Couldn&apos;t get the 12X binocs on the objects quick enough to get a bead on them. While I was watching the two objects pass overhead, they moved closer to one another and one changed course about ten degrees and veered away from the other after closest approach.  The objects were not travelling at the same speed.  The one that made the quick and abrupt course change seemed like it was playing catch up with the other.  It was just abeam its twin when it made the sudden course change and then accelerated slightly ahead of the one that maintained a more or less steady course and speed. At first I thought these might be jets from Langley AFB which is less than three miles away, but the objects were entirely silent with no obvious conventional nav lights.  They behaved like no polar-orbiting satellites I&apos;ve ever seen. I watched the area of the sky into which the objects disappeared for quite some time hoping to see them return.  No luck.", "We were walking are dog and we saw a bright large object in the sky.It look like a line star and it had 6 long lines coming out of a small middle and they were cross and very bright white.

I was laying in my bed trying to go to sleep, looking out my bedroom window.  My room was dark so I could see outside very well.  I saw a white light traveling just above the horizon at a speed I would consider to be in the range of an airplane.  It was traveling from the north toward the south.  I watched it for a few seconds and it came to a complete stop.  I thought huh,  this must be a helicopter.  It set perfectly still for a few minutes when I saw a smaller light come from behind the moutain I was looking toward and it went toward the larger light.  It went straight to it and when it got there it seemed to go inside the larger light.  I could only see one light anyway.  The larger light proceeded south at the speed I first saw it traveling, then accelerated very fast and went out of sight.

About 11:40, I noticed a white object appear above the treeline in front of me. At first, I thought it was a toy balloon or maybe a plastic bag that had been blown aloft by the wind. It became apparent that the object was not being tossed about by the wind, but was proceeding from north to south, straight as an arrow and contrary to the wind direction. It passed almost directly overhead, reflecting the sunlight as it passed. It appeared to be shiny, opaque white, not self-luminous. There were no wings, fins or other protrusions visible. The shape was a short tube with rounded ends, like a vitamin capsule or maybe an aircraft drop tank. I watched it until it disappeared in the distance to the south. I estimate that it was at least several tbousand feet high, as there were jetliners visible in the sky at the same time on approach to LAX and Ontario airport. The airliners appeared much higher that the object. The speed of the object reminded me of a military jet making a pass at an airshow, fast but not supersonic. There was no noticeable noise from the object, but there was a lot of background noise due to the wind in the trees. At one point, the object passed over, or maybe through, a cloud of dust which has been carried aloft by the wind, and it appeared to either make a wake throught it or cast a shadow on it as it passed.

They brilliance was striking.  The lights did not blink on and off, and their luminosity was constant.  There was no noise I could associate with the lights.  From my perspective, the lights were at about 45-50 degrees from ground level.  As I watched, the lights moved very slowly from north to east, and remained visible as they moved from clear sky into cloud cover.  When the lights were due east, they stopped.  After about 1 minute, two of the lights moved fairly close together (about 3&quot; apart at arms length).  The light that was off alone (it was the nearest to north-northeast, and at arm&apos;s length about 2 or 3&apos; from the other two lights) disappeared - just blinked out - at about 8:06 p.m.  Then, one of the two remaining lights (maintaining the distance I described) slowly rotated about 180 degrees around the other light, which was not moving.  I lost sight of the lights in heavy cloud cover.  I submitted a report in August of this year about some other red lights I observed, and find myself amazed to be submitting another one.

No light, no noise. I turned and watched as it flew toward and into the low clouds around the power co. smokestacks. The craft would have flown over Northern Michigan University and a fly-by of the hospital (with all those windows). I could not have been the only one to see it. There was a Miss ??

There were two small stars around it that we were comparing it to, and they didnt move at all but what we were looking at did.

It flickered the entire time, almost like a plane but you couldnt see any definning caracteristics.Then the clouds moved in and blocked our view. And to make it even stranger, weve looked the last three nights, and it&apos;s not there anymore, so that rules out it being a star. Unless it burned out, but do they move around when they burn out.? I don&apos;t think so. This was a very weird thing that happened and now has me interested in finding out if anyone else saw it. I&apos;ve seen countless shooting stars, eclipses even meteor showers but never anything like this. What we saw was in the direction of the Virginia, Pennsylvania area.

I previously reported seeing objects that appeared to be stars that were low to the ground and when magnified they appear to be some type of energy balls that rotate and pulse and glow like a welding machine. They seem to be motionless to the naked eye but on video can be observed to slowly arc upwards over time. I also have seen strange vehicles which could be normally explained as some type of airplane. Last night I saw one of these orange hovering balls over some nearby houses and when I stopped the car to film it dropped to the ground like a spider on a web. Then when it saw I wasn&apos;t leaving it rose up and started flying slowly away. Anyone else would have said it was just a plane but when I zoomed up on it you can clearly see that it is 3-4 of these little welding balls traveling together not in formation but as one unit seemingly fused together electromagnetically or something. It is beyond all of my comprehension of how this is possible. But in slow motion you can clearly see them individually but moving as one. And kind of pulling at each other as they go. This craft moved away from me just above the horizon until it vanished from view. As I drove away I could see it (light up) again and start circling back to where it had started from. In the 2 inch video window of my camcorder all you could see was a light but on the TV screen at home it is plain to see and as it vanished it seemed as if the spheres broke apart and went in different directions. As I drove along I could see these things almost everywhere. Noone seems to believe me even with the video and laugh it off telling me to watch out or I will get a probing.

It was a long black rod at about a 45 degree angle from my vantage point.  The object made no sound.  At first I thought it was a balloon.  As I watched though, I noticed it wasn&apos;t drifting or changing direction.  The object hovered in the same spot, just under cloud height.  It appeared to be about half the width of an average sized airplane at that height, but the same length. I called one of the gas station employees over to see if she could see it too.  She saw the object, and we watched it for about two minutes, when we were joined by a woman who wanted to know what we were looking at.  As we watched, the object appeared to bend ever so slightly.  It bent back and forth like this maybe three or four times, taking about 15 seconds for each flex.  The gas station employee left to help some customers.  The other woman and I watched the object for another 3 minutes or so, and as we watched, it moved upward into the clouds above it, until neither of us could see it anymore.  I stood and watched for another 5 minutes in case it came out of the cloud, but it did not.((NUFORC Note:  One of two seemingly credible reports from same source.

The lights were blue and red and white as far as I could tell.  At first it looked as if it was about one thousand feet high in a mostly clear sky.  Seemed to be hovering there for the longest time and then took a very slow northwest direction.  It was too fast to be a star, too slow to be a plane and a helicopter just didn&apos;t make sense because it was to high and for too long to be searching for someone without a searchlight.  I called the local news and tried calling the airport.  I walked outside to get a better view to see if the window could&apos;ve been causing the blinking/twinkling effect, but the lights were still blinking with an unobstructed view.", "V-SHAPED ORANGE GLOWING OBJECT THAT MOVED STRAIGHT UP UNTIL IT BECAME IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE.ON 11-24-2004 AT AROUND 0200 HOURS MYSELF AND ANOTHER OFFICER WERE ON PATROL IN THE YUMA AREA TRAVELING EASTBOUND. WHILE ENGAGED IN CONVERSATION THE DRIVING OFFICER STOPPED THE VEHICLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROADWAY AND ASKED ME TO LOOK TO THE NORTH AT A BRIGHT ORANGE LIGHT THAT WAS APPEARING OVER THE YUMA AREA. AFTER REALIZING THAT WE HAD STOPPED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE RAODWAY WE DECIDED TO MOVE APPROX. 1/4 OF A MILE UP THE ROAD PAST AN INTERSECTION TO STOP AT A CIRLCE K.

THE FORMATION APPEARED TO HAVE BRIGHT GLOWING CIRCLES FOLLOWING THE SHAPE OF THE OBJECT. AS WE INVESTIGATED FURTHER THE OFFICER I WAS WITH ASKED OUR COMMUNICATION CENTER TO CALL OUR LOCAL MARINE STATION TO SEE IF THEY HAD AIRCRAFTS IN THE AIR. WE WERE ADVISED LATER THAT THE TOWERS WERE DOWN AND NOTHING WAS UP IN THE AIR, WE WERE ALSO ADVISED THAT NOTHING HAD APPEARED ON THERE RADAR SENSOR. THE OFFICER I WAS WITH IS A 22 YEAR RETIRED MARINE WHO HAS EXTENSIVE KNOWLEDGE OF AORCRAFT AND BY HIS OWN ADMISSION HE SAID THAT HAD NEVER SEEN SUCH TECHNOLOGY LIKE WHAT WE WERE LOOKING AT.

I remarked to my wife that this was a very bright &quot;star or planet&quot; which was in the sky almost directly overhead.  As I watched it, it began to move at a tremendous speed to the southeast, climbing almost straight up.  It rapidly grew smaller and eventually faided to a pinpoint of light and dissappeared.  All the while I was watching this object, I was trying to get those standing around me to be able to see it.  It was moving so rapidly, I do not know if anyone else in the group ever caught sight of the object before it became too high and too dim to see anymore.  It was the color of white light,as I said earlier, about the size of a close large planet which might be viewed in the sky at night.  It was much brighter than any of the other star patterns in the sky.  It left no vapor trail of any sort.  The night sky was clear with no clouds.  The moon was not visible in the direction the object sped off.  It did not traverse the horizon, but instead appeared to be travelling upwards.", "what happened to the report i gave about this event . we saw three lights very high over S.

A bright flashing of red white and another unexplainable color were displayed but in more of a sequence of rotations around the object though it was to far away to determine the size, shape, or color of the craft im sure it was nothing commercial......we observed it for quite a while and it never moved and unbenounced to my knowledge there are no towers or structures with these lights that far out in the ocean or that high in altitude off the coast of south carolina....i just went and looked to see if the lights were still there but some substantial cloud cover has rolled in since i started typing this.", "I saw 6-8 craft of some sort descending to the ground and dissapearing behind the trees.I have made a couple of reports within the last week or so from College Station and am glad to see them finally posted but must disagree with the evaluation that they are merely stars. Last night as I was coming home right after dark I saw what I thought was an airplane. I refer to them as mosquitoes because they have at least six or eight white lights that extend from them. I was about a mile from my house on a big hill where you can see for miles. I saw the first and then a few hundred yards behind was another and then another. This was to my left and then to my right was the same thing. And as I watched in dismay they all went straight towards the direction of my house. And trying to be scientific about all of this I thought OK what a coincidence. Then I watched several of them dropping toward the ground until they went behind the trees. Then two of them that were still in the air turned off their (running lights) and became these yellowish/orange balls that I have been seeing. And yes I was freaking out and no I was not drinking. And the worst part was I had to go home right by there. My house is surrounded by thousands of acres of tall thick wilderness so anything could be out there. I started watching as I turned on my road and sure enough about halfway down I could see through a small clearing some sort of blinking white lights which were on or near the ground. When I stopped to look they turned off as if I was seen. And not no but hell no I did not go to see what it was. Later that night I could see a glow back there like from a town but there is no town in that direction. I could hear what sounded like machinery which reminded me of an oil well pumping station. But to my best knowledge there is not a well back in that creek bottom either. So I went inside and pulled the covers over my head and hid. I have been seeing and filming things nearly every night for about a month and have no explainations. My friend at work said maybe they are some type of military helicoptors or something which would be fine as compared with the alterenative. I only know that I hope it is one of ours and not one of theirs. But I suppose they mean us no harm because I have definitely been seen watching them......I have video but am unclear where to send it.((NUFORC Note:  One of many reports from same source.  Possibly not a serious report.  PD))", "Bright lights in Lewisville, TXPeter, at your request I am entering an extended, more detailed report of what I saw on Saturday night near Dallas.  Lewisville is a city just north of Dallas, maybe 10 miles from North Dallas.  I had been shopping that evening with a friend and my son, we got home around 6:15 or so.  I put all my bags down and went out to the patio.  There, I saw my neighbor, Rich, outside on his patio.  He was looking into the sky, nothing unusual for any of us.  He asked me to look at what he was seeing.  I looked through a break between the tree and the building next to my apartment building.  There is a 4 foot, or so, space between them.  I looked in the direction of what seemed to be the north-western horizon.  There were balls of light going up into the air.  At first I asked if they were balloons, Rich explained that he had been watching them for a while and didn&apos;t think they acted much like a balloon.  I continued to watch them, as I watched more and more would come up into my line of vision.  Altogether, there would be anywhere from 9 to 15 of these individual balls of light in a group.  This group would move upward towards the stars, but always staying in formation.  The formations were nothing I have ever seen before.  There seemed to always be a &quot;lead&quot; ball of light, then two or three in a pattern behind it.  Then the other 6 or so would be in a half circle behind the lead balls.  (weird!).  As I became increasingly curious about what we were seeing, I began to realize that they couldn&apos;t have been balloons as they went a great distance into the sky.  Once they got up high enough to where you had to bend your head backwards to see them, it resembled a moving constellation.  It would be like watching the Big Dipper move across the sky.  At that point, Rich and I were very interested in what was happening.  I called a friend of mine, Jennifer, and she came out to her patio.  At this time, my son Jake came outside to see what the fuss was about.  We all stood there and watched another group go up into space.  This group acted the same way as the first.  Then, a third group.  With the third group, my son noticed that the &quot;lead&quot; light would stop, or appear to stop, and wait for the others to catch up.  At one point, there were two smaller balls of light that seemed to be &quot;playing tag&quot; as my son discribes it.  One was in front of the other and the front one would zig zag from left to right and the one behind it would &quot;chase&quot; it.  Very interesting to see.  On the fourth batch, we had two pairs of binoculars out (myself and Rich) and we couldn&apos;t get a much clearer view of them.  Almost like they were either too far away to actually see, even with magnification, or they were so bright that it seemed distorted when I tried to see them.  During the second group rising, Jennifer noticed a very odd, very thick and extremely white fog (for lack of a better word) on the horizon.  She pointed it out to us, we all saw it and watched as it rose, but it rose staying intact.  Unlike a building fire smoke, this seemed to stay just as white and just as thick as it was when it was lower on the horizon.  This display lasted approximately one hour.  I will never forget the way that these objects seemed to have a purpose, a direction.  They seemed to almost communicate in that they all knew where to go and how to take their place in &quot;line&quot; (although they never traveled in a straight line).  The best way to describe them, for me, was moving constellations.  Very bright, very large (although there were smaller ones as well), very organized objects in &quot;flight&quot;.  When asked how big they seemed to be in relation to a star, my feeling is that the brightest star in the sky that night, was half the size of the objects passing by it.  This was the most awesome, curious thing I have ever seen and I hope to one day find out what it could have been.  Please let me know if you have any information.  Thank you.((NUFORC Note:  Second report from same witness.  We post both reports.  We spoke with this witness, and we found her to be exceptionally credible.

When the object cleared the trees we were suprised that there was no  motor noise  heard since we expected the object to be a low flying helicopter because of it&apos;s slow speed. We watched for about three minutes as the object transited our section of sky.  During that time we were impressed by the brightness of the object and that the intensity seemed to vary over time.The color was flame-like, and in fact at one point we thought that the object was a plane on fire.The shape could not be determined and the size seemed to be about a quarter to three-eights inch on a scale held at arms length. As the object approached the hill to the SW it began to coruscate and just before it disapeared it ejected a pieace or two of the same color material. The sky was for the most part clear with low patchy clouds to the SW and high thin clouds in the area in which it disapeared behind a house and hill. I am a retired photographer and for many years had an aerial mapping service. During that time I amassed over four thousand hours in the air flying in light planes. I have seen many strange things that I always have been able to explain, but this was unexplicable. It certainly could have been some space debris burning in the atmosphere, but I am surprised that at 10AM the following day, no mention was made in any press reports.

When we arrived, the fog forming in the area. Early in the morning I was awaken but what I thought was a light. I typically wake up to the pre-dawn light. I woke up facing the wall and door from the bed, away from the window. I briefely noticed, as I woke up, a light went out on the wall. I turned to look out the window and noticed a moon sized orange object, in the sky, out the window, approximately 32 degrees from my point of view. Although I thought it was odd to be &apos;right there&apos;, I told myself it was the moon, and seemingly went back to sleep. The window faces toward St. Helens in general. But you can&apos;t really see the mountain from our location. St. Helens was active and emited a steam plume with minor ash that night and day. It wasn&apos;t until tonite that I realized that the moon is not full. It&apos;s at 30%. And that the weather was foggy and not clear. It was foggy the whole next day too.

She said to look to the East and see if I can spot 3 red lights just hovering in the Eastern sky. My wife and I, along with a few neighbors were siiting in my driveay enjoying the evening and waiting for Trick or Treaters when I recieved the call. After a few seconds I, along with 2 of my neighbors, spotted 2 red lights in the East, North East, sky, about 20 degress above the horizon with 90 degress being directly overhead. One light was directly above the other separated by a few degress. The bottom one moved a little South then went back to being right under the other one. The sky was becoming overcast so we lost them both with in a few seconds of each other.I received another phone call about 90 minutes later from the same family member telling me to go look outside again because one of the lights had returned. From her vantage point she told me to look a little to the West from dirctly overhead. I could not see any thing in that direction. So I looked in the direction where she lives and we, (my wife, son, and I), saw 1 red light in the sky identicle to the ones earlier. The light was North, North East from my location. I live South West of Tinley by @ 12 miles or so. I knew we were looking at the same light because I could see airplane traffic in the vicinity and I would ask her if she saw the same traffic and she concurred. We watched this together over the phone for a minute or so before I lost it in the cloud deck. Soon after that she lost it too.I am an aircraft technician by trade and my hobbies include astronomy and photography. I had a few of my pictures of the Perseid Meteor shower on display at the planetarium in Chicago. My neighbors and my wife and I also enjoy satellite watching on summer nights. I am familiar with the differnce between aircraft, satellites, and meteors as to their apperance in the night sky.As a point of interest, I saw 3 white, satellite colored objects, back in late August at @ 21:00 passing directly over head in a triangle formation. They were heading South with the base of the triangle leading the way. It was not a solid object between the points of light because I saw starlight between them. No one else saw this for I was alone at the time. As I stated before, I look for satellites all the time and have been since I first saw one as child. I&apos;ve spotted countless times were there were more than 1, sometimes 4 satellites visible at the same time in the sky, but I&apos;ve never seen where they seemed to be flying in perfect formation, and had the same brightness between them.

After watching, a third one appeared above and slightly to the left of the other two. Then the lowest one started to move to the left, and unfortunately it dissapeared behind some trees. I (being in the top floor of a dorm) tried to run to get a better view, but the other two &quot;twinkled&quot; out.

This craft looked exactly like the video taken by the man and his daughter behind their restaraunt.

This object that i saw looked to be cigar to cylinder shaped and was going towards the northwest and is looked to be faily high in the sky.  that fact that it was that high in the sky was what led me to belive it was a ufo because if it had been a plane there would have surely been contrails coming from behind it.  Also of note their were many military jets flying around the area shortly after.  Also an hour before the sighting i was listening to wtam 1100 am to the mike trivisanno show and he said along with another caller that he seen a ufo about the same shape earlier that day.  During the show there was another caller that was calling from the mansfield area and said that he saw some fighter jets coming towards cleveland form what appeared to be wright patterson airforce base.

On replaying the footage yesterday (6th November) on my computer screen, I noticed the strange object.

It was stationary behind and above the property opposite in the courtyard.", "An orange triangular craft that made no sound observed in the Mojave Desert.While traveling northbound toward the China Lake Naval Facility approximately one mile from the base, I observed lights coming directly toward me.  This is not unusual because there is an active airfield on base, however as the lights got closer I noticed that the aircraft looked different than the regular military aircraft.  I pulled over to the side of the road and got out of my vehicle, so I could observe the craft in more detail.  The craft was approximately 3000 to 5000 feet in altitude.  It was triangular in shape, and the entire bottom of the aircraft glowed a dull hazy orange with about 6 or 8 brighter orange lights on the exterior of the craft.  The brighter lights were not strobing as are typical with normal aircraft.  While observing the craft it seemed to slow down and hover directly overhead.  I would guess that it was about the size of a large jet fighter or perhaps a little bigger.  No sound was coming from the craft, which would not have been the case with a typical helicopter or jet aircraft.  After 20 to 30 seconds the craft again began to move southward.  At that point, I got back into my vehicle and proceeded north 300 to 400 meters when I noticed a second person pulled off to the side of the road, out of his vehicle, and observing the same craft.  I am a physicist who has worked on the naval base for 15 years and have never observed a craft like that before.", "Was notified by a neighbor of 3 bright non blinking red crisp lights in the eastern sky.

Oct 31, 2004.About 8 people witnessed this.", "UFO sightings over Orland Park IL and Tinely Park ILDESCRIPTION OF OBSERVERS- My mother was the first person to notice the 3 lights in the sky at approximately 7:50pm (CST). She was walking out some friends of the family and her sister to their cars and all 5 of those people noticed the lights. My mother then called myself, my Father, and my sister out to the driveway to see the lights. We then went and got our next door neighbors to come and see the unknown lights as well. Since I work at a 24-hour news station here in Chicago I called the station to try and let the news director know what we were seeing, however, they were unreachable. I then called two friends in two different parts of our town (yet still within Orland Park) to look up and see the lights, they too were able to see the lights. One of my mother&rsquo;s friends (who had been walking to her car) she called her husband who was in Tinely Park (an adjacent town to Orland) and he too confirmed that he saw the lights. One of my friends in Orland that I called also saw the lights from his driveway with a family that was out &quot;trick or treating&quot;. The ages of the witness&apos; varied in age from 13 at the youngest to mid-60&apos;s. DESCRIPTION OF OBJECTS- there were three distinct Bright Red lights in the sky. These lights were similar to the red lights that are on top of Radio and Cell phone towers.  However these objects were moving, incredibly slowly. They maintained a steady pace similar in speed to a dirigible. The three lights were too far apart and too high to be planes, dirigibles, or balloons. Since we live in an area that has a high air traffic concentration (the O&rsquo;Hare and midway flight path triangle) we are used to seeing lights in the sky, several commercial planes flew below the lights on there way to and from the airports. There was full cloud cover at a very high altitude, so we were unable to see any stars, however these three lights remained totally below the clouds during the entire 20 minutes. DESCRIPTION OF WHAT OBJECTS DID- the three lights came in from the southwest when we first noticed, them moved toward the north (towards us), the three lights proceeded south east then after several of the people in our group had begun calling friends and family on our cell phones, the lights were too far away to be seen by 8:17pm. The lights maintained an obtuse scalene triangle formation during the twenty minutes. The distances between the objects remained relatively constant throughout the sighting. The lights did not change speed at all during the sighting, nor did they move in directions that would be impossible for conventional aircraft. Although the near &quot;hovering&quot; speed and the high altitude maintained by the objects completely rules out any helicopters. There was no noise heard from the objects. DESCRIPTION OF BACKGROUNDS OF OBSERVERS- I&apos;m a 23-year-old college Graduate and I work at local 24-hour news station covering the Chicagoland Area. My father is a 53-year-old college graduate and has worked in sales for over 35 years. My mother is a 53-year-old college graduate and homemaker. My sister is a 15-year-old high school sophomore. My neighbor&rsquo;s are in their mid-60&apos;s and both hold masters degree&apos;s in education, one is a college professor at a nearby college, the other teaches elementary school. Our friends of family included our former neighbor (ties in her 40&apos;s and a business owner), her husband in his 40&apos;s and is a business owner as well (whom she called on the cell phone), and her daughter (13 in junior high school).

I cannot explain it and feel strange even having seen it. It was too big to be a model plane or a firefly or some logical explanation. It was too fast to be a small plane or helicopter. The light was not a projected beam because it was self-propelled and moved with precision and purpose.

There were three other witnesses with me. One of the witnesses filmed the event with a hand held camcorder.The lights were a vibrant red much like a stop light. The lights were just south of my location and heading east. As they passed over me I heard no sound and could not see any discernable shape. When the lights header east they changed into a triangle pattern. Then some of the lights began to fade in and out. They nearly faded to black before becoming bright again. The lights were larger than a planet and larger than the lights from the wings of a plane. There was only the one red light emitted from each object. The spacing between the three lights remained relatively constant even when they changed their formation.While witnessing the event I called my uncle in Oak Forest(a town further east). He to witnessed the lights, and he described them just as I did. I called the police at 8:03 pm to report what I had seen. I was told that I was the second caller and that they had no idea what the lights were. I continued to watch the lights until they were out of my view. I then called my uncle again to find that he could still see them. He watched them for another 25 minutes. During this time they went back to the horrizontal line formation.

It was as large as my finger at arms length and looked like a comet without a tail. It was so weird that I told my daughter that if it hit it would be a dinasour killer. It continued WSW and when we returned to our vehicle it had moved to just above the horizon in 35 or so minutes. I felt that it was at the upper atmosphere since it remained visable for so long. We took numerous pictures with a digital and a throw away camera. Our friends , father and daughter also watched it for several minutes before it went behind trees and horizon. There was no following tail, no noise, nothing else in the sky, clear evening, no wind and it was traveling opposite of where winds normally originate.

On September 10th, 2004 at approx. 10pm - 10:15 I saw the object first then I called my mother and my two sons from our home, we saw an object was northwest and left from the big dipper, the night was crystal-clear. We did not see the moon. The object stood out because it was brighter than a star or planet and it flashed colors. As we looked at it through binoculars we were able to see the colors clearly. The colors were rotating from green, red, dark orange, to white. On the top of the object above the rotating light was a very bright white. The object was hovering then it moved to the left but not straight, it was in an angle, then to the right It stood there for a few minutes then it started to move northwest direction and it looked like it was moving up in elevation the color of the object was like a yellow. As the object left to the northwest it arched downward not straight like a airplane. My older son told me it was a rounded triangle shape. We all saw the same thing. The strange thing about this was that military planes have flight patterns through here every evening or night, and when we were looking at the object the military were flying to right of the object at a northwest direction and they were flying on the left of the object going at a southeast direction. The object was much brighter, and much bigger and much higher than the military planes.

I saw a ball shaped object in the Northeast sky that was flickering between red and white lights, it was a super fast flicker, and it rotated where the flickering came from on the object.  It would flicker in one spot, and then a second later in another spot, but on the same object, traveling at the same speed.  I don&apos;t know how else to describe it.

Minutes later, while still on my phone with my husband, it came into view again, this time traveling from the east to the west.  It was the exact same object, traveling at the same speed.  Again, I lost view of it in the western sky only because I was driving, and couldn&apos;t watch it and drive safely.

They looked like the background stars and I would not have noticed them had they not been moving. The lights must have traveled across a large expance of sky before I saw them. In a few seconds, the top light and the bottom right light just went out and the third one on the left fizzled out. Like it went behind clouds.

At appoximately 171st and Oak Park Ave. in Tinley Park IL three red lights were just sitting moitionless in the sky in a straight uniform evenly spaced line. The objects made no noise at all  After about five minutes one of the lights moved and the three lights formed a Triangular shape.  After which the lights started heading east in a very slow manner.  They were very high in the air and were just a solid red light no indicator lights like on a plane or helicopter.  It was something amazing to witness and the local paper reports that they are unsure of what it was.  After about 10 more mintues the 2 of the lights disappeared into the cloud cover and the night. Shortly after the third and final red light was gone as well.  The paper reports one of the lights been spotted again briefly at about 9:30 PM", "Two Unidentified Nocturnal Aerial Lights in the Sooke Hills - Sooke Basin Area, Southern Vancouver Island, British Columbia, CanadaIn the early hours of this warm Summer night I witnessed two bright lights, white in colour, stationary, or moving moderately about the western sky. They were in the vicinity of the Sooke Hills - Sooke Basin area (close to the Strait of Juan de Fuca). I was viewing them from Victoria, at least 16km- (10-miles) away. I have been interested in astronomy and aviation for most of my life and I am familiar with observing the night sky and aircraft at night. I can state with certainty that the lights were not astronomical bodies (they were not planets, stars, meteors, bollides, etc.) nor artificial satellites. The lights did not exceed a height of approximately 610-metre (2000-feet) above sea level. The flight characteristics (speeds and motions) of the two lights were not beyond those achievable by a conventional aircraft that is capable of stationary and/or very slow flight (to appear as if stationary), and forward flight at moderate speeds. A helicopter obviously comes to mind. However, my observations (I viewed the lights for 15-minutes over a 20-minute period) were not consistent with that of aircraft lighting: neither the red and green navigation lights, the red anti-collision beacon, nor the white anti-collision lights were visible at any time (I specifically looked for these lights). Additionally, the lights I did see were always visible and constant in brightness, never flickering, wavering, nor being lost from my view as they moved approximately 14&deg; across my line of sight. They appeared to be omni-directional lights and not the uni-directional lights I associate with an aircraft&apos;s approach-lighting. The lights, seven minutes apart, descended from my view behind the hills. The first light to descend may have been associated with a condensation-like cloud trail (a natural patch of cloud is also a possibility). It lit this up from below when it was behind the ridge lines, out of my direct view. Despite having spent a considerable amount of my time viewing the sky (in one form or another related to my interests), this is the first time I have observed lights in the sky that I cannot identify nor confidently explain. They were certainly not astronomical in nature, and they were certainly local to the Sooke Hills area. My observations were inconsistent with my previous experiences of conventional aircraft activity; sufficiently anomalous to warrant my writing a detailed report about my sighting. However, I cannot, at this time, rule out aircraft activity with certainty. My complete, detailed report with annotated maps has been published on the UFO*BC web site, http://www.ufobc.ca/History/2000/sookehills2004report.htm  I would be interested in reading reports of any other aerial activity (identified or not) that may relate to my sighting, whether around the date of my sighting or not.", "Round to oval morphing CharacteristicsMy wife and her sister were heading to the Pavillion Shopping mall when they both spotted what at first was an round object that morphed into an oval and back.Object appeared to move a short distance in a straight trajectory,stop abruptly then reverse to it&apos;s original starting point.After a short period of time the object flipped on its side.My wife who is a skeptic explained how &quot;wierd&quot; it was and assured that it was not a spotlight or balloon.It had flashing white strobes around the perimeter and was had distinct smaller circles inside the outer perimeter for an almost layered effect for lack of better words.She had the feeling that the object was not solid due to the morphing effects.I will check the news tommorrow to verify any potential eyewitnesses.She thought it odd that due to it&apos;s immense size and odd characteristics that no one stopped or pulled over.She is sure that others had seen it as well.", "Bright light object spotted near exit 7 off Highway 81 in Bristol, VA.  Next day, I have a slight sunburn and my eyes are really red.Sighted extremely bright star in the distance after pulling into a parking lot.  I kept watching this object as it seemed to hover in the distance.  At first I thought it was a helicopter whose lights were coming towards me so I watched it for a bit.  It then started coming towards me after about 6 minutes or so and I noticed suddenely two lights appeared, (or were turned on) red and blue, and they started blinking.  I got out of my car and looked straight over at the object as it came toward me and proceeded to come directly overhead and it moved extremely slow.

This is unusual for me since I am a professional web designer who takes pride in remembering details.  As I was standing there looking up at the object, two elderly ladies came out of the building but didn&apos;t notice the object at all.

I looked back to the ladies then looked back at the object again and it was gone.  Immediately after going inside the building I noticed my skin was burning a bit and didn&apos;t think much about it until today the day after.  My face appears red, just like a minor sunburn.  It is also still burning a bit and my eyes are also red.  This object was spotted off highway 81 in Bristol VA near the exit 7 area.  Earlier that day near road 700 I saw a black helicopter off in the distance, I had also saw one close to my work place even earlier that same day.

I could easily find that spot again, even after all these years. I was facing west while taking a pit stop and the sky was dark, starry, moonless, silent. I saw in the west three lights in a triangular formation. They were moving in a direction toward me very slowly in a path from due west to east. They were noiselss. All was silent and I would have heard any noise they made, as in a plane, or other known craft. I watched for many mins as they moved slowly across the sky. I then realized I had my 264 win mag rifle with me, it had a 3-9x40 scope on it. I got it out as they passed overhead and put the scope on 9x. I saw thru the scope three saucer shaped oblect with a bubble type turret or top. The lights seemed to eminate from a row of windows or whatever around each turret. The crafts were all three totally traditional &apos;flying saucer &apos; shape. I watched them thru the 9x rifle scope for a long time as they proceeded east into false dawn. Then they stopped totally and didnt move for many minutes. They seemed to just hang near the eastern horizon for a long time as I watched thru the rifle scope. It was getting lighter along the horizon at this time. Suddenly, and I mean suddenly, they streaked North and disappeared from my view. The speed which with they took off amazed me.

It was a line of 4 or 5 white and amber lights, much like an aircraft but much too large to be as distant as it looked. It moved slowly and silently, gliding low in the sky. I lost sight of it through the trees a few times as I drove. A minute or two later there were a few other small, slow triangles of blinking light in the sky, too. One triangle soon looked more like a diamond. For one brief instant, the line of lights seemed to have a faint gray coin shape below it, as if the whole thing might be a lighted disc tilted to an angle. The small objects seemed to move less slowly. Some lights blinked or changed from white to amber, but I can&rsquo;t remember a pattern. It all just seemed odd and moving strangely.

Once again I know it was there because it black out the stars as it moved only to see them reappear as it moved forward!

Both friends spotted it before me, as it took my eyes a minute to adjust to the clear bright sky. We were looking west in the direction of W.hwy 80. The object hovered and intermittingly moved as though it was going in and out of visibility. Every time it would do a sharp fast maneuver the sun would reflect silver. The object appeared to be at least 20000 ft high at first, hovering, then disappearing and appearing 1000&apos;s of feet lower, sometimes higher. Then it would do a 180 degree (half circle) maneuver and disappear only to reappear higher again. It was moving from west to N.east and eventually went straight over my apartment. The object was the typical silver saucer type. When it moved from south to north in a straight line it had some kind of tail behind it, hard to describe. It glowed amber/white. We watched this craft for 30 minutes. I watched my watch carefully as time seemed to stand still. I have never in my life watched a UFO for this long! 5-10 minutes at the most with a few past sightings but this was unreal. I remember the times specifically because I had a doctor&rsquo;s appointment at 1:30pm that afternoon which I ended up being late to by 5 minutes and the doctor&rsquo;s office is right across the street from my apartment not 2 minutes away. My two friends watched it for 5-10 minutes after I left for my doctors appointment as they say it came directly over the apartments at what they said was about 4000 feet. It then turned reddish amber and then just disappeared. The movements and maneuvering were simply mind blowing. No sound whatsoever. The strangest part of this sighting was that after watching the craft for about 10 minutes I heard a jet high above. It must have been at least 30000 feet up and it was all white with a radar type thing on top. Military for sure. It came from east, (possibly the Fallon, NV airbase?) and turned left and was heading south straight for the craft. The craft seemed to toy with the jet, appearing above then below flying in front then behind. Then the craft just hovered and seemed to start ignoring the jet as the jet flew from north to south maybe 20-30 miles and then banked east and just flew till we couldn&rsquo;t see it anymore. The strangest part was that as the craft hovered and maneuvered around the jet, the jet turned on some kind of ultra bright light of some kind that came from the center area of the plane and flashed a steady bright light that resembled a huge camera flash but it stayed on for at least 45 seconds then went off. All I know is the gov knew it was up there and must have been checking it out. The craft as it toyed with the jet, it seemed to show off to us.

Soon afterward we felt eased of the &quot;dread&quot; and we about to leave when we noticed that the airbase had came alive, ie: search lights, sirens and military police vechiles ranging along the security fencewe saw this due to our being on a slight rise. We left in our car, and decided to check if the base was shut down, the main gate was closed and MPs were not allowing anyone to enter. The next day the word was that a coyote had set off the perimeter alarm.((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

I immediately called for my daughters to come out and tell if I was really seeing these weird lights in the sky.  Sure enough, they saw the lights as well.  I called friends and family who also live in the area and they witnessed the lights also.  We stood outside watching them for about 30 minutes until they disappeared.  They moved slightly over the 30 minute period but stayed in a triangle formation.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))", "Huge triangle with red lightsWhile walking North in my neighborhood of West Hollywood, I noticed a red light in the sky, then a moment later, I saw a second red light moving in tandem with the first light (from my perspective about an arm&apos;s length away from each other). My first thought was maybe military (being in tandem and all). I then noticed a third light up ahead of the other two, forming a perfect triangle.  All moving in unison, heading North.  The three lights would pulse at the same moment. At that point, I realized there was the vague outline of a mass connecting these three red lights.  Then I watched as four or five other lights pulsed along the outer edge of the triangle, with more lights being on the western edge of the object. I could not detect any pattern to the flashing of these other lights.  A couple of times all seven or eight were on at the same time. I couldn&apos;t gage its altitude, but whether it was low or high, this thing was huge.  If it was just up a few thousand feet, you could fit dozens of commercial jets within its base outline.  If it was really high up -- well, it would be beyond massive.  One of those sweeping, movie premiere-style spotlights swept under the object and didn&apos;t touch it, so it was at least higher than those things can project light. I could detect no sound, the street I was on was quiet and I can normally hear aircraft (but I am still in a city).  The sky was clear (recent rain has made it noticibly so).  It seemed to glide across the sky and was just to my West, putting the object near the 405 highway.  Was anyone else looking up then?  Someone had to see this.", "This is in response to a similar report from Pottsville, AR that occurred on 12/2/04. On two occasions, I&apos;ve sighted a similar object in the same general area that exhibited similar flight characteristics. For the sake of brevity, I&apos;m only describing the most recent incident here. In the month of October 2004, I was traveling west on I-40 near Pottsville, AR at approximately 2000hrs when I noticed a white, non-blinking light west of my location at approximately 30 degrees above the horizon. The light was moving from south to north. I estimated its speed as comparable to a small fixed-wing aircraft. As, I neared the eastern city limits of Russellville, I realized that the object was directly over the eastern part of Russellville at an approximate altitude of 1500 ft. At this time, I reasoned that the object was the landing light of a small aircraft inbound to the Russellville municipal airport. However, an actual small aircraft moving north to south passed beneath the light and continued to descend towards the airport. I estimate the closest distance between the object and the aircraft to be less than 1000 feet as the two passed. The object continued to move to the north until it was approximately 1/2-3/4 mile north of I-40, at which time it made a slow turn towards the south and followed its original path back the way it had came across I-40. As I neared Russellville, I crossed beneath the object&apos;s flight path. At this point, the object was directly south of my location. I exited I-40 at exit 82 and stopped at a gas station at the top of the exit ramp to attempt a better observation of the object. Unfortuntately, by this time the object had moved well to the south and was difficult to observe. While standing in the gas station parking lot, I was able to note that the object was indeed moving to the south and was not a star or planet. I lost sight of the object shortly after that.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

They caught my attention as I have a large security light and these were some what brighter. At first I thought they may be aircaft landing lights as Airborne express is 25 miles north of my home. Frequent fly overs late at night are the norm. I also have worked there and these lights were spaced to far apart to be a aircraft. ALso as close as they appeared I saw no wing lights and no noise was heard as should have happened with the estimation of the distance from me.  NO operations go on at Airborne this time of the week. I thought maybe it could be a training flight from there and got out of my car to await the flyover. Suddenly they just disappeared.

Its was already dark because it was like 6. but anyway i asked them what they were doing and the said that there is a circle in the sky about this size O or a little bigger. I looked at it and it was changing colors, like lights were blinking on it red green and blue. It didnt move for a whole hour just sat there we watched it the whole time. We also had binoculars so it made somewhat a little more definite. after about the first hour we notice that it was going South East very very slow. when it got to a certain point it just turned white and we noticed another small one below it, It was doing the exact same thing but it was a little fainter, this one was following the exact some path that the bigger one took. The bigger one after a while started to look like a star like it was disguising itself as a star becasue it had stoped changing color and was just white. We didnt watch it long enough to see if they disapered or anything. But we have never seen any stars out that way or that low and my dad constatnly looks out that way because he watches the planes come in.

As I looked up and saw it, I noticed something out of the corner of my eye. It appeared very small and very high. I had trouble making out its shape but felt fairly confident that it was moving too slow to be an airplane. Since I could not make it out with my naked eye, I went and got my camera with digital zoom. It took me a while to focus in on it because it was so small. Once I was able to zoom in I recored two circular shaped objects. They seemed to be connected but their distance from each other changed and their orientation changed often. They never were very far from each other. I was able to tape about a minute worth and then lost them.

I stopped to get the mail and noticed lights in the sky above.  There were four separate round lights in sort of a circle formation. They were sort of low (below the clouds and well below an airplane that was passing very high in the sky at that time.  They moved counterclockwise incredibly fast and then moved in, toward each other and then away-almost like a dosedo in a square-dance. There was no sound. I then noticed another set of lights over my neighbors house about one hundred and fifty feet away.  Those four lights were doing exactly the same thing.  I thought it must be some reflection of some gizmo on the ground.  But I live on 11 acres.  My neighbor has ten acres.  My neighbor on the other side has 55 acres.  And behind us in a 30 acre preserve.  I could see nothing that would be causing this phenomenon. I began to drive down my road-which is a private road about two-tenths of a mile in distance to my house.  I noticed the left set of lights seemed to be following right above my car. I was in a panic and quickly turned around and sped back to the top of the driveway.  I tried to dial the police on my cell phone but I was not able to get it to work.  My cell phone always works at my property.  I used to have AT&amp;T wireless and switched to Verizon because it always works where I live.  In fact, before I had stopped to get the mail, I had just been on the cell phone.  I didn&apos;t know what else to do, so I went to my neighbor who also had those lights above her house, but whose driveway was much closer to the main road.  I skeed her to come outside and asked her if she knew what those lights could be.  She was freaked out and in disbelief.  I want you to know that my neighbor and I are both lawyers, and neither of us are prone to believing anything other than hard evidence.  We chatted for awhile both agreeing that there was nothing we could think of that could explain what we were seeing.  I joked that if I get beamed up, she would at least be able to explain my disappearance to my husband.  I finally got up the nerve to race down my driveway and into my garage, and I thought, that was the end of that.  I have absolutely no knowledge or experience with UFO&apos;s.  But the next day, my cell phone would not work..anywhere.  I finally removed the battery and waited an hour.  When I replaced it, the phone worked.  As I thought more about it, I decided to check the internet to see if anyone else had reported seeing the lights.

I muted the computer and could hear it somewhat better.  I stepped out onto the back porch to see if I could locate where it was coming from or see anything.  My dog stepped out with me.  It seemed to be receeding as we stepped out,  but it was coming from somewhere overhead. My dog, who was hoping that she was going to get to run off a racoon, stopped mid-stride and immediately assumed a &apos;Down&apos; poslture.  She looked straight up, however, from this position.  She appeared  afraid to move for a few moments. My husband stepped out onto the porch but the sound had faded away by then.  I and my dog are the only ones that heard it but it was very strange.  It had the same sort of pressure/air pushing  sound that a Chinook helicopter makes when you hear it coming off in the distance.  However, it was very much slower than the sound of rotor blades. And, it was different from a Chinook sound in that it seemed much, much, bigger.

After about 10 or 15 of these balls of light were in the air, they began moving (staying together) higher into the sky.  Once they got up to about the &quot;one o&apos;clock&quot; position, it looked as if it was a constallation moving across the sky.  Once they were out of our sight range, I called a friend of mine to come outside as well.  While my neighbor and I were telling her of what we saw, my neighbor said to look again....now there were more coming up.  Again, there ended up being about 15 to that group and they too travelled upwards as if a moving constallation.  Meanwhile, my other friend had noticed a very thick, very white and bright fog that seemed to be coming from the horizon as well.  I do not know if this was related or not.  All in all, we saw three groups of these moving.  Each group stayed together and moved up into space.  They never lost their brightness, they never flew around uncontrollably, they simply flew in &quot;formation&quot; and sometimes even seemed to be moving back and forth as they progessed upwards.  We did use our binoculars to try to see these things a little better.  I was still unable to make it anything other than a very bright ball of light.  They were not balloons, they were not air planes, they were not big bugs, or whatever else it could have been.  They were very unique and very awesome to see.

This report involves a single object. I use a Panasonic GS-12 mini-DV camcorder. I had the shutter speed at approximately 1:200, and manually focused.... (I never fish with 1:60 normal shutter speed or auto focus). The cam has 20x optical/200x digital zoom, I had it set to around 60x. It was a mostly clear night and I was filming out my front window toward the East (had glass and screen down). The moon was rising and at about 45degrees. I didn&apos;t observe the object until reviewing the film. The whole thing takes place in well under 1 second. The object enters the frame at 7:00 position (quickly), then it seems to pause/stop for the slightest fraction of a second before accelerating at incredible speed at slightly less of an angle. The interesting things to me are the apparent change of direction and acceleration. These factors, (as well as object size to camcorder zoom ratio) decrease the odds of it being something immediate to my position (bug,bird,debris,etc). It&apos;s behavior is inconsistant with a plane or satellite. I higly reccommend anybody curious to get out their camcorder and give this a try. MANUAL shutter, MANUAL iris, and MANUAL focus help a great deal. Also don&apos;t zoom way in... try to keep it as much in the optical zoom as possible. I encourage anyone handy with photo or video editing to PLEASE examine this. I am including my highest quality mpeg of this event as well as 1 jpeg of the object when it&apos;s apparantly still. And 1 jpeg just as it starts to accelerate. (e-mailing to ufocntr@nwlink.com). In the future I plan to record in tandem with a friend across town (parallax is really what&apos;s needed).

We have viewed the video footage, and our suspicion is that the object is not inconsistent with the flight of an insect in proximity to the camera.  However, it the camera was focused at infinity, that might militate against our theory.  On the other hand, the object crosses the entire disc of the Moon in approximately 1 second.  If it was in proximity of the Moon, some 2000 miles in diameter, that angular velocity would translate to 14 million miles per hour, which seems unlikely to us, given that the object appears to change its course halfway through its passage across the disc of the Moon.

I stopped in middle sentence and asked my brother &quot;what is that&quot;, with sheer excitment in my voice. We both saw something flying overhead. At first my brother thought they might be geese flying overhead because of the V pattern.  I grabbed my binoculars and noticed that this was a craft of some sort. This object appeared to be gliding with no sound.  It seemed to be a large craft flying at an altitude of 1000ft. It was a Vshaped object with what appeared to be white circular lights, I would say maybe three on each side with one at the point of the V. The lights were not bright at all, very dim glow.   It was heading in the eastern direction. This is one of three sightings I have seen in the past year.  A few months ago my sister, brother, and I were outside and saw a circular craft, this also had a dim glow to it, and last year I saw a grey triangle craft.

A Very bright red light was moving from East to West just North of her location. It appeared odd since she did not see any other customary lights as on an aircraft. It also was so slow moving as make her wonder if it could be a helicopter. After a few minutes it appeared to hover to the West &amp; she decided to have her husband come out to view it. Her husband had been a private pilot in previous years and spent time boating. Since he was familiar with various lights of navigation and aircraft she felt he might be able to add some insight as to what this was. He watched the light but could not identify what type of aircraft or blimp or balloon would appear like this so he brought out his binoculars. In looking through the binoculars he felt he could see 2 red lights, 1 slightly above and to the North of the other. He was not able to see any craft nor was he able to tell if the lights were independant or associated with a single object. They were moving syncronized. There was no engine noise detectable although throughout the sighting other aircraft were still in the area. From the time he observed the lights he felt the location of the lights was approximately 10 degrees North and 45 degrees West of where they sat. The lights headed back East (no apparent turn just changed direction) and ended up at about 10 degrees North and 45 degrees East when the husband went back into the house to see if he could see them from the front windows and if so he would see if his telescope could pick them up any better. He could not view them from the front windows and his wife informed him they were now gone. As his wife watched the lights moving East they had again seemed to hover as planes passed. This East area of the sky was hazy and cloudy. Although most airplane lights and the moon light was visable through the haze, the red lights seemed to either go on and off several times (or went behind clouds)and then were gone.  Throughout the viewing the lights appeared to become intermittently brighter or more brillant.

While in my car heading east on SR4 I noticed the formation was still there! (a little lower in the sky) It looked just like a bright comet... tail and all.

However, when I was looking straight up, a movememnt in the peripheral feild of vision in my right eye made me look towards the western sky, at a degree of 60 from the western horizon. The sky was cloudy due to a cyclone in the Arabian sea. But, luckily, a small linear break in the clouds allowed me to see a V-SHAPED/Boomerang shaped UFO which was visible in that hour only because of the lights , circular, atleast 6 of them under its structure. It was moving from west to east.Speed was about that which normal airliners take over cities.It made NO NOISE AT ALL.Inspite of that flying at cloud level (clouds during cyclones are somewhat low in altitude) , there was no engine noise/ no noise due to aerodynamic disturbance.Its size, I estimate it to be bigger than a boeing747. Shape, and illustration of the UFO , I am submitting a jpg file by email to this site.  And I am almost sure that the UFO which I saw was not a secret military aircraft.Reasons: 1) the Noiseless flight. If it were to be using a jet engine, even if the engine was hidden inside the airframe, it would have emitted some sound, flying at that low altitude.2) The big light emitting circles under it. Why would a &apos;stealth aircraft&apos; have such lights underneath it? the meaning of stealth itself if challenged if a stealth aircraft travels over a highly populated city like Bangalore, that too at low altitude, that too with light emitting circles under it.

And extremely interested in any kinds of flying machines , visit my room and find posters of all kinds of warplanes. (thats why I can easily concude that the UFO I saw was not a normal one built on existing earthly technology. Why would the USA be spending billions on the F-22 if it would have owned the UFO I saw, which was so noiseless and RADAR invisible. Moreover,  newspaper reports of unidentified RADAR signatures in the Air traffic control was NOT reported, that means the the UFO was: 1)Invisible to RADAR 2) Noiseless  Note, I on another site on the net, have come to know of a similar sighting of a similar type of UFO in Jaipur, Rajasthan , India, at october 2004.

While in the alien craft they preformed funny little tricks with me, called me names, and hasseled me.

This occurred shortly after sunset while there was still twilight in the west. The craft flew due east in my direction - I was seated on a picnic table next to a softball field and close to home plate. The craft flew fast and low over the ball field at an altitude of 15-20 feet and passed by me at a distance of about 150 feet to the south of me. It passed underneath an electric line running along the right field line and under another line that ran along the center field fence. It then left the ball field and climbed to pass over a building in an apartment complex, located on the east side of the ball field. The craft then dropped out of sight on the other side of the building. I continued to look in the direction of the apartments. Less than a minute later, the craft reappeared on the north side of the apartments, directly to the east of me. It then rose to an altitude of about 50 feet and slowly moved toward me.  It passed to the north of me at a distance of 100 feet or less from me. It then turned south and appeared to land at the south end of a parking lot, which is located on the west side of the ball field, about 150-200 feet from me.The craft then rotated to face me and then began to move toward me slowly and low over the ground. At this point I became somewhat afraid and left the park in my car.The craft was black in color and had a single white light on the front of it. Because it was getting dark, I could make out no further detail other than its shape and approximate size. I estimate the diameter of the craft to be 10-15 feet. Its shape is what I would describe to be a &quot;classic&quot; saucer shape.I felt the need to go someplace where there were other people (I was alone in the park), so I drove to a Walmart store, located about three blocks east of the park. As I entered the parking lot, I saw a white light flying eastward to the south of Walmart. It then made a large U turn and flew directly over Walmart at an altitude of less than 100 feet and then headed southwest and disappeared. I went into Walmart for about 10 minutes to make a purchase. When I came out, I saw a white light flying circles, altitude of 100 feet or less, over an apartment complex located just east of Walmart.I am assuming this white light was the saucer I saw earlier at the park, but the body of the craft wasn&apos;t visible at this point because the sky was too dark.As far as I knew, I was the only witness to the craft&apos;s activities. I went to a tavern located in a strip mall just northeast of Walmart to find someone I knew who could be a witness. Unfortunately, I didn&apos;t know any of the people who were in the tavern at that time.I stayed at the tavern for a time, occasionally stepping outside to see if the craft was still in the vicinty and saw it again on two more occasions. Both times, I saw it hovering over the east end of Walmart at a height of 75-100 feet. The first time, the craft began to move toward the southeast and then turned north. It passed low over the apartment complex and then over a service station. The body of the craft was briefly visible as it passed over the service station. The craft continued north and then made a sharp turn west. I then lost sight of it.I went back into the tavern and came out again about 15-20 minutes later. Once more, it was hovering over Walmart in the same place. This was my final, and most bizarre, sighting of the craft. The craft began to move on the same course as before, but this time it turned directly toward me instead of passing over the service station. It came at me fast and very low over the parking lot of the strip mall, came very close to me and then simply vanished. I looked all around me, even directly above me, but couldn&apos;t see it. I have no idea where it went. Because this happened so quickly and because I was somewhat stunned by what happened, I really couldn&apos;t discern any further details of the craft&apos;s appearance.I re-entered the tavern and came out again a short time later. I didn&apos;t see the craft this time, so I went home.About me: I am a 50-year old male. I have bachelor degrees in journalism and business, with work experience in both fields. At present, I am part owner of a computer store. This was my only &quot;real&quot; encounter with a UFO.

The lights went up to about 7 or 800 feet in the air before leveling off. Thier speed was so slow I found myself thinking they were very large balloons that were lit up some how.

The sky was extremely black closest buildings to the field had to be at least 5 miles or so away in any direction. The objects were moving extremely quick with a burst of purplish - white light.

At first they were coming from the dark of the sky towards the light of the moon the lights would collide and go off in 4 different directions.

I noticed that the lights moved deliberately but not always in the same pattern sometimes three of the lights would come together and the 4th would come just after. I called back into my office and asked two friends to come down and look at this. As I waited the lights started to fade away becoming less distinct and the pattern of their movement became more erratic. My two friends arrived to see a little of what I saw.

It was going the same speed as a plane.  I thought to myself &quot;are those a flock of bird? Is it a plane?&quot;  I watched it go by over my head and kept blinking my eyes and shifting them because i was amazed at what i saw.  If it was a flock of birds i was waiting for them to move a different direction as they always do.  I also looked for the blinking red lights that they have on a planes.  It didnt do or have either.... It was wierd because if you didnt look up you wouldnt notice it since the lights were very dimly lit or they kinda reminded me of reflectors and the Craft itself was almost transluscent although you can tell it was like matted black color. What it reminded me the most was the creature in the movie &quot;Predator&quot; looked like... sort of reflecting its surroundings, but yet you still are able to see the shape and color. It was still light out and i was able to see the shape which was like a &quot;V&quot;... with lights under it or reflectors.  It was going at a speed as a plane then it speeded up ... before it disappeared it tumbled (like a fighter jet pilot would do for fun) then POOF... it disappeared into thin air.

One day we stopped at the grave yard and sat down by the veterans memorial on the plot.  I looked up and said &quot;Wow, the sky is really clear tonight.&quot; Me being fasinated with the stares keeped on looking up for about 5 minutes, when all of a sudden I see something that i thought was a star start to move.  I ask ((name deleted)) if he saw it move and he said no, so we both waited to see if it would move agian and it started to move agian.  I asked &quot;((name deleted)) did u see that!?&quot; and he replys &quot;Yes! What is that?!&quot;  In amazment we layed down and watched this object that looked like a simple star dart across the sky, stop, then quickly jerk in the opposet direction. We&apos;ve gone back there many times after that night and we almost always see these objects.  I have even brought my girlfreind there to witness them.  This one night I was looking up and saw what i thought was an octigonal constalation of some sort, but when one  of the stares broke off and started moving i was really suprised, then another would break off.  I am really confedent that if almost anyone would just simply look up at the sky at night for more then 5 minutes...some of those things we think are stars..might just be a discised ufo!  I&apos;ve done resurch on ballons and satalites and nothing comes close to this.", "UFO followed meI was reading through the database and stumbled upon a report filed by a pilot about a sighting that happened on 21st November 1995.  I had a similar sighting around or on that date.  I cannot remember the exact time or date but the sighting is pretty much the same.  I was heading home from my girlfriends house in Hilton NY between 2200 and 2300.  I was driving along the parkway, east to Rochester.  I noticed off to my left (north) a blue light over Lake Ontario. The light was moving south and then it banked to the east when it got to the edge of the water. That&rsquo;s when I noticed the blue windows. The more I looked at it the more it freaked me out.  It was saucer shaped with 5 or 6 blue windows or lights in the middle of it.  It was shaped like two convex plates one on top of the other with the two plates being separated by a row of bright but not dazzling cobalt blue lights.  The row of lights was about 2 feet tall.  The UFO was about 7 to eight feet thick and about 35 feet in diameter.  (I am using the dimensions from the other sighting because they are the same).  The skin of the UFO was a metallic silver color.  It was a dull almost brushed steel finish.  It followed along side of me over the edge of the water for a few miles.  I started to get really scared so I decided to get off the parkway and take some back roads home to my dad&rsquo;s house.  After I got off the parkway I couldn&rsquo;t see the object anymore. I was coming around this corner when I saw the object hovering over some trees off to my right (south). Then I was really scared. I started driving about 50 miles per hour in these residential areas. The object followed me for a couple more miles until I got to the power plant.  Then it just disappeared. The whole thing really scared me and I am freaked out right now just writing this event down.  I am going to email a map of the area and try and make a picture.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The light on the object was circular, I could tell it was attached to a a craft but couldn&apos;t see a craft because it was dark outside. The object was roughly 50 feet to 100 feet above my car, and as it passed over and I went to slow my car down to catch a glance, the object vanished before my eyes.

The object made no noise.", "Floursent green &quot;stars&quot; that actually fly  in the skies over So. Cal.I live in Riverside/Norco California.  I have been closely observing the skies over these two cities since Nov 2003.  At that time i observed (on 11/16/03)a very large and bright and beautiful &quot;star&quot; in the eastern sky.  It was a sight to behold! It didn&apos;t just twinkle, it was a light show all by its self!!  Red, green. blue,gold and purple beams of light shooting out from it!! and as I cont. to watch it, I realized that this &quot;star&quot; was actually moving horizontally back and fourth as if it was flying! Well needless to say, the night skies captivated my full attention from that day on and I was hooked on astronomy and the possibility of UFO&apos;s in the skies over Norco California!!  Well, I did some investigating and the awesome star I saw I believe is Serius. The brightest star above earth.  It becomes visible to So. Cal in November through around March or so.  And although I know Serius IS a star...I have to say that I have never seen a star with the likes of this star in my 48 years on earth.  I know Serius has been around for probally millions of years, but I never noticed it before that Nov 2003 night.  How i missed it, I don&apos;t know.  And what makes it appear to be flying in the sky,I don&apos;t know either. Well anyways, I have had my eye on the sky ever since, and let me tell you, that I have seen many unexplainable as well as unbelieveable &quot;strange&quot; flying &quot;stars&quot; in our skies over So. Cal. First of all, when you look up in the sky just after dark, there are 3 bright lights in the sky that always stay in a triangle formation.  They look just like bright stars,but if you&apos;ve got a bit of patience, just sit down in a chair in a dark area,free from city lights, and watch those &quot;stars&quot;  Before long you&apos;re gunna notice that they are actually flying around in the sky.  They almost always stay within a certain radius from their original resting place, I&apos;ve never seen them just take off and jam across the sky.  It&apos;s as if they have a certain area to guard and they stay within that area.  I&apos;ve seen beams of light shoot out from these &quot;stars&quot; across the night sky for miles. Lately they have taken on a strange flouresent green hue, and when they &quot;fly&quot; they will luminize the whole sky around them which also turns flouresent green. Actually they are surrounded by vapor clouds and that&apos;s what lights up in the sky.  These clouds materalize and evaporate with the movement of these objects. The flying stars were observed all throughout this year. The color change took place in the middle of Nov. Will some of you see if you can see the same such mysterous objects in the sky over your own cities?? If you do, write a short discription of what YOU see here at this web site.  It&apos;ll be very interesting to hear other peoples stories about the &quot;flying stars&quot; and what YOU think they really are.  Thank You!!", "Mistaken for the moon, the light gave birth to others and &quot;danced&quot; in the night sky.On a beautiful July evening as my husband and I returned from a night out (No alcohol was involved). We pulled our car up to the curb ourside our home.  The weather had been clear until this time when clouds began to roll in from the southeast.  Then as he parked the car I became enthralled at the full moon overhead, hidden behind the clouds, and I began starring at it intently.  All, the while I&apos;m watching the moon I&apos;m thinking how big, bright, and beautiful it is. Also, where did these clouds come from?  Then it suddenly occured to me that the &quot;real&quot; moon was located in that exact spot probably 5 hours prior - &quot;how could this be the moon?&quot;, I think to myself, as I&apos;m standing on the sidewalk musing to myself.  No sooner did this thought materialize when the object (as if it heard my thoughts)jetted off to the west then stopped.  It was no longer overhead but slightly west of my location at this time. The &quot;clouds&quot; are emitting a light rain.  Now the &quot;moon&quot; appears to give birth to other lights of the same color, size and intensity.  These new lights (ever changing numbers - up to 22 or so) then began a &quot;dance&quot; of sorts.  They arranged themselves in 2 crescent shape lines of 5 or so, mirroring each other, with 6 or so others flanking their sides.  Then they would &quot;scramble&quot; and rearrange themselves in a similar fashion - just slightly different than the last - then scramble again. They appeared as children - playing in the rain.   This went on for 30 minutes or so.  All the while I am watching this I&apos;m strangely calm which is not my nature really.  I wanted very badly to run in the house for the camera but was afraid I&apos;d miss the opportunity of a lifetime for want of proof. This is my first ever time to report this publicly and I only do so now because I&apos;ve recently been haunted by the fact that that damned light actually &quot;read&quot; my mind!  I dont like that thought and everytime I look at a full moon I&apos;m afraid they&apos;re back to suck my mind.  I keep a careful watch on where the moon is whenever I&apos;m ouside. I am a simple housewife - I am not a scientist nor do I have a college degree.  My background is that of waitress and picture framer.  My husband is a truck driver/mechanic.  I&apos;m not prone to fabricating stories for attention.  In fact you&apos;ll notice I didnt even report this right away nor did I even discuss it with my husband til recent years.

I coulf see Hale Bopp in my drivers side mirror and it clearly was not green and told her so. She then pointed ahead of us and asked &quot;Well then what is that?&quot;. I looke in the direction she was pointing ans sure enought there was a bright flourescent green gaseous glowing mass in the southern sky. We kept watching it as we drove and it seemed to get brighter at its core. When we were able to we pulled off to the side of the highway. There were two other cars pulled over as well watching the green mass.We got out of the car and joined the small group of 7 other observers. The green mass had formed into a gian white brilliant ball of light. It remained as a single ball for about a minute and then suddenly two smaller balls emerged from it. One on either side of the larger ball. The two balls returned into the large one and then four balls came out, this time two on either side then they too retracted. Next three on either side came out and then went in. This pattern repeated until there were 8 balls on either side of the large ball. Then it started the pattern again but in reverse going backwards from 8 to 1. Once it completed that it started all over again. When the eight balls were on either side of the larger ball (for a total of 17 balls of light) it spread across the entire visible horizon. It repeated this pattern for about (or what seemed like) 25 minutes. My friend made a comment about how it was amazing to see but getting boring with all the little balls going in and out. At this point all the balls retracted and the large white ball shot off to the north west at what had to be several thousand miles an hour.", "ok I was sitting out on my drive way with my best friend (we were under 18 so no alcohol was involved) but anyway we&apos;d relax on warm nights, and we saw a few weird things, this one was just something that caught my eye last year.

It was huge and situated behind the bright lights of the car lot.  At first I thought it was a gimmick to attract customers to the dealership.  Then it moved very slowly, coasting back and forth from left to right.  I screamed as I realized it was the real thing...a UFO.  I parked my car and had a better view.  I described it to my daughter and said I wish I had a camera so I can show her how it looks.

She said,&quot;Mom! what&apos;s that?&quot;  When I turned around to face the moon, I saw a large gray mass moving as fast as a jet with no lights and no sound (like the trailing sound of a airplane engine).  We both watched it glide across the sky appearing and disappearing in the clouds until it finally got out of site.  The shape of it and the way it was gliding made me think that someone was on a hangglider at night.  But I couldn&apos;t see any body dangling from the object.  Then I thought, well maybe it&apos;s a plane, but again there was no sound from it.  The picture I keep replaying in my mind is that of a &quot;stelt boomer&quot; looking gray object with circles on the body of it.  The circles reminded me of cheese. It was so large that it had to be between 5 to 10 thousand feet up, well as low as the low moving clouds in the sky.

I&apos;m now attending college for culinary arts. I have lived in a high rise penthouse apartment for almost 27 months now. What I saw this morning was different then anything I have ever seen in my lifetime. I&apos;ve seen shooting stars from my apartment balcony which faces southwest. I look out my huge window daily and nightly to catch glimpses of the beautiful philly skyline that i have from my apt. I can see the airplanes turn and descend then land at the airport from my apt. Especially on clear nights I can see them coming and going extremely well as they pass back behind the skyline.Another thing is I&apos;m constantly checking outside for good shots to take of the changes in the season with the leaves and the city with my digital camera. This morning at around five am I got out of bed to get a drink of water, as I was pouring the water I was thinking to myself what a cool night it was and how it was probably really clear out. so I walked over to my balcony window and looked outside as I drank my water. I noticed it was extremely clear out and almost twilight. Although it was still dark out I noticed that it was going to be a clear day to come. I could see the blueness of the sky along with some puffy little clouds about too. As i was looking at the blueness of the sky and thinking to myself how it was pretty amazing how I could see the color in the sky even though it was still dark out. Then I noticed two extremely bright lights that were very close to each other. they were too bright too be planes and on clear nights you can clearly make out the shapes of planes, and also see the flashing lights on most of them. Although it was clear there wasn&apos;t much to see of any stars like in the summer time. these were not moving at all, if so very slow then. Not stars, not planes, not a helicopter, these were way too high up for that. They were extremely bright though, I was thinking to myself that someone else must be viewing them also. They were almost as bright as the moon when it is half full. I watched them for about ten minutes looking about thge rest of the sky at the same time looking for stars or planes to try to determine what it could be, I knew it wasn&apos;t something normal, it was interesting enough for me not to want to go back to bed, so I proceeded to go and quickly charge my dead video camera battery for a few mins. I then returned to record the footage. They were still there too close together to be airplanes, and besides they weren&apos;t moving, but they weren&apos;t stars. i taped them for about ten to fifteen mins. I zoomed in on them with my cam. very bright white light surrrounded with what looked like some type of fire or electronic field of energy. Then they both dissapeared for a moment, or so I thought, that&apos;s when I noticed that they were indeed moving because they had passed behind a cloud briefly just very very slow. I started to wonder if they could be sattelites or something, but why two so close together, and why did they move so slowly, yet seem to never change the distance between them. Then I thought maybe some type of anti-terrorism patrol craft that the military is testing or something. what better time to do it then 5am when normal working people aren&apos;t quite awake yet, and the partiers are sleeping. Not as much chance for someone sighting it. I&apos;ve seen numerous planes in the sky flying about the city around a month ago with what looked like spotlights on them flying around the philadelphia skyline, but they were moving quickly enough to tell that they were defintly moving. They also were much, much closer to the ground. These I don&apos;t know what they were. In read some other ufo reports and there is one on sept. 23rd 2004 in Hartland that sounds very similar to the two objects that I saw.

On this night I just happened to look over the St. Marys river between the tree line and noticed a VERY bright reddish orange light from where I was standing at approx. 245 degrees compass heading  moving so fast and erratically that it was at first a blur.  I thought that it was at first a helicopter from the  national guard-[they fly over the river often]- and moving so strangely I thought it was in trouble. The longer I watched though the less rapid the movement became and the VERY distinct outline became apparent. The object still had the same basic colors but was more red on the upper side and lighter toward the orange hue on the lower side. The movement was still jerkyand would move up and down and side to side quite rapidly. The longer I watched the more it seemed to stabilize and at once dropped straight  down. As I continued to watch it rose again and at approx. 200ft. the bottom became VERY white in color and a [what I would call] vortex began to form beneath it and to &quot;my&quot; eye it looked to be drawing what looked like water withen the vortex rising to the now very stable object. This lasted for about 5min. and as suddenly as it started, it quit! The vortex seemed to expand so quickly it looked similar to when someone would pop a balloon filled with water. The resulting mist expanded and the lighe from the lower side of the objece made a beautiful light show for a few seconds-[under a min.]. This is not the first time I have seen this exact same design of this type. I was raised in the Oceola national forest and as a child with my grandmother we would see these sights often and in &quot;many&quot; different forms and colors. She reffered to them as Gods lights. I have &quot;always&quot; believed in the fact that there is something about this we do not totally understand but this was the first time I saw this type of an action-and &quot;so close&quot;! The object when it performed this action could have not been more than 1/2 mile away and was large enough to be seen with extreme detail and clarity.The depiction in pictures one sees oh this type of craft is perfect in every way. The government with their continuing denial of these objects insults anyones intelligence when they say they are seeing what does not exist. The fact that within the hour of this sighting the military had a sky full if their own &lt;flying&gt; objects. The difference is they were noisy and quite stable in flight. I was in the Air Force [SAC] and have as much time in the air as most private pilots will get in any 5 years and I am more than familiar with most unusual things that are seen and meet no known description, but when something is this close---THERE IS NO DOUBT---what is seen!I have been asked why, if this so common that I don&apos;t take photos? You really cannot get one that is clear enough to be able to discern the objects as they appear to the naked eye. Anyone who has tried knows this is so! I just watch and enjoy our visitors antics that I have known for so long. Disbelivers---BELIEVE! There is no problem to see this if you spend any 1 month near this area and observe mostly at night in the early morning hours. The daytime can also be active in the summer months if you have tine to lie on your back and just watch! As a child this was a daily and nightly ritual. It us so.

My mother then returned inside to get her camera, when she came back outside the 3 lights had moved alot farther southbound. Still in the L formation, allmost perhaps it was a Triangle formation. Actually it was alot like a triangle formation. We took 3 pictures but they did not turn out(her camera is just a normal digital camera). soon after we took the pictures the farthest east light disapeared, just vanished instantly. the other to started 2 seperate and soon after the farthest west light vanished. That 1 however seemed like it burnt out like a fire. it was flickering then gone. the last middle one disapered in the same fashion, but again in it&apos;s own path.this all happend in about 10 - 15 minutes. the lights at 1st were about button sized in the sky and ultra bright when they were first over my house. These were Most deffinantly not some sort of Laser Light&apos;s that some 1 put in the sky. These were most deffiantly not moving like airplanes and were most definantly way higher then helicopters can go.they also made absolutly NO sound.", "Two bright lights in the southeastern sky that waxed and waned in brightness in unison.Not even sure this was a UFO sighting. Two lights waxed and waned in the southeastern part of the sky. The lights were parallel to each other, appeared stationary and lasted only a couple seconds. The lights were blue-white. The main oddity was that the two lights waxed and waned in unison. The size and brightness seemed identical. The brightness rivaled the brightest objects in the sky at the time. There was nothing in the sky or surroundings to give a sense of scale or distance as the sky was extremely clear and cloudless.", "2-4 pale orange spheres appeared hovering 30 degrees above the western horizon and vanished instantlyWhile driving north on Indiana State Road 37 about 3 miles south of Rigdon a light to the west caught my eye.Initially I thought it was Mercury or Venus.Then I saw movement out of the corner of my eye and I turned to look again. Now there were 2lights about 30 degrees off the horizon. I told my wife who was in the car with me to look at what I was seeing. We were meeting a car so she admonished me for not watching the road. I turned to face the oncoming car to make sure I was in control of the car. I again turned my head to look at the lights. This time I saw 4 lights in a row parallel to the horizon. Again I checked for traffic saftey by looking ahead. I again turned to face the lights. This time there were 2. While I was watching them they individually vanished one at time, just like as if someone turned of a light switch. The lights were perfect spheres sharply outlined with the light coming through a surface much like a frosted light bulb. The color was a pale orange glow. Their size was similar to a round automobile headlight when viewed from 20-30 feet away. My wife felt they were considerably bigger. We turned down the first road to the west to investigate the general area and drove 2 miles. There was no sound associated with this experience and no further sighting took place. I am a pilot and I have never experienced anything like this before or since. The weather was perfectly clear. They were not landing lights or navigation lights on an aircraft. Their glow did not change except to vanish instantly.", "Viewed a large V shaped pattern of square lights moving quickly overhead from NE to SW.We were sitting in my hot tub last night. I leaned back to look at the stars as it was a very clear night and the stars very bright. I viewed a very large V moving overhead from NE toward SW. I said &quot;what the heck is that&quot; everyone looked up and briefly saw what I was looking at. At first I thought it was a large flock of Geese, but the formation was too purfect and much straighter that a V of geese. It appeared to be a formation of smaller odjects because it was not a solid V I could see the stars behind the center of the V. Each individual object was a small square and appeared to be lit up. The color was soft orange like a harvest moon color. The squares on one side of the V looked a little more ragged than the other side. The whole grouping moved steady but quickly across the sky. We may have had a view for 6-8 seconds and it was gone out of sight behind trees in our neighbors yard. There was no sound at all. All of us saw the object(s) the same as we discussed it after it was gone, and all had a very strange feeling that it was like nothing any of us had ever seen.", "Huge circle of rectangular light beams shoot into the night sky on highway 94Entering this report as it may have some bearing for researchers.  My three companions and I were traveling from Battle Creek to Galesburg at around 2:15 am on highyway 94.  The night was damp and foggy.  Ahead, we noticed bright beams of blue white light streaming into the sky in random, puslsating fashion, and an angle of about 60 degrees, right up from the ground.  The beams lit the cloud base, and from a distance, they created a wedge shape of beams.  As we got closer, these beams were observed to be very large, as large or larger than a searchlight beam.  They formed a circular pattern on the cloud base.  We slowed down and stopped the van opposite the lights on the berm of the highway.  We sat there for a minute, watching the rectanglar beams pulse upward in random patterns.  We figured there was a car lot or welding shop down there, as they came from below the highway and behind trees.  The number of them, however, and the late hour, convinced us that this could not be search lights.  The area they eminated from was about the size of a ranch home.  I decided to cross the freeway and take a look, and we all opened the doors and got out.  When I closed the door, the lights went out!  We stood there in total darkness for a second and then piled back into the van an got out of there in a hurry. The next day, remembering a mile marker that was close, we returned and found a pond below the trees where the lights had been.  A week later, a Cleveland Plain Dealer artist drew a sketch of a UFO she had seen hovering above her back yard.  She claimed it had thrown bright, blue white beams of light through rectangular windows around its edge.  Her drawing would have corresponded to what we saw that night.", "Slow moving red lights.Three red lights moved slowly across the sky, staying in perfect formation. As they reached the southwest they changed formation into that of a triangle.  One dissappeared, then a second, and finally the third.", "Momentary flash of 7 bright lights near Saddle RockSitting on my back porch in S Wenatchee facing west, saw a momentary flash of approx 7 bright lights in a straight line equidistant from each other over the ridge at Saddle Rock.", "We saw 3 red lights in the Eastern sky traveling slowly in a straight line to the southeast. They then shifted into an L shape and held that position for a while. Then they formed a triangle. One of the lights then slowly seemed to decend or drop away. The other two then slowly just disappeared. This was approx. 8:10pm. At about 9:15pm a few of us were out and saw a single red light that traveled a short distance and then disappeared. There was a helicopter and an airplane in the area at the time and these red lights didn&apos;t resemble either one.", "A round white object flew diagonally behind a cloud.It was made up of about 4 round layers. They went up in steps and each one was a bit smaller than the one beneath it. It was white. Rectangular windows went all the way around it. On the bottom was four &apos;legs&apos;. These were silver poles with flat disks on the end. On the top were lots of antennae and aerials. Some of these were flashing. The windows also flashed. I heard a sort of beeping noise and a whirring noise. The thing was flying upwards on a sharp diagonal and it went behind a large cloud. I was scared so I ran into my house. It was flying fairly quickly and was quite large.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "Three red sphere shaped lights moved slowly across the sky and then one of them just disappered, the others followed.I was at Forest View Farms in Tinley Park/Oak Forest when three red lights started to move slowly around the area, and then disappered.  One of my friends called my cell phone and told me to look in the sky at the three red circular lights that were sort of floating.  She said they were UFOs.  I stood there staring at them and then the one at the back of the 1/2 circle shape they made faded and disappered.  The rest of them disappered soon after the first.", "UFO Pinball?This sighting took place during a camping trip with three friends. At the time our ages were between 23 and 30 years old. We were sleeping outside under the stars when we saw a light object travelling at a high rate of speed. It traversed the night sky from horizon to horizon in approx. 10 to 15 seconds, much faster than any plane or satellite any of us had ever seen. A few minutes later, it or another like it croosed the sky at a slightly different angle except it made an abrupt almost right-angle turn without losing or gaining speed. A few minutes after that another similar object was seen crossing but from a much different direction. When it was almost directly overhead, it came to a sudden stp. We tried to keep an eye one it, which was difficult in a sky full of stars. However it wasn&apos;t long when we noticed yet another similar object approaching from approx the same direction, but this one headed straight for the object that appeared stationary, then appeared to &quot;bounce&quot; off the object at about a 120 degree angle and keep right on going, without speeding up or slowing down. The stationary object never moved again, or at least it didn&apos;t before we all fell asleep. We all talked about it the next couple of days and we all agreed we had seen UFO&apos;s.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "bright orange glow turned into six crafts and flew across the skyStarted with a single bright orange glow then diminished into six small flashing crafts.  Crafts then zig zagged quickly across the sky then one of them flashed into a bright orange glow again.  Two then disappeared and the remaining four formed a straight line formation spaced about a mile apart from each other and proceeded east until they were no longer visible.", "Went over house during hurricaneHurricane Frances had been setting on us all day and I was staying up SUN. night watching reports.We were in the east eye wall and catching it bad. At 12:35 I started hearing what sounded like a large engine running (like a utlity truck or something) on the road in front of my house over the howling wind.I thought what is a crew doing out in this .I had heard earlier on TV all county vehicles had been orderd off the roads.Then the sound got louder like it went in to a great strain and more of a roar. About this time I realized it was getting closer to the house comeing across the front yard. Then I thought OH CRAP Tornado,but in my mind that didn&apos;t jive.I ran to my back door which faces north and stepped out on the first step and looked up.The wind was comeing from the south and all kinds of debris was going past the side and over the house to the north. Now the sound was right over the house and had changed to what I can only describe as the roar of a rocket at lift off, deafening. Still looking up I jumped to the ground (to get a better angle) just in time to see a yellowish light pass over the tree line of my back yard. The trees are about 30 feet high and I could see the tops silhoueted by it just a few feet above them. What ever it was it was going west to east cross-wind to the storm. I couldn&apos;t see a shape but I could tell something soild was there. No way was this a plane or helicopter.In a couple of seconds it was out of sight and hearing range due to the storm.I&apos;m 50 years old and have worked electrial mechanical all my life.

It was coming in and out of the cloud cover and covered about 1/3 of the sky in under less than a minute.  It appeared to be about a mile up, and my guess it was about 30 feet wide. It did not fly exactly straight, and at times changed course to avoid something. It was not eratic in motion.  Many craft have been seen in this area like this, but this is the first early morning one that I have seen. Definitely not a &quot;morning star&quot; or airplane. To note, I am a medical professional, and am drug tested annually.  I never have done drugs, and very rarely drink.  This is not the ravings of some mad-man.

My buddy was driving on our way home from work and I, as I do every time on the road at night, was looking for strange craft. Typically I see these triangles over my home in Tracy Ca as they are the ones flying the lowest, quietest, and slowest over the town, usually in groups of two to three, one after another, in the same path.  Friday nights view was the best I&apos;ve ever had. First I see up above, a standard plane, similar to a U2, with no lights on.  It had a red and green light, and no others. About two minutes later, as I scan ahead of us, all of a sudden there it was.  It appeared out of no where. Nowhere was it in front of us until, I must have blinked, and there were two lights ahead and sllight right of us, about 1-2 miles from us.  Freeway is packed and as we pass to the left of the craft, it was no more than 500 yards to my right and 250 yards up.  I saw a perfect triangle with three big lights in each corner.  Center was a tiny light and between each big light and the center light was a medium light.  This was by far the best vision of this triangle I&apos;ve ever seen.  I rolled down my window pointing and my buddy didnt get to see it all lit up, sort of hovering to the right like I did.  Traffic was heavy.  Often these planes come in and appear to land or hover about the Sunol grade area, just before the 84 exit.  This one either was invisible and came out at that moment, or perhaps he was moving at such a quick speed that when he stopped, I was able to view him.  Amazing!", "there were red lights which slowly moved over my location, which then &quot;winked out&quot; one by one.at least three lights appeared on my western horizon. the color and brightness were similar to the red marker lights i have seen on transmission towers, with the exception that these lights appeared to &quot;flicker&quot; the arrangment of the lights appeared to be triangular at first ( but very obliqley from my angle of view ) then they appeared to spread out in a rough line on my western horizon. it was not long before one of the lights &quot; winked out&quot; , followed in turn by the others.what was really interesting was the sighting of a last light which appeared after i could no longer see the first group. this lone light, which looked the same as the ones before, made its way directly over my neighborhood before &quot; winking out &quot;", "Silver cylindrical object; no wings; no vapor trail; no sound passing SE to NW just before sundown.Before sunset; straight-line flight from SE to NW; silver; may have had reddish color at the leading end; no visible wings; no vapor trail; no discernable sound.  It passed beneath the dispersed contrail of a jet, but appeared to be at some altitude(maybe 20,000 feet?).  Object was 5 or 6 times longer than wide and blunt at each end.  The rate of passage from my perspective was similar to a jet airplane, but the impression was that it was not being propelled so much as gliding.  It was first spotted by my 5-year old grandson, who asked what it was.  I looked up expecting to see an airplane.", "Small accelerating round object, intensly bright at its center.It was just turning dark outside dusk while I was driving just outside Fort Belvoir base on a major road, I saw a single small bright object out my driver&apos;s window, I was going about 40MPH, the object was moving above but horizontally. I saw it out of my drivers window and across my field of view at the corner of my eye to where I had turned my head completely to the left to look out the window because it was something not normal. I saw a small intensely bight object flying horizontal at a slight parallel angle of travel to my vehicle which it was traveling at a faster rate of speed. It was hard to discern the true distance or size as it was so small seemingly softball size in relation to my depth perception and traveling above the housing/tree line. The object was traveling faster than my speed, creeping across my field of view for two seconds and my eyes and head following it to the front windshield pillar when I quickly turned my head slightly look at my wife in surprise asking her if she sees that and pointing with my right hand while driving with the left and looking at the object, as I did that I see the object accelerate extremely fast at now seemingly a 45 degree angle where previously parallel to my travel. The acceleration was very linear and extremely fast, with acceleration far faster than an unknown aircraft I saw at Andrews Airforce base which was clearly an aircraft, greenish-grey which was made little noise, slowed, turned, hovered, and accelerated to a sonic boom. This on the otherhand when the object accelerated within this brief time second or so, the light just dissapeared as though it turned off or went so far out of view to where it was no longer visible. The light did get smaller as it seemingly accelerated away from my position and was at a slight upward angle but so fast as it got so small I couldn&apos;t see it or the light turned off. The light of the object was intensly bright with greater intensity with a unusual white-ish color at its center to where you could make out a inner sphere with an outer intensity lessening to a faint white yellow-ish/orange color and to its edge of intensity of a greyish color. The light intensity did not light the sky or leave a smoke trail, nor a light trail as it accelerated. There was enough light at dusk to see. There was no outline of a larger aircraft, it did not strobe, it was not a spark or flash, it was very low to the ground, it accelerated in speed and was not a shooting star or a stationary object and there was no noise I could hear coming from it from inside the car. I would note the travel path did not waver and was at a consistent straight line path of travel and it accelerated along its path.", "A large bright light like the moon.

All of my family members eccept my dad and I were at the view site. My dad and I went to the parking lot to get a few things and suddening a brilliantly bright light came in sight along with train whistle sounds. The light was white or sort of yellowish like the moon. The light reach from the top of the trees to the bottom at the ground. The one light came in from the right at the edge of the trees and went through the woods to the edge of the woods on the left side of the parking lot. After the light disappeared my dad and I ran back to the over look and started asking questions. There were scientists there along with others besides my family. We asked everyone if they had heard any train whistles or seen any unusual lights that were very large, no one had heard or seen anything. One of the scientists did tell us that the closest train there was had to be 40-50 miles away. In the woods when we walked down as we first got to wiseman&apos;s view had no evidence of any train tracks any where.
