It was fall in small town Iowa, Onawa. My best friend&rsquo;s mother sent us to get cigarettes for her (if that doesn&rsquo;t tell you how long ago nothing will). The railroad tracks ran through their back yard. On the other side of the tracks was a large grassy area owned by the railroad. My best friend, her younger brother and I were just crossing this empty area headed for downtown Onawa when we saw a slow moving object in the sky.I was between 8-10 years old as was my best friend, and very smart&mdash;later I found I have a genius IQ. I stood staring at the object and knew immediately that it wasn&rsquo;t an airplane. My father was a jet mechanic for the Air Force during Korea and then the Air National Guard and had taken me to many air shows. Before and after seeing the object I have never seen an aircraft with square red lights, and believe me, I have looked. The object was saucer shaped, moving not far above the town. It had square red lights that lit sequentially from right to left with a gap that made it seem like the lights were running around the object. There was no sound as it moved along, moving south to north. As we watched a building blocked our view. We ran to see if we could catch a further glimpse of it, but it had vanished.My friend&rsquo;s younger brother told me later that he had seen the same object one night hovering above the grain elevators two blocks from his house. He saw a beam of light coming from the object trained on the elevator for a few moments, then it took off. Because we were children no one believed us, but I went home and drew a picture of it so I could remember it and look for a logical explaination as I got older. So far I have found no aircraft with square red lights on it, but I&apos;m still looking.((NUFORC Note:  Source indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

We observed it with our rifle scopes as it moved slowly to the southeast before hovering motionless . It had 3 small windows that we could see.I called from the shop to the house and asked my wife to bring her fathers old 300 power telescope to the shop.She brought the scope and I laid it over a 55 gallon drum and we three watched the thing for about 15 - 20 minutes.I saw a small light come from the crafts belly and hold there as another small light joined it.

One and then the other entered the bottom of the craft, then the craft, shot off to the southeast and disappered in a flash.Never was there a sound we could hear and the craft only moved slightly to the west from which it came before it  zipped off to the southeast in a flash.NOTE:  The small lights that came from the belly of the craft did so in a downward arch and re-entered the same way.

E. Warren Air Force Base, Cheyenne, Wyoming 90 miles west of our sighting just west of Souix Army Depot, ===================================================================================== ** Begin Excerpt **  The popular impression through the years was that Blue Book was a full-fledged, serious operation. The public perhaps envisioned a spacious, well-staffed office with rows of file cabinets, a computer terminal for querying the UFO data bank, and groups of scientists quietly studying reports, attended by a staff of assistants. The actual situation was unfortunately the opposite. The operation was generally headed by an officer of lesser rank. In the military the importance attached to a mission is usually in direct proportion to the rank of the commanding officer. The relatively low-ranking officers in charge of Blue Book were usually assisted by a lieutenant and sometimes only by a sergeant. For one long period of time a sergeant with little technical training was given the chore of evaluating most of the incoming reports. This was not exactly a first-line, high priority operation. Blue Book had much too small a staff to do justice to a phenomenon that so often greatly concerned the public. Compounding the problem, the staff was able to devote only part of its time to the technical problem at hand. During my regular visits to Blue Book across the years I observed that much of the work in the office was devoted to peripheral matters all done at a leisurely pace. Further, Blue Book&apos;s low-ranking officers had no leverage to initiate the type of investigations that were needed and for which I frequently asked.The military is entirely hierarchical; a captain cannot command a colonel or a major at another base to obtain information for him. He can only request. As long as Blue Book did not have at least a full colonel in command, it was impossible to execute its assigned task properly. In reviewing cases that had come in during the previous month, I often asked that additional, often crucial information on a case be obtained. The results were at best minimal; officers at other bases were generally too busy to bother to investigate further. Why should they? They all knew it was a finger exercise anyway. Blue Book was a &quot;cover-up&quot; to the extent that the assigned problem was glossed over for one reason or another. In my many years association with Blue Book, I do not recall ever one serious discussion of methodology, of improving the process of data gathering or of techniques of comprehensive interrogation of witnesses. The reader may well ask at this point why I did not either lay siege to the Pentagon, demanding action, or simply resign in disgust. Temperamentally, I am one who can easily bide his time. I also dislike a fight, especially with the military. But most importantly, Blue Book had the store of data (as poor as they were), and my association with it gave me access to those data. In a sense I played Kepler to Blue Book&apos;s Tycho Brahe. As far as demanding action from the Pentagon, I knew only too well the prevailing climate and recognized that had I been too outspoken, I would have quickly been discredited, labeled a UFO nut, lost access to data, and certainly would have lost all further effectiveness. I have always been of the turn of mind that &quot;truth will out&quot; if given time; if there was indeed scientific &quot;paydirt&quot; in the UFO phenomenon, as time went on and the gathering of data improved, even the most hostile skeptics would be powerless to sweep it under the carpet. The astronomer traditionally adopts a very long time scale. By and large, however, Blue Book data were poor in content, and even worse, they were maintained in virtually unusable form. With access to modern electronic data processing techniques, Blue Book maintained its data entirely unprocessed. Cases were filed by date alone, and not even a rudimentary cross-indexing was attempted. Had the data been put in line readable form, the computer could have been used to seek patterns in the reports, to compare the elements of one report with those of another, and to delineate, for instance the six basic categories of sightings used in this book. Since all the thousands of cases were recorded only chronologically, even so simple a matter as tabulating sightings from different geographical locations, from different types of witnesses etc.was impossible except by going through, manually, each and every report. A proposal for elementary computerization of the data in the Blue Book files, devised by Jacques Vallee and myself and submitted by me directly to Major Quintanilla at Blue Book, was summarily turned down.   In view of the above and of the frequently contradictory and inane public relations statements concerning UFO reports, which even the man on the street found unconvincing, it is hardly a wonder that the charge was frequently made that the publicly visible air force &quot;investigation&quot; of UFOs was merely a front for a real investigation being carried on somewhere &quot;higher up.&quot;  Were I the captain of a debating team whose job it is, of course, to marshall the facts favorable to his side and studiously to avoid the other&apos;s, I could defend either side of the argument. At no time, however did I encounter any evidence that could be presented as valid proof that Blue Book was indeed a cover-up operation. However, many indications, bits of information, and scraps of conversation could be force-fitted into a yes for the cover-up thesis. Thus, for instance, one time when I inquired into the specifics of a certain case, I was told by the Pentagon&apos;s chief scientist that he had been advised by those at a much higher level to tell me &quot;not to pursue the matter further.&quot; One can make of that what one will. In a country as security conscious as is ours where central intelligence is a fine art, it frequently seemed to me that very provocative UFO reports were dismissed without any seeming follow-up - certainly an illogical if not dangerous procedure unless one knew a priori that the report really was of no potential information value to the security of the country (or that it was but was being taken care of elsewhere). As an example, the report of five rapidly moving discs, made by a member in good standing of the 524th Intelligence Squadron stationed in Saigon and observed by him from the roof of the squadron&apos;s headquarters, went untouched by Major Quintanilla and Blue Book on the grounds that &quot;the sighting was not within the continental limits of the United States.&quot; It would seem almost inconceivable that the intelligence officer in question would not have been further interrogated by some agency; certainly in an active battle area his sighting might have presaged a new military device of the enemy. Another example, one of many, was this, on the first day of August, 1965, and on the following two days there occurred the &quot;Midwest flap.&quot; From several states strange Nocturnal Lights were reported by ostensibly reliable police officers on patrol at various places over an area of several hundred square miles. Blue Book dismissed this event as &quot;stars seen through inversion layers,&quot; although I know of no astronomer who has ever witnessed inversion effects that produced these reported effects. Both past experience and calculations show that such illusory effects, in which stars move over at a considerable arc of the sky, simply cannot be produced by thermal inversions. However, police officers weren&apos;t the only ones to report. The following is a direct transcript of a Blue Book memo: In the early morning hours of August 1, 1965, the following calls were received at the Blue Book oifices by Lieutenant Anspaugh, who was on duty that night:  1:30 A.M. - Captain Snelling, of the U.S. Air Force command post near Cheyenne, Wyoming, called to say that 15 to 20 phone calls had been received at the local radio station about a large circular object emitting several colors but no sound, sighted over the city. Two officers and one airman controller at the base reported that after being sighted directly over base operations, the object had begun to move rapidly to the northeast. 2:20 A.M. - Colonel Johnson, base commander of Francis E. Warren Air Force Base, near Cheyenne, Wyoming, called Dayton to say that the commanding officer of the Sioux Army Depot saw five objects at 1:45 A.M. and reported an alleged configuration of two UFOs previously reported over E Site. At 1:49 A.M. members of E flight reportedly saw what appeared to be the same uniform reported at 1:48 A.M. by G flight. Two security teams were dispatched from E flight to investigate.   2:50 A.M. - Nine more UFOs were sighted, and at 3:35 A.M. Colonel Williams,commanding officer of the Sioux Army Depot, at Sidney, Nebraska, reported five UFOs going east.  4:05 A.M. - Colonel Johnson made another phone call to Dayton to say that at 4:00 A.M., Q flight reported nine UFOs in sight; four to the northwest, three to the northeast, and two over Cheyenne.   4:40 A.M.. - Captain Howell, Air Force Command Post, called Dayton and Defense Intelligence Agency to report that a Strategic Air Command Team at Site H-2 at 3:00 A.M. reported a white oval UFO directly overhead. Later Strategic Air Command Post passed the following: Francis E. Warren Air Force Base reports (Site B-4 3:17 A.M.) - A UFO 90 miles east of Cheyenne at a high rate of speed and descending - oval and white with white lines on its sides and a flashing red light in its center moving east; reported to have landed 10 miles east of the site.  3:20 A.M. - Seven UFOs reported east of the site. 3:25 A.M. - E Site reported six UFOs stacked vertically. 3:27 A.M. - G-1 reported one ascending and at the same time, E-2 reported two additional UFOs had joined the seven for a total of nine. 3:28 A.M. - G-1 reported a UFO descending further, going east. 3:32 A.M. - The same site has a UFO climbing and leveling off. 3:40 A.M. - G Site reported one UFO at 70&apos; azimuth and one at 120&apos; . Three now came from the east, stacked vertically, passed through the other two, with all five heading west. When I asked Major Quintanilla what was being done about investigating these reports, he said that the sightings were nothing but stars! This is certainly tantamount to saying that our Strategic Air Command responsible for the defense of the country against major attacks from the air, was staffed by a notable set of incompetents who mistook twinkling stars for strange craft. These are the people who someday might have the responsibility for waging a nuclear war. For some, incidents such as the above would be prima facie and conclusive evidence that the cover-up hypothesis was the correct one, on the grounds that no group charged with serious defense responsibilities for the country could have been so stupid. On the other hand, our hypothetical debating team captain could amass an even more impressive cache of evidence to conclude quite the opposite: that the entire Blue Book operation was a foul-up based on the categorical premise that the incredible things reported could not possibly have any basis in fact. After all, science pretty well understands the physical world and knows what&apos;s possible and what is not. Since the reported actions of UFOs clearly didn&apos;t fit this world picture, they simply _had to be_ figments of the imagination produced in one way or another. All my association with Blue Book showed clearly that the project rarely exhibited any scientific interest in the UFO problem. They certainly did not address themselves to what should have been considered the central problem of the UFO phenomenon: is there an as yet unknown physical or psychological or even paranormal process that gives rise to those UFO reports that survive severe screening and still remain truly puzzling?  Such lack of interest belies any charge of &quot;cover-up&quot;; they just didn&apos;t care. There is another argument for the &quot;noncover- up&quot; viewpoint: the underlings in the military hierarchy (and all Blue Book officers were such - generally captains or majors, two of which finally made lieutenant colonel but never full colonel) looked mainly toward two things, promotion and early retirement. Therefore, in controversial issues it was always considered far wiser not to &quot;rock the boat,&quot; to please the superior officer rather than to make waves. Thus, when the superior officers, who did not know the facts but were wedded to a rigid framework of military thinking handed down from above, let it be known in any controversial issue (whether UFOs or not) what the &quot;right way&quot; of thinking is, no underling officer was going to oppose or even question it unless, of course he was 99 percent certain that he could prove himself correct in the controversy - and quickly. Since the Pentagon had spoken in no uncertain terms about UFOs, no Blue Book officer in his right promotion-conscious military mind was going to buck that, even if he had private opinions on the matter. Another factor added to the noncover-up theory. Turnover in the Blue Book office was rather high. Sooner or later the officer in charge would be out of it, just that much closer to promotion and retirement, if he just sat tight.&gt;From 1952 to 1969 the office was headed in turn by Captain Ruppelt (who did not make his own views known until he was out of the air force), Captain Hardin (who had ambitions to be a stock broker), Captain Gregory (to whom promotion was the be-all and end-all of existence), Major Friend, and finally Major Quintanilla, who had the longest term of office. Of all the officers I served with in Blue Book, Colonel Friend earned my respect. Whatever private views he might have held he was a total and practical realist, and sitting where he could see the scoreboard, he recognized the limitations of his office but conducted himself with dignity and a total lack of the bombast that characterized several of the other Blue Book heads. Thus one can have one&apos;s choice of whether Blue Book was a front or merely a foul-up. But that there was certainly foul-up and complete divorce from the scientific community within Blue Book was apparent. The members of the scientific fraternity were, of course, wedded to the misperception-delusion hypothesis (there was no need for interchange of ideas with Blue Book, which held the same views), and some members rose to heights of vitriolic verbiage in denouncing reporters of UFOs. This phase of the total phenomenon had many of the aspects of a modern witchhunt. ** End excerpt **", "bright lights over hollywoodthey were six lights in the sky we thought they were stars but then they started to move and stop they kept doing this in one spot for about 20 min", "Triangle craft at standstill looks like star from distance as to blend in and then flies over house, Avon Park, FlTo explain in words I will do my best. Around 04:45 this morning, I let the dog out in the backyard and saw this very bright star. That was my original thought, that it was just a very bright star. It somehow grabbed my attention, obviously, or I would not be writing this. This is a small town and very dark at night to where you can always see stars in the night sky, any given night, so that is normal, and yes some &ldquo;stars&rdquo; appear to flicker as this had seemed to do but in retrospect to the others around it from a &ldquo;distance&rdquo; appeared as looking as a star. It appeared to look that far away, so I thought. So I just could not stop watching it...and then, I could not believe what I was seeing. It began moving up and to the right REAL slow, I mean REAL slow and a trail of white light came from behind it and in its appearance it still remained as to look as a star would as it moved up and to the right. I was thinking to myself, I hear no chopper blades, so it can not be a chopper. I was trying to equate logic to what I was seeing while watching it. The fact that it was moving that slow is what really shocked me about it. So I had to see what this thing was, It was cold as I stood there from inside with the back door open, and had no shirt on and ran to the couch to put it on. Why is this important, well because of this I did not see it &ldquo;turn&rdquo; towards the direction of my house and then when I came back it was flying over the house at a slow speed. A speed to me that if a plane was moving that slow it would not have the propulsion to really fly. It was in the shape of a triangle. It made no noise whatsoever and it was so smooth as it was moving. It was like a bird, slow and just gliding through the sky. There was a BRIGHT white light on the left of the triangle, in the middle there was a small BRIGHT white light which blinked only white in sequence and on the right there was a HUGE flashing BRITE white light. And then as it passed over I ran to the front of the House to watch it out the big bay w! indow an d I saw it fly off into the distance through the darkened clouds and it was gone. Then I recorded my description in audio on my cell phone, and then I went outside into the backyard again replaying what I had just seen. Then I hear and see a small plane off in the distance about the same height this triangle was and I was thankful, because I could hear it, I saw the red light blinking light on it and I could analytically without question differentiate the attributes of both the triangle craft and the plane. There was no red blinking light on the triangle craft and as I stated before NO noise. I am still in a shock status here and I am hoping that someone else here in this area saw this thing and can confirm it.Shalom", "Metallic green right triangle in the middle of nowhere.My report took place roughly 5 months ago. It took place at Salem County, New Jersey. It took place at my house. My home is on a dead-end street and surrounded by woods. It was about 9 or 10 o&rsquo;clock at night. I took my dog out to go to the bathroom. Roughly after a minute when I was outside I looked into the sky which I noticed an object flying really low.  The object was a greenish metallic, right triangle. It was roughly 50-75 feet above my head and made no noise. It flew over my head and into the woods away from me at a very slow speed. The object had white and yellow lights that formed at each point. Also I noticed the object had a very intricate design under it as it flew by.

At first it looked ligth a shooting star but to the naked eye it looked like an egg shaped object. I used the buinoculars to look at where the light went off and I saw it hiding behind the trees. Then it disappeared. When I went to look into the night sky again I noticed that the place I was looking at was full of the object there must have been lie 30 of them!!! They started to blink and I ran inside still watching. They suddenly dissapeared 30 seconds after. This sighting is not a hoax and it is real!!!! I feel that this wass very freaky. If anyone else saw it I know they would feel this way too.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

It had two silver cyclinder shape object side by side with what looked like some kind of bar in the middle connecting them together.  It was heading toward the Ohio River. There was no sound. It had no wings. There was a small plane following behind it. We watched it until it went out of our sight. There were no lights on the cylinder shape thing and it and the plane were not going very fast and they were low in the sky. We can&apos;t be sure of what it was but it was something we had never seen before. The weather was really nice outside and people were in the pool swimming. I wouldn&apos;t mind talking to someone but since I have only a cell phone I can&apos;t except collect calls on it so if someone would like to talk to me I&apos;ll be glad to talk with them.", "A strange orange light big enough to be enough to be plane moved across the sky but soon stopped and soon  phased outMy dad had us come out to look at this.  We had called your hotline as well to report this. There was a bright dark orange/red light that was moving across the sky south to north.  We were observing it from the west looking towards the east.  It apeared to be a plane or a helicopter so it was about 4 times brighter than a star, However there was no noise while it moved across the sky about 45 degrees (favoring the north) than it stopped and than started and stopped a few times.  After about a minute it started to get smaller as if it was moving further away from us. During this the light elongated into a line instead of a sphere which seemed to have a whitish bluish light with the orange. Than it completly vanished. It seemed to close to be a satalite, or space station.", "Enormous V-shaped formation consisting of inter-connecting puffy objects traveling very fast.Sky was black with a few wispy clouds scattered about, moon low in the east, stars were out.  FROM NOWHERE, there appeared in the sky what looked like a gaggle of geese formed in a V, traveling west to east VERY fast, no engine sounds, no bird sounds.   Hard to describe - like individual puffs of smoke semi-connected to one another.   It&apos;s length took up 1/3 the span of the sky, it&apos;s width between the two points of the V was enormous.  If this were actually a gaggle of geese there would easily have been 75 to 100 of them. As this formation flew across the sky it seemed to lose its length at the widest points of the V and then it DISAPPEARED.  I&apos;d love to know if anyone else spotted this phenomenon.", "Three bright lights in formation hovered, then moved slowly northweast and disappeared through the trees.I watch the sky frequently and understand flight patterns from SeaTac, so I know when something&apos;s askew. Tonight I watched three very bright white lights in formation hover above Lake Washington and travel very slowly northeast, which was not the prevailing flight pattern I had been watching today.  While I watched with binoculars, there was a red light in the middle that flashed intermittently, and I never saw any green light, even though the craft was relatively close, not more than 10 miles away. I kept waiting for the white lights to break apart, as I&apos;ve seen in videos and while they never did, the snail-pace speed and the behavior of this UFO was unlike the airplanes I have been watching and filming.I also realized that I had not been able to get a good look at any of the planes tonight due to the cloud cover, while this craft was seen clearly.", "I saw a black triangle shaped object about 300 ft in length with a dim red light at each point traveling slowly past over me.I saw a black triangle shaped object with 1 dim red flashing light at each point of the triangle. the size was 100 yards to 150 yards in lentgh hovering above me about 250-350 yards above me.the object was completely silent and was traveling south very slowly when it passed over me it turned slightly to travel southeast and continued on that path until it was no longer in my sight. I got a very good look of what the object look like from under it it was all solid black with uneven surface almost half dome shaped around were the lights were.", "bright light drops and disappearsMy boyfriend and I were driving home and saw a bright beam of light flash in the sky (it was larger than a star), drop straight down, then disappear.  It did not go all the way down to the horizon, it just disappeared mid-air.  We both yelled, &quot;did you see that?!&quot;   It definitely did not look like a meteor or shooting star.", "I was visiting my brother last night.  He lives in a mobile home in the middle of a pasture.  There is a logging road that leads down to a large pond.  There are trees on each side of the road. My brother and his best friend went outside to smoke leaving me and my sister-in-law inside with the children.  They were outside for about five minutes when the called us out to come look at a bright star.  I went outside and down the logging road I saw what looked like a large star that was very low.  It sat just over the tree line in the horizon.  I remembered thinking that it was tear drop shaped.  Looked like a tear drop diamond.  We were talking about what it could possibly be.  We had never seen a star so large and one of us said that even the North Star wouldn&apos;t be so low.  Maybe it was a planet?  We are all strong christians and have never believed in any alien myths or stories so we were talking about any logical explanations.  After looking at it for a minute i began to notice red streaks coming out of the bottom.  I kept thinking that my eyes were playing tricks on me from focusing too much so I turned away and looked back only to see red and blue colors coming from this bright light.  My brother then asked if it was moving or if his eyes were playing tricks on him.  I looked back at it and the light was moving right to left very quickly.  It never moved far enough to disappear behind the trees. At this point we were all a little scared.  This was obviously no star nor planet.  My brother got out his video camera and began filming.  The movements became more noticeable.  Diagnol, side to side and up and down.  My brother and his friend decided to try to get closer.  They began walking down the lane and were not ten feet closer when the light started to BACK AWAY.  The light was moving backwards.  Me and my sister-in-law were screaming that it was leaving and of course the guys froze in fear and we literally watched this ball of light back away until it was out of sight.  As a skeptic If we had watched that light for a while and it never left I would have been convinced it was just a planet or something and that our eyes were playing tricks on us with the lights and movements.  But when I saw that thing back away from us I knew that it was nothing of this earth. I don&apos;t know what we saw last night but I do know it was either an angel of god or a being from somewhere else.  After it left of course we are all looking in the sky in terror and amazement at what we saw and I began to notice planes EVERYWHERE.  It was dark of course and it was a very clear night.  But I counted eight planes.  When I commented on this to everyone else they brushed it off as it being a clear night and there&apos;s always that many planes, I just never noticed it.  But I did count 9 planes and they were headed in the same direction as the light.", "There were three different objects, in three different directions. Jets seem to be closing in on two of them.Actually I have 3 sightings. One, was in the western sky, very far away, about 9:00 high.  It was rectangular in shape, and was a faint red.  It was moving very slowly across the sky in a southerly direction.  After noticeing that one, I turned around, heading back to the house, when I noticed a very bright red light, flashing, in the eastern sky about 10:00 high, much closer than the one to the west.  I also noticed a couple of planes fliing northbound in front of it.  As I kept watching it, I noticed a couple of Air Force jets to the south of the object.  They seem to have been heading for the light.  I ran in to get my camera, and when I came back out, the light had became very dim red.  The planes were still in the area of the object.  I turned on the video recorder on my camera, and all I could see was a red ball- like object, moving around on the screen.  I will send you a copy of what I recorded. As I turned to come in the house, I noticed another bright light to the south, coming in my direction, slowly.  I kept watching for a few seconds to see what it was, when I noticed another jet approaching that object also.  Then, all the sudden, the object vanished. I am not crazy!!  This happens around here all the time.  My fiance and I have several other witnesses to events we seen occur this past summer.", "While driving my daughter and I saw a batwing shaped large hovering object flying over Marysville, Washington.It was 10 pm and I was driving with my oldest daughter to my mother&rsquo;s house in Marysville to pick up my youngest daughter, and all of a sudden we saw a flat surfaced object that was moving north to south.The object was large almost the same length as the moon, all black with a red light in the middle and evenly balanced wings with really bright white lights on each side. It looked like a bat wing.The night was clear with the Milky Way, little dipper, and big dipper in close proximity to each other. The object was diagonally south to the stars.   It hovered closely to the earth, a lot lower than a plane would fly. It looked like it had smoke or a haze following it. It moved up and down and within about 2 minutes it disappeared. I tried to follow it with my car because I couldn&rsquo;t believe my eyes, I and wanted to make sure of what I was seeing. My daughter kept saying &ldquo;mom, mom, do you see what I see? That&rsquo;s huge!&rdquo; We had never seen anything like it.", "Red and white lights curving around a large hovering black mass, which speed off very fast.As my mom was driving us home south on Powerline rd, off to our right over Olivehurst she spotted something that was different. After turning a corner she got a better view of the object and pointed it out to my brother and I. It was just sitting still hovering over houses. We wanted to get a better look at it so we started towards it. It then began to fly off to the right very fast, so fast that we could not catch up to it. We lost it. It was very large, we could not see the exact shape, but we could see the out line of a large black mass. It had bright red lights lit up in a line curving around the left side. My mom had a better angle than me and she saw white lights lining the lower part of it. We live near both an airport and a very active air force base, but it looked like nothing we had ever seen before.", "dark, slow, still, red lights, on Shadeland Ave. where my aunt had seen UFO 3 years agoI was driving and I a looked up in the sky and I saw something shoot up like a shooting star.so I continued driving and I was at the light and I saw a disk like shape hovering in the sky.

It was a clear night, and unseasonably warm for December.  In the sky north of Benton I saw a orb of light descend quickly towards the ground.  It moved at a speed which is unlike I have ever seen any typical aircraft.  The light was a solid bright yellow, and had to be within a mile from where I was standing.  The craft moved rapidly down, and abruptly stopped still above a tree line.  It wasn&apos;t too far from the ground when it stopped, probabley 50&apos; above the trees.  The aircraft then flashed slightly brighter, and disappeared.  No noise.  No trail.  It vanished.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

We were in the backyard for a few minutes when I saw a bright light that seemed stationary in the Northeast sky.  I pointed the light out to my wife and than noticed it was slightly moving from north to south.  We live 40 miles outside Washington DC, near Dulles airport, so we do see a lot of airplane traffic. I started to think we must be looking at a slow moving airplane.  As the light got closer I noticed there wasn&apos;t any blinking lights and this light was not acting like a conventional aircraft.  The light would slowly move than stop and stay stationary for several minutes than would start moving again.  While we watched the light I told my wife to stay and watch so I can go inside to grab the camera.  I ran into the house, grabbed the camera and opened the back sliding glass door. Just as I started filming the light was just making it over my house, I told my wife to meet me in the front yard. As I ran to the front yard and met my wife I again started filming the light, at this point it was slowly flying above Orion, which was just rising in the east. This is when the unbelievable happened. Just as the light was above Orions belt my wife said &quot;Look it&apos;s turning around&quot; I couldn&apos;t believe my eyes. The light was making a complete U-Turn. But even more spectacular, as the light made the U-Turn, another light continued moving south and stayed on the original path. What I&apos;m trying to say is-the light we were originally watching turned into two separate lights. One made a complete 180 degree turn headed back north and was blue in color, the other light continued south. It seemed to me that these two lights were somehow together or connected and than separated. The light that U-Turned off the original light soon stopped and remained stationary for approximately five minutes as the other light continued south. Soon after the original light was out of sight the U-Turned light started moving ag! ain towa rds the north until it was out of sight.During this sighting my neighbor was also walking his dog, he saw my wife and I and was also able to see the two lights after they separated. This was our sighting. I really hope someone else saw what we did. Thanks", "UFO Flying Wing - Shape shiftingThis event happened in the bright , cloudless afternoon sky of Michigan- metro Detroit.  I was fueling my car with everyone else under the gas staition canopy roof.  I was standing at the edge of the canopy and with the fuel running I jumped over quick to look at the paper headline in the box then went back to tend the fueling and on the way back something caught my eye high up in the sky.  I had to look again to see if it was moving at all.  It was. It was drifting slowly in my direction and now it looked closer to the Earth  Then when I first noticed it about 20 seconds ago.  It looked fairly small. 2-5 feet across.  About 200-300 feet up.  The object made no sounds.  It was drifting in the wind direction basically but not completely.  It was if the wind was not affecting it.  It moved much slower than the winds which were fairly heavy this day.  The sky was cloudless as the wind had blown everything away.The object looked at first like a flying wing.  But it had more than one wing.  It had wings which changed shape, position and in number about once or twice a second not in a mechanical way but almost in a random way.  The wings also were colored in sections and these sections continually changed like a prism changes in the sunlight.  They would also stay one color in the wing and then a new wing shape and direction sprouted and a new color came up.  Sometimes there would be two or more stripes of color in the same wing until the new shape came in.  When this object was the closest to me I could see a streaky gray plasma type cloud hanging from it like a tail.  The bottom of it came to a point and there was movement in it like a swirling effect from bottom to top.  As it passed overhead the plasma tail became invisible to me.The object left my view as it passed over the rain canopy I was fueling my car under.  This event up till now has taken about 60 seconds.I had paid with a credit card so I didn&apos;t have to go in and pay.  I pulled the car around and out from under the canopy and stuck my head out the window to see it again and it was still up there drifting away and now looked slightly higher again.  The plasma tail was visible again.  It was still heading slowly in the same direction but still seemed to wander slightly unaffected by the wind speed.  I watched it for another 20-30 seconds before it left my sight.", "A craft that was bright and looked like it was on fire was 300 yards away and came closer and I put a light on it, and it came closer.It happend a little after five AM. I was setting up for a duck hunt in Back Bay on December 8th 2008.  I was early and began putting out decoys and it was very very dark out.  I was faceing the opan water and out of nowhere a huge bright light the size of a small air plane came around a point off a cove it was the color of fire and extreamly bright and extrmaly fast.  It was no more than 300 yards away from me and it was moveing closer to me. I had no lights on during this time.  As it came closer I became very scared and picked up my 2,000,000 power spotlight and pointed it at it.  As soon as i turned it on the light that was like fire went out.  Five minuites later, a dark shadowy figure which was silent, came within 50 yards of me i was so scared.  It was like it it knew it was spoted and then came to see what had made that light. and seconds latter it was gone, so i thought. I emmedittly called home to tell them what I had seen i was on the phone for about 15 minutes and while I was talking I saw the it agin and it was about .5 mile away and it was on or right above the water and in seconds it was in the sky and as high as the stars, The whole incounter from beging to end was about 35-40 min.  Oddly before this while I paddled my duck boat out to the duck blind there was a small metor shower or some like that and then a few right after the event.  The fire like light was huge, bright, very fast, quite, and amazing.

As I walked into my backyard I was looking at the long contrails extending north to south across the deep blue sky.I soon noticed a lower flying aircraft flying from the northeast to the southwest. As I watched the aircraft I soon noticed a small white object following close behind it. Stunned at first, I starred at the object trying to figure out what this object could be. After a few seconds of observation I noticed the object was white in color and disk or orb like in appearance.While I watched the white disk it started swinging back and forth behind the airplane in a left to right type fashion. I wondered at first if I was seeing a big white bird, I quickly realized this was definitely not the case. As I watched the object swing left to right it all a sudden dove or dropped straight down and flew underneath the airplane for a few seconds, it then swung just under the plane to the left side and amazingly completely circled the airplane and then again trailed behind it.I was absolutely amazed at what I was seeing, it was at this point I thought to myself, do I have time to run inside and grab my camera. I hesitated at first thinking the object would be gone by the time I got back. Than I thought, I have to try because know one will believe me if I don&apos;t get a picture-so off I went running. I grabbed the camera, ran back outside and was just able to take a short video as the object disappeared over Haymarket toward the Bull Run mountains.I have tried to consider other explanations for this object but have been mostly unable to do so. The only possibility could be a in flight refuel for the air combats that are deployed to protect Washington DC airspace. I don&apos;t think this is much of a possibility since the aircraft the object was following was not military but a passenger plane. The white disk I saw was also not a conventional military aircraft. There wasn&apos;t any wings visible on the craft and the craft was more disk/orb like in appearance.I wanted to report this sighting to you in hopes that someone else in my area may have also seen this remarkable ariel display.I Thank You.", "I saw this green light fly into visibility in the sky and hover in a position for a couple of seconds.  At first I thought it may have been some sort of firework that was being shot off, but rather than explode or do something of that sort, the object then seemed to quickly fly away and disappear.  I do not seem to recall the actual shape of the object, but it appeared to be round from what I remember.  I also believe that there were a couple of other aircrafts in the area as well.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I watched an object move from the SSW sky to NNE.  It was clear night with no clouds. It took approximately 5 to 6 seconds to entirely cross the sky.  It was silent.  It was shaped like a short grain of rice.  It was the color of light pink beach glass softly glowing from within, and with a slight aura of white around it.  If I held my hand at arm&rsquo;s length with a short grain of rice, this is about how large it appeared.I called for my husband to come, but it had already disappeared behind the trees.  3 to 4 minutes after observing the object, a commercial airliner crossed the sky from SW to NW on an approach path to Seatac Airport.  I am reporting this with the hopes that perhaps the commercial airliner saw something, or traffic control at Seatac.My husband is a fixed wing and helicopter Pilot.  I grew up around Seatac airport and McChord Air Force base.  I am very familiar with the appearance and flight patterns of conventional aircraft.  I also grew up watching for satellites and am familiar with satellite flight paths across the sky. This pink, slightly oblong object was very unique; like glowing pink glass.It needs be said that in my life I have seen alleged UFOs.  As a 10-year old (1966) my entire family (7 of us) watched an object above the desert in Utah.  It was composed of two large metallic objects with 7 small metallic objects in between the two larger ones.  We all watched it for over 20 minutes.While camping at Mt. Rainier in 1984 I and my children (7 and 4 at the time) watched as a blinking object flew a path ascending toward the mountain before suddenly streaking out of sight.Here in Shelton, I have experienced several occasions of a very bright flash in the night sky.  Sometimes it is one bright flash.  Sometimes it is a series of erratically timed bright flashes.  The flashes are always in one stationary spot in the sky and are not accompanied by any visual trajectory common to a helicopter or aircraft turning or flying; just very bright white flashes, and then nothing.This last Sunday, December 7th, 2008 at 16:43 I observed a very bright white light sitting stationary in the SSW sky above the tree line.  At first I thought it was the first star of the night, however, no other stars were visible and this light was brighter than any star or planet I am accustomed to observing.  I am also aware of metal objects commonly reflecting sunlight at that time of the day in the SW and W sky.  This bright light sat stationary for 10 minutes.  I had my husband get his detachable rifle scope with a high power telephoto capacity.  I propped it on the back of a chair and we watched the bright light.  It never changed position.  It suddenly just disappeared as I was viewing it.I hesitated in turning in my reports because I understand that in order to substantiate anything or lend credibility, it is best triangulated or viewed by more than one person at one place in time.  I was also concerned I&rsquo;d come across like a quack because I have seen objects before.  I support all research and work being done in the field of extraterrestrial existence, however, and believe it is important to move forward and turn in a report when it happens with the hopes maybe someone else saw the same thing.I turned in the flashing light reports to MUFON, but the local investigator for MUFON in Olympia has a very jealous wife who felt uncomfortable with him talking to women (even though I am happily married and have no interest in playing around).  He began taking report my report from me but abruptly stopped telling me his wife was jealous of me.  !!??

We went back outside and noticed a strange red/orange light drifting in the sky in an upward motion traveling east to southwest.  The object looked like it was on fire, and my first thought was maybe someone had their fireplace going and it was flaming debris, but the motion of the object was floating upward and there was no wind to carry anything.  That and given the distance of the object to us (at arm&apos;s length it was about 1/4&quot; diameter), the object was too large to be debris.  I ruled out a flare as it wasn&rsquo;t falling.  It almost looked like it was something suspended from a balloon, but it was traveling to fast and it was traveling too fast to be a balloon.  If it was a balloon, then it would have been visible or at least a reflection of the light would have been on the balloon.I rushed to my car to grab my digital camera and my sister took hers out of her purse.  I snapped a picture, but it was too dark so I deleted it.  I then decided to change the settings on my camera in hope of maybe getting better luck.  As soon as I looked back up, the object was gone.

She pointed to the cloud and followed it heading North.  The full moon was out, the cloud ceiling was low and it was windy.  The scattered clouds were moving very fast. It was easy to see the sky, stars, moon, and clouds. At that point, at approximately 11:40 PM, Maria and I both saw a large black round disk-shaped object that appeared to be on it side (top or bottom facing us).  The size was larger than a dessert plate held at arm&apos;s length. It was moving slowly from Southeast to Northwest along the bottom of the cloud ceiling, and moving slower than the clouds, which were clipping along at a fast pace. It was very windy.  The full moon shone brightly and I assume that is the only reason we could see the object.  There were no visible lights on the object. Maria, age 32, saw this at the same time I did, but Rachel did not, even though she was looking in the same area.  After a few seconds, the object changed to a gray color, then just vanished.   I then said outloud  &quot;We want to see evidence of any persons not of this world&quot; and all of us looked in the same direction where the black object had been and I was pointing.  Right after I said this a shooting star appeared in that same spot.  Then we saw lots of shooting stars all around the sky (probably a meteor shower).  Rachel left for home.Maria got in her Suburban to leave, but I noticed a bunch of tiny twinkling lights above the center of the hood of her vehicle appear for 2 seconds, then they disappeared.  I was looking at this area trying to figure out what the lights were when I noticed a reflection of a rectangular light that came on then blinked off on her hood.  Maria got out of the car and the light appeared again.  I soon figured out that it was blinking on and off every 25 seconds, so we knew it had to be something mechanical.  Being square was odd, though.  So she turned off her car and I turned off all the lights in and outside the house in order to see if we could identify the source of the light.  It continued to blink on and off, being an amber color, white, or blue at different times.  There were two spots close together where the lights appeared.  We could not locate the source. We tried blocking the lights out with our hands, and checked the trees moving in the wind that might be blocking or unblocking lights.  The one light continued to blink off and on at regular intervals of 25 seconds. The only reflection of light on the hood that we could identify was the moon, which was in a different location from the blinking lights.  Then I realized something and said &quot;OMG&quot; - and Maria finished my sentence with &quot;It&apos;s something we can&apos;t see and it&apos;s above us.&quot;  I ran inside and grabbed my video camera which I had charged up the night before and it went dead after 3 seconds.  Maria got her Sony digital camera out of the car and video-taped and took photos of the car and in the sky above us. Note: The photos came out very dark and smudgy. I got the night vision monocular out but could see nothing.  I then saw a tiny orb appear inside Maria&apos;s vehicle, then disappear.  I fully expected to see a ship hoovering right above us!  We could feel the presence of something. Then, 45 minutes after starting, the lights stopped at approximately 12:35 AM.  Since this date, strange things have been happening around my house and my psychic abiliti! es have improved, almost to the point of being annoying.  I see a golden glow around all living things, and this is rather distracting.  Also see details in energy fields around humans.

(LOCAL)  A young woman was driving at 40-45 mph along Lake Cook Road, when her car suddenly lurched to the right for no reason that was apparent to her.  There were no cars within sight on the road, and she had not seen any pedestrian or animal near the car.  She stopped her car immediately, got out, and apparently was flabbergasted by the appearance of the left side of her automobile.The investigating police officer could not provide an adequate explanation for the damage.  He noted that there was no damaged paint, and no animal hair, feathers, or blood, evident on the damaged area of the car.   NUFORC has passed the case along to Mr. Sam Maranto, Illinois State Director for the Mutual UFO Network (&ldquo;MUFON&rdquo;), for follow-up investigation.We have no reason to believe that the incident was UFO-related, but we have no explanation for how the extensive damage to the car could have occurred.

While I was in the middle lane, I felt a nudge on the left of my car which made my car shift to the right.  I did not swerve out of the lane and gained control back quickly.I slowed down and as I got my bearings, I realized that my left side mirror was knocked off and so I turned right onto Revere Drive and put on my hazard lights.I got out of the car and saw that I had several dents on the side of my car.  There were two that were deeper and larger than the others; one was located in front of the rear wheel and the other was in the center of the driver door.I called 911 to file a police report and the officer said that I was side swiped by another car but, there were not any cars around me before or after the hit and also there were no paint scratches from other cars on my car.Images Copyright 2008 - Click for larger images  I know exactly what happened to her car.....I have seen 3 hovering craft...one of which took off...and became inviaible over my head.

Their altitude was just above the tree tops and they were flying in perfect formation staying the same distance from each other through the whole sighting.  The sky was clear (no clouds) and there was little to no wind blowing.At first we thought that it could be that they were coming from a Roman candle since there were some fireworks being set off at the time (it being just after midnight at the New Year), but these objects were flying too perfectly and stayed at the same altitude the whole time.The light from these objects stayed at the same intensity throughout until they finally faded away at the horizon, and there was no sound.Just as the first two objects disappeared another two appeared from the southeast (the same direction as the first two).  These two orbs were identical in size and shape to the first two.  They were flying a little farther apart from each other than the first two (it seemed about twice as far), and the first one of this second two objects to appear was flying at a little higher altitude than the following object.  Again these two orbs flew at the same speed as the first two and stayed at the same distance from each other and at the same altitude throughout the sighting.  Also the intensity of the light from these objects was the same as the first two and similarly did not vary until they just faded away as they reached the horizon.The entire time of the sighting from the beginning two objects to the time the last two disappeared lasted a little more than five minutes.We were so much in awe and did not want to miss anything, so unfortunately we did not get any video of this.

I called the police and they told me to report it to the airport, and they put me through to the controll tower who told me there were no aircraft in in about 2hrs and none coming in for about another 2hrs,  not a very big place.

PD))", "Translucent arch over road, small cloud that changed colors and sparkled.This sighting happened in the summer of 1974 a few miles south of Minot ND.  I went outside to smoke a cigarette.  It was a very clear night and I walked down the driveway from the house  so I could get a full view of the night sky.When I came to the end of the driveway I noticed a white translucent arch over the dirt road  that ran in front of the house north and south.  I was puzzled by this and wondered if it was some kind of fog.  I walked  about 30 feet down the road to get a better look.  I could see that the arch went from one side of the road to the other side right down to the ditch.  I walked under it and looked up and could faintly see the stars through the arch while looking strait up into the sky.  I then would walk about three feet from under it and the stars where all bright and all the sky clear.  It reminded me of the milky way.  I moved under it then  next to it a couple more times  then excited I ran to the house to get someone else to come see this.It was about 10 pm as my parents where watching the news so I went to my brothers room who is 15 years old.  He thought I was crazy but I persuaded him to come out and look about 10 minutes later as he was in bed  watching TV and had to dress.  When we got to the area where I had seen the arch it was gone.  Down the road north about 60 Ft., we both witnessed a cloud above the road about 20 feet in diameter.  We started to follow it as it was moving away from us.  It was no longer a translucent white. It would turn red to blue, green and had like sparkling little lights shimmering in it.We both started to follow it till the road ended 200 ft. then it veered to the NW and we crossed over the barbwire fence climbing over a couple hills to follow it.  We stayed down when we came to the top of a hill as it almost seamed to be trying to lose us.  It stopped over the top of a large watering hole about 30 feet..  We could not follow it anymore but as we watched it for about one minute it was still changing colors and sparkling.  It then started to fade quickly.  We walked home amazed as we lived in the country, hunt, hike at night to a neighbors.  We never seen anything like it.  To this day we recalled this sighting and both seen this.  We had seen the same thing other than him not seeing the arch.I was not a drug user or drinker.  I am now 48 years old and still can picture this dense cloud type object that changed colors along with the arch over the road. We have never seen anything like this again, nor have met anyone else that seen anything like this before.  We figured it could have been something from the Minot Air Base.  We have seen fog over water and such.  The arch did not loose its shape fade.  I was thinking of walking down into the ditch to one side of the arch touching to the ground to see if I could walk through it or put my hand in it.  I decided that may be dangerous so ran back to get a witness.I would like to be contacted about sightings in the Fargo area.  When I googled to see if anyone else seen thease sightings your sight popped up with reports on the same date and same thing that still hangs around at times.  I would like to know how to report the observation properly or hear a explanation.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date is approximate.  We have assigned an arbitrary date.  PD))", "oval-like shape with little lights spinning around its perimeterI was driving home with my children when I noticed something strange in the sky--I only say strange because it seemed to be tilting in place, almost like a kite. It looked like a staight line of lights line at first, so I thought it was a plane but when it tilted I could see that it was an oval or disk- like shape.  It moved back and forth and up and down, so I decided to investigate by driving in its direction.  It was near Tinseltown movie theatre in Plano, actually about 200  meters above it...about 7 people were looking at it...one was an old man, there were also some young men wearing tuxedos (employees of the theatre?), and a couple of others...I thought, maybe someone is hiding somewhere and flying this thing just to see people sreactins but it moved so gracefully that it seemed real??? Has anyone else reported it--it just happenedwithin the last hour or so! I can&apos;t remember what happened next, but as I was driving home to let my husband know, I spotted it again, this time in Carrollton, near my home.   It was far away, but it seemed to be lowering...I don&apos;t know if this was some kind of toy, but ity looked real, and too large to be a toy...about the size of two cars.", "Twice I saw a light zoom from my tree, once to a series of branches, the ground, and it disappeared both times.It was about 12:30 A.M. and I was listening to music on my MP3 and looking out the window.  I was sitting near the window (about one foot away) and facing the window.  All of the sudden I saw a rectangular shaped light fly from directly above my head from the roof to a tree in my backyard.  The light was about six inches wide and nearly one foot long.  The roof was about twelve to fifteen feet tall.  The light moved in a straight line from the roof to the tree (about thirty feet).  It moved about sixty feet in about one second.  I looked up in the tree to see if anything was there.  I did not have a clue what it was.  At first I thought it might have been a white owl or bird although there are not many in my part of the town.  This is because I live in a suburban area.  I did not see the light up in the tree after that.  About fifteen minutes later I saw the same exact light from the same spot zoom into the tree.  Then, unlike the first time I saw the light, this time the light went from one branch over to the next parallel to the ground.  A few seconds after that it went from that branch to a lower branch about two feet beneath it.  From there the light seemed to squiggle down to the ground.  When it hit the ground it immediately bounded twice away from my house and towards the road behind my house.  Each bound was about forty-five feet in length.  Once the light had bounded away from my house it seemed to disappear after it hit the ground on the second time.  It landed in a part of our garden where we had rocks as our landscaping.  I never saw the light resting there and I never saw it move from that spot again.  At this point I was pretty sure that it was not any type of animal that I have ever heard of.", "We were leaving a place when we saw a bright light in the sky, it looked as if it could be seen miles away. We sat and stared at it and it never moved. We got into the car and drove in it&apos;s direction, and it vanished", "These were not man made objects!!!I was facing north. and the objects were headed south east.They were positioned in a triangular formation.They were circular in shape and had a deep orange and red color to them.I only got about ten seconds of visibility until cloud cover came.With my arm extended above my head the objects were about the size of my pinky tip.I can only guess they were between 10 and 20 thousand feet high.", "roundish, wavyish bright light with a flashing reddish edge that kept changing, pulsating.Thanksgiving night around 8-9 pm I looked out the window and saw what looked like a roundish, wavyish bright light with a flashing edge that kept changing, pulsating. It looked reddish at the edges. I didn&apos;t see it appear, it was already there when I looked out the window. I called my husband to come look. We both watched it for about 5 minutes. It stayed in the same place then gradually got smaller and disappeared. I am a teacher and my husband a retired firefighter.", "At 11:12 I pulled into my driveway and was exiting my vehicle when me and my girlfriend noticed a dim rust colored light flying above my house. It was a brownish color and had a few smaller ones. It made a strange wavy sound, like it was floating. The UFO was not moving to fast but was clearly not of earth origin. It proceeded across the sky until out of sight. Also worth mentioning, there were jets flying around where the object had been scene the next day.", "Bright orange ball of fire hovers then snapped back up into the atmosphere at a high rate of speedOn Tuesday November 18, 2008 I decided to go back to my mothers&rsquo; home, the home I grew up in, after I left work at 8:00pm. She resides in Upper St. Clair, PA, a quiet suburb south of Pittsburgh.  I arrived at her home about twenty after eight in the evening. There was a very light snow on the ground. I went to the house, let myself in and found her in the kitchen. After making some coffee and sitting in the kitchen talking for about a half an hour, she went upstairs to change from her work clothes into her pajamas. I went to use the upstairs bathroom. The bathroom faces the front of the house and the road. She lives on a very quiet road with very little traffic, but numerous homes. Behind the house is a very dense wooded area that prohibits any light from coming up the hill from the road below. The road behind the house is about a &frac14; mile from our home.I was using the bathroom sitting on the toilet when I heard her go down the stairs. As I was finishing up, I glanced through the venetian blinds as I have a millions times in the past when I was younger. What I saw has occupied all of my time awake and while asleep for the last 24 hours. The shadow of her home was cast on the snow, a perfect silhouette. No car lights would have been able to accomplish this because of how steep the hill and how dense the woods are behind the house, even with sparse leaves on the branches. I yanked up my pants up, zipper down and shirt untucked and bolted down the stairs. My mother was frozen like a statue staring out the back window.What we saw at that point we will remember for the rest of our lives. In the sky only about 10 yards above the tree line, there hovered a perfectly quiet but blazing ball of orange light. I would estimate it to be about 15-20 yards in width. Not oval or cylindrical, but perfectly round. It was very strong and not pulsating or shifting. It was not blinding us at all.  I looked back at the front window, this time from the family room and still saw the house silhouetted on the snow. I continued to stare out the back door that leads that leads to the raised porch as I opened the door. No sound, no heat, no vibration just this spectacular ball of light as I stood on the porch. I ran back in to get a camera down in the game room on the basement level. As I ran to the back door under the porch, the ball became smaller and smaller as it seemed to be yanked back into the sky at an extremely rapid pace. I never got a shot off. I didn&rsquo;t have time to turn the camera on unfortunately.Today, she asked the next door neighbors, who are an older couple, they saw nothing. Nor did a woman she knows through church who lives on the hillside about 1 mile away from our home, directly behind the house. I believe what we witnessed was not of this world. This was certainly not a noisy helicopter or some child playing a prank. This was a real, tangible, perfectly silent ball of orange fire well above the tree line. If anyone in this area had a similar encounter from the evening of 11/18/08 I would be highly interested in hearing your account of that evening. Can anyone help us understand this?", "Bright red/orange disc seen moving silently over Atlantic Ocean from East to West on dark summer night.At approximately 11:15 PM my wife was looking South from our vacation cottage in Montauk, out over the ocean, and observed a large orb, about the size of a full harvest moon, colored bright red/orange, moving slowly and steadily from East to West, in complete silence, on a straight unwavering trajectory.  She called me over and I observed it, too.  She describes it as looking &quot;firey&quot; although I thought it looked more like a bright disc.  There did not appear to be any other structure.  We watched it for about five minutes as it passed out of view.  At about 10 minutes later we observed either the same object, or an identical one, pass again from East to West and out of view.  We called the East Hampton Police Dept. and the U.S. Coast Guard; neither had any similar report.  The next morning we spoke to the motel manager; she said she had seen a similar object at about 8:00 PM that evening, and thought it was a hot-air balloon.  I do not believe that is what it was, as you would have seen bursts of flame, and heard something, and why would a hot-air balloon be floating over the Atlantic Ocean at 11:00 PM?", "Spearmint colored object flys extremely fast in the sky then dissappears completely leaving only green trailAt approximately 9:30pm ET while driving home from shopping on RT1 in Revere MA, a friend an I both saw what seemed to be a spearmint green ball of very vivid bright light appear in front of us in the sky then in the only way  I can explain it get brighter then moved quickly leaving a light green trail behind it.  The instance was only for a matter of seconds but very visible and clear.  The two of us exclaimed &quot;what was that&quot;! I can only compare it to a green shooting star yet in the atmosphere and much larger. I came home and began to look up what the occurrance could have been with no luck.  Nothing fit the color and the way it appeared then sped irregularly fast then was gone.", "Bright circular light travelling at high speed in LincolnshireWhilst driving home from work with my two teenage children in the car I was witness to a bright white circular light in the sky travelling at high speed in the Boston direction.  There was quite a lot of cloud cover which ruled out the possibility of a shooting star and this area has a high concentration of military aircraft and I knew that it could not possibly be a plane as there was no noise and at that hight it would have been very loud if it had been an aircraft. The object was travelling at a very high speed and appeared to skim the cloud cover.", "bright object  emitting colored lights moving slowly up and south from 35 to 60 degress elevation eastObject was observed in the eastern sky at approximately 35 degree and rose to about 60 degrees over a 2 hour period.  It was emitting bright colored lights in a erratic manner.  The colored lights were very visible at 10 pm, but needed binoculars and a scope at midnight.  The lights were blue, red, white and orange and scintillated rapidly mostly in a counterclockwise direction.  Called UFO center yesterday ( 12-1-08) but was limited to 15 seconds to describe sighting.  Representative said the object was the Dog Star Sirius, but that doesn&apos;t seem possible.((NUFORC Note:  Possibly a sighting of the star, Sirius?  PD))", "It was odd.My wife pick me up from down the street from where we live.When I saw 3 orange lights in the sky in a triangle shape floating.It was very dark and there was low clouds,but the way it moved was not like anything I&apos;ve ever seen before.When I first saw it it was hovering over a building about 100ft off the ground,then with no sound it started floating eastward and then vanished.I never saw the body of the ship,all I saw was the lights.It seemed like it was shrouded in clouds that moved with the craft.  It was very odd", "red lighted triangle with circling white light at top tip came across sky then hovered.I was sitting in my living room when I heard my neighbor scream, followed by her husband and brother and many neighbors across the street and  around the neighbor hood . At that point I ran outside to see what was going on. They were all looking up into the sky and pointing.  I witnessed what appeared to be a triangle hovering out in the distance that did not appear to look like any kind of craft I have ever seen before. Judging from the distance out it had to be really large. It had a white light that was circling around the top corner of the triangular shaped object. The rest of the craft or object was bright red in color and looked to have many lights on it all of which were red except the white one that was circling it. My neighbors said they watched it come across the horizon for about ten to fifteen minutes before it stopped and  hovered where if was.  As we were looking at the object it released a white lighted globe like thing that fell to earth.  We all screamed and kind of waited for an explosion or something to  happen but we could not see anything.   About 2 minutes after that it released another one that went from white to red as it dropped, then  its red lights all went dark from the outmost corners to the center, as it became one small white light and disappeared into the horizon. I grew up in Lancaster Ca. and being near Edwards Air Force base had seen some strange goings on sometimes, but I have never witnessed anything that strange or unexplained in my life. It made the pit of my stomach sink several times watching it.", "Sighting in rural Louisiana, teardroped object rising and falling about 100 yards in the sky.Last night at 9:30 pm I took the dog outside and saw the same light I see hovering over the woods quite often.  After observing the light for less than a minute, it began rapidly ascending and descending about a 100 yards up and down.  I ran into the house to grab my friend who saw the same thing.   We both a heard a noise inside the house that sounded just like my dog when it scratches the door.  The dog was outside with us.  When I opened the door to the house the car alarm went off.  I probably set the alarm off with the keys in my pocket.  There was nothing in the house.  I went back outside a few minutes later with my camera.  The object moved slightly but nothing like earlier.  A few hours later the object was moving  slowly, like a star to the west and 10 degrees higher in the sky.", "Here I go again.I saw two objects tonight in two different locations in Queens at two different times. First object was definitely triangular shaped with three lights heading straight up, from where I do not know. Watched it for about a minute. Looks like the same thing I saw last year in Queens.Second object again in Queens was moving straight up and was a brilliant white which turned to red and disappeared right before my eyes. What is going on out there?", "A color changing point of light in the sky turns out to be a whole lot more.On the night of October 28th, 2008, I arrived home from work around midnight.  I got out of my car and stood in the driveway as I took the last drags of a cigarette, gazing into the clear night sky as I often do.  Looking in a southern direction, I noticed a point of light that seemed to be changing colors.  The light would change from blue to green to red to yellow with no apparent pattern or timing to the change of color.  As the color changes occurred, the point of light seemed to retain a brilliant white color throughout, seemingly intermeshed with the colors mentioned above.  The color of the light struck me as quite peculiar, and I thought to myself jokingly, &ldquo;what if it&rsquo;s a UFO&rdquo;, but because the light was stationary, and because I was skeptical of extra terrestrials, I finished my smoke and dismissed the light as a strange star or planet and headed inside for bed.The following night (10/29/08) I arrived home at the same time and again looked for my strange light to the southern sky.  The light was there but seemed closer than the night before.  It loomed over my neighbor&rsquo;s property along the wood-line, behind his cow pasture, approximately 300 yards from where I stood in my driveway.  Separating the light and myself was (in order from me to the light) my front yard, the road, and the neighbors cow pasture that ends into the wood-line where the light occupied a space above.  The night was relatively clear with the exception of a very small group of clouds that hung just above the strange light.  Once again I brushed off the lights appearance and headed inside.About an hour later I went back out to my driveway to have a smoke around 1 a.m.  I again looked at the light but this time its position had noticeably changed.  I was quite confused by the apparent change of the light&rsquo;s position, but became dumbfounded when I watched it move with my own eyes.  The light shot towards me with incredible speed, but maintained its previous altitude.  I was shocked by the light&rsquo;s ability to accelerate and stop so rapidly.  The light was much closer now.  It hung motionless in the sky above the road separating the neighbor&rsquo;s property and my own, but not for long.  As I watched, the light began to move in a circular motion in the sky followed by a square pattern.  The light traveled the outline of an imaginary square in the sky, accelerating with great speed and stopping on a dime at each corner only to repeat the process until the square outline was complete.  About that time I had seen enough to become thoroughly frightened. My heart raced as did my mind.  I discarded the half smoked cigarette and ran inside making sure to lock the door behind me.I watched the light from my bedroom window, noting its movement by looking at its relation to near by stars.  It glided across the sky moving closer and then farther away and the closer, in no particular pattern and at slower speeds than before.  I watched the light from my bedroom for approximately half an hour until I gathered enough courage to go outside for closer inspection with a pair of binoculars.  Upon looking at the light I realized that it was not a single light but many.  I can only describe it as a gyroscope.  It was a series of three rings, arranged inside each other with the largest on the outside.  Each ring had a series of lights around it, and each ring seemed to have its own distinct color; blue, red, and yellow.  The rings were moving inside each other on multiple axes in no discernable pattern.  I watch this self described gyroscope through the binoculars for about ten minutes until fear got the best of me.  Back inside the house I watched the strange light.  Around 2 a.m. two other lights approached the U.F.O. but passed it taking no notice.  Judging by their speed and flight path, these two additional lights were jets of human making.  I watched the U.F.O. until approximately 3:30 a.m., at which time I closed the blinds, took some night-time sleep aid medicine, and fell asleep fully convinced that the strange light outside my window was a U.F.O.My opinion is changed.  I am no longer a skeptic, but a full believer.  My encounter with the U.F.O., in my small farming community of Palmyra, cannot fully be explained by words alone.  I only wish I had a video camera to capture the spectacle (cell phone cameras don&rsquo;t work very well).  The feelings I felt that night are unexplainable.  In my twenty odd years of existence I can&rsquo;t remember another time in which I felt such fear; fear of the unknown and the feeling of being watched, closely watched, by someone or something I can&rsquo;t explain.  The most interesting sight in the whole experience was the gyroscope-like mechanism that composed the whole point of light.  My best guess is that the gyroscope-like mechanism was an advanced propulsion system, but that&rsquo;s just a guess.  Overall, my encounter with that strange light was an eye opening and frightening experience that has forever changed my opinion of life and the universe.((NUFORC Note:  Venus and Jupiter were quite prominent in the southern sky, at this time.  PD))", "bright green light, hovering object, heat wave haze around object.I was sitting in my bed watching TV and a bright green light hover down.  I got up out of my bed to see what it was.  As i approuched the window a bright green light again shined in my window.  It began to not be as bright.  The object hovered over my yard and had blue, orange, and green lights on the side of it. Within 10 sec. it hovered slowly bck into the sky and quickly hover away.", "Possible Bethel UFO sightingA little after 1am Jan 1, 2009.  A relative cam to our house and said she saw some lights (reddish-orange) hover in place.  Then a minute or two later it moved very fast to our left then dimmed and then reappeared in the location we first saw it.I tried to video record it but all I got was a faint light before it finally disappeared from our view.It was a very cold and clear night in Bethel, Alaska, no clouds you could also see lots of stars.  All the fireworks had ended way before we saw this.  We also told some neighbors that came outside their home to see what we were looking at but they didn&apos;t think nothing of it.  We also had children in the car that were scared when it moved real fast and reappeared in a different location. It looked like reddish-orange light maybe group of three like a triangle.  There was no sounds from it.  It was quite no other fireworks or gunshots at the time. After it disappeared we went back into our house.", "Red-orange light above horizon that rose slowly and zigzagged before disappearing.I was carrying in some groceries and I saw a flickering orange-red light up above the horizon. The sky was perfectly clear with no clouds. At first, I thought maybe it was a planet or something until it started moving. It seemed to rise slowly while zigzagging back and forth. After watching it for a little over a minute it completely disappeared. The object looked to be a mile or two away west-southwest toward Dawson. I live out in the country surrounded by farmland so I have a pretty good view all around me. This is probably the 3rd time in the last two months I&apos;ve seen this same light around my house. Also, I saw several planes out and about but as far as I know it didn&apos;t make any sound at all.", "Strange being in my bedroom and real dream having eggs.I&rsquo;m 43 years old woman. I was born in Bogot&aacute;, Colombia.  Actually I&rsquo;m living in California three years ago.  From the time I had opportunity to find your web side, I was encouraged to write down my story.In 2002, when I was living in Bogot&aacute;, I went to bed 11:00 pm very tired after a hard day in my job as import manager for a big multinational.  I woke up at about 2:30 am and It was like being between sleepy and awake.  I saw just next to my bed a long figure looking at me.  I&rsquo;ll describe it for you:  Very thin, as skinny as a skeleton.  More than 7 feet height.  His body was like transparent gelatin.  His two eyes black and very big.  His head was as big as our heads but small from his neck and wide on top.  He had four long fingers, 4.5 inches each one.  His hands looked like two spiders.  He had like a purple fluorescent radiance.I didn&rsquo;t feel fear. I was very interesting on him.  I raised my arm to touch him and he did the same. I could touch his hand with my finger, and I don&rsquo;t remember anything else.At 2007, living in California I had a dream.  I was walking and I felt something in my vagina.  Something was leaving from there without pain.  Then, I saw something falling down between my legs; it was two long jelly eggs.  After that, I didn&rsquo;t remember anything else but next day I could remember the eggs material were the same like the figure I saw seven years before.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I backed the SUV out of the garage and once I was in the street, facing Northwest, I immediately noticed a large bright yellowish white ball of light in the sky low on the horizon.  I had absolutely no clue what it could have been, but I wondered if it was a plane on fire or maybe a large plane with its headlights pointed toward me since my subdivision is on a flight path to and from Cincinnati Northern Kentucky airport.  I pulled up to the stop sign at the end of my street watching it and soon realized it was getting closer and flying toward the southeast at the back of my subdivision.  I turned left and stopped at the next stop sign and looked to my right and realized it was still flying low and moving very slowly.  I turned left and headed to the end of the street to exit my subdivision so I was driving Southeast too and could still see the light out my driver side window.  It was now to my left.  I hurried up and turned left onto State Route 48 to see if I could intercept it, and now I could see that the object was no longer a single large bright light but actually a solid object with multiple lights on it, and that it was flying very slowly, maybe only about 20 or 30 mph!  It was coming toward me now so I stopped the truck and put my window down to get a better view of it.  I couldn&rsquo;t believe how close it was to the trees that are about 30 feet tall.  It was probably only 25 or 50 feet above the trees.  I watched as it approached me and it had several bright white lights across the front of it.  I opened the door and stepped out of my vehicle but stood right there, and I could hear this sound coming from it that I&rsquo;m finding hard to describe.  Sort of like the sound of a jet engine with the volume turned way down, and this thing flew over me so slowly that I could now see that it was shaped like a triangle but with rounded edges, and was about the twice the size of my SUV.  There were no wings and! it had several white lights on the bottom and on the corners of it.  I saw a car coming up the street behind me so I hopped back in and put it in drive and tried to keep it in my view but was unable to.  I didn&rsquo;t think to use my cell phone to take pictures of it!  I searched the Internet hoping to find something similar and I am uploading the two photos I found that are VERY similar to what I saw.  The first picture is the bright light off in the distance, and the second picture is one of a triangle but the one I saw had more lights under it.", "Very blue light traveling FAST from north to south high in the sky.I was driving home on a dark street with very few street lights. Just before driving over the hill moments before pulling into my drive way I  thought I saw a blue light to my left high in the sky but I let it go thinking it was the reflection of the firehouse lights I passed on the power lines.Seconds later I realized there really was a light in the sky. It was moving incredibly fast and it was a blue light that wasn&apos;t blinking. It looked very high in the sky but it was easy to see.It moved smoothly from the left part of the sky to the right part of the sky and there as no sound. It took about several seconds to cross over to the other side. It was coming from the south going directly north. I live along the Hudson River and the town is very dark so the sky is usually very visible on a clear night.", "Orange Light UFO Over Beaumont, Artane, Dublin Ireland.Just after the fireworks end, 11years old son has notice a Strange Orange light and he call me to see it....

I hear my neighbours also asking them self what was that...?!...This is our 1st time to see something like that.. We are 100% sure that this thing was something out of this world!!! It has disapear in mater of second in the sky...The next day I have search the google to check did somebody else sow it.. and it was there many people who sow the same Orange light. some of them claim to have so 2 orange light. I also find the Report from Australia from 03/01/2009 who sow the same Orange lights and also the Australian Army jets have chasing them..The Report says:  &quot;MILITARY exercises may explain sightings of a mysterious orange light in Central Australia in recent days.   Military exercises spark UFOs  The Northern Territory News understands a group of people who live at Ali Curung, an Aboriginal community not far from well-known UFO haunt Wycliffe Well, had seen the strange phenomenon from their front porch at about 4am on Saturday. Several of the group watched as a huge orange ball hovered for an estimated 20 minutes before being chased by what appeared to be four fighter aircraft. Wycliffe Well owner Lou Farkas said some mentioned their UFO experience the next day when they came in for coffee. &quot;They had all just come in on a bus from Alice Springs and none of them had been drinking,&quot; he said. &quot;Apparently the light hovered for a while and then three other objects that looked like fighter planes trailed it and were joined by another plane. &quot;Then the orange light just disappeared into nowhere - they thought it was quite unusual, especially with the other lights that appeared to be aircraft joining in.&quot;  Advertisement: A US military spokeswoman said it was quite possible the stargazers had witnessed a military exercise.

I was in the front passenger seat. The area is rural farming.We headed East on Chillburg Rd. then turned South, South East onto Best Road. As we cleared some trees I saw to the right of us (west) a bright pulsating white light. We were just coming into Rexville when I lost sight of it.We crossed the North fork of the Skagit river and turned South on Fir Island Rd. As soon as we turned, we saw it again to our right (west). It looked bigger this time and my friend suggested that it was Venus or Jupiter. Then we realized that the object was stationary and below the cloud cover. A light fog was rising but the object shone very bright like a mercury vapor light.We found a place to pull over and watched the object through binoculars for about ten minutes. It remained stationary about 35 degrees above the horizon. I used an old navy trick to judge degrees by extending my arm, fingers closed and parallel to the horizon. It measured 3 and 1/2 hands above the horizon which is about 35 degrees. I could not judge the distance but its altitude was under 3,000 ft. because that was the ceiling and it was below the clouds.The object, as seen through the binoculars, was extremely bright with a soft blue light that seemed to cover the top; a pale red glow showed amidships and the bottom and sides were bright white. It was silent and stationary. It&apos;s shape could not be determined because the pulsating light was too bright.A few other cars pulled over because they too saw it. Unfortunately, none of us had a camera.We got back in our car and watched it as we continued south on Fir Island Rd. Just before the road comes to a tee and Fir Island turns sharply to the East, it disappeared. I started writing down everything I could remember and decided to submit this sighting.", "bright object lands near forestWe was driving south back towards Dixon in Maries County checking road conditions due to ongoing light snowfall and I witnessed a bright light moving from North to South that looked like a helicopter when i first witnessed it.  It then hovered for about 5 seconds then went straight down towards the ground out of my sight.  We proceeded on up the road to a hill top at which time we stopped the vehicle and got out and looked and from there you could see an object on the ground that had alot of bright light around it with a reddish light or glow on the top.This object was out in a field somewhat near the forest line.  From the distance we was from the object it was hard to get a good lookat the object other than to see there was a good deal of light around the object.  We was too far away to determine if there was anyone around the object but there was no noise to be heard from the location we stopped in.At that time we proceeded to continue our drive back into Dixon but the event occured over a period of about 4 minutes from the time i first spotted the object until the time we drove off.((NUFORC Note:  Case has been forwarded to an experienced investigator for follow-up investigation.

Since 12/19/08, having seen and reported a very up close UFO, I&rsquo;ve felt almost paranoid to be truthful. I&rsquo;ve found it best not to say too much to too many people, as they are justifiably skeptical.Since, my husband and I have been constantly looking to the skies over Highlands Ranch, CO.This morning, 01/03/2009, at 05:42, I was in our bedroom with the lights off. The skies were pitch black as I could see stars, and to the north, airplane&rsquo;s lights approaching DIA.Looking out the window, in a southwestern direction, toward the mountains, quite a ways out in the distance, I saw an extremely bright light &quot;falling&quot; straight down. At first I thought it may have been a comet (however, the light was &quot;brilliant&quot; and there was NO trail) and then it stopped...just stopped...and the brilliant white light suddenly disappeared and a horizontal strobe of varying colored lights came on the object.Still not certain of what I was seeing (I thought it may have been an airplane that had a close call and perhaps the lights were on wing tips as I was admittedly trying to talk myself out of what I was seeing) when suddenly a very long, diffused looking white light shot straight down from the object for about 2-3 seconds (the light was about 1/3 the distance between the object and the horizon from my viewpoint) and then that light went away. (If it had been daylight, I&rsquo;d say it looked like a long, large jet-trail--going straight DOWN!)  As I noted the object had been in one location for a while now, I quickly went to the living room and opened the blinds and was relieved to STILL be able to see it.The view from the bedroom had been better, so I went back and as I was watching it, 2 very long, diffused looking white lights shot out horizontally (one to the left, one to the right of the object) again lasting about 2 seconds.There had been no movement of the object now for a number of minutes. About 2 minutes later, the 2 horizontal lights came on for about 2 seconds again! Then, all of the lights just disappeared.", "Daytime ball of light flies at ground level only to disappearI was relaxing on my bed watching TV and happened to look out my bedroom window (actually a glass sliding door) when I noticed something whiz by.  It was a white ball of light about the size of a Baseball.  The only thing I can compare it to is a large smokeless roman candle projection.  It was about 12 feet away from me and 6 feet off the ground.  I got up and looked outside and saw nothing.  As the ground is covered in snow (at least six inches) I expected to see a smoking visible hole as the trajectory would have had it slam into the side of a foothill behind my house.  I found and saw nothing. I considered it might be ball lightning but it was clear and about 30 degrees outside.  It also made no sound I could hear.", "lSwannanoa nc 1202 am large pale light then bright flash helicopter type blades disappeared instantlyAbout 12:02 am 02/16/09, I saw a large pale light in the sky I was looking east.

It seem to be moving very slow toward the east at the same height and then it seem to blow up with a large flash and I could seen what seem to be the blades of a helicopter but extremely long and very bright, it seem to disapear very quickly.

I had just stepped out side to have a smoke and was looking up into the clear night sky when I noticed a boomerang shaped object. The object was coming from the south headed north and banked and headed North East. I am not a good judge of distance but I would say it was about 200 to 300 feet up and about 50 feet long. The color was opaque. It was very well camouflaged against the night sky and I had to concentrate first to make sure what I was seeing was what I was seeing and second not to lose site of it. On the bottom of it I could make out 5 circles that appeared to have a slight glow about them. There were no lights on the object but the circles had the appearance like glow in the dark stars when they are dim. The object made no noise and move about the speed of a glider. The whole event lasted about a min. and a half and it just appeared to fade into the sky.I am not a pilot or expert in such matters. I am a computer repair technician.

We both noticed a bright white light in the sky. The light did not move and was too close to be a star or a planet.  As we were looking at this extremely bright light we saw two different airplanes that appeared to fly very close to the bright object, one of the planes flew from right to left in front of the object and a few minutes later another plane flew from behind and just to the left as if the plane was coming from farther away and then getting closer.  I tried to the record the object three separate times and each time my camera would malfunction about 1 minute in and I would have to take the batteries out of my camera just to turn it off.

My fianc&eacute;e and I were driving south on Waukegan Road in Glenview, Illinois and saw a large, (about the size of the moon when it is midway up in the sky), round glowing object hovering high over the road about &frac12; mile in front of us. There was no noise from this object.   Everyone was out of their cars, including the police. All traffic was stopped.This object was so bright, all that could be seen was light. It hovered there for such a long time, that we finally had to leave. I&rsquo;m going say it was there for at least ten to fifteen minutes before we left. I remember saying to my fianc&eacute;e that we would find out about what happened the next morning, because it would definitely be in the newspaper or on TV.  There was no way that this could go unreported, because the police and 25 - 30 people were standing in the middle of Waukegan Road watching the incident. There was no report in the paper, or on the news the following days. FYI, the Glenview Naval Air Station was about four or five miles from this spot.Many years later, I tried contacting J. Alan Hynek, but he had died. I believe I contacted his office and they said they had no report of this, but that was probably 15 - 20 years after the occurrence.  It was so extraordinary, I can&rsquo;t believe there wasn&rsquo;t a report to someone. I&rsquo;ll never forget the sight of this, and will always wonder what it was.

Cape Rosier, Maine, is on the coast and is fairly remote and very rural.  I had a summer job there at a bed and breakfast kind of place.  A friend had come to visit me, and we had been to the 4th of July celebrations nearby.  She was staying in one of the cabins down by the ocean, so we decided to sit on the shore and visit a while.  It was very late &ndash; perhaps 11:00 or midnight.  We noticed that across the bay, just above the tree line, there was a big green glowing ball, and it was moving slowly to the right.  We continued watching it until it went out of sight behind us and to our right. This may have taken a half hour.  A few minutes later I sensed something, and I turned to see the green ball hovering above the trees just behind and above us.  Then we heard a splash, and turned to see a white raccoon emerging from the water in the little cove we were sitting by.  It was a big raccoon and instead of being afraid of us, it was coming straight to us. I could see the phosphorescence dripping off his body.  My friend said, &quot;Hi, little raccoon!&quot;  I instantly felt scared and I grabbed her wrist and yanked her up and we ran to the cabin.  We stayed in the cabin for a while, but eventually went back outside.  There was no sign of a raccoon or a light or anything. The next day we asked people if they had seen the green light, but no one we asked said they had.  I don&rsquo;t remember seeing anything written about it, either. For years after that my friend and I would mention that night and wonder what we had seen, and what that raccoon would have done had we stayed put.  Unfortunately I have lost touch with my friend now. I just noticed that you asked for background:  I was a 19 year old college student.  This was a summer job.  My friend was a few years older than me, maybe 22 or 23, and I think she may have been teaching at the time.  I can&rsquo;t remember.  We were both in our right minds, and didn&rsquo;t drink or do drugs or anything.

My friends and I were sitting in my car in the parking area in front of my apartment. My car was parked so that I was facing the road and the whole entire sky above it. It was a remarkably dark night, as we had just made a joke about it because we could barely see each other and we were sitting so close to one another. Then , out of nowhere, it seems like the entire sky lights up. This massive bright light is all you can see. I had no problem at this point looking around the car and being able to see all the rather shocked faces. And then the light subdues but into this ball-like object that seems to be hovering about 1000 feet from my neighbors rooftop, never losing that intense light. It stays there just about long enough for you to say &ldquo;What in the world?.. and then it just shoots of into the sky. I looked at the clock right after and it was 11:11pm.

I dismissed it as nothing out of the ordinary, figuring it was possibly the planet Venus. I returned to my activities on the computer but I started thinking about the light and realized that I had never observed Venus in that position in the sky nor had I ever seen a star or planet either as bright or as big. After having pointed out the object to my brother I returned to my room, turned off the light, noted the time (20:46) and started watching the ball of light. It seemed to remain stationary but after a little while I thought I saw it move.To confirm that it was indeed moving I rested my chin on the window sill, braced my head with my hands and kept one edge of the window in my peripheral sight to provide a reference point. This is what I observed: 1: The intensity of the light changed, it would go from rather bright to fairly dim. The duration and brightness seemed quite random.2: There appeared to be a background shape but I could not distinguish an exact form.3: The light pulsed or throbbed red. The duration and brightness of the pulse was somewhat variable.It had a rise, peak and fall unlike an airplane strobe.4: The light moved. It was moving westward (away from me) very slowly the whole time I watched, at times it would stop and stay in position and then in a very fluid but quick motion go either south or north a little ways and then either remain motionless in its new position or resume movement west.5: I saw three airplanes at different times coming from different directions and altitudes but they all were heading in general direction of the light.6: Toward the end of the time of my observation the light was pretty far away but it seemed to separate into three different points of light and then join back up into one several times. The time I spent intently watching this was just over 45 minutes, but starting from when I first spotted the light it was in the sky for over an hour.

My camera was on the same window sill that I was watching from but the battery was dead and I didn&apos;t want to break away to get the charger, if I had my camera I could have got some good shots with its 10x zoom and probally some good video due to how long the light was in the sky.", "Object that looked like a large moon...it moved and then dropped off sight.Around 8:50 pm I was throwing out garbage when I noticed what looked like a very large moon.

Then they went out 2 at a time in the opposite order until they were all gone.  After maybe 5 seconds they repeated the pattern and then disappeared.

At this point I could see that the object was a solid black triangle against the dark bluish night sky, all sides the same length. The rear was a point, and the front was a flat side. The small blinking redish/pink light was on the tail and the large white lights were on the face of the two front tips of the triangle. It continued moving south away from the highway until out of sight. There was another large white light far away in that southern direction as well, though I saw no detail of it. If it was an airplane though it certainly saw this object as it was moving in it&apos;s general direction. I could clearly see though with no doubt in my mind that this was indeed a solid &quot;backwards&quot; flying equilateral triangle with no wings, engines or windows. I feel that some form of authorities in the areas that this object passed over should be contacted to see if others saw it as well.", "Low, large, fast, maneuvering aircraft with strange glow and configuration over I-64W.Was driving from Clifton Forge to Covington, Va. on I-64 W after getting off work and going to the grocery store. Weather was overcast, just before a winter storm warning, with low, solid clouds, cold temperatures, and poor visibility. Sky was fully darkened. Was driving due west on I-64 when I observed from the far left, an aircraft of some kind, which flew from left to right (very south to very north) over the interstate. The aircraft was approximately the same size as a typical fighter aircraft, but didn&apos;t have running lights. First off, there were no flashing lights at all (required by FAA), and also no solid wingtip lights, if there were any wings. Second, the aircraft had a distinctly large, bright, diffuse aft glow, orange to peach in color, oval in shape like a figure &quot;8&quot; laid on its side but not that precise. This gave the impression of what might be jet engines, but it didn&apos;t seem as bright or cherry-red as engines, and was more large and amorphous, less like two distinct circles, like you&apos;d observe on a fighter aircraft at night. Also, there was a fore end glow, rather large but smaller than the aft end glow, also peach or orange in color but less bright, and either pointed-oval or cone-shaped, like a cockpit with the light on. It gave the impression of a structured craft with a general shape of a high aspect ratio cone, but the glowing features were not bright enough to illuminate wings or a fuselage of any kind. The aircraft flew approximately over Alleghany Regional Hospital, perpendicular to the interstate, over the interstate, until it reached Valley Ridge Road in front of Alleghany High School, where it took a sharp turn westward, to follow Valey Ridge Road. It cut the turn rather abruptly, kind of &quot;skidding&quot; through the air and wobbling from left to right a couple of times to overcorrect its path to a straight line before proceeding due west to the right of I-64 along Valley Ridge Road toward Covington, where I lost it. When it cut the right-angle turn, the glow seemed to brighten, but that could have just been me getting a straight-on look at it&apos;s aft section. What struck me was how low, large, fast and maneuverable it was. There is a mountain behind the high school, can&apos;t be more than 1,500 feet high. I saw this thing silhouetted against that mountain as it flew off, so it was definitely lower than the ridge. It looked like it had to hand a fast left to avoid smacking into the ridge. Approximately the size of a large jet fighter only larger, and very fast and maneuverable... I&apos;d say the whole sighting lasted maybe 5-7 seconds. There had to be lots of people who saw this, it was over the interstate at a very busy time. This could be related to some daylight sightings of Osprey aircraft operating in Lexington a few weeks ago. Could this have been an Osprey at night? I don&apos;t know. Somehow I don&apos;t think so, because if you saw this thing move, it moved more like a cruise missile or sophisticated UAV or something. Also, there was NO (and I mean absoluted ZERO) sound at all coming from this thing. That produced an eerie effect. After I lost it, I looked at my car radio and marked the time as 6:41 PM. Anyone else who saw this, I&apos;d appreciate your views. Thanks.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I live in Oregon, so this time of year, you don&apos;t get to see the stars very often-It was a beautiful clear night.  This &quot;star&quot; was just too strange-It seemed too close to the earth, and I could plainly see it pulsating with vibrant colors.  I ran into the house to grab my digital camera, and began filming.  It did some amazing rotating, and moved several times over the next two hours.  All in all, I saw five of these in the night sky, but none as close as this one, and then this one bacame a pinprick pretty fast. This was the best footage I got. What do you think?  I see that I&apos;m not the only one out there seeing these in the sky.  I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s an actual extraterrestrial vehicle, or a government vehicle, or even an entity but all I can say is that is NOT a planet, that is NOT a helicopter, and if you&apos;ve watched this full screen, you will see it rotate into three distinct parts.  Please [politely] let me know what you think of this.  My husband and I have been fighting ever since, because he insists it&apos;s a planet whose light is refracting thru the cosmos. Phooey.  That&apos;s no planet!  Like I said, it came closer and then became a pinprick, and then came closer, and moved left and right over several hours.

I was outside around 6:30-7:00pm on Friday after work playing with my dog, and b/c I live 5 minutes from the airport I happened to be looking up at all the airplanes in the sky. I noted just before the incident about what a clear night it was and how you could see almost all the stars. As I watched one plane that happened to be pretty low probably having just taken off and banking in a southern direction; going just under my clear view of a very bright Venus; I looked down at my dog. When I looked back up to find the plane to see which direction it was heading in, I noticed a single white light moving from the south to the north. It struck me as odd b/c I could see about 7 planes in the sky at one time from my vantage point and I noticed that all the planes in the sky had at a minimum of 2-4 lights on, and at least 1-2 flashing lights. I watched the single white light move north at a somewhat medium pace, wasn&apos;t fast, wasn&apos;t slow. As it got closer the single light started to turn pink, then changed to red then completely faded out. After I saw that I assumed that the object, presumably a plane, probably banked to the side and the light was hidden by a wing. So I sat outside for 10 minutes and watched the sky in the general area where the object was heading. I never saw a light appear in the area. I still saw several planes in the area, all with multiple light, and flashing lights. I also remembered to recheck the sky conditions for possible clouds... not a single cloud in the sky. I&apos;m a natural born skeptic, so this is strange for me. I was so baffled by this, that I told my wife and of course she laughed and told me I was crazy.", "Very Bright yellow light  high in the sky in AlgarveMe and my girl friend left our house in Carvoeiro Algarve at approx 21.30. The first thing we noticed in the sky was a bright pinpoint of light much brighter than a star, it was far away and I assumed it was Venus but it troubled me because I have never seen Venus so bright. We both looked at it during our walk for about 10 minutes. We made several tests to see if there was any movement, making a comparison with nearby stars. It was stationary. It was so bright that it gave  a star burst effect and it was difficult to eliminate the star burst effect to ascertain just what it was.We both agreed it was not round but elongated, we continued our walk to a nearby hotel. Buildings began to interfere with our view of the object, at this point we made a decision to continue to the hotel with the hope that we could view it from the rear of the hotel, as it turned out we couldn&apos;t, again it was obscured by buildings.We stayed in the hotel for about 1 hour, when we returned to the last siting position it was gone. There was no trace of it anywhere in the area of the sky where it was, this object was not an aircraft as there was no flashing lights just a very bright, yellowish, stable, elongated light, approx 4 times the brightness of Venus on a good night.", "Small Sphere traveled very low, very smoothly, and then danced out of sight.I was walking in the area of Union Station when a small greyish-white Sphere came in to view very close to me.  It was traveling at about 10 miles per hour approximately 20-30 feet off the ground.  It was moving so smoothly in one direction (diagonal, to my left, passing from the side of me to in front of me) that at first i thought this sphere was on some type of invisible zip-line.  Then the sphere started moving in directions outside of it&apos;s original path.  Still traveling forward, it moved up and down, and then swooped very quickly as it got closer to the brick building in front of me (High School in the Community).  The sphere was small as I mentioned, but it&apos;s movements were quick and smooth.  The possibility of it being controlled somehow by remote is out of the question based on the quick, sudden movements (at one point doing a quick loop.  The word dancing would almost describe it).  I kept walking forward towards the brick building where it was fading out of my site, and then I could no longer see it as it seemed to have traveled out of site.  I continued to look for it for the next 30 minutes to no avail.  Shortly thereafter I saw a large slowly drifting  object far off in the distance, cigar shaped, but very large.  It didn&apos;t act or look like a cloud.  The only possibility I could come up with was that maybe it was a Zeppelin or blimp.  This remained in my sight for 15 minutes or so.  Also, a bright light high in the sky appeared in view.  It looked like a bright star or planet, but I hadn&apos;t seen it minutes earlier.  This made it suspicious to me.  I asked another walker on the streets if he could see it and he could.  He said maybe it was Venus.  Regardless, the sphere was very much so real, and blew my mind.", "I remembered this about 4 years after the fact. It came backs suddenly.I was on the roof of my house  about to clean the leaves when i heard  hum a sound that seemed like high voltage transformer type sound.I looked at the sky and I saw a huge rectangular craft it looked like some kind of rig, It had  huge metal  ibeams containing  a huge  yellow cylinder.  And a huge square volume  next to it.  I saw what seemed  to be walkways or ladders.  In front there where maybe 10 to 12  objects but had passed over me before I saw  the one I am talking about.

It must have been pretty low. As I watched the helicopter pass by, I caught a glimpse of what I thought was a plane headed toward me from the opposite location. It was was brighter than the other stars in the sky, but it looked just like a star. I questioned myself about the speed of the object. I was giong really fast for a plane. Easy to follow with eye, but faster than a plane. Also, the flight path was unique as it changed direction from southbound to northbound. This only lasted maybe 30 seconds then the object stopped. It just sat stationary like a star. It also looked just like one, but brighter. I sat there and stared at it for twenty minutes or so. No more movement. I went inside and have been checking on it. Still there. It has been over an hour since I saw it moving. I am blown away. I have found many other accounts like mine on the net. Skeptics explanations do not account for what I have just wittnessed. I hear unexplained frequencies and metallic noises during odd hours (1-5 AM)and I have experianced purple ball lightning near where I live several years back (i can elaborate upon request, it was amazing, there was witnesses), perhaps there is something of cosmic interest in the area.", "Saucer shaped objectThis info was from my father, who recently passed away.

He said there was one red light on the botton and what appeared to be a row of rotating windows with a very bright white light.

Somehow, the bruising around my ribs and thighs are telling me this was more of a visit.  I was about ready for bed, letting my dog dudley out for an evening walk.  He began barking and used his tail to cover his genitals in fear as he cowered behind me.  I suddenly felt what I would describe as an extreme static charge in the air that seemed to cause droplets of dew to quickly evaporate.  Even the frost on the ground turned to steam and I could feel intense heat.  This quickly turned my attention towards the treeline in front of me as I heard the same high pitch sound, only this time much more painful.  I dropped to my knees and noticed blood dripping from my nose onto the ground.

It always appears out of the western hemisphere, and does nothing but sweep from north to south for roughly one hour at a time then just disappears. The way I know it is not a series of stars is because even when cloudy outside the lights are still there, and they create a shimmer on the clouds as they are passing by them.Here lately a second set of lights has appeared over the sky so that there is now a total of 6 lights between 21:00 and 23:00. Have not seen any more than that but do know that every night the lights are again out and about doing whatever it is they are doing. The formation they tend to fly in is an over and under type formation with a slight stagger in between the two. The first ship will by slightly higher in altitude and a good bit above the second while the second tends to move a little bit slower almost as if to be scanning for anything the first ship did not pick up or see. Each night they move closer and closer towards the actual city.The size of the object is really hard to tell because of how far out it appears to be, but at the best estimate I would give the object roughly 1mile in length due to the size it appears and the distance it seems to stay at.The two people who I know may have seen it would be myself and brother. Both of which are completely fascinated by it because we have some sense of background with airplanes and knowledge of the air force from family history. I myself have studied planes because I wanted to be a pilot and this object is nothing like any air plane I have ever seen or ever even thought about. Its movements are the biggest reason it comes across peculiar to me because it does not move like any aircraft known to man can move it moves almost as if its just floating from point A to point B. The other unique thing is that unlike most aircraft that make a slight noise when flying even from a distance this object makes no noise, and seems to draw almost no attention.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I noticed the chemtrail coming out of the back of the plane when the orb appeared and did three full circles around the chemtrail itself and then flew to the very end of the chemtrail and back to the very front of the chemtrail right behind the plane. After that it quickly broke away from the chemtrail and flew towards Valley Fair mall about maybe 50 to 100 yards closer.

Sterling OhioThis is a  report of a sighting from 1972 I am unsure of the exact date however there should be a record of a newspaper clip verifying the date as well as an unknown witness inquiry.It was in the summer, august probably as I was home on leave from tech school in Rantoul, Illinois.  Just after basic training in the Air Force.  I lived in a small town in Ohio, Mt.Sterling, about twenty five miles south of Columbus. There is a small creek running through it called Deer Creek, now made larger by a dam project built there in the mid 70&rsquo;s.While on leave from the Air Force my uncle, and two of my friends, and I  decided to go fishing near the bridge on the north end of town. There were stands of trees on either side of the creek bank and open farm fields beyond there. We had been there about 4 hrs camped out with the usual fishing gear and such when around midnight, one o&rsquo;clock a large shape rose out from behind the trees. The object was approximately 200 feet or more long or I should say around with an indescribably blue light emitting from the bottom. It was the color of a welder arc but not painful to look at, it was more of intense glow than a light. The light or glow was probably 80%as large as the craft was.The craft made on sound and emitted no heat, nor air movement. It rose approximately 100 feet into the air, and stopped!  It did not wobble or move it just stopped. The craft stayed there for at least 10 minutes and then began to slowly rise increasing in speed the farther away it got.  Its assent was precisely vertical and continued until it was a pinpoint of light. And then it was gone.Needles to say we were all stunned at what had just happened and decided to make haste out of there.The next day the newspaper came out and a couple driving on the highway had placed an ad inquiring if anyone had seen anything strange in the sky that night. I was just in the air force, and project Blue book and UFO&rsquo;s were being officially call swamp gas, so I did not report the sighting.Soon after that I returned to my Duty station in Fla. I have never spoken with the people I was with again, and do not know of there where abouts. So if you would like to track them down you would be welcome to.We were less than a hundred yards from this craft, I know of no other report that has been that close, I can understand folks seeing light and other such things at a distance. But we were so close that we had to restrain one of the younger members from throwing a rock at it. He would have hit it.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It rotated clockwise slowly and had 4 or 5 beams coming from the bottom of the UFO which were not very bright and were yellow in colour, but were bright enough to poorly illuminate an object.  The UFO was only a couple of hundred feet in the sky.  It moved at walking pace and looked like it had a dome on the top of the disk which was faintly illuminated red/pink.It made a quiet noise, similar to a jet engine, but much quieter.  As well as the beams of light it had what looked like green glow-sticks on the rim of the disk.We saw the UFO slowly move away towards the coast.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was late and dark.  We had just finished watching some movies when we thought it would be a great idea to go visit the small cemetery down the road.To make a long story short, we were walking in the cemetery and- I remember very well- we had to go slow because it was very dark and we couldn&rsquo;t see the stones.  We weren&rsquo;t doing anything, just kind of walking around.  We got to the back where there was a small woods with a field on the other side.  We decided to turn around and go back to the house.I clearly remember that I was looking down (stones and all) so that I wouldn&rsquo;t trip when I suddenly realized that I could see all the stones with some weak shadows.  The light wasn&rsquo;t blazing bright- kind of like moonlight that is filtered through clouds.I stopped and looked up (as did my friends) and there well above us (but on the horizon) in the sky was a perfectly straight, rectangular bar of light.  It was big enough that you had to move your eyes from left to right to see it all.  I don&rsquo;t know what direction we were facing.  As we stood there, mouths open, just staring, the bar of light got thinner from the top and the bottom- like you might see when a door to a lit room closes- but horizontally.  It got thinner and thinner and then just disappeared.It did not move except for the &ldquo;closing&rdquo; effect.  We asked our astronomy professor at SUNY Geneseo about it the next day.  He said it may have been Northern Lights- NO WAY!. . . straight lines on all sides, controlled closing of the light.I am writing about it now- after many years- on a whim of looking it up on the internet and finding some other accounts that sound exactly like mine.

I was removing a wasp nest from the eve of my house with a stream of water from a garden hose.  After I knocked it down and was spraying the wasps I looked up at the eve and saw this white/silver shimmering object staying stationary in the sky.  As I watched it, I saw it moving slowly left and right.  It did not seem to be affected by the wind.  The wind was out of the west maybe 5 mph. at ground level.  I went inside and grabbed my video camera.  It is really hard to film these things.  I got some of it on tape but I&rsquo;m disappointed at my video.  At least I managed to capture something.  The white/silver thing moved back to the west, against the wind, hovering then moving again.  I called my wife out to look at it and my kids saw it too.  Unimpressed they went back into the house.  I watched and tried to get it on film for over 15 minutes, and then it just vanished.((NUFORC Note:  Three photos forwarded by witness.

I immediately noticed 3 diamond shaped light configurations in the northwest corner of the sky towards Newport Beach, CA.  I of course stopped and just stared.  They were moving very fluidly, counter clockwise and then clock wise, back forth with no apparent set pattern- like kites would do.  The lights were a very bright light blue. They would go completely off and them come back on.   I couldn&apos;t make out exactly what type of craft they were on.  I watched for about a minute and then two of them disappeared and just one remained.  I saw it go behind a cloud and then reappear...so they had to be at least at cloud level.  They were quite high in the sky because I was seeing them way over trees and building tops.  I knew immediately that what I was seeing just by the shear movement of them was not an airplane, helicopter or military craft.  I was already running quite late so I got in the car and headed to meet my friend, while I was driving I tried to hang my head out the window to see the remaining object.  I wound up right under it when I got to the intersection and could make out a faint outline of some sort of a craft that looked grayish.  I was a little worried at that point, realizing I was right under it.  Then the traffic light turned and it was above my car so I could no longer see it.  I called two friends and tried to get them to go outside and se if they could see it as well, but didn&apos;t reach them in time.  Southern California is a big place with a huge population and I&apos;m quite sure lots of other people had to see this as well.

I looked at the clock and it said 7:30pm I told her I would be there in about 20 minutes( I was running late for my husbands birthday dinner.) All of a sudden I felt some sort of magnitism drawing my attention. I looked up in the sky and saw a oval shaped object sitting still in the sky. It was beautiful,it looked like an eferdescent opal color. It had a bright neon purple tail that went all the way to the ground. For some reason I pulled my car off to the side of the road and I locked my car and suddenly I was inside the object. the inside was a clean,sterile,cool room made of stainless steel. It had cabinets on the wall and it looked immaculate. There were two beings. they had big white heads and black eyes. They were actually tall and were both male and had on long white lab coats. I remember I was laying on a stainles steel table and they were examining my body. They took body fluids,blood,urine,saliva among other things. The next thing I really remember is walking back to my car with a splitting headache. I looked at the clock and it said 8:30pm  my daughter had left several messages checking on me. When I arrived at the restaurant I was still shaken and felt weak. I didnt want to say what had happened to me. but I wanted to know what had really happened. I saw one of the area firefighers and I ask him if anything had been reported in the sky. He said no. I called the sheriffs dept and kep getting the same answers..nothing unusual had been reported.  When i got up the next morning I went to my neighbors house and before I could tell her what happened she told me she had seen a flying saucer and it scared her really bad.  She described it to a t.

Seeing that this was a bit strange, I went to get my binoculars after a few minutes of observing this strange light. After retrieving my binoculars, it came closer at a high rate of speed.  As it turned to go west I observed what was orange, now become 2 red objects and one yellow/amber object. The light from all 3 objects did not strobe and the lights appeared as orb/arrowhead shapes in single file one behind the other with two red and one the amber object trailing. As the craft came closer these craft were of triangle shape and all were of equal distance,  but then converged into a triangular formation. The amber was at it&apos;s highest point in the triangle formation, and as the objects traveled through the sky, the formation changed to a single file formation and then back to a triangle formation with the amber object now at the bottom of the formation. There was no sound from these craft and there were no aircraft in the area at the time of the sighting.  The speed was enormous for the distance I observed. The objects were about 32-36 thousand feet (perhaps less), descending quickly and were about 3 to 4 miles away. I was able to observe the object for about 6-7 seconds going west. I have a nearly unobstructed 180 degree panoramic view from the back of my house  which points almost directly north. I live in an area that has a lot of airplane traffic, so I know these were not planes. However, soon after, there was a plane that flew over my house and then abruptly changed direction,  the same direction that these craft were headed.

I remember at least one flashing yellow light on the bottom as it passed over my head. The back end of the craft was the flat edge of the triangle opposite the front point.The back end had an open round hole that glowed orange.I could hear a low rumbling, whooshing sound, similar to the sound a gas furnace makes when the thermostat clicks and causes the to burners kick on, but before the fan starts.Just that low sound the gas flames make. I&apos;m not sure if the sound was actually coming from the triangle craft or a jet at high altitude, which sounds like a gas furnace to me. It was a quiet, windless, foggy night about midnight, no traffic or other noise.A guesstimate of size...... at least as big as a two car garage. It was not huge.How I came to sight it: I had decided to run into town to the 24 hour convenience store to pick up a gallon of milk for morning. As I stopped at the end of the driveway before pulling out onto the highway I could see a bright light shining through the tree tops of a heavily wooded parcel on the other side of the road. I gasped, because I thought it was a helicoptor using a search light, which would mean something seriously urgent was going on. Things like a lost or abducted child, a dangerous criminal on the loose, etc. raced through my head. I made sure the doors of the van were locked and waited for the helicopter to fly over. It was sooo ssslllooowww and I couldn&apos;t hear any racket from a helicoptor engine and rotors, so I turned the defroster off. Still couldn&apos;t hear anything, so turned the ignition off and rolled the window down a crack. Still heard nothing, so got out of the mini-van and stood beside it.The silent triangle slowly cruised out over the tree tops, over the highway and directly over me and my van at the end of the driveway. I walked under it at a leisurely stroll with my head tilted up to watch it. After walking under it for about 30 feet, I reached the corner of the house and flattened my back against the side of the house. I was starting to become uneasy and scared, yet awed and mesmerized at the same time. It was so quiet, the dogs didn&apos;t wake up and come out of their dog houses to bark at it. But I&apos;ve since often wondered if it&apos;s something they were used to, so it didn&apos;t bother them.I thought about running around to the back door to go in and wake-up everyone else in the house.I even thought about just staying where I was and pounding on the side of the house to make them wake up and come running out, but I just stayed quietly where I was and waited for it to pass completely over me. At least one small yellow light flashed while it was still over my head. When it had passed far enough passed me, I could see the orange glow from the round hole in the back.And as weird as this sounds, I don&apos;t remember anything else about it. I know on the course it was taking, it should have floated past the barn and out over the pasture and hayfield behind it, but if it did, I don&apos;t remember stepping away from the side of the house to watch it.This happened on the outskirts of Elkhorn, Wisconsin. It was either 2000 or 2001. The weather was cool and foggy, and the trees were fully leafed out and still green, so I&apos;m guessing it was early fall of either of those years. We moved from that house summer of 2002. My best guess is that this occurred early Sept.2001 before the 11th. With the collective trauma of 9/11 and the personal stress of having the property up for sale at that time, I think is why my memory of the exact date is lost.Anyway, sorry this narrative has gone on so long.

It is a dark, dead, straight stretch of road. More than fifty miles ahead, we could see an active city of flashing white glow.  As we neared the city of lights hovering over the left side, my wife pulled off the road and she said,  &ldquo;Look at this!&rdquo; I saw a spectacle of the brightest white flashing light ever experienced.  The object was hovering approximately 40 yards away and 50 feet above the ground.  It was so bright in the night sky that I could not make out the shape of the object, or objects.  It was hovering, but not completely stationary, as it slowly wavered 10 degrees down it&rsquo;s path.  There was no sound.  I peered into the luminescence as I looked up to this swiveling white light at the top sending beams high into the dark sky.  Below, there was a row of blue lights possibly stretching 30 yards across.   I franticly repeated, &ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; My wife, my eighteen-year-old daughter and ten-year-old grandson were speechless as we, all, looked on in awe.  This experience lasted a mere minute before I resolved quickly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna grab my camera&rdquo;, reaching in the back window for my camcorder.  Suddenly, as I said this, the lights/object strobe-shifted miles down the road.  The movement was unworldly as there was no humanly audible sound nor any notice of motion to reach it&rsquo;s distance.  I, still, thought to capture the distant lights to record &lsquo;something&lsquo; of the phenomena.  Again, suddenly, as if there was connection of my intentions, the object shifted considerable distance down the road to be a mere glow.  Within two seconds, the object was here and then had nearly disappeared.  I felt cheated.

The colors were red,orange,green,raspberry and several shades of blue. I handed the binoculars to my neighbors to look and then I noticed 3 more in a line from East to West travelling in the same North East direction. Looking through the binoculars they were also of these same beautiful colors.My wife came out of the house and we handed her the binoculars and she remarked that they appeared to be translucent like a jellyfish.The last ones observed were 2, one behind the other travelling in the same North East direction. The lead one seemed to slow and the trailing one seemed to touch or bump into the lead one. The lead one then turned the most beautiful blue that I cannot fully describe, almost like a Carribbean blue but more vibrant.They did not seem be moving fast or make any turns and appeared to be as high as our commercial aircraft fly, but these objects left no contrails. The sky was clear/blue.We were all very excited seeing thse objects because the beautiful colors gave us an uplifting feeling.Later that evening I saw another neighbor in the supermarket and he told me he saw the same objects.Before this incident I was somewhat doubtful of stories about UFO&apos;s, but this experience has changed my views.", "We were (five of us) all watching a small saucer (approx 40 ft wide at approx 3000 ft altitude).

It really startled me because it didn&apos;t look like it could be more then 1,000 feet high in the sky.Looking directly at it the size might have been the size of 2 basketballs put together.  I used my neighbors roof peak to give the fall a direction.  If the peak of their roof was 12 o&apos;clock the fireball fell to 3:30 in 10-15 seconds.  I ran from the porch to the sidewalk.  Just when I thought it was going to crash into the houses about 1/2 block north of where I was standing it went poof and was gone.  By poof I mean that it got dim and just disappeared.  It didn&rsquo;t shatter or fall apart, it just got dim and was gone.The fireball itself was a bright white and the flames around the outside were neon lime green closest to the circumference then neon yellow and finally a very bright orange.  (The orange wasn&apos;t as intense as the other colors.)

It was route 3 and we were heading toward West Chester. There used to be what was called &apos;the Nikie sight.&apos; It was some sort of military installation with radars. (I wish I could remember more details about his facility and even how to spell it. (I moved out of the area in 74) Within a couple of years that facility was no longer there.) I was between 10 and 12 years old (my brother was 3 years older).It was starting to get dark. We saw one huge triangular shape on the ground. We saw many other cars parked along the road looking at this. So we pulled over as well. People had gotten out of their cars watching in amazement. &quot;what is this thing?&quot; It was just sitting there. Within minutes of watching it it suddenly lifted straight up in the air, very low humming sound, at which point we could clearly see the triangular shape with a white light on each of the three corners. It looked like a triangular shaped donut, because as i vaguely recall we could see a triangular shape hole in the center that we could see the sky through it. I can remember the people around us saying, &quot;What is this thing?&quot; As soon as it was a couple hundred feet up in the air it took off so fast and was out of sight. We heard a sound of wind, like a wooosh and it was instantly gone out sight.One UFO special on TV showed actual home video of a triangular shaped craft, through the trees showed a craft with 3 lights on each corner. The second I saw it, the hair on the back of my neck stood up. That was exactly what I had seen back in the mid 60&apos;s.

But i was reluctant to tell my story until i hearing more and more people testifying of the same thing.I am currently 53 years old (as of 2009). I have always wondered, if this is something of our own military, why would it not have been revealed by now.

My three teenage and preteen children and I turned into the driveway and had stopped at the mailbox to get the mail when we saw some extremely bright lights at the far end of the field.I got out of the car and noticed it was moving slowly in a circular path.  It was triangular in shape, with 3 bright white lights at each corner.  The edges of the craft glowed with a dull silvery light.  It reminded me of the neon lights you see under cars.  In the center was an extremely large red light.It began to move slowly across the field and over the far end of my driveway.  I grabbed my phone and quickly took a picture with it as it passed over the woods on the other side of the driveway.  After about 45 seconds from when we first saw it and about 5-10 seconds after I took the picture it disappeared.  It did not shoot off, or leave any trails of light because of moving quickly, and did not go behind any hills or trees (there was nothing to obstruct the view).  It simple just disappeared.  My two oldest could verify the exact experience to my husband when we got to our house, so I know what we saw.  Hopefully, once I download my picture to my computer I will be able to zoom in and have it enhanced to better make out the objects shape.

As I sit here now typing, i can still see the light.  it moves up and down, back and forth quite a bit.  I phoned the police and was told an officer will check it out.  I am still waiting for his arrival.  Oddly enough, I phoned a friend about what I am seeing and he told me that similar reports were on the front page of the newspaper today.

I was renting a room in a house. I did not have a car, but I bought a bus pass to get around. On many nights, I would leave around the same time, and take a walk to a local 7-11 store to get a soda or candy bar. It was a good half mile to mile walk. I occasionally would glance to the sky and look at the stars on my walks. One evening, I did just that, but this time was different. I noticed a real bright star that stood out from the other stars. I was walking South towards Washington Street, but my head was facing to the West while walking (Rancho street), toward this object in the sky. I was looking at it for about 5 or so seconds, and all of a sudden it zipped at a 75-80 degrees using an acute angle. When I say zipped, I mean it appeared to leave the Earth within a few seconds (blink of an eye). I am not good with angles: so I will say it zipped nearly straight up. It was too far away to describe what kind of object it was. I did notice a light trail that was whitish/blue that it left behind. This trail dissapeared within a few seconds as well, but gave me a good idea of its path. It was clear that this object (physical or non-physical) had unreal speed. This incident proves to me there is either something else out there in this universe, or man has developed something amazing. I surely side to the former.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

He was killed 2 miles from my house in a one vehicle crash.  On 10/19 his wife (friend #1) asked that we (3 friends) go to her house to get his burial clothes because she did not want to go alone.  We took my car.  The time there was somber to say the least, we reminisced a bit and left for my house.  Upon backing out of the driveway friend #4, sitting in the back passenger side said &quot;What in the heck is that?&quot;  Nobody looked because she has a drug problem and we never take her seriously.  Her sister (friend #3), sitting in back, driver side looked and said &quot;Oh My God look over the house!&quot;  I looked and stopped the car (in that order) and all I can say is the first thing that came to mind was &quot;Is that an old car?&quot; I immediately dismissed that idea because it was ridiculous and I continued driving.  I figured it would &apos;disappear&apos; but it didn&apos;t.  I came to a stop sign within a mile, rolled through it and the object was moving closer to us from the direction of Friend #1 house.  The object was not as high as a cell tower (I don&apos;t feel comfortable stating measurements in feet).  It was pewter in color.  It depended on the angle it was looked at, as to what it looked like.  After a while I didn&apos;t see the old car resemblance, I saw a futuristic car.  The car comparison is due to what appeared to be big fenders, like a 56 chevy.  The closest thing my mind could compare it to was the car in Back to the Future.  Its movements were as quick as a thought, there was no stall when it stopped.  At one point it backed up, stopped, waited and continued when we did. It was more of a rectangle shape than a disk at one angle.  Every edge was rounded and where there could have been doors there were no seams.  It appeared to have a windshield because the front of the object had a darker color in the area of the windshield.My friend that had died in the wreck had seen them many times out there as orbs and lights and triangles, always at night.  We have video that he filmed.  I watched some of it, I saw an orb but I&apos;m not sure what to think but he was definitely convinced it was abnormal.The area we were traveling is in a very rural area and the road from their house to town is narrow and winding with trees hanging over the road.  Most of it follows a bayou for the first 5 miles or so.  Then it is open pastures and farm land for 5 or 6 miles to a city of 20,000. I live on the opposite side of town so we drove through town on a four lane highway until we stopped at a gas station 3 miles from my home.  Then we proceeded to my house through farm land.  Through the entire route the object stayed to our left as we headed north and then west.  It was hard to see it clear when we first left Friend #1&apos;s house due to the trees but we could see it.  It followed us along the winding road.  It stopped when we stopped and we all commented about it stopping.  All of us are fairly cool-headed so no one panicked.  It was the first time any of us saw a spark of the normal Friend #1 in the past few days.  We didn&apos;t know whether to laugh or cry so we all started laughing, everybody found a cigarette to puff on and we watched it follow us for the next 10 miles until we stopped at the gas station.  No one outside of my car seemed to see it.  We were all looking up and while on the 4-lane I watched other cars and it was as if they didn&apos;t see us either but that&apos;s not unusual these days.  When we stopped the lights from the gas station were so bright that we couldn&apos;t see the sky.  I never noticed that it would cause a blind spot when you try to see past the fluorescent lights at dusk.    While we were in the store I remembered I had a dang camera in the car!.  After 5 minutes we started back out and it was waiting on us over a field still to the left, passed a bridge.   Now it was dark.  I pulled my car to the right and jumped on my hood with my camera and started taking pictures and when I did the dang thing started flipping literally.  It now had red, white and blue lights (we triple checked that that night).  I got one shot of it in video (I attached it P1010006.MOV), if you have problems opening it I can co! nvert it Everyone was moving around in the car so all the still shots look like slivers of light.  I hollered for them to stop and they did and that is when I got the video.  They were all freaking out about me being on the hood.  I guess they thought I may get beamed up.  After listening to coast to coast, I have realized that may not have been the smartest move.  The object shot up so far in the sky it was just a blink of a light so I got down and drove us to my house. When we arrived at my house we told my husband what had happened and he looked at us like we had been doing drugs.  We pointed it out to my husband who quickly saw we weren&apos;t making it up.  He saw the 3 lights and estimated it was 1/2 mile up. He manages road construction so I trust his judgment on the measurement.  It was higher now than it was when we first saw it.  Friends #3 &amp; #4 left and I offered to take Angie to her Dad&apos;s in Monroe so we could talk about what had just happened.  When we left, the object didn&apos;t immediately follow us.  My husband said the lights started getting closer to our house, so close that he went inside in fear of what may happen if he didn&apos;t.  After 15 minutes we saw it again while heading south on Hwy 165.  It was high in the sky (1/2 mile I guess) hovering.  Once I got her home I headed back to my house and I did not see it again until 10/19/2008.  I saw the same type craft in the sky roll out of the path of a jet.

Now when I say lights, I don&apos;t mean like car or plane or copter lights. They looked like a glow from a fire or if a trash can was turned upside down and a huge road flare was put inside of it.

What I saw was a bluegreen flash and then it rained down in a burst as if a firework had exploded and was dropping to the ground.  My first reaction was that it was a firework maybe someone shooting off a late 4th of july shot.  But then I said to myself look how high that debree is falling from.  There was no firework ever shot that high up.  It appeared to come down somewhere to the west of Caddo Mills north of IH-30.  I had just dropped off my car pool buddy 2 miles prior to the event.  The next day at work I waited to see if he saw anything.  Sure enough he spoke 1st stating exactly what I saw, so I know it was no just seeing things.

In the south east direction (30 Deg above the horizon) I noticed a red light, pulsing very slowly. At first I thought it was a tower, but then I realized it was slowly moving.There were no other lights on the object other than the pulsing red. It seemed to be moving further south. I continued to watch it for about 2 minutes, then it was gone. It didn&apos;t just fade out, one moment it was there, then it was gone.I&apos;m a former Navy Aviation Technician and a fan of aviation in general. I know what to look for when describing planes, helos, and jets. This object looked so foreign and out of place to me. I called my 13 year old son to look in that direction and he found it.

At the time it looked like a flare as it was very brigh and did not diminish in size.  From my perspective it appeared to be moving downward on a slight angle.

It moved like a jelly fish and looked like it was plasma.I was thirteen, and at night I often liked to lay down in my front yard and observe the stars. One night, I did just so and noticed something weird in the sky. You can tell it was very far away, but it was huge. I would compare its size to two football fields. It was shaped like a triangle with one open end. More like a boomerang, but more narrow like a triangle. It was moving along sort of like a jelly fish swims. It looked like the sky was water, and it was swimming in it. It also looked more like an aligned trail of plasma lights. There was no metal; it just looked all like plasma. So anyway, I was lying in my driveway for about a minute just watching this thing, I couldn&rsquo;t get a picture even if I wanted to, it was too dark out and I didn&rsquo;t have a camera handy.

I then sat down beside her and after a few moments there appeared lights out side our window. Yvone ask, what are those. I answered they look like UFO&rsquo;s to me, and I opened the window wide so we could get a clearer view of a spectacle taking place in the sky.We saw 5 orbs each one looked exactly the same as all the others the were glowing the color of a soft pink similar to the color of the rising moon at night. The were all in a straight line of 5 round orbs or discs straight up into the sky. The were approximately 1, 500 feet away right over the Spokane Community College and were approximately 500 feet above the ground. Each one was moving in rotation around each other. This was a sight of beauty that reminded me later of looking down upon a group of square dancers. You know the doe, see, doe, and spin your partner type thing.The size of each of the 5 orbs or balls was the same, each was approximatly the size of a hot air baloon.There was no sound as they continued to circle around each other in the sky in front of our ring side seats. The speed of each rotation was a complete rotation took less than one second. After viewing this for about 5 seconds I decided to get a picture of this strange scene and rose up to find a camera. At the same time I ask Yvone to keep her eyes on the orbiting orbs. A few seconds later Yvone said they were no longer visible and described them all rising together at an angle to the right rather than straight up.

The thing that caught my eye was the fact that it was a bit larger than a star and a lot brighter. I&apos;ve seen this in the sky for the last few weeks, and I simply thought it was Jupiter or Venus or some other planet that I thought I had heard someone on TV talking about being in the night sky at this time in the year. Well, on this night and on the next, the &quot;star&quot; moved. I don&apos;t mean it moved a tiny bit, it really moved! If you hold your hand out at arm&apos;s length to measure the distance that it moved, it moved about 3-4 inches in any given direction. Sometimes it would perform a circle type movement, but most of the time it would just kind of &quot;float&quot; around, going from one side to the other, back and forth. I observed this for 40 minutes or so, until I could no longer see it (it seemed to sink in the sky as time went on). It would seem to be moving in a straight line at times, almost like it was deciding on a direction to take, and would travel in this straight line for a couple of inches (at arm&apos;s length) and then it would stop, only to move around aimlessly, without purpose again for a while. I&apos;m not sure how many points of light there were coming from the object, but at times it seemed to have more than one, maybe three or more. Maybe it was disk shaped, because at times it would dim as though the lights were turning away from my direction. There were no flashing lights of any color, only whitish light. I hope to see it again the next few nights to take a picture or video of it.(I have no camera, but my girlfriend does)", ".First of all i am a C2C listener for about 15 yrs.((name deleted)) i will just begin on what i saw.I wrote it all down and have gone over it and i can still see it fresh in my mind.Ok here it goes.Feb.11th 2009 5:40 am FTCKY.It was a very very windy morning at least 40 + knots and gusting.It was a typical morning drive to work about 58 miles oneway.On the last part of my drive 3.5 miles from state hwy.SR 79 i turn on Gate 10 road north,which takes me to my hanger at Sabre helicopter airfield.I am an A&amp;P aircraft technician.I work on U.S. Army helicopters,And N.G. helicopters,we modify them so they can go to the Middle East conflict.I have been doing this for about 30 yrs.Ok while i was driving on the back gate road i saw this very bright ball of light on my left or west of the road.This light was just coming up from the trees near a road called Oriental Village.On that road back is a area that has a urban town for the army to train in.It just hung there.....I thought it might be a helicopter with it,s landing light on....But no it was way to bright....plus there was a weather warning out because of the high winds.So nothing should be flying.What happend next convince me that this was not a conventional type of Aircraft.The ball of light started to move towards the high right NorthWest,as it did i could see the very fast moving clouds by its very bright light,and as it ascended into the clouds they filtered out the brightness and i could see the shape of the object....it was a perfect white ball and i watched it as it slowly faded out of sight.This whole ordeal lasted for about 2 minutes....my truck said 5:42 am.I was about a 1/4 mile from this object and made no sound just the wind beating on my truck. i wonder if Ft. Campbell tower pick this up on radar.Since no other Aircraft would be flying. i can not get this image out of my mind.What do i do next.....still shaking.Thank you for what you do.", "Green firball in sky, brighter than any star, li up, appeared then fell staight down behind trees, remained same color and brightnessGreen fireball light appeared in sky above tree line.

My mother was saying goodbye to her boyfriend outside because he worked for Newsday and was going to work.  My mothers boyfriend was at the end of my driveway (I heard this after the fact because I was still inside watching TV) and said come over here and take a look at this to my mother, when she came to the end of my driveway and looked into the sky where he was pointing she yelled &quot;Oh my god&quot; and ran inside to get me and screamed into the house &quot;((name deleted)) there is a UFO outside&quot; ((name deleted)) there is a UFO outside&quot;. Thinking that my mothers boyfriend had some prank in store for me when I went outside I followed her out the door she ran into the middle of the street where her boyfriend was now standing and when I reached the point where I can see it in the sky I was in awe.  It was a spaceship about the size of a football field hovering but moving very slowly to the right.  The ship made no sound and looked similar to the ship from close encounters of the 3rd kind. I saw the ship briefly because it was between two houses mine and my neighbors and it finally made its way between the trees and at that very moment my dog ran out the door that I left open and took off down the street.  My mother told me to get into the car and her boyfriend left in his car and we took off in the direction that the UFO would have been from where we saw it.  We traveled in the car and got as far as route 110 in farmingdale but we never seen the UFO again. My dog was in front of my house upon our return about an hour later.I went to school the next day, I was 16 at the time and told my story to my class in Science which was appropriate since my teacher was pretty &quot;out there&quot;.  I was laughed at from my class when a girl in my class who never spoke said &quot;Oh my god my mother saw the same thing last night and I thought she was crazy&quot;.  The girl lived on Prairie Lane two blocks over from my location on Chapel Lane. The class got pretty shocked and I felt validated in my class and started to say &quot;see I told ya&quot;.  After school I was walking home from school with my two friends telling them about my experience the night before and telling them about what happened in my class but still was continued to be made fun of.  My friend lived on Saddle Lane one block from where I lived and when I walked into my door my phone rang and it was my friend I just walked home with and he said &quot;first off don&apos;t tell me I told you so but my neighbor ran over to me when I got to my house telling me that his father seen a UFO last night with the same description as me and at the same time that it happened to me&quot;.  I told him I told you so and that is the last time anything has came from this story but it has changed my life.  One thing I can tell anyone reading this is that it wasn&apos;t a blimp, plane, or helicopter it was a spacecraft and if I had it on film it would be the best footage of a UFO ever captured by far.  For months after I stood at my driveway with my camcorder waiting for a return of the UFO but it never was seen again I am now 33 years old.", "UFO Sighted in Poole, Dorset EnglandIn October 1997 I threw a &apos;sickie&apos; from work.  We were moving house and I had loads of things to do.  About half way through the morning - about 10.30am I decided to telephone the selling agent.  My phone was on the window ledge at the front of the house, as all the furniture had been moved out - I rang the agent and when I finished the call I put the phone down .. I don&apos;t know why (but why not) I stood looking out of the window for a while and noticed a plane in the sky about, I don&apos;t know, maybe half a mile away, as I watched it it changed direction and came towards me.  I stood there watching because the way it did the turn was weird it kind of hooked round, like you&apos;d expect a helicopter to do, planes can&apos;t do that, but it didn&apos;t look anything like a helicopter.It came towards me (in England most of us live in roads where the houses are in rows, pretty much as in the US but the roads are nowhere near as wide - usually about 60&apos;) and glided across the row of houses directly opposite me about 4 feet above them.  Straight along the row - it was the weirdest thing that&apos;s ever happened to me, I knew when I was watching it that I&apos;d never convince anyone I saw this. It wasn&apos;t a plane or a helicopter, I watched it with my mouth open and tried to memorise it so I could draw it later - it was roughly 20 feet long (about the size of a semi-detached house) when it got to the bottom of the road it went behind some trees and just seemed to disappear.  It wasn&apos;t until it had gone I realised that it didn&apos;t make any sound at all - if it was a plane, or a helicopter - anything that could fly really it would have made a sound (bar a hang glider, but I know what that looks like and it wasn&apos;t one).I think about that thing every day but the only thing I can remember about it is that it was like a really high tech plane with a round &apos;saucer&apos; part hanging out of the bottom of it - I even got the impression that it was scanning the row of houses. When it glided past I looked to see if it had a cockpit .. it didn&apos;t. It was really shiny like silver aluminium.Has anybody else seen anything like this? I&apos;ve tried to draw the thing I saw but I&apos;m useless at drawing and it was so long ago now all I really remember is it being in two parts attached by a kind of arm at a right angle. From a distance it rather looked like a microlight airplane with something hanging underneath it.", "Spherical object hovers 20 feet above roadI observed a spherical object hovering 20 feet above the road and drove directly under the object(no sound). I viewed the object while driving about 40 mph and viewed it for  about 10 seconds from first sighting it, to passing under it. The object had no lights and was the size of a basketball. Curiously the street lights had been out. The object was not difficult to see since my headlights illuminated the area. The object (metallic) had a raised band around the middle and 3/4 of the way up it had what appeared to be a round port or eye. The object was positioned right near a power line that stretched  perpendicular to the road which was two lanes. This object seemed like some type of probe. This was kind of bone chilling when you see something that close! It is my opinion that an invasion is taking place. I have seen too many this past year, and continue to hear and read of many reports around the world.Coincidently, Florida, or at least my area, experiences a high number of power outages. One occurred in the State which made the news shortly after my sighting. It was reported as of unknown cause and was being investigated. My background is as follows. Served in the U.S. Air Force and hold an Aircraft Mechanic Certification.I have had many sightings occur since 1991. I made a report here once before from that year in Colorado. I see UFO&rsquo;s at least once every two months.My brother had a sighting shortly before I had mine. He is in Colorado and also served in the Air Force and made a report here.

The object darted suddenly up and down and sideways. There was red and green lights all around the base of the object, which flashed on and off. The object was moving extremely fast, and within a few minutes was within 40 ft. of my car. I look in total shock as I had a very clear view of the object, which looked like nothing Ive ever seen before. It stood in the sky maybe 75 ft. high and 40ft away from my car and just stayed there, totally silent.It looked made of metal, and was very shiny. It was weird shaped, and didnt look as if its huge size could fly, as there was no wings, like an airplane. Some white lights started to flash, brightly. I got out of my car and walked towards the object. I was within 25ft of it and it just stayed where it was. I knew at this time, it wasnt from Earth, but I felt no fear. Maybe 30 minutes passed as I stood there. Then all of a sudden it went straight up and enormous speed and went sideways and totally vanished within 5 seconds.As I drove away from the area, I looked into the other cars parked there with me, and saw very shocked faces inside. Later in my life, Ive seen many more sightings, but never saw this particular object again.I&apos;d be willing to take a lie detector test! I&apos;m also willing to be contacted by a researcher using email.I might also note, Im not sure of the actual date this sighting happened, as it was many years ago, but I&apos;ll never forget it!((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

There is a strange flashing light hovering and changing colors. It is in the sky still as we speak. Has moved slightly from where it was when me and my boyfriend first saw it. I thought there were two other, less bright blinking lights that created a triangle shape with the main light.

They were completely stationary.  While Visible for a half minute or so before actually driving underneath them, from a distance they looked more like bright stars, once below them however they were very detailed and were not bright like a star but had blinking red lights and triangle shape.  They did not appear to move one inch the entire 2 minutes I was looking at them from the time I approached, came up upon, and drove below the craft. The one craft was approx 2000 - 3000 Feet in the air, and further removed from being directly over the freeway.  The other one was lower 1000 &ndash; 2000 feet in the air, almost directly over the freeway, and the lights were extremely bright and red on the lower one.  They were approx 300-500 yards apart from each other.  There seemed to be three (3) overly bright red lights at one of the points on the triangle, and less bright ones at the other points.  Since I was driving and only could see the bottom of the black triangle I can not describe the top obviously.  I noticed a couple other cars in front of me on the freeway swerve so they must have been looking at this too.  Unfortunately, it is impossible to take a picture while driving since this is too much of a distraction and safety risk behind the wheel; however I am sort of kicking myself for not pulling to the shoulder and taking a hundred pictures with my iphone.  If I see them again I most certainly will.  This is the second time in one month that I have seen these craft in almost the exact same spot.

Three other people in my house joined me in looking at this object.  It was pulsing and changed colors, which was visible with the naked eye.  We started looking at it with binoculars, and could see more details. It was rotating and appeared to have four smaller lights inside. There were a couple of airplanes that passed by in the time that we were looking at it, and it appeared to be about 20 times bigger than the planes.  A point of reference that we had was a tower on Camano Island that has a red flashing light, and is about 120 ft. tall.

As we drove down the winding hills to our home, our eyes were glued to the sky.  I don&apos;t know how I drove.  When we arrived at our long driveway, the object separated into two glowing objects which were changing their shapes slightly, but were definitely separating.  They then rejoined and shot down in a straight line toward the earth, resembling an elevator; a glowing elevator. We were stopped in our driveway at this point.  As we drove closer to the garage, the object seemed to shoot off a small saucer-shaped, also orange neon and glowing in the same fashion, object which moved very rapidly toward Doylestown Airport which was behind our backyard, lined with trees.  At the same time, the large ship shot off into the distance and was absolutely gone in a second, it seemed. At this point, my daughter and I were in shock; I told her to get my husband because I knew he would never believe it.  I remained outside alone for several seconds, and the small glowing ship was now hovering behind the trees, practically close enough to the ground to say it could have even landed.  I felt that it was watching me. When my daughter and husband came outside, my husband saw it and didn&apos;t know what to make of it, but told us to get in the house immediately. We had a movie camera with my daughter&apos;s school project on it, and we began filming this orange light from our kitchen window.  The orange light and its movement was captured on film, also as it darted away into the distance very rapidly.  Although my husband did not see what we like to refer to as the &quot;mother ship,&quot; he did, at least, see the smaller &quot;saucer,&quot; which, however, was nothing compared to the large object.  My daugh! ter and I knew from that day forward that this was of another world.  I tried calling the police department, the airports, news stations, etc., the following morning, but there were no reports.  We were left feeling that this was a very personal experience.  From other reports that I read, it doesn&apos;t seem as if anyone has ever seen this type of UFO. The most similar report that I can associate it with is that which the airforce men saw way back while flying; I believe that was a huge orange neon long ship as well.  There is even more to tell, but I need to know if you would like to hear the rest? Even more intriguing.  If I were alone that night, I would have admitted myself to Bellevue.

There were several potted plants on the front porch that we were taking to the cemetery. While I was loading the trunk of the car my wife was attracted to a moving object in the sky. She told me to look at it, but I have hearing problems and did not hear her. She said it was a cylindrical shaped object with a bulge in the center. Why she did not insist on me looking at it I do not understand because I could have easily obtained photos at that time. The object was vertical and she could not determine the altitude. It was moving slowly from the north. It did not have a glow at this point. We entered our car and left for the cemetery.We were driving east on East Luzerne avenue in Larksville, PA.  Coordinates (41&deg;16&rsquo;27.52&rdquo;N) by (75&deg;55&rsquo;07.68&rdquo;W) (Our location) I looked to my left through the open window and saw a flying object and immediately told my wife to look at it. It appeared to be 20&rsquo; in length and was cylindrical in shape and moving horizontally. That is when she told me that she saw the vertical object in the sky when we were in our front yard.It was bright silver (unpainted like shinny stainless steel) and had no visible windows, doors or wings although it seemed a little wider at the back and less in the front and had some contour. It was silent and was traveling at about 50 mph. Very slow for a craft this size to stay aloft.There was a blue white circular glow at the rear of the object that was twice the diameter of the craft being so bright you could not tell were the craft ended. The glow looked as if the sun was hitting a mirror and reflecting at us, the only apparent means of propulsion.It appeared to be 200 ft high at this point and descending. It was between us and a small mountain range. The elevation of the northern horizon at that point is 340m and our elevation was 215m. The distance to the horizon from our location was approximately 800 meters. I could see the detail of the craft clearly and at our line of sight it was slightly above the horizon so I estimate the distance of the craft to be 200m or less.It was traveling east and was obscured by the trees for several seconds At this point I believe it was no more than 100 ft. above the ground. It reappeared about &frac12; miles away. It flew over the boroughs of Larksville, Courtdale, Luzerne, Forty Fort, and due east until it was out of sight. The last thing being visible was the bright glow.The total time of this sighting was approximately ten minutes.Co-ordinates and some elevations were obtained by using Google earth.", "red ball splits in 2 then joins  back together over middle drove glastonbury england 1998on 21st august 1998, i was living on a travellers site middle drove ,glastonbury ,england. when a disc shaped red /orange object started to come towards myself and then partner,at about 8 or 9pm.as it moved forward it also seemed to move gentley from side to side,suddenly as it got about 60 yards away ,and about 50 feet in the air,it split into 2 . whilst still moving forwards at a very slow pace,the then 2 disc shaped objects travelled about another 30 yards towards us,and at this point the 2 disc,balls joined back together. i then went to tell my friend keeping my eyes on the object,as i knocked on his caravan door ,the object was overhead there was no sound,as he opened the door the object took off at incredible speed towards the tor untill out of view,ive never reported this sighting untill now.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I was passing the municiple airport, and saw an object hovering, only 20 feet above a 1 story house, which sat right next to a large subdivision of about 400 homes. Object was less than 1 mile from airport. I drove towards it, in my truck. When I got within 500 feet, I turned my lights off and drove, staring at this object. I came within 300 feet when I realized it made absolutely no sound. It rose about 30 feet, then took off towards the northwest sky and dissapeared in seconds. All without a sound. Object had three lights on the bottom. Red,green,blue. Thought it was a chopper at first. But why hover silenlty, 20 feet over a house, and then take off from a dead stop, to out of sight in 3 seconds? Sonic booms are common in this area, but this was silent.", "Many star like objects fly in formation then blink out as they fly toward coastIt was a clear night. I was going next door to give my girl friend the phone. A helicopter seemed to be flying out of the area when I looked east over the hill and I saw what looked like three bright lights forming a triangle directly above the hill. The lights were bright and they seemed to be rising in the sky.I called people from inside my house and next door to come look, that is when one after another the lights began to break off and fly west towards the coast. Once they fly over the population it seemed the lights went out and red and blue lights replaced them with white flashing ones. They were able to stop on a dime and change direction and made no noise and we hear helicopters and planes just fine.After three of the lights did this then hovered lingered and crossed over and under one another out at the coast, three more came over the hill. This continued for almost an hour. I have no idea what I saw, I know that where I live does not have nearly as much air traffic as was going on that night. We got some video but it was taken with a shaken hand. After all the lights flew out to the coast that was the end of the night&rsquo;s excitement. I did not have any binoculars only a Sony cybershot camera.", "Crescent shaped object travels through night sky near Boulder.I was driving home from works when I saw an odd shape race across the sky.  I had time to say, &quot;Oh my God...&quot; fairly calmly before it was gone.  The shape was a bit of a crescent, at an angle to myself and my car.  It was not moving towards me, and not heading at a steep angle towards the ground.  It simply moved across the sky.  There was a brighter light at the front, a dimmer one above and an even dimmer one below the brightest.  They were the color of bright embers and did not flicker or blink.  There was also no tale.  The object seemed large, if I had looked at the end of my thumbnail and held it against the sky with my elbow a bit bent, it would have just covered the object.I&apos;m not certain if this is related or not, but my cell-phone reception has been rubbish ever since even in places it was perfect before.", "Luminous blue Cloud-Orb spotted over the Sky area of Buffalo NY from Columbus, OH same time as crash of AircraftFriday Feb. 13th, 2009  Reporting a UFO  I went out onto the North facing back porch last night&hellip;it was 10:08 PM, therebouts..looked at a cloudless sky, seen a &lsquo;luminous Blue Cloud&rsquo; in a direction of 110 degrees N-North East from my position.

Her home is located in the central Denver area in the 80204 zip code.  As we were preparing to enter her home, she mentioned that the stronger than normal winds that the Denver metro area experienced had cleared the pollution and made the stars appear brighter.   As she mentioned the clearer night sky, we looked up, initially to the south.   As we looked up, a brighter light caught our attention approaching from the southeast moving towards the northwest.   The light initially appeared to be a shooting star, but was not as vibrant as a star and not moving as rapid as a shooting star either.   As the light moved over our heads heading towards the northwest, it appeared to be not just one light, but a group of about six lights in the shape of the letter V, or very similar to birds flying in a group.  The shape of the V formation was not perfectly symmetrical like you would see from lights on the tips of a commercial airplane.It took approximately 20 seconds for the lights to appear and to move out of sight towards the northwest.   The lights were not as bright as the lights that are on a commercial airplane.  In addition, there was absolutely no sound.   If these lights were coming from a jet or a commercial airplane, it would have to make sound moving at that speed which it did not.  Also, the lights were moving below the clouds in the sky as the clouds did not impede the lights as they moved across the sky.  The lights continued to move towards the northwest until they were no longer visible leaving no sound.", "3 slowly moving objects in a triangle form.So I was walking my friend out to the car and I was on my way back to the porch when I noticed 3 lights in the sky in a perfect triangle form.  I thought it was just bright stars at first but when I watched them closely, I noticed they where moving closer and closer slowly. So I sat there and watched them until all of a sudden 1 disappears.  A few minutes later another one disappears.  And finally as the last one got close enough, I could see 2 small lights spinning around the big one.  But as soon as I saw that it kind of faded away very fast and shot off in the opposite direction as it faded and disappeared.  I didn&rsquo;t know what to think because it was the first time I ever saw anything like that.", "Strange bright pulsating light in the skyI saw some strange lights last night on my way home from the basketball game. It looked like one flashing beacon light on a tower at first but it then it tracked across the sky like there was five of the same flashing light in a row. Then in an instant it was one again just pulsating in the same spot. Then in a quick instant it was on the other side of the highway far from where it was the first time in a stationary position not moving. It was so fast I didn&apos;t even see it move to its new location. It was just there. It was to fast to be any type of aircraft. Very strange and not sure what It was. I got off the ramp and looked back and it was still there in its new spot just flashing away. It was around 11 PM. I might add that it was on a night where the temps were below 10 degrees and we were getting a light snow so the sky was cloud covered. The object was very bright and constantly pulsating. When I first saw it I thought it was a beacon light on a cell tower but I drive this way every day and there is no towers where I saw the light which is why I watched it so close. It was so bright it stood out on a snowy night. This all happened over Moraine State park. It was so odd to see I was asking myself did it really just do what I thought it did?", "Unexplained Lights in the sky over Long Beach, CAI have been viewing the object for over 1 hour now, From my Balcony in Long Beach, CA.It appears to be a round object very bright and changing colors in a pulsing motion.

Can the movement of a satellite be seen by the human eye?  The reason I&rsquo;m asking is that I&rsquo;ve been seeing lights moving in the night sky.I may think that it&rsquo;s satellites, until Friday night, where we observed, two lights moving in the same line, though the light coming from behind suddenly became bright, and then dimmed out though staying on the same course.Does this make any sense?((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

We became lost for two to three hours down a rural country roads in or around Swanton OH.  As we were driving I noticed lights within the trees which were brighter than normal house lights but I paid no mind thinking it was a house or cabin.   Approx two hundred yards from the trees we came across a corn field at which time my sister&apos;s friend slammed on the brakes and said ,&quot; What is THAT?&quot;   As I looked I noticed aprrox 25 yards away from the road was two story house with a large barn and a combine and approx ten to twenty feet above the house was an object shaped like a football beaming different color lights.  We immediately stopped and starred in disbelief as we tried to figure out what we were looking at.  In my mind, I ruled out all known hovering vehicles such as blimps or helicopters.  This football shaped object made no noise, created no wind, and was approx half the size of the house.  We all became terrorified as my sister&apos;s friend drove slowly passed the house.  I looked to my right and noticed a State Trooper parked with no lights also watching the object.  At that time, my sister&apos;s friend did the quarter mile in what seemed like ten seconds.  I told her to slow down because of the Trooper.  As we slowed I looked out the back window of the car and saw three identical object approx five hundred yards behind us which was ten to twenty feet over electrical wires in formation moving slowly across the road.I have told few people of this story and the people I have told do not believe the me or poke fun.  My sister who is now a devote Christian denies these events.  I was sixteen years old at the time.  Since then I have served four years in the Marine Corps in a line unit, flown and seen many helicopters, and witnessed many things in the military.  However, with all that I have experienced I know what I saw that night.  I know this was not a helicopter because helicopters while stationary cause enormous down drafts, in fact hurricane force winds.  I&apos;m not saying it was little green men from Mars, it was by definition UFO&apos;s.  I was not amazed or awestruck by the objects, only frightened at something I could not identify or explain.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

The worst part was, I think I saw a light come Out of it!! I don&apos;t think I saw a human being sucked up, but I think it was an animal of some sort.(We were by a pet store).

I hope I could help.", "First off, the first night my girlfriend and I were fishing in a stone quarry and it was time to go.  Right before we started to pack up to leave we heard this bone chilling cry behind us.  When I say &ldquo;bone chilling&rdquo; is was not a cry of anything I have ever heard of before on this planet.  It was loud and long.  I will never forget what it sounded like.  We both JUMPED UP!  It was just starting to get dark,  just a minute after the sun set.  We were around twenty feet off the side of my jeep.  There was a dirt bream about another 30 feet past the jeep.  It was slightly wooded with quite a bit of brush.  I shined my flashlight at where the sound came from.  What we saw in the reflection of the light I also will never forget.  These two large eyes were looking right at us.  They had a green/orange fluorescent look to them and were oval, pinched at the ends and slightly sloping down at the centers.  Then it howled again.  We could see the outline of its mouth in its eyes. It had a fairly large mouth.  We watched it for 20 seconds or so longer then all of a sudden it vanished.  Then as fast as the ambient light from my flashlight could move it would reappear.  And it howled again.  It moved a couple more times and howled a couple of more times.  It could move through the brush and the trees SSSOOO  Fast!  I could move around 40-60 feet as fast as my flashlight could move its beam of light.  It would move within a &frac12; second of one spot to another.  We were pretty freaked out by this time.  I turned all my fishing poles around so the reels were extended outward incase I had to start beating something over the head.  We scrambled to my jeep and got the hell out of there as fast as we could.  My girlfriend cried for hours after that because she was so freaked out.The next day my buddy and I went back there so I could do some investigating and see if I could find anything that would help explain what the creature was.  We eventually called it the (Waubonsee Monster) because we saw it out by the waubonsee college.  Any way I didn&apos;t find anything.  No footprints, broken branches- Nothing!  I couldn&apos;t figure how anything could move through the brush and scrub that fast.  How anything could move that fast anywhere.   Well going forward.My buddy and I started fishing again for a little while.  We packed our stuff up again and started to walk towards my jeep up a slight hill.  When we got to the clearing by the jeep, where there was also a clearing that opened up to a corn field.  We both stopped in our tracks and coming at us from across the corn field just about 10-15 feet above treetop level was some craft that had quite a few lights on it.  It also had some sort of spot light that it shined right on us for about 2 seconds.  Then it made a 90 degree turn and zipped out of there Very! Very! Fast.The craft did not have any sound what so ever.  You can imagine how quiet a small stone quarry is at sunset.  Well this craft was one hundred percent soundless.  Even gliders have some kind of sound and we could have heard a pin drop 200 yards away it was that quiet out.One or other of the events would have been pretty exceptional.  But to have them happen in two consecutive nights is really pretty profound.I truly believe that what we saw the first night was some type of extraterrestrial.  I know it was not any creature of this earth.  And then the next night to see the craft in the same location.  Pretty neat!!!!!!!!!! I don&apos;t know too many people who can say that they have actually seen an extraterrestrial and a UFO like I have.   Well that my story.

For some odd reason, there was not one car in sight.  My husband casually said, &quot;Well, would you look at that, an unidentified flying object&quot;.  I looked up to the northeast, and what we saw appeared to be about 2 miles away, black, and cigar shaped.  I said to him that I thought it was an airplane.  He asked me just what kind of plane did I know that looked like that.  Just as soon as he said that, the object flew instantly towards us and now was not even a quarter mile away in the sky.  It changed shape, still black, but looked like liquid metal.  It became egg-shaped and was very shiny, however, the sun was blocked by solid cloud cover, so I didn&apos;t make sense that the object was reflecting light.  It hovered in the same spot for about 15 seconds, then, with amazing speed, shot straight to the east and stopped instantly, hovering over the middle school.  I was now heading east in my car to get closer to it.  I traveled two city blocks, looking straight at the object.  When I became close, approximately 1/2 city block, it again shot off straight east and disappeared from sight.  My husband and I racked out brains trying to figure out what it could have been.  We have never seen anything move that fast, stop to hover just as fast, change shape, you name it.  It had no windows, no landing gear, nothing.  It just looked like a black and metallic, with a liquid mercury appearance.

I was about 14 or 15 years old had been on a date with a young man I met at a church retreat. It was my first car date.  I was hugging the door knob I was so shy.  On the way back near Ann Arbor we saw a disc shaped object at about tree line maybe 100 yards away.  It was probably 40 - 50 feet across.  It was shiny light grey and had lights around it. Maybe even windows.   We sat in the car and wondered what the heck it was.  We were listening to the news on the radio, probably an Ann Arbor station... and they said a UFO had been sighted in the Ann Arbor area.  We peeled out of there so fast.  Because it was before I was driving, I wasn&apos;t paying attention to roads and have no idea exactly where we were.  I remember scooting to the middle of the car.The odd thing is that it took me years to remember it again. I thought people would make fun of me.  I can&apos;t even remember telling my Mom about it when I came home.  Now I think about it a lot.  I hear about people sighting &quot;lights in the sky&quot; and calling it a UFO sighting and think mine was huge compared to that.  There were lots of UFO sightings in the Ann Arbor area and they were always &quot;swamp gas&quot;.  This was no swamp gas.  But I can&apos;t find a record of a sighting in the 1961, 1962 or 1963 timeframe in this area.  Lots in 1965.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I saw a single slow moving oval UFO moving North towards Cairo, Illinois. The speed was compared to an airliner at high altitude. There were two lanes of white clouds ahead of this object. The clearly defined oval edges had a cloud like reflective color. This craft moved into the first lane of clouds. Thinking it would appear in seconds into the open space between the clouds. It did not do so, and I did watch that area for some minutes. Nothing!  Two weeks later a Sacramento, California Open Lines caller to Coast to Coast AM&apos;s George Noory.

I thought nothing more about it until, having parked my car in my garage in Lindfield and walking across the back garden towards the house, I looked up and saw, almost directly above me, an orange glowing object (much the same as I had seen a few minutes previously) moving fairly rapidly roughly on a course of 080deg(T). At first I thought it was an aircraft except that the orange glow was more like a spent firework, there was no sound and no navigation lights. My next thought was that it was the ISS or a satellite. The ISS was ruled out by its appearance and the lateness of the hour and its angular movement appeared to be too fast for a satellite as well as being too large and the wrong colour. I was still trying to decide what the object was when another one appeared, exactly on the same course as the second (and, as far as I can tell, the first). On this occasion I went out of my garden gate into the adjacent road in order to keep the object in sight for longer. The night sky was completely clear and cloudless and there was complete silence. The object continued on a dead straight course towards the east and gradually faded from view as it became more distant. I waited for several minutes but did not see any further unusual airborne activity. I am 63 years of age, in good physical health and on the occasion of the sightings, totally sober. I have been employed as a pilot since the age of 18, first as a fast-jet pilot in the RAF and later as a captain with a British airline.  I estimate that the height of the objects was between 1000ft and 5000ft mainly because my first sighting in the car would not have been possible had they been very much higher or lower (assuming they were on the same course). They could have been conventional aircraft except that they were totally silent and also displaying no anti-collision or navigation lights, just a dull orange glow. The speed is very difficult to judge without knowing the height and size but if they had been at 3000ft they would have been travelling at around 250-350 kts.", "Three incidents that happened to me in the White Mountains.My friend and I were hiking to Tuckerman&apos;s Ravine on Mt. Washington late at night in 1967. We were both 17 and still in High School.   I decided to rest on a very large rock and drink some wine. We were laying on our backs looking up at the stars when my friend said, &quot;look at that star moving across the sky&quot;.  I  said, &quot;That must be the satellite echo, the one covered with a reflective surface.&quot;  Then my friend started stuttering which was a complete surprise to me.  He said &quot;Tha tha that&apos;s no satellite, it&apos;s reading my mind.  Then I connected also and it flashed a great big &quot;Hello&quot; like in lights in my brain, and then it shot off toward the moon and disappeared into a speck and then gone.  It&apos;s possible that we were abducted because I can&apos;t remember anything about the trip after that except driving home.  There are two more incidents connected to this.  One happened 7 years earlier in 1960 when I was 10 years old.  This time my family was with me, my father, brother and mother. Hiking from the top of Mt. Washington to Mt. Adams, I became very ill and had a 104 degree temperature. When we finally made it to the Mt. Adams hut, I was burning up. My mother asked everyone at the hut if they were a doctor. One couple told her, &quot;We are not doctors, but we can heal your son&quot;. She said &quot;OK&quot; and brought them to me in the mens dorm. They explained to her what they were going to do. &quot;We are going to put our hands on your son&apos;s chest and remove the fever.&quot; The woman put her hands on my chest and the man put his hands on her elbows. Immediately they started to withdraw from the burning heat that drained out of my chest. The man said to the women, &quot;Did you burn your fingers?&quot; She said &quot;yes&quot; and I could see her fingers were bright red. I felt completely better immediately. My mother took my temperature and it was back to 98.6. My mother will vouch that all this happened. My brother and father didn&apos;t see it and didn&apos;t believe it. We learned later that this couple belonged to the Atherious Society. The next incide! nt happe ned seven years after the second incident, which was listed first. , when I was 24. Again, I was hiking to the Mt. Adams hut, this time with my 17 year old cousin. We wanted to go to the top of Mt. Adams first, but there was a large man completely covered in rain gear and all you could see were his eyeballs. He was standing at the base of the trail to the top and he roughly told us we couldn&apos;t hike up there because of the bad weather. It was windy, but it wasn&apos;t very cold and it was a bright sunny day. I could see a lot of people coming down from the top. We were a little annoyed but decided to take his advice and take the short cut to the Mt. Adams hut. When we were about 50 feet away, something lifted us up in the air about 4 feet and layed us on the ground gently on our backs. I looked back, but the man was gone. I was sure he had done this to us.  Again, I don&apos;t remember discussing this at the time and ever again with my cousin. A few years later, I wrote to Betty Hill after Barney had died. I told her about these incidents and I got a wonderful letter back from her.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

She took couple of pictures with my digital camera a total of nine pictures.Between these pictures 6th and 7th picture had some object above the bridge.  We noticed it few days later when going through the pictures.  It definitely looks like something new and it is not an aircraft shape.  It was gone within few seconds as we checked the time on the camera.  Pictures were taken from 23:08 ~ 23:11 and two pictures that were taken at 23:09 had UFO object in it.

My sighting was of an unexplainable, nighttime aerial phenomenon that took place in 1987, San Juan Capistrano, California.I lived in a large house at the time, not far from the ocean, and while sitting in the living room facing a very large picture window that faced a sparsely lit, dark expanse of hills and custom homes, a streak of yellow light shot from somewhere overhead and angled downward, across the frame of view afforded by the window.The &ldquo;beam&rdquo; of light was essentially a brilliant ribbon of considerable size, flat rather than vertical, utterly silent, that shot across the sky and ended with a sudden, but not particularly bright flash. Rather than the shower of sparks and arcing trails of debris that one would have expected from such a display, the event was more notable for its lack of detail or fancy after-effects.The explosive spikes of light that radiated from the center of the explosion, if it was indeed an explosion at all, showed no signs of gravitational arcs, as if residual remnants were falling to earth. After viewing many modern videos of meteors, bolides, and returning space junk, the light event I witnessed bore no resemblance whatsoever to any of the aforementioned displays.As an amateur astronomer, and a consummate skeptic, I have always believed the phenomenon I witnessed to be some type of high-altitude bolide, a midair, exploding meteor with its own unique characteristics separate from more typical meteors and meteorite strikes.I further supposed that no two bolides should be identical in how they might appear to different observers, thus the lack on my part of any immediate need to report anything. Over the years, however, and especially recently, it has grown apparent that such a sighting as I experienced, should be recorded regardless of how unimportant I may believe it to be, or not to be.One last description of the seeming physicality of this &ldquo;object&rdquo; as it streaked across a very dark sky, is the peculiar fact that, as said before, it possessed no detail. I mean this quite literally. The ribbon, as I call it, was entirely uniform in structure, in color, brightness and shape, with no irregularities as would be expected by a completely natural event. It was as if a stripe of solid yellow, similar to a painted highway lane marker, zoomed across my field of view, then came to an abrupt stop as it &ldquo;popped&rdquo; and faded into the darkness. It all happened very fast. The stripe also bore its own perspective, meaning I could tell that it was nearest when directly overhead, and that as it trailed off, grew narrow, like train tracks leading off into the distance. Thus the object traveled some distance further before terminating or destructing.This was the strangest thing I have ever seen, and has never been repeated. For what it&rsquo;s worth, please add this odd little anecdotal tale to the pile, where it can find some meaning, perhaps, for those who truly care about such things.", "Silver oval craft seen near Electra, TexasConditions: Clear, 50 deg. F Time: 4:28 pm Location: Wilbarger Co., Texas  I was driving home from work SE bound on US HWY 287 about 3 miles NW of Electra, Texas, when I saw a very bright shiny ovoid shape back to the south (right side of HWY). I&apos;d guess it to be about 0.5 miles away and maybe 2-3 thousand ft. high. The craft was hovering in place but as soon as I locked my gaze on it, it fell with dazzling speed towards the ground at about a 45 degree angle. Then it completely disappeared. I don&apos;t mean moved out of sight, I mean it was like someone switched off a light bulb! It flat out disappeared!  As I was watching, it suddenly reappeared est. 1/4 mile north from where it disappeared, now flying slowly at about 1000 ft. off the ground back across the left side of the highway heading due north, it then fizzled and sparked (electrical short?) and completely disappeared again. I&apos;d say the first sighting lasted about 4 seconds and the last maybe 2 seconds. I never saw it again.This was very, very strange! I know it was no airplane, weather balloon, or space debris because of the controlled movements and the disappearance/reappearance. Other planes were flying, leaving plain vapor trails, this left no vapor trail at all.", "line of 4 balls of light three white and one red seen for 10 seconds moving straight across skyI was standing in my driveway a few years ago (hence the guessed date) when I looked up and saw the UFO. It was a line of four balls of light.  The first three were white and the last one was red. They were moving across the sky in a southeast direction as I faced to the southwest. They were almost directly overhead at about a 75 degree angle.  They moved together as if connected as one craft and the balls of light were touching like this OOOO.  They didn&apos;t blink or anything, just moved in a straight line.

I looked up to see a ringed object seemingly tumbling or darting in and out of cloud cover. I stopped at the corner of Esplanade and Topaz Street to look up and see the vehicle perform maneuvers for about 10 minutes. It appeared to be a solid object, with a ring of blue white light around the outside. Occasionally some small strobes were visible as it tumbled and moved back and forth laterally. It appeared to be somewhere over Esplanade and Pacific Coast Highway. There was no sound whatsoever and the object rotated and tumbled about for several minutes.

It includes a lot of details that you might find interesting or useful, so I will include everything instead of typing a new report. I just heard that there was a report on San Diego Local News within the last few 3 days of people reporting the same sighting.Monday Febuary 23rd 2009  I swear to you on my life Yas&apos;...this is all true....This is how it happened....It was about 1:10 am...I went out onto the back deck to call in my cat. She didn&apos;t appear. I sat down in my usual spot and lit a cigarette to wait for her. As I looked back up I saw three little red lights way off in the distance. Jets I thought. We live right in the middle of the flight path for San Diego Airport, so I watch the incoming jets lined up in the distance 20 or 30 miles away when it&apos;s clear. Which it was this night. No clouds. But I quickly noticed that there was something different about these lights.They weren&apos;t staggered like planes lining up for their landing approach which I I&apos;ve seen thousands of times in my life and watched out here for the last month and 1/2 everynight. Next I&apos;m like, but the Airport is closed. It&apos;s been closed for at least an hour. No incoming or outgoing flights until 6:00 am. So I&apos;m thinking smaller private planes..? Military Jets.? Why are the lights not flashing like ALL jets and planes do..with red lights on the right wing and green on the left. These are just red. Constant ..No flash at all. And they are coming closer, but they are still all together like in a pattern. They were getting brighter and bigger, but they were moving much slower than any planes..Taking way longer to get to where they should be in the landing path.Helicopters..?  They are getting closer and it&apos;s starting to hit me that I may be seeing something very strange.By now I&apos;m standing up going saying out loud to myself...What the hell are those ? And they just kept coming still way off maybe 10 miles or more..But defenitely coming straight towards me. It was getting weirder by the second as they kept approaching.Then I slipped in the door and grabbed the binoculars.Is it a blimp..? Some kind of balloon. It was defenitely not an aircraft, helicopter or anything like that. It was coming right up over the top of the mountain ridge on the other side of the valley. And it was then I really started to kinda freak out..not really, but more like excited...what was it.... I came back out on the deck and I put the binoculars up to my eyes and focused. What I saw made my jaw drop. It was Huge..I mean the size of a Football field.One more second and that was it..Everything suddenly clicked in my brain... I had logically ruled out every possible explanation. It was a UFO.My mind had no doubt at that point. I was seeing a &quot;real&quot; UFO. I was wittnessing what they call a &quot;sighting&quot;. I knew I had never seen anything like this in my life and then I realised it was one soild object. A triangle. It was perfectly visible now and moving slow...floating no sound..It just hit me..NO Sound at all.  Oh my God. I was in shock. Through the binoculars it was very clear and I could now see the defenite shape of a triangle and just then it started to turn slightly and I could see the red lights..one on the nose and two on the rear tips. A giant silent floating triangle. I couldn&apos;t beleive what I was seeing...but yet I really did..I knew.I kept staring in amazement..And the it rotated even more and swung around completly where I could see it from the side. It was incredible.! Then it just stopped..and hung there and I focused the binoculars on it again and I could cleary see the outline of the triangle. barely visible..but it was defenitely there..It was slightly brighter than the sky behind it, but it blended in so well you had to really look closely to see it. Oh my God ! Picture..I gotta get a picture...!  By now I had been watching it for at least 7 minutes or more...It just hung there..almost motionless...completly silent...Like I said it was giant...three times the size of even our largest Jumbo Jets...Bigger than the Damm Space Shuttle..My mind was racing now...I was afraid to walk away and grab the camera in case it did someting or took off...But I made my move...Boom I dashed in the house..snatched my Mom&apos;s camera and ran back out..10 seconds....Still there...! I turned on the camera and started to take the shot, but the display menu was on the screen and in the viewfinder and it wouldn&apos;t shoot...Damm it..! I kept messing with it with one eye on the lights...I could not get it to work..I tried for two more minute I&apos;d say and then I gave up....And went back to staring through the binoculars...It was absoultely stunning. My brain is racing a million miles an hour.... With thoughts like........Is anyone else seeing this...? Can I be the only one in this entire valley that is seeing this...? Should I call someone..?...who...? 911...? the news station..?...Someone has to see this....God why is the camera stuck..I am standing here looking at a UFO just hanging in the sky and I can&apos;t get a picture..Who is gonna beleive this..?   Mom...!  I have to wake her up...I start to go inside to wake her up...What if it&apos;s gone by the time she gets out here...? She is gonna think I have lost my mind or I am drunk or on drugs or something...Anything except seeing a UFO....! Oh well..I have to take a chance it will still be here...it&apos;s been here this long and with no sign of moving..I hesitated only a few seconds more and made my move...she can make the camera work...! It&apos;s her camera.!...Boom..I ran.....Ten seconds I am upstairs at her door pounding Mom Get Up..! Mom..! Wake up.....!  She answers starteled from her sleep...Jeffrey what is it....?  Whats wrong..?     I hear her getting up...Outside....Look out the window..!  She says while frantically getting dressed, Whatis it...?   I don&apos;t know I said....Lights..Red Lights...We gotta get a picture....!   She gets to her window and looks out I guess and says ...&quot;Jeffrey those lights are on the Road  across the hill&quot;...I had already started back downstairs and was yelling..&quot;Get down here..Hurry..You gotta see this and the damm camera won&apos;t work...!  I hear &quot;my step father&quot;grumbling in the background....&quot;What the Hell is going on ?&quot;.... I hollared back at him..Get up _____, get out here quick...get your camera..your not gonna beleive this thing...! I was gone  In less than a minute I was back out and I looked up praying it was still there. It was. Same spot. Just &quot;hovering&quot; there..effortlessly.I go back to the binoculars...It is mesmerizing. A few seconds later and Mom is beside me...Still not sure what I&apos;m seeing....She looks out and says again..&quot;my name&quot;...&quot;Those lights are on the hill over there&quot;  Kinda pointing across the valley off to her right .....I say No Mom...Up there..In the Sky......and point as I handed her the binoculars.  She puts them up to her eyes and fixes on the lights.....I waited for what I knew was coming.....Oh My God.!...Jeffrey..What is that ?  It&apos;s a UFO Mom...&quot;There is no doubt in my mind&quot;. Look at that thing...the size of it. She already knew I was right. It was undeniable. It can be nothing other than a UFO.She just keeps staring going...&quot;Oh My God...It&apos;s unbeleivable...&quot;  I start pointing out all the details...No sound...the outline..telling her to look really close and keep the binoculars very still. She could see it all perfectly..She was astonished. I could still see it fine with just fine without the binoculars.  &quot;We gotta get a picture Mom...Fix the camera...I practically hand to pry the binoculars out of her hand and handed her the camera.. She turned it back on and waited for it to set, but it did the same thing..and she kept messing with it but it wouldn&apos;t take a shot. It just kept getting stuck.And I knew it wasn&apos;t going to. I was frantic to get a photo and yelled for &quot;My step father&quot; again a few seconds later he was there. Still half asleep ..going &quot;What the Hell you guys...&quot;.....We just pointed...and I handed him the binoculars. All the while, Mom is still fumbling with her camera, looking up and down still shocked. Then it&apos;s ---&quot;his&quot;--- turn..After he looks at it for a few seconds....Same thing...&quot;Oh My God&quot;...That is a UFO ____...!..Look how big it is..!  We said something like Yes...Yes..Get your camera ----------This one is stuck...Another minute of mumbling words and staring at it in awe and he hands Mom the binoculars and takes off for his camera.I was pissed that I don&apos;t have one right now, except for on my phone, and that would not have shown up so far away. Even with their cameras it might not show up very well but I think it should be visible and it could be some kind of proof. Mom and I just keep staring and I tell how it appeared and everything. We were both still toatally stunned. What a sight. We were so excited and were convinced it was very real. Our eyes couldn&apos;t lie to us.By now it had been over 15 minutes since I first saw it. ______ comes back with his camera, and gets ready to shoot....But of course...It goes dead....He turns it back on...Boom...It shuts down again...Dead battery...We are all frustrated...Damm It.I don&apos;t know what is more unbeleivable..A UFO hanging in the sky in front of us or that we have two cameras that won&apos;t work....I can&apos;t beleive we can&apos;t get a picture...Another couple minutes and we realized that neither camera was going to work and we were disappointed, but still excited.We talked about calling 911...the police...fire department...But we just kept staring.I am serious Baby...It was truly Fantastic..I wish you could have been here to see it yourself.Then as we continued taking turns with the binoculars, It started to move again. We all said something...It began to turn it&apos;s nose back toward the direction it had came from go sideways..the it suddenly pulled up until it became completely vertical...straight up and down like it was standing on it&apos;s tail end with it&apos;s nose pointing straight up in the sky. It stopped there for a few seconds, and then it flipped around and went back leveled out facing the direction it had appeared from and hovered there again. To see it turn like that we all knew that anything we have that flys in the sky can not make those manuevers...especially without making a sound....We watched...eyes wide open..fascinated....But what happened next was the most incredible part of the whole thing and left us almost speechless..It slowly began to disappear...one light at a time....what looked like the &quot;front light&quot; slowly dimmed out...It wasn&apos;t moving away though like the way it approached. It was actually vanishing....the 1st light...then the 2nd and then the 3rd...it took about 30 seconds to disappear.And it was gone just like that. It wasn&apos;t like it moved far away or went up or anything..it completly vanished right in mid air.We talked about the whole thing for about 45 minutes...All kinds of ideasand questions...what it was...what it wasn&apos;t...why was it here...did anyone else see it or report it..get a picture or video.....Is it possible for us to be the only people to see it....On and on.....We turned on the news and went through the local channels..Nothing....We said we should report it..but to who..?...the police..and what would they do...Laugh..Probably take the report and throw it away..thats it.So I said I would go on the internet and find a UFO &quot;Hotline&quot; or something and make a report and see if anyone else made any reports also.About an half an hour after it had gone I looked out my window and saw several small planes flying around the area which was wierd that late at night..They flew around the area for a while and they flew off. I went back to the internet and a few hours later the next thing I knew it was 6:00 and the sun was coming up. Then I heard jets... Military jets...they were blazing around all over up there going around in a sort of big circle. This went on for about half an hour and then fly off away. They defenitely looked like they were looking for something. I&apos;m pretty sure I know what it was..!  As of now I have not found any peports from that night, but I haven&apos;t looked yet today..But I will. Someone had to have seen it too.  What an experience Yas&apos;. I&apos;m not kidding Babe it was straight out of a movie scene...but undeniably real.Thank God I woke Mom and _______  up and we all saw it together...Otherwise they would probably beleive I saw something..but that it was something more explainable than a UFO. But we all agree it wasn&apos;t.I am 100% positive in my mind that it was some kind of &quot;Craft&quot;...Who was inside it is the big question. Extraterrestrials...?or was it the military testing a secret &quot;spacecraft&quot; which we supposedly crashed in Roswell New Mexico back in the 1947and we learned how to work and used the technology to build our own &quot;Ships&quot;. All that goes on about 600 miles or so from San Diego in Nevada at the militarys most secretive base called Area 51. People claim they have all kinds of strange &quot;spacecraft&quot; out there.Who really knows. Why would they fly anything down here in San Diego..? I personally don&apos;t think it was &quot;us&quot; flying that thing.I beleive it was defenitely extraterrestrial in origin. We are wondering if it will appear again.....sometimes &quot;sightings&quot; as they call them happen alot in clusters in the same area over a short period of time.....it&apos;s possible.and I&apos;m ready with a camera that works..just in case... I doubt it.  But we&apos;ll be keeping our eyes on the sky around here thats for sure.......I stayed up last night to see if it would return...It didn&apos;t. I could go on and on about all the details but I&apos;ll stop for now.and write more later.Pretty wild huh Babe !?! I&apos;ll tell you one thing...It was defenitely an experience that none of us will ever forget as long as we live.", "Strange lights above the highway on a stormy night.While driving w/b on Highway 160 out of Las Vegas I saw 2 lights ahead which I thought may have been landing lights on an aircraft.  It was very windy and the sky was completely overcast with low clouds.  As I drove nearer it was apparent the lights, which looked like white globes, were either stationary or moving very slowly above the highway, and they appeared to move apart as I closed with them.  As I passed beneath them, 6 very dim white lights became visible; four in a diamond shape between the globes (closer to the right globe than the left) and then two placed equally distant trailing west.  Unlike the two bright lights, the light from the smaller six looked indirectly lit, like distant windows appear in the nighttime.  The lights were then blocked from view as we passed beneath them.  My wife was with me but was not in the least interested and paid no attention to either me or the lights. Also, on the drive back to Tecopa I was astonished to find my night vision was restored--the halos I&apos;d become used to seeing around oncoming headlights were gone and I could actually see the road ahead as headlights passed. It only lasted a week or so, but man was that a great thing.  I don&apos;t know for sure that it was associated with whatever it was I saw in the sky, but I do know that my vision immediately after I saw the lights was a whole lot better than before.I can submit a sketch of the lights&apos; configuration on request, IF I can figure out how to load it into this computer.", "Bright light in sky over PictonI was on the front porch with my wife about 20:15hrs.

On my way home i saw something running in zig-zags from one side of the road to the other at unhuman speeds. After that it was gone, the next year in school in my photo class me and my friend got to talking about aliens and such and he told me a pretty terrifying story. Well he used to live in Huntington Park and there are fields throughout the park where there are playgrounds and such. Him and one of his friends saw lights flashing in the sky and heard a siren sounds(similar to police). They were shooting fireworks towards the lights in the sky, all of a sudden they look up and saw this thing standing about 60 yards or so from where they were. He said it had long straggly hair, long fingers, and long arms. All of a sudden it started running towards them with it&apos;s arms going in a circular motion and ran the 60 yards in about 3 secs. As soon as they saw it start running they ran into my friends house locked the front door(doorknob and padlock)and their garage where the main door was connected to. They then ran into his bedroom but forgot to shut the door, they were scarred to death, they then argued to who was going to shut the bedroom door he lost and got up to shut it. He then heard all the locks coming undone extremely fast, then the door opened heard it walk into the house. Then heard something glass breaking, and heard the door slam. He shut the door and they stayed awake all night. In the morning his mom asked him why was there a broken bowl in the kitchen, he told her it wasn&apos;t them but didn&apos;t bother telling her the story because she wouldn&apos;t have believed them. After he told me this story i was like no way and told him my experience and we came to the conclusion it was the same type of being running at the extreme speeds that no human would be capable of. if you&apos;ve had ne thing similar contact me Rbreeze001 @ student . monroecc . edu without the spaces between @ and .", "several objects seen over Central Orange County  (Santa Ana College Area)I reported something similar on 01-05-2006. This afternoon I was at lunch and about 12:15 I happened to look up and saw it again, at very high altitude this bright white object hovering for several minutes right at the top of the sky (90 degrees)  it hovered in place for about 15 minutes then suddenly it released some smaller objects, (about fifteen in total) and as they started to drop, they formed a  V formation and began to move at high speed towards northern orange county.  The original object started to move in a north-east direction.  It took fifteen to 20 minutes to slowly move about 2-3 miles in that northeasterly direction.During this time at a much higher altitude there was another object that had a very reflective surface as it would shimmer with the sunlight (it was not white like the first one, but actually reflected the sunlight).  This object was way much higher than the first one ( it was barely visible to the naked eye), and it stayed in place throughout all the time that the other object did its maneuvers. eventually after 20 minutes or so, I lost track of those two bright objects.  I am going to take my digital camera tomorrow to see if I can catch them again and see If I can take some pictures of them.  I am a county employee and I am college educated. I have studied astronomy and I can tell a star from a planet from an airplane at high altitude.  these were not planes or a mickey mouse balloon, and not seagulls either.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

I was too bright and low to be a star and there was many lights grouped together I thought that was weird.  Then I had noticed it had started to rise like it was almost hovering over my neighbor&rsquo;s house.  I had noted to my mom there was something like a plane in the sky she didn&rsquo;t seem to care so I checked it out myself.At first I ran to the window and watched it move slowly over the trees until I couldn&rsquo;t see it any more.  At this point I ran outside to my porch to get a better look.  It flew lower than an average plane and was quite quiet.  It had the high drone like that of a jet, but again it wasn&rsquo;t loud my mom noted that she couldn&rsquo;t hear it while she was inside.  I have helicopters that come over my house that transport people from hospital to hospital and they fly pretty low but not that low and are considerably noisy.As I watched it come over my house I noted that its bottom was in the shape of a diamond, and there were four white lights, one in each corner.  The light at the tail end was flashing a white while there was two smaller lights on either side.  Once it was more in front of me it looked liked the top of it was like a balloon, it was like the jiffy pop popcorn the kind that you put on the stove and watch it puff up.It took around two minutes to pass from my neighbor&rsquo;s house till it was out of my side.  It moved to the North West, West coming from the North East.", "A bright, big circular object over Folsom, CaliforniaI was taking out the trash at my job when i looked up in the sky and saw a very bright circular flying object.  It was very close to the ground to be a plane and was moving at speeds that were unthinkable.  It was brighter than a full moon and about half the size.  It flew over me then stopped in mid-air.  It waited for 15 seconds, then abruptly moved very fast to the left.  It floated for another 10 seconds and then miraculously the light when dark.  It vanished just like that.-Another thing i found odd was i was in a back parking lot with only two cars in it and when the object disappeared both of the car alarms went off without any outside interference.", "Mysterious light growing brighter then ascending then dissapearing.I was standing outside, smoking, when I noticed a bright orange ball of light. I at first thought it was a planet because of how bright it was and since it wasn&rsquo;t moving.  The light then became brighter and seem to expand then dimed.  I was looking east-southeast just above the horizon.After it dimed it started moving very slowly to the &quot;right&quot; or south. I then wondered if it was maybe a large jet turning and possibly reflecting light. Then it began to ascend at, what looked like, a 40 or 45 degree angle then after a few seconds it faded out!  I have to say I&rsquo;ve always kept an open mind but have been skeptical not having seen one myself.  I&rsquo;m willing to hear anything  that may explain what I seen because I&rsquo;m a bit stunned. I understand the laws of science and it did not seem to fit anything that I have ever seen before.", "very bright light with tail, traveled slowly, about 5,000 feet in the air, was NOT comet.Around July, 2007, It was a very calm day without any kind of cloud insight. The sun was already pre-setting. Me, my mother, and sister were outside enjoying the afternoon, we live on a lake and we had a long dock to go with it. My mother and sister, were in front of the house as I started jogging down a hill towards my dock. I happened to look in the sky and I saw a very bright circular light with a tail. Now I know what a comet looks like, and this was something I never seen before, I stopped dead in my tracks and gazed at the light. It started to go out of my view, I ran to the end of my dock and it was still their, this light looked as if traveled very slowly as if a airplane high off the ground and it made no noise. But I assumed the light was about 5,000 ft. in the air, the light looked like it had a high force of light, almost like a car light 150 yards away in the dark. I yelled at my family to come and see this but as soon as I turned around the light vanished and was nowhere to be seen.", "Black object over Wenatchee, WA.Being the sky watcher that I am, at Approximately 4 pm (I do not know the exact time) I noticed what appeared to be a very large bird up in the sky. I ran into the house and called my family out. As we watched it, it began morphing and changing shapes. We then agreed at this point  that it was not a bird. My Brother In Law ran to his car and got his binoculars out to try and get a better look. By the time we got it into sight it has risen up considerably and he mentioned that it  looked like 2 parachutes connected together but was still changing shapes. The only problem with that theory, is that this object, like I said was rising up (not down like a parachute) as it moved East. The thing that really struck me was that it was &quot;SO&quot; black in color, in a way, blacker than the color black truly is. I also want to note that my Brother in Law is with the Air Force and he estimated that the object was at 10,000 feet. Towards the end of the sighting as he continued to observe with the binoculars he said that the object split into 2 possibly 3 before it disappeared from sight. He is a cut and dry Military person and this event really shook him up.", "Saw a streaking object for only a few seconds, travelling too fast to be a bird or small engine plane.I happened to see a streaking object in the sky travelling East.  The sun was hitting it, but it was very low in the sky and moving too fast for a bird or small engine plane. I only saw the object for a few seconds and then it disappeared from view behind a mountain area.  It could have been a shooting star, but as it was still very light out, that seemed implausible.", "Franklin County, Union, Missouri at Hwy 50 and Prairie Dell Rd, WalMartMy dates are not exact, I apologize for that, but I can narrow it down to a 3 year window when my oldest daughter was 12-15 years old, she will be 23 this year. This sighting occured between approximately 6-7 pm, in broad daylight, as I was stopped at the stoplight on Hwy 50 (in front of Wal Mart and across the Hwy from East Central College), several cars in front of me, several behind me. I was Eastbound headed toward I-44, and while stopped at the light, I noticed the cars stopped Westbound, looking at something to my left. I looked to my left, I remember having to turn my head quite far - practically over my left shoulder, and hovering approximately 20 ft over the trees was a massive object. The exact location at the time had a large barn and silo on it, but is now a strip mall of shops - directly west (to the left if you are facing the front of it) of wal mart.The object appeared to be 20+ feet high, 50 to 60 feet wide, and it was matte mettalic looking, grey/silver in color. Solid in appearance, with no distinguishable lights or windows. The object appeared to be motionless, and made no audible sound that we could hear. The best way to give a visual is this: Take a stainless steel dogs food/water bowl, and turn it upside down. This hovering object was wider at the top, slightly narrower at the bottom.As I recall, it took several seconds for my brain to process what I was seeing, as it wasn&apos;t necessarily scary looking, it was more of a &quot;what the ****?&quot; reaction, more alarmed than frightened. I turned to look at my daughter in the front passenger seat - she was leaning forward and towards me, looking out my driver side window at the object, with her mouth hanging open. I remember saying &quot;you see it too?&quot;, to which she replied with a nod of her head indicating &quot;Yes&quot;. I had the presence of mind to glance around at the other vehicles, the traffic light had turned green and no one moved, we were all looking at the object. I looked back at the object and stared at it for what seemed like maybe 1 minute more, and I promise as God is my witness, it &quot;disappeared&quot;.  My daughter&apos;s interpretation of it is the same. One second it was there, and the next, gone. No dramatic flight at high speed was witnessed, just the analogy that it seemed to vanish in the blink of an eye.The craziest thing of all, looking back on it now, is that there had to be at least 6 cars that I noticed, whose occupants were looking at the same thing we were, and none of us acknowledged to each other what we had just seen. I checked the local newspapers for months after the incident, hoping for some validation, but could find none. My husband said that if I wouldn&apos;t report it out of fear of being labeled a psycho-nutcase, what made me think anyone else would report it? He had a point. Anyway, I plan on checking back here from time to time, to see if anyone else comes forward.I would like to point out that I see that there IS another report on here that sounds like a family saw the same type of object in almost the exact location, except their experience occured in 2004. I held my breath when I saw &quot;Union&quot; and &quot;Wal Mart&quot;! I hope more people &quot;google&quot; their experience, as I just did, and find this site. After all of these years, reading about the other Union Wal Mart sighting report gives me the validation that I have been searching for, for many years. THANK YOU!!

I look up the stars in the sky when i smoke quite often.  I noticed an extremely large triangular shaped craft pass over us and eventually disapper over over and behind the treeline.  Because it was so large it appeared to be moving slower than it was.  It had white lights at each corner, and one inbetween each corner light.  They were dimmed out.  It appeared that the craft was in blackout mode. It made no noise whatsoever. There is no way possible it was a conventional or military aircraft.  Earlier in the day I noticed A-10 warthog jets flying around.  A few minutes after my sighting i saw them again.  I served in the military and know their sounds and characteristics like the back of my hand.  I also believe these are the aircraft that the person saw from the other sighting from North Coventry on this site.  I believe it was from december.

I am on the  north shore of Orcas island  in Washington state and there is very little light pollution here, and the light is to the west/southwest. I, We thought it was a planet at first because we can see planets quite clearly from here at different times of the year. But as far as we know there is no planet suppose to be in that location now.  The light also seemed to travel to the north and up from the horizon line, then slowly within the 2 hour time frame it moved back south and down tward the horizon line.  I called my daughter who lives in Bremerton WA, and asked her if she could see it and she said &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and we watched it together while talking on the phone for about 15 minutes. During that time it got brighter and dimmer over and over again. It seemed to be generating it&rsquo;s own light not reflecting light from somewhere else.  There was no real significant flight path, it didn&rsquo;t travel anywhere, just moved in the same general area for the whole time it was visible. At about 20:30 it dimmed out completely and we thought it was gone, but shortly there after it was back again, it continued to dim out and come back over and over , I took some video, but it is very poor quality and just shows light dimming and brightening, in the distance.

The last sighting was last night around 6:45 pm. We were driving west on McKinley ave in Fresno CA on our way to a meeting. We noticed 4 hovering objects at a stand still on each side of our car about 3 miles up in the sky when we were at a red light. Once our car started moving they moved along side us, every time we stopped they stopped. They all looked alike and did not look like helicopters and not planes. Later on in the evening on the way back home we spotted another craft similar to the ones earlier just hovering at a stand still above the houses in our neighborhood. the object even brightened its lights from red to super bright white. it was still for about 3 minutes then slowly started to move to the right, then left then it either vanished or we just did not catch it take off. This is not the first time we have seen these objects in the sky. we seen larger ones the size of two commercial planes before. We just find it strange that the sightings have not stopped. Our children, my parents friends and my mother in law have all witnessed them. For some strange reason these objects have not gone away and seem to be growing by the numbers each day and showing themselves pretty boldly.

We 1st spotted 2 white lights through the trees.  About 1/8 of a mile or less away. These 2 lights were just above the tree level.  It was a cloudy night with snow coming down.  We were in the interior of the remote 30 mile wide Drummond island in Michigan`s upper peninsula. With a low cloud ceiling and snowing lightly. We would never expect to see aircraft in the area.  The lights were white-white with the left one being about 2 times in size as the right light.They appeared to be like a tower light not blinking. I first thought it was a plane that was passing by slow and low. They seemed to be moving in the direction we were going maybe slower than the speed we were going, 40 to 50 mph. I could see both lights horizontal.  15 seconds after spotting them they stayed spaced the same distance but started moving left.  After a move to the left the object banked more to the left and I could plainly see its oval shape with one side facing me lighted on the edge. The light around the edges can only be described as like a woman&rsquo;s ring that has baguettes set in the band. I could see it was lighted all around the outside edge as it turned up sideways.Its movement was not anything I have ever seen in 51 years. This very quickly got right out of sight in what looked like a rolling motion not like a horizontal movement. For just a couple quick seconds it kind of looked like a kid&rsquo;s sparkler when you make circles without the sparks.  As soon as it was visible as the oval shape to me it very quickly went straight away out of sight. I saw it as an oval shape for about 4 or 5 seconds. We stopped right away a couple hundred feet down the trail. We both said, did you see that?  I said, I did but my family member said he did not see it leave as an oval or circle shape.  We went a short way farther &frac12; mile and stopped in a more clear area. My nephew 41 years old did not want to hear what I had to say about the shape I saw as it quickly shot away.  I am telling you on my mother&rsquo;s grave this was nothing short of the truth.My nephew also said there was a collision of a couple satellites and it could have been falling debris. I got the creeps and looked over my shoulder all the way back to the lodge.  It still makes me shiver as I write this.  All I can say is I am glad it went away from us not toward us.

That is when they spotted a large round light in the northwest section of Tucson.  They called me and I drove 10 miles out into the desert to join them.  We had a wonderful view, as the area was dark and on a hill.The object was large, round and had a white light.  The light would very in color, from white to brilliant white.  It would also change from round to a horizontal oval shape.The appeared to be at least 6 objects that came from it.  These were smaller and reddish in color.  They would circle around and then go back to the main craft or light.  This happened several times.At least twice, a reddish light came from the object to the ground.  There were also two other white shears, but they appeared smaller.  At one point one of the smaller white one appeared to land and take off in a few minutes.  This continued for at least 6 hours.At one point a white light came from the object towards us.  At that point my daughter panicked and ran to the house.  At times there were light that went from the smaller red objects back to the large white one. On the bottom of the large object, there also appeared to be red, blue and green light.I have no doubt that I saw the same object; to the southeast of the same location I was at, about two weeks ago.  It also stayed in the same spot for hours.  There was one other incident of one of the smaller red light much closer to the house, but my daughter is too afraid to talk to anyone about that.The objects could not be seen from the area of Marana I live in, which is right across the street from the City Hall, but could be easily seen from out in the desert slightly northeast of here.", "Invisible aircraftIt was about 7:30 AM on the morning of the 15th of December, so the sun was just coming up and I was on the west-side of our building just looking up at the moon (I have become a pretty avid sky-watcher as of late and when you are alone it is just kind of enjoyable to look at the stars and moon etc.) and all of a sudden there were four lights just popped into the sky. They were in formation and equidistant from one another. They were flickering like what I would call afterburners on a jet from behind but there was nothing there. The only thing you could see is the four lights and they stayed exactly the same as it traversed from North to South right over us here. I watched thinking maybe I was looking at some birds that were reflecting the early morning sun, but then I saw a bird fly by and it looked totally different. These lights went South for about 20 seconds, not really fast but at a steady rate until they just poofed out of existence. I am absolutely certain that what I saw was not a natural phenomenon. It was four lights attached to something that was apparently invisible. Yesterday here in Denver Colorado it was a record cold day and I was actually wondering if maybe it was something we have built with some kind of new stealth technology but because of how cold it was out the exhaust was unable to be hidden.One last comment is that whatever I saw was close enough to me for me to notice that is made absolutely NO SOUND. I am going to watch with my camera in hand when I go outside from now on just in case I see it again I can photograph it for analysis. Oh, and another thing, I usually do not go outside at that time so maybe I had not ever seen it before because of the timing so I am going to go out at the same time again for a while to see if I can catch it. I will update with photo if I do get so lucky as to see it again. As of today I have not seen anything like it again.", "Light-distortion moved methodically across San Francisco Bay to above Treasure Island, dropped, returned along same path.3 of us were sitting on a rock outcropping with a good view of San Francisco after dinner. Persons 2 and 3 were busy discussing classes. Person 1 noticed a strange shimmering that seemed to appear in front of the Golden Gate Bridge, after which it began to move south. As it passed in front of the city lights, the lights in a small spherical area would become distorted (brighter and wavering), and return to normal as the object moved farther left in the field of view. Person 1 pointed the object out to Persons 2 and 3, neither of whom could pick out the object until Person 1 told them to look at the TransAmerica Tower and told them exactly as the object passed in front. They then all followed the object with their eyes as it continued to move slowly southward over the Bay. The object stopped directly above the island that cuts the Bay Bridge in half (Treasure Island I think it&apos;s called?), and we lost sight of it as it dropped directly down and out of our line of sight to the buildings (again slowly). We started talking excitedly about what we had seen before Person 1 again noticed the object; it had risen back up to roughly the point from which it started its descent. The object then returned along the same path it originally took. As it came in front of the Golden Gate Bridge again, it began to shrink rapidly and move slowly upwards in our field of vision until it no longer distorted the Golden Gate Bridge lights. It seemed to be moving away from us at this point, but we could be wrong as well; we could not, after all, see the object, but only the circular pattern of distorted light.

I didn&rsquo;t think anything of it at first I even mentioned calmly to my girlfriend  I wonder what that light is?  As we kept driving that far light happened to have gotten a lot closer all of a sudden to where we were able to see more definition of the light and began questioning this light, and started trying to follow it. We saw it for a few seconds before trees and houses began getting in the way of our site of the object. So I proceeded to turn right into State St. heading in the direction that the light appeared to be going.  I made a right onto smerber Rd and saw the light again in the Northeast direction, the light was definitely round but I wasn&rsquo;t close enough to see the actual object, I only saw the light it was generating. After the second time we didn&rsquo;t see it anymore.  The UFO appeared to be moving northeast and getting lower because houses and the mountain in the area began to get in the way of my girlfriend and my vision.  I am convinced that I saw a UFO,  I just wanted to get closer to see more Which was really hard at the speed it was moving and the landscape in that area that is really hilly which can block ones vision.", "Large, saucer-shaped object with three bright lights flying very fast and low to the groundI went outside at 7:23 to give back a hat that had been left in my car to one of my friends, who was sitting in another car facing mine with another one of my friends, who was driving. I could not find my car keys, so I was using the spare keys to open the car. I was unable to open my car and after trying several times, one of my friends in the other car came out to help me. She was immediately able to open the car door and I got the hat from the car and gave it to her.As I was walking from my car to my friend&rsquo;s car to say goodbye, I noticed a unusual object in the sky. I pointed it out to my friend, who was standing a few feet away from me at the time, and asked her what she thought it was. She said she did not know, but that it was flying very low. The object we saw shaped like a saucer, and it was flying at around a 30&deg; angle to the ground. We could see there were lights at the bottom of it, arranged in a pattern I have never seen on an airplane or helicopter &ndash; there were three bright lights (one was orange/red, the other blue, and the third white/yellow) that were very large placed around the circumference of the aircraft. The lights were not beams; they did not illuminate the ground.Some other characteristics of the aircraft that made us sure it was nothing we were familiar with was the speed and agility with which it moved, the UFO seemed to glide through the air at a very high speed without making a sound. It also looked much larger than any plane or helicopter flying at that distance. But the most unusual part of this sighting came when, more or less 45 seconds after first noticing it, the object passed behind a house. We waited around five seconds for it to come out from the other side of the house, but the object didn&rsquo;t appear. I then started to run down the street to see if I could see it at a different angle, but it was clear the aircraft was no longer there. It was then that we were clear on the fact we had just witnessed a UFO.", "Hovered- Colored lights went out- sped away -left trailThis was a long time ago, but it is still fresh in my mind. I saw a red and green light over the mountain where there is a christmas star that is turned on for the holiday.  Upon driving north on rout 171 in Simpson Pa, I saw the red light move over the highway.  I drove over the bridge going home and saw a number of cars onthe side of the road.  There was at least 10 people watching this.  I stopped and got out of my car, we were all watching the lights moving over the road.  The lights stopped and they hovered for about 2 minutes.  Then the red and green lights went out and a bright white appered inthe middle and sped off.  It left a trail of white light behind it, because is moved so fast.

She pointed out a strange light near this red blinking airplane light thing.  Anyways, the light color was a goldish yellow I guess.  Perhaps the color of a star or something.  I thought it might be another light like the airplane one then remembered, they didn&apos;t put up any new lights!  So we watched this light in the sky as we were driving and it didn&apos;t move.  Didn&apos;t do anything!  But it was weird.  The size was to large to be a star or planet, and it was to close to the ground. It was just a strange light.Every night since then I look out my windows at the red light to see if the other light is there.

We stop the car and stand there looking at a very large craft (maybe the length of 10 or 12 cars end to end). The color is flat gray. There are two spotlights on the underside of the craft toward the front. They are sweeping the ground back and forth with light. We see one porthole like window toward the front of the craft. From our vantage point on the ground we see nothing but bland ceiling. There is a light on inside the craft (the window is illuminated). In our youthful excitement the three of us start running through the underbrush to get under the craft. The fourth is in the car screaming.  Before we make it the craft vanishes.  There was no sound, no wind.  Just gone. No one believed us. We saw it for several minutes it was huge.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It had to be really big because it was extremely high in the sky, yet you could still see it in wonderful detail, such as its lit-up windowsp windows.  Although round, the object also had depth to it.  A certain height to it.  Around and around there were rotating lights or windows. The lights or windows that lit up were square in shape, and they rotated and spun super fast, flashing many colors. It hovered and spun for several minutes and then it flew off in a flash and simply disappeared.  The UFO was silent.  No sound. I did not feel afraid of this craft, but I did of the triangular one I also just reported tonight on your website.  My father, however, felt very afraid. I will never forget what it looked like because it was unlike anything I have ever seen or expect to see again in my lifetime.

The saucer was clearly visable in the sky and was rocking back and forth left to right approximately a saucer width or 1.5 saucer widths to each side.  After staring at the object for approximately 15 seconds the saucer disappeared in a streak of light heading towards the east.

My tour is the night shift 10p to 6a. I wrote down on a note pad as it was happening so the details of what I wrote here are accurate. On 2/17/2009 at 20:47 I was driving to work on Route 80 east in New Jersey when I noticed a group of RED lights up in front and to the left of me. My first thought was radio tower lights, but these didn&rsquo;t blink.. I then noticed as many as 6 or more cars pulled over on the right shoulder. As I slowed down I seen the drivers of the cars looking in the direction of the lights. Were I pulled over was highway marker 40.5 east bound about ten feet in front of me. Searching a internet map service, I determined I was facing EAST, slightly SOUTH. Sitting still on the highways shoulder I could tell that these nine (9) lights were not moving. They were bright solid red. In a pattern of what I could best describe as a bent letter H. Four (4) slightly curved to the right to make the left side of an H. Two (2) across, but a little higher than the middle as the line of an H, and Three (3) lights slightly curved to the right as the left side of the H. My estimate of their hight was later determined by the cloud formations that night.Altocumulus clouds stay between 6&apos;500 and 20,000 feet. Theses lights were just under the clouds, to a point that the right side of the H patterns 2 lights seemed as if they were slowly pulsing. They were simply going in and out of the cloud formation as the clouds moved. I took a photo 20:48 with my cell phone but it just looks black on the phones screen. I am keeping the photo to open latter on my PC. I called my son at 20:48 to tell him what I was looking at, and yes I did get the (can you see little green men in the windows) attitude. Mind you there was no body structure, just the lights. As I was talking to him a Jet plane passed from South to North (right to left). Clearly saw the planes flashing lights on both wings, which told me he was banked an turning. He was about an inch in length and clearly visible. (Not sure how far away a jet is that looks an inch in length to the naked eye). Newark Airport is close by. As the plane passed under the lights, just to the hight of the lowest light. I would say that the RED lights were closer to me. I then yelled to the two men standing out side of their car if they knew what we were looking at. They were just as puzzled as I was.In searching the internet, my best guess as to the location of these lights is over Boonton Town Reservoir, New Jersey.  Being late for work I left the area and lost sight of the lights at first.  I caught them again just after the 43 mil marker.  They were to my right side of the windshield top, only now in a wavy line of eight (8) across and one (1) was half the distance to the ground below and centered on the line.  Just sitting there.  I lost them as I drove and looked at my clock and it was 21:12.

It was only in one direction and one place, it wasn&apos;t the whole sky like when lighting strikes.My boyfriend, while on the phone with me said, &quot;((deleted))&quot;, at the same time I did. He was looking out his bedroom window and saw a horizonal cigar shaped blue object appear and disappear within seconds. He said by the looks of it, it seemed to be about a few miles away, which would be adjectent to where I was driving.Also, upon sharing the story with other friends they too said that they saw the sky light up blue while driving about 12 miles from where I was driving at the time of the sighting. They also said the sky lit up bright blue and then went away.Another friend living about 35 miles from where I was driving saw the sky light up too.  He also said it lasted only seconds and was just a part of the sky not the whole thing.These sightings all happened at the same exact time during the night, at about 12:30 a.m. on Saturday Febuary 14th, 2009.

At first I thought it was a star, then it started to bounce/hover closer to the coast.  My next guess was that it was some sort of satellite?  But what type of large, bright, satellite would be that close to LAX?  It would be a danger to the planes coming and going.  I am not sure what it was, all I know is what I saw.  What I saw was not a star, not a plane/chopper, not a satellite, nor was it a flare, as I have seen flares in the past.

As we walked through the parking lot, I glanced up at the sky as I usually do.  I first noted Venus, then turned to look at Orion (roughly to the East) and said &quot;Look, Orion!&quot; (typical behaviour for me). To the left upper side of the constellation, I noticed a very bright star that didn&apos;t seem to belong there, but I shrugged it off and  turned to get into the car, when my boyfriend, who was still looking up at the sky said &quot;A UFO!&quot;  I turned back to see that the white dot of light that I&apos;d first mistaken for a bright star was slowly moving downward through the field of the Orion constellation. The light zigzagged slightly as it moved downward and toward the left.  The lack of blinking and coloured lights, as well as the pattern of movement made both my boyfriend and myself remark that it couldn&apos;t be a place.  The light was also far too small/far away to be a helicoptor. After about a minute or less, the light had reached the area right below the constellation, when it began to dim until it had disappeared entirely.  We waited a bit to see if it would return, then got into the car.  As we were exiting the parking lot, I looked up toward Orion again, and this time I did see an airplane traveling northeast, though I doubt that was related.

When I looked where he was pointing in the sky sure enough, I saw it myself.  This was in broad daylight.  It was just above the clouds over the Mid-Hudson-Bridge in the southwest sky.  I would say about the same height as the cumulus clouds.  It stood still for abound 1 to 2 minutes, then suddenly flipped on its side.It was visible as heck.  The Sun shown a reflection off the craft and it was unmistakable.  It seemed to have a small dome on top.  Then it flipped parallel again to the horizon.  Stood there for quite a few seconds, then suddenly took off, faster than the human eye could trace.  It was metallic and shiny.  There is no doubt in our minds even today of what we witnessed.  To this day I know we witnessed something beyond this Earth.  I just wish I did not wait so long to report this.

As we admired the clear cool October sky, stars clear, moon bright and vivid, one of my family members pointed north just above the trees and said,&quot;look at that plane, its flying just above the trees&quot;. Everyone&apos;s attention focused on the flickering lights as they appoached, no one spoke another word as we were all trying to bring into focus an airplane. That never happened and so no one spoke because no one knew what it was, even after it passed over. The craft took a long time to arrive. I would estimate about 1 minute passed from the time we first saw it until the time it arrived over my Gradfathers&apos; house because it was moving so slow.  It was shaped like a plate, 3 times the size of my Grandfathers house, with strobe lights that went all the way around the craft changing from white around most of the craft to red, white, then red again before starting back to white.  As if 2 lights in the rear were red seperated by one pulse of white, then back to white all the way around the rest of the craft very rapidly.  The craft was solid and the moonlight made the top of the craft appear a blue/white color and moved slowly and rose a bit to clear the higher ground and trees to the south of us over my aunt&apos;s house.  The craft was completely silent and was flying so slow I thought it would fall out of the sky on top of us at any moment.  That was my biggest fear at the time.  That it might just fall on us.  It was so big and slow. I have the benefit of having my parents and relatives there.  We discuss it occassionally and re-confirm what we all saw for our own edification and satisfaction.

I think it was before Holloween in 1966, she disagrees.  I think my time is correct because I remember giving my book report to my class before the holidays and that spring of 1967  I was silent about UFOs because of the reaction I received.As a boy I had followed the US space program and knew I had seen nothing like this in my life up to that point or since.In 2004, while serving as a Police Advisor for the Department of State in Iraq, I met a gentleman who was a retired Air Force Officer and told him my childhood experience and he laughed and said I know exactly what you saw.  He called it the Lenticular Re-entry Device.  He told me it was a round craft, powered by electricity generated by a nuclear power plant with a crew of 5.  He said it remains classified to this day because of the power plant.  He told me the craft was an experimental craft that carried a crew of 5 and was capable of carrying 2 nulear ordinance weapons and could acheive low earth orbit up to 200,000 feet.  He drew mw a picture of it and it was similar but no way to say for sure it was the same thing I saw.I remember vividly the experience and the experience there after as I did my next book report at school on the subject of UFOs and what I learned was ridicule comes fast for having seen something extrodinary that no one else had seen.  I haven&apos;t spoke with many about it since then but those that were there with me at the time and the exception of others who have shared similar experiences as I had.I carry a camera with me everywhere and have for years now hoping that by chance I catch another glimpse of such an object and snap a photo but no such luck so far.

When it became purple, the size of the object got smaller and then after some adjusting of the camera it then got big and had a shape of a ship. The ship was like a saucer but had a orangish/brown plasma below it and with my camera holding still, it moved across the screen at 70x zoom.

I don&apos;t remember the exact day. I decided to go get a hair cut. So I borrowed my Mom&apos;s car and headed out. It was between 7-8 in the evening. It was dark too. The first thing I noticed as I was driving along was the unusual amount of lights in the sky. There were a number of planes or helicopters all over, but not close enough for me to hear or identify them.As I traveled west on Sycamore in Pasadena, TX, I came to T interesection and stop sign at Beltway 8. I believe its called E Sam Houston Parkway now. Back then it was not a toll road. I looked to my left and saw the traffic was stopped down at the Spencer Hwy intersection. I turned right and headed north. Almost immediately I looked over to my left and saw something that grabbed my attention.About a hundred yards across Beltway 8 from my location (I measured it on Google Earth) there is a field with 2 bill boards on the north and south side. Hovering above the field was a large black shape. It was between the bill boards (at least appeared to be so). It had no lights on it. I slowed down to almost a complete stop, turned off the radio, and rolled down the window. There was no sound coming from the object.I should have stopped the car and gotten out so I could get a really good look, but I was so surprised I didn&apos;t really think about it. Within a minute from me sighting the &quot;craft&quot; it began to slowly ascend into the sky. It was quite large, but I could not see any detail because it was blacked out. I am not sure if it was a &quot;saucer&quot; shape or not since I was looking at it from the side. But it was not very thick.I circled around at the U-Turn on Pine as it slowly moved upward. When I was under it on the opposite side from where I started I could tell it was quite wide. I circled around back at Spencer and watched it float high and higher, and I ended up at a light down by Pasadena Blvd/Red Bluff intersections. At some point the dark shape lit up into a ball of light. I&apos;m not sure how else to describe it.Then suddenly it flashed northward toward me. When I say it flashed I actually mean it flashed. It moved so fast that it left a trail of light behind it. As it came toward my location it did a 180 degree change in flight and flashed southward toward the Gulf of Mexico and did a zig zag. Again, it moved so fast that it left a light trail behind it.

My guess is it moved approximately 1 km north from the spot when the light went off a second earlier.  The light moved again in a slow speed to the north this time, turn off, and re-appear further to the south approximately a km away again.  The distance it moved is just my estimate.

There were no streaks in the sky, no trail left behind.  It all seemed to occur in one small spot, miles up in the sky. Family members immediately attributed the flash to the work of our deceased relative.  Though a meteor might explain the bright flash, the fact that flash occurred in only one small spot in the sky casts some doubt, as does the enormous intensity of the flash of light.  And, that doubt is what makes this flash of light &quot;unidentified&quot;.  I did not see the sky myself, but I did see the flash of light reflected on the ground and buildings, similar to a lightning strike, brighter than the sunlight which was bright that day. It should be noted that the elderly relative whose funeral was in progress, was a witness to at least 2 UFO sightings, one in the 1970&apos;s and one mass sighting in the mid 80&apos;s, both of which she forever refused to talk about, taking the accounts of those sightings to her grave.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It is cold out so I only planned on having a quick cigarette. I saw this huge bight light. It looked like it was maybe hovering above Lake Ontario/ St-Lawrence river. I thought it might be a helicopter since I live close to the Kingston Airport, but the light did not move or have any other flashing lights just a blue haze around it. I called my mom out to the step and ask her if there were any planets that would be that huge and bright and close this time of year. She informed me that she did not hear of any on the news. Sometimes they let us know if you can see them without a telescope. I came back inside and googled planets to see if there was one this big and close. There were no head lines. The closest and brightest one for this time of year was Sirius and it was so far and small and distant compared to what I saw. I thought this bizzare and went outside to look again. The light was still there. It was. same spot, not moving, no sounds of engines. Just sat there motionless. I was just turing around to go back inside because it was so cold and I took one last look. I am not shitting you when I say this light took off almost faster than my eyes could see!! I didn&apos;t know what to do, and had to sit and think about what i just saw. Unless the news says otherwise I saw a UFO. I know I did. I cannot think of any other explanation. Weather balloons don&apos;t move that fast.

I was laying in bed, looking out the eighth story window of my dorm. It was a completely clear night, with no stars or clouds in the sky. I noticed a bright disk of light. Though very far away, I knew that it could not be a plane because it did not move, initially, it just hovered for ten to fifteen minutes. The object also flashed different colors, in no specific pattern or sequence, and the colors appeared to be green and red. This object seemed to be accompanied by another object, but this second object was smaller than the first, and was not as bright either. Its color stayed the same green the entire time, and did not flash sporadically like the first. Both objects were in perfect alignment the entire time, hovering, when they both began to gain altitude at a slow rate. I am currently still looking at them now, and they are hovering at the same higher altitude as they were ten minutes ago. Another reason that these objects could not have been aircraft was because two very obviously airplanes passed by the objects, at a lower altitude and had a blinking white light, that blinked at a regular pace, like all airplanes flying at night.I am a college student, who is rather interested in this subject matter.  After watching numerous shows and reading numerous accounts, I would consider myself somewhat knowledgable on the subject.  What I saw tonight was not normal, and resembled other accounts and videos that I have previously seen. I was not able to take a picture or video of the account, and even if possible, the objects would not appear clearly because of the distance. As much as I would like to believe that what I saw was merely a star or aircraft, it did not resemble either. The irregularity of the blinking of the lights, and the rapid change of color from green to red and back, seemed very paranormal. Though I do not have hard evidence supporting this claim, I hope it will be taken seriously and maybe even confirmed by another resident of Farmville, Virginia.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

The property I was on is situated on a peninsula on the westcoast of Zealand, Denmark.Overhead is an air corridor I think, because you often see passenger-jets crossing west-east og east-west.  At almost 2.am I spotted a jet on an eastern course at an altitude of maybe 24.000 feet. I followed it with my eyes having nothing better to do.After a couple of minutes I took my eyes off it and lighted a cigarette. When I looked for it again I saw the following: Maybe 20 km away and above the city of Kalundborg in the eastern sky close to &apos;my passenger-jet&apos; was a light as bright as Venus, but it was moving and swelling. &apos;My jet&apos; suddenly switched on its landing light, which couldn&apos;t match the light from the other craft at all. The passenger-jet seemed to make a rapid move to the right, whereas the bright light almost danced around it on its left side. And it was still swelling now with a milky halo, which again were surrounded by a white rim. In size it would still be like Venus in all its might, but the halo around would be ten times wider. The passenger-jet just looked like a jet with its light turned on. The strange craft seemed to almost lock on to the passenger-jet...as if the jet couldn&apos;t get away from it.I was quite alarmed by this and was thinking: so now it happens. Suddenly the lights of the strange craft went out and nothing was to be seen of it. After five seconds the passenger-jet turned off its landing light.For all I know it could have been an advanced military craft getting too close to a passenger-jet, whose pilot in panic would have turned on his lights to warn the other craft. But two things make me wonder.1. My own immediate reaction. I&apos;ve seen strange crafts before and have been puzzled. I&apos;ve even reported my sightings to you twice. But I am still a sceptic and search for at rational explanation. But this time I felt a deep fear.2. There was a blackout at the hospital of Kalundborg that night. It happened at the same time as the strange craft were immediately above the city. My sister works at night on that hospital and has been for 20 years. She told me about the blackout the next day. And said that they had never had a blackout before and for the first time they&apos;d had to power up the generator.I reported this sighting to the danish SUFOI (Scandinavian UFO Information), but they managed to lose my report, which they have apologised for, but I don&apos;t really trust them. I wanted the report posted in Denmark in case the pilot on the aircraft were Danish. He might have checked to see, if anybody had observed something from the ground.I still wonder about the incident, so I decided that the right thing would be to mail it to you.", "&quot;What the heck is this thing I&apos;m seeing!!&quot;While walking alone through a backyard during a usual routine of exercise I had stopped for a glance in the sky as I ordinarily do on clear days when in the air straight up above me at an altitude of about 3000 feet I had spotted a round ball-like object hovering in a slow but steady glide toward a southerly direction. This visible object did not in any way appear as what would normally have been a bird or plane, no wings or tail were seen.  With the extreme force of wind current and at it&apos;s estimated height, it would not have been possible for any winged creature or balloon to hover so sternly, as they would have shown an air pattern in a more turbulent or vibrational path. Additional note:  Using my very sharp and accurate vision I was able to depict that because of the slow steady movement it presented, this was not a star nor even a meteor.  Either one would have displayed a more split-second sparkling streak or no movement at all. The object remained in sight for at least one minute and as the cold wind began to water my eyes I glimpsed away briefly and when I quickly returned to what was a very open part of the sky, the object was nowhere in sight.  After another whole minute of observing that area of sky and with the awareness of how the sun will divert things at different angles and colors, there was nothing visible. In retrospect from what similar reports have stated, it seemed very possible that the object must have made itself off at a high rate of speed.  It is unknown to me as to what it was or why I had come to observe this, other than for me to account for it and being clearly seen and recognized as a UFO.  I&apos;ll be recalling this experience until the end of my days.", "Large triangle of lights near Enola, PAI saw an extremely large unknown aircraft at around 4:30 AM on the morning of January 23, 2009. I was outside on my sidewalk having a cigarette, when I happened to notice a very bright light flying to the east. I assumed this was just a plane landing at Harrisburg International Airport (KMDT), as my house is more or less on the approach to runway 13 there. I paid little attention to it until it drew a little closer, when I realized that it was not one landing light, but about nine of them arranged in a huge triad formation. Above these lights were a pair of ICAO standard recognition/nav lights, moving with the landing lights. Actual assessment of the size of this object was difficult, as it was dark, and the low amount of noise it made would indicate it was quite high. The faint and indistinct noise signature makes it seem all the bigger, as visually it seemed gigantic. It continued flying an easterly course a ways south of my house, until it disappeared from view. It did not seem to be moving particularly fast, certainately no faster than a commercial airliner. It made no sudden or erratic movements, and it&apos;s behavior seemed consistent with known laws of aerodynamics. This, combined with the fact that it had operating recognition lights, makes me certain it was terrestrial in origin, yet the sheer size of it makes it hard for me to explain. I also have some background information about me that is relevant. I am a rather large aviation buff, and I am taking flight lessons at the Lancaster, PA airport (KLNS).

They would make wide circles, then join in the middle, separate and continue making wide circles.  I watched for about two or three minutes, then noticed that they changed from clockwise to counter clockwise orbits. They gradually stopped, one at a time.

It did not move from 7:15 until 8:30. The shape looked round - like a bright round ball in the sky. I called a local weather man. He said it was Venus. It was emiting blue and red colors on the sides. Also a tail would come out sometimes on the top, sometimes on the bottom and sometimes on the sides. It never moved in those 75 minutes. It also looked like it had a huge search light beam that would occasionally point down. We got some great photos of it. The photos showed the blue and red lights. It also showed 2 triangles. One triangle was on the left. It was an upside down triangle. On the right there was another triangle that was right side up. They appeared to be connected. One of the photos show 3 dots in the center of it. Some photos were just totally bizarre. It was like hyroglifics. We took photos of the orange ball, and they came back as designs. At about 8:30 p.m. I was assuming it was Venus, as it had not moved. I also assumed that the colors and tails we saw were just gas in the sky. However at 8:30, it moved quickly; first down towards the earth - lower in the sky. Then it quickly moved to our right. It moved so quickly that we had to change windows to see it. Then finally, it took a hard left turn and gradually vanished from site in the distance. That made me a believer. I doubt a planet like Venus would do that.

We had just turned off of highway 45 going east onto a road that made a hard left turn shortly after turning onto it.  In front of us, before the left turn there was a huge (presumably) oak tree, and hovering over and behind it was a very large saucer shaped disc.  The diameter of the disk was approximately the same as the tree in front of it from our perspective, and I would estimate to be about the same as a saucer for a coffee cup held at arms length. We could see what appeared to be a row of windows around the perimeter.  One of us, I don&apos;t remember which, said &quot;wow, look at that&quot; and pointed to it. We watched it descend, and presumably land in the field behind the tree. Then I, who was driving, said &quot;lets go check it out&quot;.  It was afternoon, but still broad daylight at that point.The next thing I remember us is being on the other side of highway 45, back on a farm next to a creek.  My friend and I were looking around a small meadow on our side of the creek, and there were woods on the other side, and it was dark, although there was a full or near full moon, so we could still see pretty well.  We were both very apprehensive, but did not know why.  Then we suddenly saw a white figure standing beside one of the trees on the other side of the creek.  We looked at it, and it darted behind a tree. Curious, but also anxious, we crossed the creek to see what it was, but could never find it.  When we discussed what it might be we finally decided it was an albino bear cub, standing on its back legs in an upright position.  That sounds stupid today, but we could think of nothing else it could be.  Many many years later when I was walking through a bookstore I saw it on the cover of a book, and almost fainted. The book, which I bought, was named Communion.The odd thing was that at that point I did not remember the craft we saw earlier at all.  And we never mentioned the sighting of the craft or the &quot;being&quot; to each other after that time to each other.  Only after years did the memory of the entire event come back to me, and by then I had lost contact with the other fellow.  Also it was years before I realized that the two events were really the same event with a time between them that I still do not recall.  I have considered having a hypnotic regression done to try to find out what may have happened during the time I can&apos;t remember, but have not done so. I did take several people to that area in the following months because I was completely unnerved to be in that area and thought they would feel it as well, but no one I took there later had any strange feelings like I had when I went there.Decades later I dreamed of the event, and in the dream saw a huge flying saucer ascend from the field near the creek.  I however have no conscious memory of this, but still remember the dream quite vividly.

I noticed a VERY bright light in the sky.  This UFO incident appeared over towards the pacific ocean off the coast of Oxnard/Ventura county (my position). It had the appearence of a shooting star, or small meteor entering the atmosphere.  It was like a fireball and it glowed a bright red/orange color, so I knew something was entering the atmosphere.  I have seen small meteors enter the earth&apos;s atmosphere and burn for a brief second.  Well this UFO had been burning for about 30 seconds with a LARGE tail.  After I noticed it, it had emitted an object.  The object was glowing White, and VERY bright and not flickering.  The best way to describe this object would be a flare burning as bright as magnesium. *it was a great distance away so the material must have been rather large because it was burning so brightly i could see it and could not have been a hand flare because those are too small.*  The UFO emitted 3 of these objects.  As soon as the object emitted this bright white light, it stayed lit for 3 seconds, then it died out. As soon as the first object died out a 2nd one came and also for 3 seconds. As soon as that died a 3rd was emitted, and again lasted 3 seconds and disappeared.  When the 3rd object disappeared the UFO appeared to have slowed down its entry into the atmosphere and the glowing red/orange color dissapated away as it slowed down.  I noticed it left a smoke trail when emitting the bright white objects.  It was an awkward shape, large enough that I could see its shape and draw it out.  The UFO glowed a magnificent Gold color.  Then it was just hovering in the sky, and then slowly *from my position* started moving left and away from me *south west direction*.  It still glowed a gold color, and did NOT have any lights flashing on it, nor have ANY sound.  Something traveling that fast into the earths atmosphere should have set off a sonic boom. I waited and heard nothing.  It was traveling away fr! om me, h overing rather gently.  It was moving slowly, then started picking up speed and going higher &quot;UP&quot; INTO the atmosphere.  The gold color dimmed as it picked up speed, then got brighter 2 seconds later.  The gold UFO was flying off into the sky then the bright gold light was growing fainter, but I could still see it, then all of a sudden it VANISHED. BLACK. GONE.  I was stunned and amazed that I witnessed this event and called my girlfriend halfway into this.  I looked back where I had originally seen it and it left a trail of smoke and debree in the sky.  I kept walking my dog and the smoke still remained.  It had a spiral look to it and next to it another small smoke plume. I am 19 years old male college student, I am not crazy, I have my head on my shoulders. I have great eye sight and do not wear glasses.   I witnessed this event and I remember seeing this website on TV so I decided to report the incident. This was NOT a plane, nor a meteor.  This was something significant.  It came RUSHING down into the atmosphere, then emitted objects, hovered away and disappeared going back up into the atmosphere.", "Large retangler object flamed out after 3 seconds traveling north east over northern california 3:32 AM", "saw a triangular shaped object flying low and slow following power lines on RR tracks at duskMy self and a friend went into his backyard right at dusk- his house was on Northwest Highway and it runs parallel to the Chicago and Northwestern RR tracks. As we went into the backyard we spotted a triangular shaped object (dull white or grey)with a small light on each tip. It was maybe 12 to 14 feet long and perhaps 5-6 feet thick in the middle (it was tapered).I saw it from full left to right; the timing was perfect. It was completely silent, and traveling about 60 feet off the ground following the power lines (from SE to NW) at about 10 knots. I had it in full view for what seemed an eternity- it was maybe 2 minutes.I was 15 at the time and neither I nor my friend thought the houseful of people we just left would believe us so we kept it a secret.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

The object didn&apos;t move  but was glowing brighter at time. We went back in the house for about 5 minutes and whent we went back to look, its was gone.

These lights appeared comming up from the sea, (distance indeterminate), rising up and disappearing into the sky. There were five of these objects. A few seconds later they dropped back into the sea.  We thought perhaps they were distress flares from a ship. A few minuetes later they rose out of the sea and performed synchronized  manuevers moving up and laterally in perfect formation.  They then rose up into the sky and disapeared.  I think the whole episode lasted perhaps two to three minuetes.  The USS Gearing one of our sister ships was initially dispatched when the objects were first sighted to see if they were flares from a ship in distress.  However they were no reports of may day calls or missing ships and our combat information center, (CIC), could not get a radar fix on the objects.The whole incident, (as was par for the course), was never recorded as a UFO sighting but rather as an unsubstantiated ship distress signal.With regards to the USS Scorpion who were a part of our manuevers, she was most likely sunk by accident by one of the two Soviet subs that followed her out through the Straights of Gibralter into the Atlantic - they were playing &quot;cat and mouse games&quot; and I personally think the incident was an accident.((NUFORC RESPONSE TO SOURCE OF REPORT))Dear ((name deleted)), Thank you very much for the excellent, and interesting, report! Are you still in touch with members of the crew of the USS Zellars?  If so, I would like to invite you to have them submit reports of the incident, as well.  We know from experience that different witnesses to the same event often see, remember, and report different aspects of it. Have you considered the possibility that the Scorpion might have been sunk by the Israelis, or a force in sympathy with their interests?  The Israeli submarine, &quot;Dakar,&quot; was lost on January 29, 1968, in a fashion which suggests to me that the U. S. might have had a hand in that sinking, given the Israeli attack on the USS Libery on June 08, 1967, an act of war against the U. S..  We might have sunk the Dakar as an act of quiet &quot;quid pro quo.&quot; Thanks, again, for the fine report!

I was sitting in my living room watching T.V. in front of the northern facing picture window when out of nowhere a bright moving light traveling through the sky caught my eye.  No one else in my home witnessed the event - could not get to the window fast enough.  The sighting lasted approximately 3-4 seconds.  The object was a bright silver white light traveling northwest downward toward the San Francisco Bay.  1st thought it was a private aircraft but then the light (large brilliant silver white, maybe 12 ft. in diameter from my vantage point) shone so brilliantly then instantaneously disappeared.  It seemed to be a light in and of itself.  Not a light coming from a separate source.   Approximate height from ground--100ft. and approximately &frac14; - &frac12; mile away.  Also thought it could have been a falling star but too low to the ground. The date and time of this sighting is Feb. 1, 2009 7:38 p.m. PST.  Clear night sky and a little over a quarter moon.

Like the Northbrook, Illinois incident I witnessed a vehicle hit an invisible object.  I was sitting at a stop light with one other car that was directly across from me, also waiting for the light to change.  I heard a crash and looked up to see a car that was traveling from right to left had come to a complete stop just short of the intersection.   Steam was spewing from the radiator and it had a large dent in the grill.  It was like the car hit a pole but there was no pole.  I saw nothing that could have caused this.The next thing I knew the light had changed and I proceeded through the intersection slowly.  It felt like a dream and I was just along for the ride.  I remember starring at that car and even looking over at the other car that was proceeding through the intersection across from me.  Very strange was the thought in my head that said &quot;keep going.&quot;  Not an audible sound but more like a thought.  What makes it so weird is that I was a Vietnam vet and knew how to react to all kinds of stressful incidents but found myself just as an observer and unable to react.  I never reported that accident to anyone and that was also strange because I was a Security Policeman in the Air Force and worked with the Arizona State Troopers and the California Highway Patrol with accidents involving military personnel.  I was no stranger to accidents and accident reports but never reported this one.Over the years I&rsquo;ve felt badly that I didn&rsquo;t help that poor person explain the weird accident to the police but who&rsquo;d believe such a thing?  I have told very few people about this but who would?   I saw a car hit an &ldquo;invisible&rdquo; object!!

We were thinking it was a planet but then we saw it drop dramatically and go to the right and as it traveled away from us, we saw red lights on it and then we saw it hover over trees. Even when it has been cloudy and there are no stars out, this bright white light is still there. We got our telescope out and the next night we looked at it and the way to describe it best was it was shaped like a round fried egg, sunny side up.  I think that is the best way to describe the shape of what it looked like.  The rim of the cylinder was solid and it outlined the cylinder.  Then last night when we were traveling on Rt. 113 in Comar, PA, we saw another bright white light the same as the one we looked at with our telescope.

Witness 1: Driving home from work around 7:20 PM, I saw what I thought was a large airplane, however the lights were different from normal. I do not know how far above my car the object was. I would estimate about the normal height of airplanes, going a bit faster than normal airplanes. The object appeared to have a large rectangular wing unit with lights (blue and white) that flashed from the inside to the outside of the wings in a parallel pattern. I kept looking at that object as much as I could (I was driving), and then I saw another set of lights, much smaller. These were flashing red and white and moving extremely quickly at what appeared to be a very high altitude. I used my cellular phone to call witness 2 at my house to tell him to go outside quickly and see the lights. Our house is in a valley, and by the time I got home and he got outside, the bigger object (with the white and blue lights) had gotten over our house and beyond the tree line. However, we could still see the smaller ones. They moved very quickly over our roofline and out of sight. I did not see anything more that was unusual after that. The time span was about 15 minutes.  Witness 2: When I took the call I was upstairs in our home.  I headed downstairs and out the front door to see her driving down the driveway.  I could tell she had seen something unusual. She pointed out the first object though it was just entering the tree line to the rear of our home and that of next door.  Nothing unusual to me as this can be a corridor for landing patterns at ATL. However, the smaller object she then pointed out was moving rapidly, with a flashing I had not seen in commercial craft.About the time (and this will sound corny) it traveled under the constellation Orion, another smaller light appeared right behind. It, too, began traveling at a speed I have not seen the commercial craft do.  I also could not hear any echo of jet or other propulsion noise from aircraft.  Normally, we would hear a faint engine sound.  It should be noted I did not hear this as the larger craft went by, either. These two smaller lights were out of sight in less than 90 seconds. The one in the rear that had &lsquo;appeared&rsquo; was traveling, using line of sight and my hand for scale, approximately three inches behind the other.

I was in their sunroom that has two windows to the south and five windows to the west. Their backyard backs up to some thick woods. To the south the tree line continues for at least a mile or so. I was in the sunroom watching TV, facing the west wall. Suddenly for no reason at all I turned my head to the south. Just above the tree line, no more than 100 yards from the house there was a large cigar shaped disk hovering above the tree line. I looked as though it had just come out of the woods but that was ridiculous because there was no clearing that it would have fit into that I knew of. And I know those woods pretty well. This object was about two to three minivans in length. It was a silver color with red lights revolving around the middle. It had a disk shape with a dome top. It stopped and teetered for a moment. Then it just zoomed (for lack of a better word) off into the sky. I mean it was just gone in an instant. It was July and the windows were open because my parents are too cheap to run the AC at night. There was a low hum coming from the machine and that could have been why I turned my head to the south. Although there was a hum, the trees sat perfectly still.  I was so scared I ran to all the windows and shut them. I then went upstairs and ran around to all the windows upstairs and closed and locked them. It was hot and humid but I didn&rsquo;t care. I have never been so scared in my whole life. I moved in with my fianc&eacute; two weeks later, but up until then every night I locked my window and my door at night. I haven&rsquo;t seen anything since then, however recently my brother and his friend watched a bright, non-blinking light move in the sky following the Snake River. At one point it stopped several times and made a 90 degree turn. My dad who is a non-believer also witnessed this from the front of his house two miles away. As an experienced pilot he knows that no planes, helicopters, or satellite moves the way this object did.! I don&rsquo;t know why we have seen all of these things, but I am sure there are others in Mora that have witnessed strange activity in the sky as well. I am reporting this now as I saw a &ldquo;stock&rdquo; photo of a UFO online today and I instantly burst into tears. I feel like a crime victim that is finally ready to confront the experience after years of holding it in. The only people I have told about this has been a few family members and my now-husband. I am not looking for &ldquo;fame and fortune&rdquo;, I just want people to know that there is something out there and I have seen it up close.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I noticed an object in the sky to the west of me hovering for a few minutes .I could not tell if it was an airplane or a helicoptor it was just too far away. About another mile up the road at a redlight I noticed it was still in the same position.I pointed it out jokingly to my daughter &quot;theres a ufo!&quot;,figuring it was just a plane or helicoptor. I watched it out of my window on and off for about another mile or two  This is where it gets interesting, After passing the Red Roof Inn on Thomas Road I looked again and it was still there. I looked at traffic, proceded through the red light on the south side of the Thomas Road I-20 overpass, (distance of about 300 yards to the top of the overpass) and thought I was going to get a good look at the object but it was totally gone!!  I pointed this out to my daughter and she was shocked that it was gone to!  I have no idea what the object was, it was not flashing lights of any kind it did not leave an exhaust trail and it did not seem to move and was only visible to me for a maximum of 2 to 3 minutes .There is absolutly no way an airplane could have moved from the last position, to not being able to be seen ,a distance of 300 yards drivin from a stop light!!

I was driving in the car with my mother when I looked to the left and spotted an disk like object rising from the trees.  I continued to watch the object while I said, &quot;Oh my god!&quot; to my mother.   We both stared at the. object while it flew and approx. 2000 feet in the air above the road and continued onward to it&rsquo;s destination.My mother and I both agree on the fact that the most bizarre thing about the object was the color of its lights.  The lights were Red, Blue, and Green and were placed in a triangle like formation on the bottom of the object. As the object passed over, I thought I could clearly make the out a half-moon shaped object flying over. My mom thought it could have been an airplane but I know what I saw.

It was about the height of helicopters flying around when there&apos;s news and chases and things of that nature. It made a weird &quot;hoovering?&quot; sound, its hard to explain really. We were all really surprised as it was flying relatively low. The skies were really clear and we only saw it for about 10 seconds just to where we were able to see it as the light were really dim and could not see it that far after it passed.

I got my friends attention and he saw it too. It was not moving at all. It stayed in the same place for roughly 20-30 seconds, and then it was gone.

I had noticed the trash was not taken up to our trash compartment so I grabbed it and headed up the hill East, looking out to our pasture I noticed that everything became a brilliant hue followed by a shadow of light this is the only way I know to explain it even the night time noise that your normally hear at night fell silent.  So much so it startled me and I looked up I saw three lights which really didn&apos;t alarm me but it grew brighter in the distance and so I thought oh cool a shooting star then it shot straight up in the air all three of them and turned kind of a golden brown then went back to a bright light again I stood gazing up at it thinking what the heck is this, then it just stopped right in the air and then shot straight across to the left  I did not have a camera on me except my cell phone that I had in my pocket so I grabbed it out and turned the camera part on and snapped the pictures.  This thing shot across the sky stopped again then literally went straight up and at an angel and then it was gone.

The cloud was very white but the object could be easily seen as it flew in front of it as it was a pure white colour. It passed the cloud then stopped again and flew up very fast in a semicircular movement from left to right, stopped again in roughly the original position that i first noticed it and stopped again for about 30 seconds or so before moving from right to left again before stopping.

I used a telescope to look and found it has a shpae of arc, the entire body is very brigth. It definetly is not a plane (moving too slow) and not a star or planet (moving too fast).

Just as we were leaving the town of Haymarket via the Old Carolina Road I noticed a very bright light in the Western Sky. To the left or South of the light I could also see the planet Venus which was setting in the South Western horizon.The light was fire orange in color and at first sight seemed to be shining from the tree tops on Bull Run Mountain. We pulled over at the intersection of Old Carolina and Hethecote Blvd to get a better look. Now able to see unabated we were amazed to see the orb rising from the top of Bull Run Mountain. As the light lifted, which had to be at least a few hundred feet from the top of the Mountain it started drifting towards us in a Easterly direction. Incredibly as the light drifted it would stop and hover for several minutes than resume moving again, now on a more East North Easterly flight path. As the light got closer to our position it stopped, again hovered for several minutes, now just North of are position, this is when we noticed this was not a helicopter and certainly not a airplane. At this point the light gradually started to turn North and remained on this path until I could know longer see it anymore.During the sighting there was a lot of other traffic that also seemed to be watching the object, I just hope they take the time to fill out a report of this fascinating sighting.", "Changing red, green sphere, blinking out, moving around mountain, south end of Anthem, Az,. between midnight and dawn.4:15am looked from my upstairs bedroom window to the mountain range/hills on the south end of Anthem,between Anthem and Tramanto.

This time the light changed SLOWLY from red to green, blink off.  Then green, red, green, blink off.  Then green only, blink off. Red only and blink off.  It varied patterns like this the whole time I watched for over an hour. The object slowly moved across that specific area of the mountain, slowly bobbing downward then up, across. It has traversed a good portion of the lower half of the whole hill/mountain.   An hour later it is now down close to the bottom of the mountain.     Police officers came to my house, upon my call, and saw the object from my front sidewalk. We could all see it as we looked south, between 2 houses, yet a mile away at the base of this mountain.  There are people, perhaps 7 houses,living on that mountain, so if it had been a helicopter, the noise would have awakened everyone living in that area.  Last year I heard that there is lots of gold in those &quot;hills&quot; and that local kids like to go on their bikes up the desert hills to find small pieces of gold. I only mention this, because a person told me years ago that some civilizations actually drink gold and need it to survive, for some reason.

I know it was a craft only because of the way it left.  At first it was still - straight above me - and VERY clear the entire time. The size had to have been longer than a football field (I know this because I could judge its length as it was really very close.  Now let me say -  it was beautiful - the colors did not seem of this earth - it was long rectangular with a very bright diamond white light in the very center - I&apos;m only going to say &quot;cigar shaped&quot; because it was proportionate to a cigar in width and length, but its end corners were most unique - They were more perfect than a computer could draw out (how is that possible).  The material seemed to be like a silicon - it was not a metal - it was blue but darker than the sky and I say silicon material because of what the edges looked like, especially the corners - how the blue color defined itself.  It was not only too perfect of a shape for this world but the white shining light was like a diamond in its radiance, but not in its color - it was a solid white light, but not a light or sun white -like we see in any of our earth lights - not even our stars are this color white.  Also, it was not blinding, but had a magnificent radiance.I was sitting alone, but knew there was a couple about 10 yards to my side.  After about a full minute or more of me staring straight up - amazed and testing my eyes and sanity (am I awake?, here?, etc)- the craft started to move perfectly forward very slowly - as if it was a submarine (one of its ends leading).  It moved in a straight line in north-east direction.  At this time, I knew it was possibly leaving and so I moved slowly to the couple sitting close to me.  I continued to keep my eyes on the craft while I moved - nearly stumbled on the couple close by and pointed up - just saying &quot;Look&quot;.  One of the people (female) looked up and said &quot;Oh wow!&quot;  At just that moment the craft started moving faster (and I mean faster) it shot north, but (bing, bing) with two angles.  Our crafts can&apos;t do that right?  long shape disappeared very soon after it shot north - The light remained very very very bright for a longh time (at least a thirty seconds or more) - until it finally got smaller and smaller and disappeared.Only one person who I went to - to look up -actually saw the long body of the craft, the other person looked up too late and only saw the white light as it bing binged away into the northern sky.  The person who saw the craft with me acted very calm - thought it was amazing, but said she had many amazing experience of the sort. She started saying,  &quot;Have you seen...I&apos;ve seen....&quot;.  I had never seen anything that was so clear, and so not of this world. I went inside and drew it immediately.  Even if I had not drawn exactly what I saw - my memory is crystal clear.  And the other witness, I am only happy for her that never in my mind will I ever question if it was an illusion of some sort.  It was very material, and very visible.  It never made one sound and it did not leave a trail.I am writing you to ask you if you have any photographs or video of what I saw.  I can not find anything on internet - except distant videos and photos of long rod shaped craft things - but with no light in the middle and they don&apos;t look as large as what I saw.  I have been looking.  I want to have a real picture of this magnificent craft.  I want to show my husband -whose been hearing about it for years and has seen my drawing - I want to show him a photo if you have one.

The short descriptions I heard were that the balls of light were small though.I will email you a jpeg photo of my drawing.Thank you.

It was a cold and extremely clear sky, with no clouds and lots of stars. At first, I noticed a small looking &quot;star&quot; object in the sky that split in two and then the two objects were ejected in oposite directions (similar looking to a fireworks display). Then a few minutes later, I noticed a small blue colored spec (&quot;star&quot;) in the sky that suddenly got larger and brighter and continued to do so until I began to wonder if this larger (now white looking object) was going to actually land. But just as soon as that thought entered my mind, it shrank into it&apos;s original small blue spec size and color. I thought it was strange but ignored it until it happened again, then I began to really wonder what was going on up there!

I managed to get some of this one on DV tape, but the colors are not as intense as watching it live. Again the wind was out of the west, and this object is moving against the wind to the west. I called my wife out so she could see it too. It would stay stationary for a while then it would go up or down in my sky and go east sometimes then west.

I know the woman in the car next to me saw it too, but we did not communicate with each other.It was clearly capsule-shaped, (or rectangular with rounded edges) never blurred or faded, but seemed to be glowing from above. It was light bluish-green (more on the green side) and seemed like it was not too far up. It did not seem like it was in space. It looked clear or crisp like it was just over the valley.It was much faster than a plane, but not as fast as a shooting star or meteor, at least none that I have seen before.

It was about 2:00AM. We left Tishomingo, Oklahoma and went thru Madill, Oklahoma toward Hwy 377 in Texas to go home from visiting family for the holidays.We had left Madill and were on Hwy 99 just west of Madill.  The road has very low rises, gentle slopes it is not flat.  I was the lead car. What I saw ahead of me on Hwy 99 was a huge reddish orange fireball which made me think there was a bad accident ahead.  My perception was as I topped the little slope I could see the fireball, then as I went down the lower part of the road it could not be seen.  This went on for about 5 miles.At one point, realizing I was driving erratically, I pulled over to explain to my cousin to be careful, as I did not want us to drive into an ongoing accident scene.  She said she could not see anything unusual whatsoever.  It was unnerving to know it was just me seeing this.  This light completely covered the width of the road and was about the size of the sun at sunset, yet my cousin could not see it.I kept on driving slow (thinking I need to be prepared to stop) and never ever came up on the accident.

On one of the recent shows they had a guest and were talking about unidentified flying craft using stealth or camouflaging technology to imitate star patterns and such. I think what I witnessed may be similar to this. I wish I could be more specific in the date but it was some time ago and only hearing the show caused this recollection. It was during the summer months in central Connecticut between 1975 and 1978 as best as I can remember between 10:00 p.m. and 1:00 a.m. I was with a bunch of friends at local gathering place, away from city lights out in the country. We were just hanging out as we did on many summer nights.For some reason I looked up at the night sky at the stars, which were exceptionally bright, as there was no moon and no clouds. I was just gazing at the different constellations when I noticed something out of the ordinary. A sizeable section of the sky was blacked out. Then I realized this section of black out was moving if I remember right in an east to west direction. I don&rsquo;t recall if there was a noticeable shape to it, but you could see the stars disappearing behind it the reappearing as it passed. This did not have a false star pattern as some that were mentioned on the show just darkness. The only reason I saw it was due to the motion. If it were sitting still you would not have seen anything. I&rsquo;m not sure of the altitude with nothing to reference it to, but my gut feeling is that it was quite high not quite Airliner high but much higher than small Airplanes fly. It did not do any sudden or erratic moves just cruised across the sky. With out being sure of the altitude it would be hard to say how fast. Again my gut feeling was that this thing was big  if it was as high as an Airliner it was really big and moving faster than an Airliner. And I did not hear any noise no jet sounds, no helicopter sounds, or visible contrail. I am very familiar with what Airplanes, Helicopters and Blimps look like and sound like this was not any of those things. I do not know what it was.I don&rsquo;t know if this information is helpful or not, maybe it will correlate with something else that happened during that time.

It seemed to increase in number from 1 up to 4 from time to time.  I took notice of the next mile marker which was 42.  I then rolled my window down to see if perhaps there was something on my window creating the affect, plus to listen for noise.  The spot(s) were still there, but I heard no noise other than my car and general traffic noise.  The spot(s) were dark and the best I could describe the shape was from a cigar shape to a disc (flat)shape.

Object stood sitll in air.January 1st 2009  I stepped outside to smoke a cigarette before heading to bed. I remember checking my watch because I knew I had to be up early and head out of town the following morning and I recall it was approximately 11:15 p.m. or so. I was standing out on my front porch smoking a cigarette staring at the tree tops which I often do and noticed a light which was yellowish white in color off in the distance. It was behind one of the trees in my neighbor across the streets yard and at first glance I assumed it to be a star. I noticed slight movement which I assumed was from the tree swaying but the light seemed to be getting closer.With an airport within 15 minutes away, it was not uncommon to see planes flying over head so I thought nothing of it. As I continue to smoke my cigarette, the light was moving closer and was ascending. As the object got closer, something told me to take a picture. I pulled out my phone and attempted to with the phones camera, but because of the night the only thing that appeared in the picture was the light (I have the picture archived on my phone). By the time the light reached over were the tree was, it maneuvered in what I can best describe as a half circle or moon shaped movement to the left.Still ascending upward, I was able to see the undercarriage or belly of the object. There were lights in the shape of a triangle under the object that were in some sort of series of blinking. The lights were red and a very white crystal light. I am still assuming at this point that the object is a plane.Within what seem to be a minute or so, the object then made another maneuver in the same half round or moon motion coming back around to the right in the direction of the tree I had first initially seen and maneuvered past the tree over to my side of the street a few houses to the right. At this point the object had descended and I was able to see the top of the object.The object was round in shape and had a ring of lights on the outer edge. The object sat in the air still almost as if it was starring at me. I opened my front door and yelled to wake my daughter off the couch to get her mother. Not very comprehensive from being awoken, rubbing her eyes, I directed her to get her mother yelling its important hurry. She came back and said mommy was sleeping. I yelled for her to wake mommy up now! The object is still sitting there while this is transpiring. Finally I dart into the house to wake my wife and fly out the back door of our bedroom onto my deck in the hopes for her to come see what I have seen.Standing on my deck, I saw nothing. I then run through the house back out front in hopes it was just out of visibility from the deck, but it was gone. I checked my watch and it was 11:28 p.m. After it was all done I was a little shaken by what I had seen. I was telling my wife of the experience and in telling her about what I had seen, my memory recalled that I did not here any engine noise that you typically would from a plane, and of course it was not a helicopter. I have always been quite the skeptic when it comes to the sightings, but I know I saw something I had never seen before and was unable to identify exactly what it was.I am a 28 year old male, married with 2 children.

We observed all 4 airships for about 7-8 minutes as the traveled SE over the coast until we lost sight behind the trees", "Directly over head at tree level a Massive, Silent, Hovering Object blocking the  night skyAn August late night, on my way home from work, I came upon a group of cars and people off the side of the road, I pulled over shut off my car and approached the group where I was directed to look over to the northeast at tree level, where I saw a huge dark form (no lights) hovering (no noise), I realized around me were people I did not know other than one, the father (barber) of a highschool classmate who I had just graduated with who lived within a mile of this site.  People were saying it is just stationary and not moving, suddenly it began to move very slowly across the ground at tree level toward us and stopped directly over where we were standing.  I was captivated and not afraid.  Others were saying &quot;it&apos;s the Russians&quot;.  I did not speak I just focuced on the huge object that appeared to be aboiut the size of a football field, blocking out the entire night sky, it&apos;s bright blue white light coming from windows in a horeshoe format surrounding a gear of somekind underneath the object was of interest to me.  I was waiting for some thing to happen, but as far as I know at that time nothing did, after about 20 minutes or so it seemed, it just began to move slowly at tree top level south west over the country side with no noise and no fanfare, as far as I could see, until it slowly went out of sight.  I was told by one of the bystanders it was headed to a air base about 50 miles away.  I drove home and ran into my house where my father was sitting reading...I told him about what I had experienced and he just got up and went to his bookshelf and handed me a paperback book about an accounting of a commercial pilots story of spotting more than one unidentified object in his flying career.  Of course, to this day I read and stay up on serious accounts of this interesting aspect to our universe.  I was seventeen when I had the experience and it shaped my life and has been forever a reference point that nothing can surprise me and has formed a open mind and unlimited potential attitude. The object! was a s oft delta shape and was a matt deep green blue or black, no distingusing features or symbols on the object. I was a massive object, overwhelming, indeed.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It appeared to be glinting off the sun or reflecting light,similar to the look of a metal ball I was driving south in SF,CA.  It appeared about 35-40 degrees above the horizon straight south guessing about 3 miles near Daly City,about 400&apos; in the air.It was initially stationary,became smaller as if it were moving away south, then darted left and right,and disappeared.  I was able to gauge the lateral movement because I was looking through overhead utility wires.It wasn&apos;t a plane a balloon a helicopter or a bird, because the velocity of the movement was too swift.  It made me very nervous. I was about to call out to a pedestrian but by the time I did it was gone.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

At first I thought it was an airplane.  The light appeared to be moving slowly, like an airplane.  I stopped to watch it.  Then I noticed the light was stationary.  We live on a large 2,000+ acre Lake.  The light was across the lake from us and over land.  I am guessing it was  10 miles from me.   The light appeared stationary.  At first, I thought it was moving, I stopped to watch it.  The light was about the height a low flying  airplane would be flying at.As I watched it, it appeared to be getting larger and brighter.  I then thought it must be an airplane heading  straight toward me.  However, as I watched it, it seemed to be hovering and moving very little.I watched it 15 minutes.  It was a very bright white light.  There seemed to be smaller red and blue lights near the bright white light.   The lights seemed to be sort of &quot;twinkling&quot;.  There was some kind of &quot;form&quot; of a shadow structure where the lights were, but I could not determine any shape.  It was too far away from me.  It was not directly overhead, it was in the western sky.It was cold outside, so I did not want to stay outside.I walked back inside and told my husband &quot;there is an UFO outside&quot;.He replied &quot;You mean that bright white light?  It has been out there for several nights this week&quot;.  I could not believe he did not mention it to me before.My husband went outside and said &quot;that is the same light that I have been seeing all week.&quot;  He goes outside at night more than I do.I was busy cooking at the time.  I went back outside an hour later, and the light was still there.  The light seemed to have dropped a little lower to the horizen, and it was not as bright as it had been.  I did not stay outside because it was cold.  I did go back outside a couple of hours later, and it was gone.I was not sure how to photograph it in the dark when it was so far away.I have a feeling the light may be back out there tomorrow night.

Outer border was bright with a bright dot at it&apos;s centre.My brother and I had arrived in Mayrhofen, Austria for our skiing holiday.  Our sighting happened on our first evening whilst stepping outside to the balcony to smoke a cigarette.The red circle as it appeared to us in the sky appeared over the mountain horizon and continued upwards, sometimes moving very slightly to the left or right.  It continued to move slowly and then gained speed and moved still upwards.  As it gained speed it grew fainter until the light had disappeared from sight.We took a video although this was low quality.  However upon examining the photograph taken, the red circle was brightest at it&apos;s centre with a bright outer border.  There were no visible trails of exhaust from any propulsion.  The light remained constant for the entire sighting and there were no additional lights or flashes.I&apos;ve searched the internet and found nothing similar...I will forward the photograph to this website as evidence of the sighting.", "Orb that popped in and out of the atmosphere twiceI was driving down highway 76, when I saw a slow moving object.  It was very bright and the color was a reddish, brown solid color.  I didn&apos;t know what to make of it.  So I shined my powerful mag lite at the orb, when all of a sudden it released a cloud of white smoke.  There was no moon out, but the cloud was very bright, after two minutes it went out of the atmosphere, and then it popped back in again, and started to show more smoke like cloud.  The clouds were small and lingered for about ten minutes after it vanished.  It almost reminded my of a comet entering our atmosphere, but it popped in and out twice, I grabbed its attention after the second pop in.  Cause my flash light was on it and it traveled very slowly then it left. no strobing light and it was far enough to remind me of a star, that left a cloud in the ozone.I was the only one who saw it and I was to nervous to take a picture.", "I observed a light in sky on January 30th it moves slowly from left of my home up down right left sometimes making a circular movement!!

I then sensed movement. Looked directly up and saw three spheres of light sort of clustered together. The bottom two spheres were soft whitish in color. Not really a glowing. Different from any other aircraft that I have seen in the night. The third light/sphere was situated above the other two spheres sort of in a &quot;club&quot; like formation. The sphere was approximatly 1/3rd smaller than the other two directly below it. The light color was a faint yellowish maybe kind of orange light.Movement was silent and moderate, but detectible by my senses. The altitude I estimated at approximately 200 to 250 ft. With my past military experience I would say this craft traveling at this low altitude is undetectible by radar. this instantly raced through my mind. I dont know why.The total approximate view time was approximately 10 to 12 seconds. It seemed much longer. I did a post mock-up this morning. Positioning myself and timing approximate viewing time. Not more than twelve seconds.The craft was moving in a northeasterly direction. Speed was approximately 300 ft per second. While viewing. At approximatly the 7th second. [Estimated on my post mock-up also]. The two lower light spheres suddenly turned off. Leaving the third smaller faintish yellowish light sphere. Still travelling at the same rate but, getting fainter losing light and shape, then totaly vanishing. I was&apos;nt scared or startled. Just marveled,concerned, and sort of disturbed. As I feel presently.Finally. I have experienced seeing moving lights on different occasions. I always figured they have to do with the nearby airport and airbase.

I live in Christiansburg, Va. It was 6 am and fairly clear.  Sunrise wouldn&rsquo;t be for almost an hour. I heard a funny noise above me, like a low rushing sound, and looked up and saw 3 steady white lights forming a perfect triangle. In the center was a flashing reddish light. It was very large and very low.  It moved slow, to slow for a jet. I&rsquo;d say it was at about 500 ft. It was pitch black against the sky.  It was around 100ft between lights.I&rsquo;m a airplane buff and my first thought was, it must be a B-2 on a training mission, But the more I thought about it, I knew it that couldn&rsquo;t be as the triangle of lights was to large and perfect. Running lights on a B-2 wouldn&rsquo;t form a perfect triangle. I did some research on navigation lights and haven&rsquo;t found anything that would match up too what I saw. A jet would have been louder. I could barely hear it when it went almost right over my head moving off to the southeast.I&rsquo;d like to know what I saw.", "Neon green UFO over Los AngelesI was driving south on La Brea near San Vicente Boulevard in Los Angles last night at 10 PM. To the right of me, a neon green oval shaped object appeared out of nowhere and moved very quickly towards the earth at a right angle. The shape of the craft was similar to the photo from the battle of Los Angeles incident. The whole event lasted about two seconds, and even thought the object was moving at an amazing speed, I could make out the shape very clearly. There was no trail behind the object. What struck me most was the clarity and color of the object. When I got home and looked at a map, I calculated that the object was headed towards the ocean near Topanga Canyon Park.", "Floating Orb over LAXI got up early this morning to search for the comet Lulin in the direction of Virgo and Leo.  As I pointed my binoculars directly to the ocean, West, I saw what appeared to be a white light moving steadily north.  As it got closer, it got my attention, because it had no strobelight.  It flew over the Los Angeles Airport and I was able to keep an eye on it for approximately 2 minutes till it faded north into sky.  I have seen planes in the area and have become accustomed to see them.  This was not a plane.

It followed a straight-line trajectory at a fixed altitude which did not seem very high at a comparatively high speed. It was clearly breaking the usual observation pattern for a plane: if you&acute;re not close to an airport, a plane looks small and if it&acute;s night time, then you see one light fixed and a couple of another ones blinking, all flying slow. In this case it was only one light much bigger than one of a plane flying at a considerable distance away and even bigger than lights of the sea ships sailing along the Malec&oacute;n at a prudent distance for a while before entering Havana Bay. At the same time the speed of the movement of the light was much higher than the speed usually observable for a plane, although it did not cross the sky in a single moment. Given that it was night time, it was impossible to see the shape of the carrier of the light, but given all the described above it was leaving the impression of being something small flying at an altitude, let&acute;s say, below heaviest rain clouds. Given straight-line trajectory and fixed altitude it was DEFINITEVELY not a meteorite, but something piloted or directed (although who knows, not necesserily extra-terrestrial). I saw it when it was already flying along the Malec&oacute;n from the Bay to the West of the City, then it disappeared behind the roof of my building and I ran to the hall trying to see it from the other side. And I did. Around U.S. Interest Section the Malecon makes a slight turn, but the light kept flying straight becoming each smaller and weaker until disappearing. I did not hear any sound at any moment, although it did not give me time to open the windows, and the whole thing lasted for about a couple of minutes tops.", "This is it, i was doing laundry, sudenly my wife called me to say: came to watch this quick (she was hanging cloths in the porch)and i saw from the sky above into our atmospher like samething came off &quot;from aircraft&quot; its was like comet burning fired but then i was keeping watching like it,s going to land and what happened was the thing was slowing down till stops for long standing still &quot;like a comet&quot; then turned back slow to west side of the world i,ve got part of home video of this scene..", "boomerang shaped object with 5 greenish lights growing in size and then turned and disappearedWe spotted a tiny boomerang shaped object with five greenish blue lights hovering what looked to be many miles offshore as we looked from Narragansett Beach toward Newport.

I noticed a plane with 3 lights in the shape of a triangle, something about it intrigued me and I could not stop looking at it. As I was driving I noticed the plane was not moving and coming towards me as it should have been. So, I keep my eye on the plane and when I got to Heritage Elementary I saw that the plane was hoovering over the school about 5 to 10 feet above tree line. I could not understand how a plane could do this with out falling out of the sky. I noticed it was a gray military plane with no markings on it. I was so weirded out by this I literally had my head over the steering wheel looking at the plane and was wondering if I was the only person that saw this plane hoovering.After leaving the vet I was not thinking about it and drove right past the school and then I thought to myself I wonder if the plane is still there after seeing a smaller plane flying in front of me. As I looked in my rear view mirror I saw that the plane was now flying and going south down County Line Rd. towards the airport. I keep watching the plane the whole time and felt like it was following me, it stayed 15 feet behind me the whole way. As I turned East on Palmer Rd. I thought the plane would fly over me, but no it proceeded to go down Palmer Rd. with me and the weird part is the plane did not turn left like I did, it stayed facing South but flew side ways down Palmer. At this point I was terrified and thought my mind had to be playing tricks on me. I speed up and after passing the Palmer park I came into the group of trees and the plane seemed to have stopped, almost like it couldn&apos;t see me anymore. At this point I slammed on my breaks next to the Madison Water Dept. and watched the plane. It proceeded to start flying &quot;normal&quot; and going South towards the airport. I keep my eye on the plane as I drove towards Sullivan &quot;Wall Triana&quot; and once I turned going South on Sullivan I could not see the plane. A plane this big would still be visible from Sullivan, but it disappeared and was no longer in sight.", "Black triangle flying low over northwestern Florida.I walked out back to smoke a cigarette, watched a plane fly over and disappear over the Gulf of Mexico (due south) was looking at Orion, trying to pick out some of the fainter stars. By now my night vision was fairly good. I caught movement out of the left corner of my eye, and startled, I instinctively ducked. At first, I thought it was a hang-glider, basing this initial impression on the shape alone.  I was startled, as this had &quot;sneaked&quot; up on me without any noise, no cutting of the wind, nothing. Coming from due east headed due west, this triangle was of a conflicting description.  It was darker than the night sky, no lights, but also seemed somewhat transparent in that the outside/frame/shape was more clearly defined than the middle. Black but with the appearance of &quot;transparency&quot; toward the center mass.  Contradicting terms, but that&apos;s the best words I can use accurately.  It was so quiet and stealthy, had I not been looking south at that part of the sky at that moment, I would have never detected it.  That part startled me the most. It glided overhead, less than 400&apos; AGL, and remained in my vision for seven to nine seconds until it dropped behind the trees.  In other words, moving steadily, but not very fast.  I would estimate the width greater than 25 feet. Hurlburt Field is due West of here.  If it maintained it&apos;s heading for a few more miles, it had to cross it the base and certainly the runway.

I was driving about 2 miles north of Addy, a quarter mile north of south McClain road. The highway in this area is straight with a slight grade north, to the west is approximately a mile of open farmland, to the east a hill that abuts the McClain farmhouse, and small hills to the east and north of the farm. The sun had gone behind the hill to the west a few minutes before, the sky was clear and headlights were unnecessary.As I drove north I noticed two parallel lights approximately a quarter mile ahead, at perhaps 300 feet elevation. The lights were extremely bright, the brightest white light I had ever seen, with a slight blue tint-they looked exactly like halogens, though I had never seen a halogen at that time. They appeared to be separated by a hundred feet or so, but traveled exactly level in elevation and distance from one another. If you put a light on each wingtip of a jumbo jet, then erased the jet, this is how they appeared. They were about 6 times larger than lights you see on plane wings, more the size of round headlights.What I saw happened quickly. I noticed them first about a quarter mile to the left of the highway, they were moving extremely quickly, faster than a jet, yet slower than a meteorite. They flew exactly eastward and then turned a 90 degree angle north without losing speed. Everyone on the highway slammed on their brakes when this happened, so there were other witnesses.This happened approximately 60 miles north of Fairchild Airforce Base.

Not having my glasses on at the time, my first thought was that the moon was still out and was really bright.  I put my glasses on and immediately recognized that it was not the moon, but very similar to a very bright star exceptionally far away.  I then just layed there observing this &quot;star&quot;.  Upon observation of approx. a few minutes, it appeared that this &quot;star&quot; was in fact moving in a back and forth movement, to the right and then left.  Being that I observed this through a rectangular skylight, I did have borders from which I could tell that this object was in fact moving.  At that point I called to my wife and asked her to look at this.  As she looked at it, I asked her if she could see it moving.  She said that she could, and at that I said I thought it was a UFO.  She responded &quot;coming to get you&quot;?  She then went back to getting ready for work and I continued to watch, even having to reposition myself as this object had gotten to far to the right border of the skylight.  After a few moments passed, I then noticed this light start to diminish.  I assumed cloud coverage as it seemed to come in and out of light.  It then disappeared.  To me it appeared that this object went up as opposed to going any other direction.  I continued to watch for approx. 15 minutes longer to make sure that cloud coverage wasn&apos;t hiding this light.  My honest opinion is that this light was far to high in the sky to be a helicopter.  I thought of trying to contact the Onondaga Co. Sheriffs&apos; Dept. to inquire if they in fact had their chopper in what would have been the southwestern sky, but I didn&apos;t want to lose sight of it by going to the phone.  Also, I took note that there was not on other star in the sky.

Still dark outside with no indication of sun rising yet. I turned off my bedroom light and laid down on the bed, just before I closed my eyes, I saw a light in the sky.  My bed is right beside the window which faces east.  I have no curtains, and I live on the 17th floor of an apartment building.  Mind you, I filed a report one month ago.  I have to admit I have a more heightened awarness of the night sky now.  The view from my bedroom allows me to see the entire eastern night sky.  To redirect attention for a second, other than the last report I filed in Late January, I have had to other sightings, one in grade eight, and the other sometime in late highschool.  My first sighting was at a religious retreat in Orangeville, Ontario (1987).   All the boys slept in a large room with rows of beds either facing toward the inside wall or the outside window.  My bed was facing the large lengthy window.  It was approximately half an hour after the lights had been turned off (10 pm).  I noticed a green glowing, saucer shaped object hovering above the tree line approximately 300 meters away.  There was quite a bit of fog.  I watched it for a few seconds when I saw a beam of green light go down into the trees, that is when I woke everyone up to look at it.  Most were asleep.  Of the 25 classmates in the room, approximately five others witnessed it.  After about a minute, the green glowing object slowly disapated.  The second sighting occured while drving northbound on highway 404 heading toward Richmond Hill, a small town north of Toronto.  This occured sometime in 1993.  I was in the back, left seat of a friends car.  It was the middle of the day.  I looked up and saw a clearly orange triangular shaped object maybe 1 km high.  I pointed it out to my friends, but because of there position, they could not see it.  The driver had to focus on the road, as well.  It hovered for 30 seconds then shot directly st! raight u p at an astonishing speed and disappeared out of site. Now back to the latest sighting.  I quickly determined the light I was looking at was not a plane.  There were no flashing lights, and the light was almost luminescent.  The best I could describe it, as if it was floating across the sky.  The light was approximately a km in the sky.  I stood on my bed and watched the light, it quickly sped away at an alarming speed.  At this point I was convinced it was not a plane.  From the vantage point of my bedroom window, planes normally take approximatel 10 minutes to completely disappear out of sight.  This object not only sped away in less than thirty seconds, it followed an angle in the sky different from an airplane.

It had red lights that didn&apos;t blink in the middle of it and other lights where wings would be but in triangular distances from each other. As it changed shape, the red lights didn&apos;t move but the other light moved from their position from the sides to the direct top and bottom!

He then asked why it was dragging a hot air balloon behind it.

During this period I witnessed many military aircraft travelling at speeds in excess of Mach 1.8, usually at military exercises. If I compare the speed of the black oval to military aircraft I have worked with before, I would say it was accelerated from tailing the Airbus (400+ mph) to Mach 3.5 in 1 second.As you can imagine, at this speed the oval quickly vanished from site in the direction of Banbridge, SW.I do not wish you to contact me, but thank you for your time.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was about seven miles west of Russellville on I-40, a few miles from a nuclear power plant.The objects came from the north side of the road at approximately 9:40 pm.  The object I saw first was triangle shaped, with a solid white light at front and the lower right corner, and a solid greenish colored light on lower left.

I live very near to the described location of the reported sighting.  Based on the description furnished by the witness, I believe what was observed was a flight of three C-130 aircraft from the Little Rock Air Force Base.  These aircraft fly directly over my home every night with out fail between 8 and 10 p.m..  The usual flight path is from the northeast to the southwest. Along this flight path, the aircraft pass approximately 3-5 nautical miles west of Arkansas Nuclear One (the nuclear plant metioned in the report).  Additionally, the aircrafts&apos; usual approximate altitude is less than 1000 feet and display the lighting characteristics described by the witness (on one occasion they were so low that they momentarily blocked the signal to my satellite television receiver). My personal opinion on the reported hovering of one of the aircraft is that if the aircraft is observed flying directly away from the observer it could appear to be motionless or hovering, as I have personally observed this with these aircraft on several occasions.((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to the source of this comment.  We will post it, such that it is posted together with the original report.  PD))((END ADDENDUM #1 OF 2))((ADDENDUM #2 OF 2--COMMENT FROM ORIGINAL WITNESS, AND SOURCE OF REPORT))I just made a report about a recent sighting. While  I was on the website, I decided to look at my old posting from Feb 12, 2009. A response was made and I believe the response to be wrong and demeaning to my story. http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/068/S68848.html http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/069/S69646.htmlI grew up my while life on Sugarbush Road, which runs parallel to the Selfridge Air Force Base runway, here in Chesterfield, MI.  I have seen nearly every type of military aircraft make its way over my house in one form or another.  The C130 has ALWAYS got my attention when they would fly over because they were very low and VERY loud.  They would fly so low you would think that they were skipping over the trees.  So I am VERY familiar with the C130 and how they look in the sky, be it day or night. That being said, these were NOT C130 aircraft that we saw.  They were MUCH larger than any aircraft I have ever seen.  Also, I have NEVER seen a C130 fly right on the tail of another C130.  It was so close it was like it was being towed by the other one in front.  Regarding how the &quot;it can look like it was hovering&quot; comment, I understand when he meant, but that is not what happened.  We were already coming to a very fast stop on the shoulder.  The van was pretty much at a stop already when we saw it/them hovering. I think the response to my report is uninformed and based on what he &quot;thought&quot; we saw.  He did not see what we saw when we saw it.

Everything was completely normal, so we proceeded to sled with no strange thoughts or fears.  After about 15 minutes of sledding, we were both resting at the top of the hill.  Suddenly, we saw a giant flash of blue in the sky.  It was an intense blue-white light that lit up the whole sky.  I did not see anything but the light as I was looking down.

She says that the shape was not completely solid (picture an open black folding chair, upside down but more oval-shaped.  The sky was visible through a hole in the shape.)

I stare through my polarizing glasses, which allowed me to see the clouds and sky clearly, at 8 to 10 small round shaped white objects moving in formation similar to Canadian geese forming and reforming a triangular shape. My immediate reaction was that it was a flock flying as you always see them. As I watched, I realized they were up by the clouds some 5,000 to 8,000 feet or more, and were colored white, not the usual dark color of geese, and staying very close to the cloud at that high altitude. I watched for some 15 to 20 seconds until all of a sudden they disappeared into the cloud. I kept watching for another 2 minutes or so until the powerful winds quickly swept the cloud away. I kept searching the blue sky for the objects, but saw nothing.

Mall, 7-4-97I&apos;ve decided that I should finally share something that I and my then-girlfriend saw over 10 years ago. This seems to be the best place to do it. I do not expect it to be taken tremendously seriously, as there are some details I&apos;ve frankly just forgotten, and it is far from what you hear most UFO reports sounding like, but perhaps it&apos;s something to add to your database which could be correlated to other incidents. I&apos;ve only recently become deeply interested in this event again, sparked by a discussion with a friend, but I know that it has, in a way, always been in the back of my mind, for over 10 years now. Brought to the fore every time there was some report or show on TV, or a tabloid headline having to do with UFO&apos;s. I do not expect a response to this, though it would be interesting to know if anyone else has ever seen anything like what I describe.First of all, about me: My name is, let&apos;s say &quot;Mike&quot;. (I have no trouble giving my true details privately.) I&apos;m 37 years old, educated, and most would say intelligent. I practiced law for 4 years, now write flight simulation software, and will next year begin teaching high-school mathematics. My hobbies have included things such as aviation, reading classic literature and about physics, plus even a bit of dabbling in astronomy. (Just enough to appreciate the TREMENDOUS distances to even the nearest stars... which in my mind would make interstellar travel nearly impossible, at least under physics as we know it. This is one of the reasons I&apos;m so skeptical and have had real internal conflict over what I saw.) By the way, I do not have a pilot&apos;s license, but do know quite a bit about aviation, theory of flight and such. With a background such as this, and a mind-set skewed towards logic and science and technology, it&apos;s probably no surprise that I&apos;m generally a very skeptical, evidence-oriented person. I frankly view a large part of the UFO &quot;movement&quot; or whatever it&apos;s called as comprised of people who just WANT to believe something -- followers, in a sense, of their own religion, in that many seem as eager to bypass reason and rationality as do the fundamentalists of the traditional religions. I add this only to point out that there really isn&apos;t a large part of me that is *eager* to believe this... to believe what I probably must believe if I accept the reality of what she (my girlfriend &quot;Lori&quot;) and I saw.I think I now am starting to... hence this e-mail, 12 years later.My &quot;sighting&quot;: First, I&apos;m actually not certain that this happened in 1997. Lori and I are no longer together but still talk about this, and we&apos;re only 80 percent sure it was &apos;97. It may have been &apos;96. Regardless, it was the night of July 4th, and we had been to the National Mall in Washington D.C. to view the fireworks. We each lived in the northwest suburbs of D.C., so had taken the metro (rail) from Gaithersburg directly down to the mall. (Red line to Orange line.) We were there all day, watched the fireworks, and in general had a great time. We did not consume any alcohol, as we rarely drank, nor did we take any drugs. The fireworks had ended. We were tired and ready to go home. It was around 11 o&apos;clock, I believe. The crowd there was huge, obviously, so she and I had waited a bit for it to thin out instead of trying to sardine ourselves onto one of the metro train cars.So we started walking (I remember it as we were walking west, on the north side of the mall), and were heading towards the Nat&apos;l Mall entrance to the Smithsonian Metro station. We were not far at all from this entrance, certainly within 100 feet. Then, from nowhere, this... &quot;thing&quot;.. appeared. Carmel and I have always referred to it as the &quot;dragonfly UFO.&quot; It was on our left, slightly above eye-level -- no more than 10 feet high -- and I&apos;m certain it was within 15 feet of us the whole time, at several moments probably less than half that. This thing was the size of a large dragonfly, I would say around 6 inches, and it flew and hovered the way a dragonfly might... just with MUCH more quick and abrupt movements. Like gravity and inertia didn&apos;t mater to it. It would be hovering, and then a handful of seconds later, in what seemed like an instant, it would zip over and be hovering several feet away in a new spot. We were walking while this was all happening, mouths agape I&apos;m sure and staring, but afraid to stop I guess because of the main light&apos;s striking brightness. It did seem like it was paying attention to us (I can&apos;t believe I&apos;m saying this, but like it was &quot;scanning&quot; us), so, during the probably 30 second period this all lasted, we saw this zipping around movement I described several times. It was so astounding.How that made us feel is complicated. In fact, I can only speak for myself. I just know that as this was happening, a few times I glanced quickly around to see if others were seeing this too. There were people around, so I suppose I felt a little bit of the whole &quot;safety in numbers&quot; thing. On the other hand, it did seem to stay near us, and we saw its light from the brightest aspect angles, I assume, so it did seem like we were being evaluated somehow. Combine that with the fact that this thing does NOT, truly, seem to be anything that would come from this Earth, and yes, there&apos;s a level of fear that mixes in. So all in all, I personally was a little scared, VERY amazed by what it could do, and frankly felt somewhat entertained by it (to the point that I was laughing... as if I knew then I&apos;d never see such a spectacular show again.)  Sound.... This thing made no sound whatsoever. (Even considering the background noise, which is actually not as much as you&apos;d might imagine that time of night on the Nat&apos;l Mall, I feel confident that, given this thing&apos;s proximity to us at times, we should have heard something.) &quot;Lori&quot; agreed with this: if there were anything to hear, we would&apos;ve.This &quot;dragonfly&quot; SEEMED to be slightly illuminated, but perhaps was just so shiny that it was reflecting the background light. I&apos;m honestly not sure. It was hard to see past its &quot;main&quot; light. This was a very bright yellowish light, facing forward, from the &quot;head&quot;... though it struck me that calling that direction &quot;forward&quot; was somewhat arbitrary... and I really only could call it the head because that&apos;s where the light was. But this main light didn&apos;t show up as a beam, despite its intensity.  Again, maybe because there was a fair amount of background light in the area. What I did make out past of the object past that bright light could be best described as a very elongated computer mouse -- a flatter bottom, more rounded top, and length that was probably 3 - 4 times its width. Height was maybe half its width. All edges were rounded... nothing sharp.By FAR the most interesting feature of this miracle dragonfly was that there seemed to be two small spherical &quot;wings&quot; to it. But it wasn&apos;t like the blurry whirlwind you&apos;d see when a humming bird or dragonfly are moving their wings very rapidly. It was more like a slightly yellow luminescent haze. Kind of like when you can see the heat rising from the asphalt on a hot summer day, but this was more intense than that. Somehow more turbulent or &quot;wigglier.&quot; These circles, where dragonfly wings would&apos;ve been, were not large. Maybe a couple of inches, probably slightly less (because they were less than 1/3 its length). But certainly they were not large enough, had it actually been the blur of wings, to support even the lightest weight imaginable for a &quot;body&quot; of that size... i.e., even though we refer to it as the dragonfly UFO, its &quot;yellow haze ball&quot; wings were not nearly as large, proportionately, as a dragonfly&apos;s.One thing striking to both &quot;Lori&quot; and I is that only one other person seemed to see what we were seeing, though there were probably a dozen people within a 30 - 40 foot diameter. It was a girl between 5 to 10 feet behind us, and who herself was several feet away from who I assume was her boyfriend. She and I just quickly glanced at each other, puzzled, amazed, after this thing flew away. Those parts I remember clearly. I think I may have said something like &quot;what the HELL was that,&quot; but I can&apos;t be sure that I wasn&apos;t just thinking it. I know she said nothing to me, but looked shocked and far too white for July in D.C..As I said, this thing seemed to come out of nowhere. When it left, about 30 seconds later, it receded to our left (which I believe was south at that point, towards the Potomac), very rapidly, in a flat trajectory. No more than +5 degrees flight path. It was as if this thing had instantly decided to go monitor someone else a mile away. The speed at which it left I&apos;d say was 80 to 100 miles per hour. But I could not keep it in sight for long, and don&apos;t know if it sped up after that, or where it went. And it reached that 80 - 100 mph speed very, very quickly... as I look at the second hand of my computer clock and replay this in my mind, I&apos;d say just a bit over a second. 1.25 +/- . But you have to understand that this thing was not so easy to see unless the main light was visible to you, and near the end it was not visible to us. You could track it if you HAD seen the main light, and then it turned and maneuvered, but with the way it blended with everything else, pulling in and reflecting, almost duplicating the visual surroundings, I doubt that someone who wasn&apos;t in the path of the main light would have noticed it at all.I remember this very clearly: this object did not have to yaw or turn so that it was facing the direction it wanted to fly, nor did it have to pitch its nose up as a typical helicopter would if it wanted to fly backwards. This stuck with me. Standard fixed or rotor wing flight principles are out of the question here. Jet and rocket engines make noise, of which this had none. Even the ion engine things I&apos;ve seen are not equipped to power something in the way that we saw. Nuclear... sure, whatever. But these are power sources, not propulsion sources, and there is no physics text book in the land that could describe how something could move this way. You almost have to have seen it to believe it... those yellow luminescent &quot;wing&quot; spheres... the INSTANTANEOUS stopping and starting. No way. Skeptics may dismiss things like these as obvious hoaxes, but I&apos;m telling you, neither I, nor my ex-girlfriend are idiots. I&apos;ve tried for 12 years to find ways to convince myself it was some super secret CIA craft, but I just can&apos;t believe that. The principles behind this &quot;dragonfly&quot; just simply strike me as things which are thousands of years ahead of our technology.I have never heard of UFO sightings such as this, with a small craft doing dragonfly-like darting maneuvers. But I can tell you that &quot;Lori&quot; and I discussed this incident many times, and there was always an element of disbelief in those conversations. I&apos;m not sure either of us ever said this explicitly (maybe because of fear of ridicule by the other... because we&apos;re intelligent, rational people, right?), but I&apos;m pretty sure there was an unspoken understanding between us that this &quot;thing&quot; was not built by man. Yet it was definitely intelligently controlled. The conclusion is one I&apos;ve avoided, but which is obvious....I&apos;ve attached a very rudimentary bitmap. I&apos;m not much with any of those paint programs, but it gives you a pretty close idea. However, as I look at what I &quot;drew,&quot; it seems to me that the length should be still longer. Still 6 inches, but the other sides adjusted proportionally down, so that the whole thing would appear longer and thinner, a super fat cigar, almost.By the way, I should tell you, I admire the work your organization is doing, and believe, given what I&apos;ve seen, and given what it seems others have seen, that your hard work will be validated and highly appreciated within the next 50 years.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))", "saw large bright light in wsw sky as well as 3 reddish orange pulsating orbs in southern skyI returned home from shopping and let our three dogs outside at approximately 645pm. I brought them back inside and realized that I had left some items in the car. I went back outside and noticed a very bright light in the WSW above a nearby treeline. I kept looking at it trying to figure out what it might be. I live across the street from a Navy helicopter training field, so I am very familiar with their sights and sounds, but it would have been too late for them to be flying anyway. It wasn&apos;t a plane- it had no blinking lights and did not move like one. It had fringes of red on the left and right sides and what appeared to be &quot;moonbeams&quot; eminating from it. It moved very slowly towards the south. I called my neighbors (to my west) on the phone and asked them to step outside and see if they witness what I was seeing. We stood in their front yard and watched it move away to the south. We watched it for approximately 10 minutes and they went back inside (since the temperature was around 30 degrees). I came back inside my home and thought about what I was seeing. I went back outside and it was still there, but lower in the sky. I went over to my neighbors (to my east), and they stepped outside into the street and also saw it. We watched it for a few minutes, and they went back inside their home. My neighbor (to the east) went online to see if there were any stars that were supposed to be visible, and I told them I would talk to them later to find out. I went back home at this point.At about 730pm, I went back outside to see if the light was still in the sky, but it had disappeared. I walked back over to my neighbors (to the east) to see if she had found out anything on the internet, and as I knocked on their door, I turned towards the SWS, looking over the helicopter training field towards Perdido Bay. I saw three orangish-red pulsating orbs. Two of them were close together, and the third was further to the west. At this point, I noticed that the orbs were fading out slowly, then would reappear in a different spot. They did this independently of each other. My neighbors came to their door and as we stood in their driveway, we all witnessed the orbs fading out then reappearing, moving westerly. They started appearing closer together. One would fade out, and then the other two would fade out. The whole episode lasted approximately two minutes before the orbs disappeared completely.We noticed that air traffic in the area picked up considerably during both episodes- more than usual. There was a distinct difference between the bright light and orbs versus the planes and helicpters that started appearing.My neighbor did say that Scorpius would have been the brightest star in the western sky, but when we came out to look for it, it was no longer there- with no explanation where it disappeared. The bright white light was no star. The three pulsating orbs were not stars. I&apos;m not sure what we all saw last night.", "Triangular UFO with 3 lights on each corner.  No Sound. Low Flight Pattern.It was some time in October of 1989.  My mom &amp; I were driving through our neighborhood, off of Hwy 218.  As we approached our house we saw 3 distinct lights in the sky in the shape of a triangle.  We pulled up into the driveway and got out and walked back down to the street.  We saw the craft moving very slowly from west to east.  It was enormous, maybe the size of a football field.   It made no noise and seemed to block out the sky behind it.  It floated right above the treetops until it disappeared from our sight behind other houses.WSOCTV news that evening reported that they had received calls of similar UFO sightings.

Not flashing, it was like when you have heat coming up from the asphalt and it looks like its twinkling, but its not. Thats what it looked like. The lights where in two lines, an eighty or ninty degree angle. They were concentrated over near the middle tower. This thing was huge. It made the tower look like a toothpick. There isnt any possible thing in the area that could compare to the size of this thing. I pulled off the side of the road and watched it for at least ten to fifteen minutes. It looked like it was just hoovering, barely moving at all. It was just there, thats it. I went back the next morning to see if there was something that could have caused this. There was nothing. The tower is at the top of the mountain. It was a good distance over the tower. It couldn&apos;t have been nothing on the land. What ever this was, it had to have been in the sky.

It was well after dark between 8:00 and 9:00 PM.  As I was driving, I observed (at about the eleven-o&rsquo;clock position on the horizon as I peered out the driver-side windshield) what looked like a very bright and low-hanging star.  It was positioned curiously and directly above a cellular tower.  It was much higher in the sky than the top of the tower, but what I remember was how directly above the tower that it was placed.  I began to watch it more closely.  It grabbed my attention, and I began to sense that it was just a little bit too large to be a star.  I observed this light for approximately 2-5 minutes, and it seemed to drift higher (not obviously noticeably) into the sky as I drove closer to the tower and I eventually passed the tower.  And then, as I was looking directly above at the light, it just blinked out and disappeared.  This was VERY unusual to me, and left me talking to myself in disbelief.  After I saw that, I said to myself that for the first time in my life, I had really seen a UFO. A very short time after this event, I noticed another light which appeared larger and lower to the horizon, and it was located directly to my right, out through the passenger window of my pickup.  I had an even stranger sense that it was something not normal due to its size and location.  It was like it just appeared out of nowhere.  It also appeared like a giant star, and much too close to the horizon to be so, and gave me a weird feeling&mdash;like it was menacing. A short time later, while still watching the light to my right, I could see two or three lights up in the two-o&rsquo;clock position (through the passenger side upper corner of the windshield) and these were much higher than the one on my right.  At this time, it became too dangerous to try and drive and look at all of these lights, so I pulled over to a well-light service station and got out of my vehicle to try and take some photos with my blackberry (which were inconclusive&mdash;lights too small and too far away.)  By this time (approximately 15-minutes since I first saw the light over the cell tower) the largest light to my right had gone away, and I was observing the 2 of 3 remaining lights high above from outside my truck.  One started blinking and moved off, almost like the speed and distance of a satellite.

I have just witnessed an object falling into the atmosphere at 5:08 am this morning(2/15//09).I stepped outside to have a cigarrette, and noticed a glow  travelling due south about 45 degrees above the horizon. it proceeded to fall glowing a bright silver color, with no other color at an unusually slow rate. After about 1.5 seconds it began to dim and then the intense glow faded to see a remnant travelling for another .5-.7 seconds towards the treeline behind the water tower.The trajectory appeared to be heading into the East side over Charlotte, and from my astonomy background appeared unusual because of the relative speed and color. I seemed about 1/2 the speed of most meteor oblects and the duration of visibility after burning also lasted for a longer period. The color was an intense white light that would be a magnitude 5 times brighter than Jupiter ( which is visible just after sunset in the East currently around 7 pm).This could have been a very large meteor that did not burn completely, and the remains may have reached Earth East to South East of Charlotte. This however appeared to be at a slower speed, possibly close to a speed of a visible manmade satellite.

The airport told me that there was nothing flying in the vicinity of binghamton at all.  It did not look like anything I have ever seen or thought existed.  This object made no sound the whole time. I reported this by phone the morning after it happened to the Seattle UFO reporting center.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

The place I was watching from is out in the country, totally dark, and one of the highest spots in Illinois, Wisconsin &amp; Iowa. It is quite easy to tell the difference between satellites and aircraft from this vantage point. It is very dark, very little noise (birds and crickets), and quite secluded.&nbsp; As I watched three satellites move through the sky, I was astounded to see them converge from distant points, and form a triangle, after which they flew off into a different direction.&nbsp; I know satellites are on a specific trajectory, and seeing them leave that trajectory was very surprising.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m just a nurse, not an astronomer, and didn&rsquo;t know about this website, so told a few friends about it, but didn&lsquo;t know where to go from there. Several weeks later, the person whose deck I was watching from (and who laughed at me when I told him about this) was out watching for satellites with me, and we saw the same thing happen, but in a slightly different location in the sky. These sightings looked just like the drawing from Rolla, MO 20:50 hours on April 16, 2007.

At the tail end of the object the yellow tail broke and there were three distinct flowing yellow lights coming out of the back end of the object, like engines.  No noise.  When it appeared it tilted slightly to the left then disappeared again.  While watching this flying object it appeared very small and there was a very bright white led like light in the center of the object.  It is almost like when the object put on the brakes so to speak it appeared and then when it released the brakes it disappeared again.

It was HUGE and for a moment I thought that it could have been Venus, although, I&apos;ve never seen Venus so enormous.  Upon starring at it for a few minutes it appeared to have a red center.  The Asheville Airport is near here so we are familiar with aircraft travel and appearances.  The aircraft from the airport that we did see during this event would pass behind or to the side of this bright object.I called my Mother who lives in Etowah (about 20mins west of my location)  and she said that she also saw the bright light.  We don&apos;t have a telescope so we used binoculars to look closer.  Looking through the binoculars  also appeared to have a red center and trails of yellow which turned blue at the top coming off of it, almost like a meteor or satellite coming into the atmosphere.  However, this changed.  It then began  to appear that what I thought had been trails were surrounding it.  I checked to see how it looked at that point by the naked eye and it appeared to be as I had originally seen it;  just a huge star with a red center.  After being unable to determine what it was I went inside the house and checked back 30 minutes later where it had appeared to have moved latterly across the horizon toward west.  I know that it moved because on first seeing it the object had been right between two trees and on my seconding outing I saw it behind a tree more to the west.I have seen this same light on other occasions but assumed that it was Venus or some gigantic star. If I see it again, I will definitely post again.   Could this be Venus?  Or a satellite falling?", "Bright human/diamond shape seen over the Pacific Ocean from San Diego area then disappearedOn the night of January 17, 2009, a family member pointed out an outstandingly bright light in the sky over the ocean. The night was perfectly clear with not a cloud in sight. Two other family members walked outside and saw the light. I personally stood there for five minutes to gaze at it. At first I thought it was a planet I never recognized before, but I knew that to be false after about fifteen minutes.  At first it was just a bright light, but after staring at the center it looked almost like a cross or even a human shape.  Four spokes (for lack of a better word) sticking out from a main frame.  There were rays of light coming from all sides.  These rays seemed to be rainbow colored and white at different times. It was hard to tell if it was moving or if it was just my eyes, but it seemed like it was moving slightly.  Like I said, about fifteen minutes later the light disappeared and that was the last I saw of it.", "i seen a bright light across the feild, and i asked my dad to look at it, and he said it was probably a plane, but my mom said it was there about 15 min ago.so we look at it through the binoculars, and it was actualy a rainbow, red, yellow, and green. it was changing shape rapidly, and was going up and down in the air. well my dad left for work at about 10:00 and asked if we were still loking at it, and i said well no, it just got really bright, and disapeared, and he said that he had watched it fly through the air, very fast and in the north direction, and it disapeared. keep in mind, my dad is one that doesnt beleive in any other forms of life, aliens, ghost, he doesnt beleive any of it, but he called me and told me what happened. honestly i was really creeped out", "I was on my roof deck admiring the beautiful night. All of a sudden I saw a strange light formation move across the sky. It was a V like object, similar in shape to a formation of flying birds that appeared for about 30 secs and moved steadily across the sky. It traveled in North Easterly direction, passing from Orion belt, under the moon toward Orion&apos;s head.It didn&apos;t appear to be a solid object (like the point of a plane) but was rather like a collection of dim orange lights. It made no noise. It is very difficult to describe its size or how high in the sky it was but it seems like it was as high as the stars and was, very roughly, about the size of 2 Orion&apos;s belts in a V shape.What we saw seems amazing similar to this report:http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/053/S53154.html", "Upside down teardrop hovering over hwy witnessed by others.Heading south on I-85 between Spartanburg and Greenville, SC just past the intersection of I-26 E (also locally known as the crossroads of the south) about 1 mile. As the wolfpack of vehicles I was in ( about 15 vehicles) turned onto a straightaway there was an object in the sky that resembled a lightbulb with the threaded part taken off the lightbulb. It had a texture like the moon but was orange and seemed to have a arua about it like heat rising in the desert, from the bottom to the top..All the vehicles hit there brakes at the same time. Myself and another guy in a truck realizing this may be a one in a million event raced to where the object was over the road. The only time I took my eyes off the object was when I bolted into the emergency lane. As we both approached the object it turned toward the south and flew away with the same heat signature that appeared to surroound the object. It was almost like the orange part that I could see had disappeared when it turned, and the back part of it was the same color as the sky, almost morphing invisible, except for the heat trail. Even though it moved quickly it moved with such fluidity. By the time me and the other guy got to where it was it looked as if it was 20 miles away over Greenville, SC in maybe 30secs to a minute. I pulled over next to the guy and he said what the hell was that? I shrugged my shoulders and he drove away. About 5 minutes later I was home telling my wife what happened. I watched the local news that night and for days and no reports. I just wondered if anyone else may have seen the same as me and the other guy. I have never seen anything like this in any report or pictures anywhere. It appeared to be more biological looking then mechanical.", " We were laying back in our lawn chairs, on a hot July. summer evening at Chickahominy lake, (a desert lake 30 miles south of Burns Oregon) watching the bright stars under a moonless, cloudless, night.While watching a satellite passing overhead, suddenly the whole of the sky flashed, as if a flash bulb had gone off in the heavens.I turned to the wife, and commented, did you see that, and of course she had. We watched the heavens for another hour of so, but never saw it again.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))", "Bright white football shaped object, turned neon green and shot off horizontally  While attending a family Thanksgiving in Los Angeles, CA, our family had booked several rooms at the Four Seasons Hotel on Doheny Blvd, near Beverly Hills. Our room was on the 5th floor. Since our room was in the middle of the hotel it became the meeting place for everyone.The first morning we were there, which was November 26 at about 9 am the room began to shake ever so slightly. We turned on the TV to find that there was a 5.4 earthquake.  We were delighted to have a great story to tell when we got home back to Texas. What happened next, paled in comparison to the earthquake.The last night we were there, Saturday November 28, 1992, we ate out and those of us staying at the hotel came back to pack for Sunday&rsquo;s departure back to our respective homes across the country.  My husband and children went to sleep around 9:30.My two nephews who had other rooms at the same hotel, came to our room to visit.  The room was sort of a one bedroom suite with a separate living area that had a balcony. We went to the balcony at 10:30, I remember because I checked the time and checked on my family who were all asleep.I was on the balcony with my two nephews ( aged 24 and 26) we could see the layout of the area below which was like a courtyard where people were sitting at tables and walking around. We chatted and enjoyed people watching as well.All of a sudden, as if someone on the roof had thrown it, I saw what appeared to be a football shaped object bright white light come down in an arc (it did not fall straight down, it arched from the roof to in front of us) to eye level where it seemed to hover in front of us. I happened to be looking up at the sky or roof when it first appeared so I saw it from the get go.I remember one nephew saying, &quot;What is that?&quot;  The light or whatever it was hovered in front of us for what seemed to be a few seconds then took off like a bullet horizontally and as it did so, it changed color from bright white light to a neon green, with the green advancing from the front to the rear of the object as it changed color, it disappeared into the darkness.Suddenly, we realized it was 3:00 AM, we were sort of surprised that the time flew by, they left to their rooms and we all went right to sleep.The next morning, we gathered our things said our goodbyes and headed to the airport. While on the plane to Dallas, I suddenly remembered and told my husband, &quot;We saw a UFO or something.&quot;  He was quite amazed and had me tell him the whole story.  He found it significant that neither of the nephews had mentioned it, and I had not remembered it when we were all together that morning.My eyes started bothering me beginning that day on the plane ride home. I was seeing spots in front of my eyes like you see after flash photography. I assumed it would go away. By Monday, I was trying to get in touch with my nephews to see what or if they were experiencing something. The younger of the two told his mother who told me that in the night of the sighting, he had a bad nightmare that something had him tied down to a table and was trying to hurt him  By Thursday of the same week, my eyes were somewhat better, but the spots were still there. So, I went to the eye Dr. He checked and said that I had damage similar to an arc welders burn at the back part of the inside of my eye. He asked if I had been near anyone while they were welding. I told him no, not at all. He said the spots would go away in a few more days and they eventually did.When I was finally able to speak to my nephews about our experience, neither really wanted to discuss it other than to say it was the strangest thing they&rsquo;d ever seen.  Neither of them could understand why it was 10:30 then 3:00 and why time flew by, furthermore none of us could understand why we all seemed to forget about it completely until I remembered. The nephew that had the nighmare said he didn&rsquo;t want to talk about it, so I dropped it.Page 2 UFO Experience cont&rsquo;d.I became obsessed with this experience.  Since the Internet was not available at the time, I went to the Dallas Public Library. I asked the Librarian how to report a UFO. She turned to a reference book, and gave me two names.  The first of which was in Phoenix, AZ. To this day, I cannot remember the man&rsquo;s name. I called him and he took down the incident.  He may have had me make a drawing and mail it or fax it to him.He had the oddest monotone voice, very deep but without emotion or inflection.  He assured me he would look into it.  A few weeks later, he called me and told me that he went to the Four Seasons, he actually stayed in our room (back then I knew the room number and gave it to him-now I can only remember 5th floor) he said that in daylight, the direction at which the bright white object that turned green went on the horizontal level would have taken it into a shopping mall on Robertson Blvd. He said that was not logical.Furthermore, he said that green lights are a phenomenon that occurs around earthquakes and have nothing to do with UFO&rsquo;s.   His conclusion was that what we saw were those lights.Obviously, I forgot this man&rsquo;s name because he did not tell me what I wanted to hear.  He did not validate what we knew we saw, a UFO.  We knew it was a UFO and have known all this time. He had no explanation as to why the object changed color from white to green as it went horizontal and shot off faster than I can type it.We know what we saw was a UFO.  We were not UFO buffs at the time.  This thing or even seeing it was the farthest thing from our minds.  What I do know is this thing to me was real. It was an experience I will never forget, and it opened my mind to the fact that we are not alone.As a sidebar to this experience, when I took the film from our California trip to be developed the girl that was working at the photo shop asked me who was my trip.  Well, I told her all about the UFO. She told me that on her way to work a week earlier she saw a diamond shaped UFO which seemed to follow her from Plano, Texas, (along FM 544) to Carrollton, Texas, which is where the photo processing store was. Not just her, but suddenly I found out I knew other people who had seen UFO&rsquo;s right here in our area.If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.", "Unusually fast and triangular shaped craft with red and green flickering lights underneathOn Monday night, Jan. 19th my wife and I saw a triangular shaped craft flying unusally fast over our apartment complex.  The craft had a triangular shaped silhouette woth an unusual lighting pattern on the bottom and to the rear.  This pattern of lights were mostly red and green and flickered across as if they were blinking on in sequence.

I also know what a plane/jet looks like when the sun is beyond the horizon and reflecting on it and running lights. More over I know the sound. This thing had no sound from the moment I first saw it to well after it passed from the point where I could see it (I went out doors to find it again).Simply put, an unusually clean white coloured craft less than a quarter inch in size (to my eyes) flew a full 180 degrees across my field of view in less than 10 seconds.

As we drove past, there were no lights on the back side of whatever it was.  Then the light was back, then gone again.

It was completely silent.  It moved in one direction for approximately 4-5 seconds and then disappeared.

It slowed, and sped up a couple times, then my heart started racing when I saw it make really tight turns, circling and darting in different directions.

While on the phone with my mother, I noticed several strange objects in the sky.  I counted as many as six in all.  The objects appeared to be of several different shapes, however I could only clearly see 1 craft in particular, and i will attempt to describe the others by their light patterns.The most visable object was one in which the shape and light patterns appeared to morph. It started off as a round object with a single light, then went to an triangular shape with three different lights. It then morphed again into an oval possessing 6 lights, and finally a cross shaped object of eight lights. It moved at a constant, slow speed across the sky and traveled directly above me.The second most visable object was a very bright object which seemed to hover, and would during the duration of the sighting appear either farther away of closer and at varying points across the sky. However, this object did remain within a small patch of sky and did not deviate from it.The other objects I will divide into two catagories. The first catagory is what would best be described as &quot;Firecracker&quot; like objects. These objects would appear to &quot;blink&quot; and would then reappear at a different point in the sky. these objects traveled in a very erratic pattern and at very fast speeds. They apeared to possess one light each, and the light would change colors from yellow, white, and red at random. Approximately 3 were seen.The second group can best be described as &quot;slow and steady&quot;. These objects moved slowely across the sky, but with an erraticness that could not be explained. Their light was constant, appearing white or red in the sky. Approximately 2 were seen.It sould be noted that I live on a waterway which emptes into the Atlantic Ocean and that there is a Powerplant on the body of water. There were also a good amount of aircraft that appeared after the sighting.((NUFORC Note:  The date indicated is flawed, so we have assigned a date above, which we assume is the correct one.

I always think about this experience even though its been over 20 years ago and really started to think about it after that police dash cam caught that light in the sky recently... that is exactly what me and a few friends saw out in the country while playing outside. We all were around 16 years old and in pitch darkness or at least hardly any light. It was very late and all of the sudden the whole sky lighted up like daytime and we all could see each other. It was so weird and we talked about it after but we never told anyone as we were kids and just thought it was a big meteorite.... I however have it etched in my mind that it was way way to bright for a meteor. It brought light as if it was daytime. The ground and everything lit up as if it was daytime. It was almost as bright as the sun or so it seemed. We actually could see each other for about 10 to 20 seconds. If you ever heard about this incident, I would really like to know what it was. I am not sure about the date but it was either in 81, 82 or possibly 83. I think it was closer to 82.  I also had another strange thing happen in a dream I had about a UFO one night. I used to live by fresno state college and one night had a dream about a ufo. The next day there was a crop circle in the field that was part of fresno states ag department. It happened right about the time that the movie &apos;signs&apos; was coming out about the ufo crop circles. They said it was a college prank but I thought it was strange that I would have a dream about it the night before it was seen. The dream was very strange and I could actually see the craft. The next day it was found. They would not let anyone in the field to view the evidence and threatened to prosecute any students that destroyed the crops. They said it was a prank but never caught anyone and never let anyone in the field to view the evidence.

It was about 10:30 pm, and my mom was driving the car, my sister was in the back asleep. We were on the highway, and there were plenty of airplanes flying around. The sky was cloudy so instead of it being a dark blue/black color, it was sort of light purple and I could easily see the shapes of all of the airplanes against the night sky.hen I saw something flying that didn&rsquo;t look like an airplane at all. It was triangular shaped and had an off-white light on each corner. It was flying very close to the ground and didn&rsquo;t produce any noise. We drove almost directly under it. What struck me as most interesting was that it was flying in a straight line, at a constant medium speed, but was spinning around at the same time. At first all I saw were three lights spinning around, but as it got closer I saw that it was a triangle. It wasn&rsquo;t large at all, and it looked to be about the size of a small commercial airplane, or even a jet. One of the lights on it was blinking as well. It was flying across the highway when I saw it, and I stared at it until it disappeared behind the trees on the sides of the highway. However, it didn&rsquo;t look like it landed. I only saw one. I saw many other airplanes after that, including commercial airplanes, jets, and small individually owned ones, but none of them had the same shape, light color, or light blinking pattern as the triangular flying object did.I have always been interested in UFO&apos;s and have believed in aliens for quite a while, and this definitely looked like something that I&apos;ve seen on UFO shows. In the past I thought that I&apos;d seen UFO&apos;s before, but it took me only a few seconds to realize that it was an airplane. This aircraft however showed no signs of being one.", "Slient craft shines light on meI was camping with my family and my cousin and I were sitting around the fire when we saw a light in the sky.

The campground is very quite so even the slightest engine rumble would have been detected but I heard nothing. It fly directly above us and as it passed it shined a light down(mabey a spotlight).

The sun had set and the sky was almost dark but still had a slight glow to the sky. The balloon object; no lights,  was flying away from my position like a knuckle ball at about the 2:00 o&apos;clock position, but the wind was blowing into my face from the north.

I am absolutely convinced that due to the speed, color, and brightness that this was absolutely not a plane or helicopter.", "red flashing object moving over chicagoi was facing east and saw a red flashing light object in the sky heading south. it slowly turned back west/north, then headed east and slowly disappeared out of sight after a minute heading towards lake Michigan.", "1991 - Bedford, Pa-Triangular-3 Red Lights-Ship rotated to it&apos;s side-20-25 minutesI was pulling in my driveway from work and had just parked, when i sighted 3 lights above the mountain top.  As i moved to the house, I noticed that the lights started moving towards me.  My guess is that it was about an 40 yard walk.  The object drew nearer to my house at a very steady rate.  I ran about 10 yards to the door just being freaked out.Out of panic i rushed in and yelled for my father who was sitting in his chair.  He immediatley got up and both of us proceeded to go out on front porch.  At my surprise the object was directly above us.  This is where my opinions differ from other reports.As the object flew from the mountains it looked flat, like the oters reported, all 3 lights were horizantal.  When we got out on the porch, the object was above us and the lights were then vertical, as if it completely turned on it&apos;s side.  There was no noise.   The object seemed to be about the length of a football field. I ran into house to get a video recorder which is where this got scary.When I returned to the porch, lights still there, it was like an ery feeling in the air.  We had a barn with horses in it. These horses (apprx. 4) were screaming-not normally.  They were kicking the walls.  There screams were terrorizing and as this continued there were also dogs up the road that were carring on too! As i went to record this the object just vanished. within minutes everything seemed back to normal. This is something that my father as well I, have never discussed with anyone! One out of fear of what we saw and heard, two--the normal, we&apos;re nuts column.We lived in Centreville, PA along rt 220 (I-99). Between 2 mountains-- one is called Wills Mountain, not sure of the other.  There are also 2 dams thereas well. (Koont&apos;z Lake). Centreville lies between Bedford, Pa (about 15 miles) and Cumberland, Md (about 15 miles).  It&apos;s a very small town, mostly farm and woodlands.I do not live here no more but do live in Bedford, Pa.  My father resides in Cumberland, Md.These statements ARE true. The lights were big red circlular lights.  I have never seen an aircrat of that size-speed-or quiteness. Nor one that would turn sideways and just hover there with no noise.Again, thanks for your time to read, i am not looking for publicity. I have seen multible reports of similar objects and wanted to add this viewing. Again thank you!((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))", "Light beam in New York City sky.At around 8:00 pm I was walking to my apartment in Astoria, Queens.  I was headed east.  I looked up into the sky and I saw an orange beam of light that had a stretched oval shape travel across the sky from north to south.  This light was traveling much more quickly than an airplane would.  It appeared in the sky for about two seconds and then it vanished.", "i was driving down the highway and saw a blue orb that disappeared when i focused on it.I was going down 2818 (which is a highway by my house) and I looked up in the sky to see if any planes were going to land,because its by an airport.  I looked up and saw nothing,and kept driving.  I then looked up again and saw a blue circular light, first thinking it was a small airplane landing, then taking a second look.When i focused on the light with my eyes it sped away to fast for me to see where it was going.  The light seemed to just disappear into nothing. My eyes immediately began to water, i wasn&apos;t crying and my eyes weren&apos;t irritated;they just started watering.  I got goosebumps and called my mom. When she tried to call me back there was a call failed message,and then a weird sound.", "three bright lights different colours, changing shapes.About 19:30 hour. On the 27/01/2008. I was looking out over my back garden, when I saw a bright light in the sky, apron south/ east, about  50 degrees high. When i looked closer i could see three of them. I went in to get the vid cams, and started filming, The first light.  the brightest was like a plasma ball. With an electric storm inside of it. The one to the east, same elivation. Was like a blue diamond, then a blur, then a jet shape, and was morphing all over the place. The other one was west, and was a little bit higher, this was about, 65 degrees high. And was multi coloured, red green bright blue and intence white. And was morphing.  I have a good few hours of dvd video and 8mm footage of this event. And would appreciate some one to look at this footage as it is not a star. I do not know where else  to send this footage. Would like advice.", "Boomerang type object hovvering silently right above the treetops.My friend and I were laying on the ground outside of another friends house. There was nothing to do so we decided to just look at the stars and talk about stuff. As we layed there, a boomerang shaped object approached from the right side of us. It had five lights on it. The lights on the object were perfect circles. They were dim, orange, yet a little yellow. At first I was shocked by the object, then I realized it must be a UFO. I shook my friend, however, it was like he was in a deep sleep. I turned my head back up to the object and it grew into four fingerlike objects, but yet they were all conjoined at the climax. Now the object had twelve lights. All of them were still the same color and the same form. There were three lights on each fingerlike connector. There was no sound while this object passed us. It gracefully passed by as if it was trying to sneak by. Then it shot into the sky leaving a brightly colored trail behind it. No sound at all. Finally my friend woke up and i asked him if he saw it. He said no and that he was asleep.", "There was a very bright Crescent shape light  as wide as a house that faded into a smaller red/orange light.I was drawn to look out of my living room window at approx 23:00 hrs. There was a very bright Crescent shape light about 1/2 mile into the woods just under the tree line and as wide as a house.I live just north of the Baton Rouge metro airport and thought it was a plane. I walked outside to get a better perspective. I realized there was no sound. If this was a plane it would have been rattling my house. Not to mention, it would have been moving. It was completely stationary. It just hovered there in the woods and began to change the color of a harvest moon (orange). The brightness of the light was not as intense as this time passed.By this time I decided to get my video camera to show my husband what I saw. While I was scrambling to find it, the light was fading. The camera disc was full. So, I just stood and watched it shrink smaller and fade into a red/orange light the size of my hand.It was strange how it shrunk and faded. It just faded down to the center of the original light source. no sounds, just complete silence. The whole thing lasted about 10-15 min. Then the light was gone.We are in the winter season here and the trees are bare from hurricane Gustav and the cold. So the visiblity through the woods was pretty clear.My father is retired Chief of police for the Baton Rouge airport. I called he to see if this could have been some sort of exercise, runway lights, something. He said I lived too far north of the airport to experience any of these things. So that&apos;s why I am reporting this Unidentified hovering light experience. I even checked to see if there was a lunar eclipse that night, Since what I witnessed was in the west.", "It looked like a huge star, but far to close, and way to brightaround 6:30 pm pacific time I notice what appeared to just be a star but was exceptionally larger and brighter it was in a fixed position in the sky due west from where I live in Clarkston Washington but I could see what looked like alternating red and blue inside the brightness it had to have been just outside the stratosphere if not in it. I continued staring at it for another thirty minutes and it didn&rsquo;t move at all except for the amazingly bright light it was giving off. I called my brother outside and he originally said &ldquo;that big star&rdquo; then realized it utterly dwarfed any other visible star in the sky I went inside about 7:00 pm or a few minutes after and when I looked out the window at 8:10 it was no where in the sky. Upon mentening  my sighting the following day  ( 1-16-09 ) I&rsquo;ve talked to three other people who saw the same strange big bright light in the sky.  I work as a night front desk person at a motel and am always looking at the stars, yet I have never seen something like that before.", "I was driving west and as I approached the river I saw a cluster of lights (red and white, flashing) directly above the east bound bridge on the other side of the small river. My first thought was that there must have been lights attached to antennas above the new bridge station because it was very low and hovering above the bridge. (At this time I could see no solid shape, only the lights.)  As my road turned, I could see that this was now slowly moving closer (northeasterly) and was in fact a narrow triangular shaped object.  At one point I could see underneath the object clearly and it appeared to be very large, gray or silver with a completely flat bottom and had a series of two lights at each point of the triangle, flashing red, white and now I could see blue as well.  It also seemed to be very quiet as I am used to planes and helicopters in our area, but this did not make the noise like they do at this low of an altitude. (This object was only between 7-10 stories up and I could not hear any sound from it.) I was not in an area to pull over and my destination was less than a mile away. I could still see it slowly moving east-northeast above the hills.Upon reaching my destination I could still see the flashing lights very small in the distance directly eastward, but no longer moving. At this time I told another of what I saw and we watched for another few minutes with binoculars as this flashing never moved. The lights were still flashing over the hill when I left at 7:35 PM.I have been completely shocked that there has not been any talk about this in our local media. I simply cannot believe others did not see this too as I was not the only one on that road and there are many homes in the area.", "I WAS PLAYING AT MY FRIEND&apos;S HOME AFTER SUPPER AND HER MOTHER WORRIEDLY REMINDED ME IT WAS LATER THAN SHE REALIZED.

I was walking across 6th street to the store, when I heard a group of people yell &quot;woah&quot;.  They were looking up and a red glowing disk had dropped from a bright star.  It streaked through the sky to my left, then white lights started comming slowly toward it from far away, they were military jets I presume.  The red craft did a quick 90 degree turn and shot in a matter of seconds into outer space/disapeared.

The light was very low compared to the height of most air craft in the area.  We continued to watch the light as we drove home and the light continued to remain in the same place.Once we arrived home, I walked to the pasture, with my wife and continued to watch the light for several more minutes.   My wife grew bored and went into the house.  I continued to watch the light for about 15 to 20 more minutes until clouds moved in around the light and the light grew dimmer, due to the clouds.  I continued to watch the light until it faded away.The light did bob in the air and I guess it to have been ten to fifteen miles away.  While watching the light, I saw two air craft fly past the light, although the air craft appeared to be further away from me.  The size of the light was difficult to determine given the distance although it did appear to be as large as a normal commercial plane, although the light was very bright, brighter than what I would expect to see and have seen in the past on commercial planes.  I did not see any wings, flashing lights or any other indicator that would have made me think it was a plane, besides the fact it remained in the same place for about 30 minutes.I was standing at 32degrees 39&rsquo;07.61&rdquo;N and 96degrees 17&rsquo;27.92&rdquo;W, looking almost due west.  The light was visible just over the trees and as stated previously, much lower than any aircraft I have seen in the past.I attempted to contact the Naval Air Station and the Dallas Fort Worth International Airport, both to no avail.  I am not a UFO buff, not even sure that I buy into the whole UFO thing, although I know that what I saw and watched for quite some time, was not normal and did not act like any aircraft I have ever seen in this area or any other area.((NUFORC Note:  Venus.

It was a cloudless night here in Eastern Oahu, Hawaii. I had been looking at Venus, then looking for the Milky Way.When I looked up at Orion, I saw a flash of light. I waited, and soon it flashed again. It was positioned &quot;above&quot; Orion&apos;s Left &quot;shoulder&quot; (West-North-West+-) or the right side of Orion as you look at it (Orion was lying on his right side).When it blinked again I began to count. I counted to seven between blinks, some were dimmer, some brighter. I went inside to try to find a place to report it or look it up if it was a satellite, to no avail, for half an hour. When I went back outside it was no longer visible (8:15). It did NOT appear to be moving, or, it may have been moving VERY slowly. I&apos;ve watched satellites before, seen them traveling West to East and North to South. I know there are geostationary satellites, but I&apos;ve never seen a blinking one before.My best guess is a rocket booster that became geostationary (since others have seen it in the same position) and as it turns end-over-end it also spins and some sides may reflect better. Then perhaps it &apos;disappeared&quot; as it entered Earth&apos;s Shadow?  I did explore other websites, and on ATS (Above Top Secret) people in Africa, Texas and Finland described EXACTLY what I saw.", "Large unidentified object located only 100-150 ft. above us, diamond shape, four dominant lightsMy brother, his girlfriend, her sister, and I were returning from running errands on Friday 1/12/09.  ((sic.  January 23))  We were coming back down Kellers Church Road which is the road that runs directly behind my house.  Before making a left into my development, we noticed two distinct lights in the distance.  It was 5:59 PM because my brother had called his friend Matt right when we noticed it.  We initially thought it was a plane that was making an emergency landing or crashing because it was so low to the ground.  From where we were, I would say we were only a mile or two away from this object.  So, before we turned into my neighborhood we decided to continue down Kellers Church to figure out what this object was.  We went over a small bridge, went around a bend on the left and then another on the right where Scott Road and Kellers Church Road meets.  We went through a set of woods, and in the middle of it was a clearing.  In that clearing we saw an unidentifiable object which all of us had never seen anything like it before. We were SW of the object, and it was directly above the tree line, just sitting there hovering.  It could have not have been anymore than 150 ft. above the tree line, which is incredibly low.  We decided to come to a stop to try to figure out what this object was.  It appeared to have a diamond shape, with four lights on each angle.  There was an obvious dominant light on the front of the craft.  My brother tried to make out a video of the object using my camera phone for about 30 seconds, but nothing appeared on the screen.  My brother and his girlfriend&rsquo;s sister both felt the object had recognized that we were in its presence. The front light then appeared to be shifting towards us.  My brother immediately told his girlfriend to please go, because none of us knew what this object was capable of.  She hit the gas and we proceeded through the rest of the wooded area.  We kept an eye on the bright light as we traveled in a circle so we could return.  As we were driving I turned arou! nd and c learly saw a spherical dome shape structure on top of the diamond that stood still, while the body was still shifting.  We went up the hill which led to a connecting road.  We made a right and continued to try and follow the object, but by the time we were back to our original location, which could have only been 5 minutes max, the object was out of sight.  We couldn&rsquo;t find it anywhere.  The only thing we could see above were normal blinking, red tinted planes.  It was nothing we couldn&rsquo;t identify normally.  This was something that none of us in the car had ever seen in our entire lives.  The engine also did not have any sound.  My brothers girlfriends&rsquo; sister described the only noise coming from the hovering object was a humming sound.", "2 ufo&apos;s parallel to each other descending,zooming diagonally,disppearing and reappearing,First I saw 2 ufo&apos;s parallel to each other.Then another one appeared and was flashing then all of them started to move,but there was one in partically that boggled my mind it was descending,zooming diagonally,disppearing and reappearing, they were moving faster than any plane, helicopter, or jet.It looked like there were moving at the speed of light to reappear then dissappear wasn&apos;t like anything i&apos;ve every saw.Then they started to proceed south coming from the western sky&apos;s,then dissappeared into the night.", "Bright green light above the mass pike. Fell to ground then disappeared.Me and Roommate were driving down the mass pike when out of no where this really bright green light showed up in the middle of the sky and then started to drop like a shooting star, while it was falling it disappeared. neither one of us has ever seen anything like it.

PD))((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))", "First off, I apologize for the length of the &quot;report&quot; however, it took quite sometime for me to actually be interested enough to find out where/how to make a report.  Mainly, I have heard many stories in my life of ghosts and UFO&apos;s.  I&apos;m not one to believe everything I hear.  Until recently, that&apos;s been my view.  So, skeptic?, absolutely, believer?, still working on that one.Here is my past, I&apos;ve been in the Marine Corps for nine years and 8 months.  I am an operator of a type of Amphibious Assault Vehicle. Google: AAV for more information.  Deployed to the Asias, Iraq and several Floats (stationed aboard Navy Ships).  During these times, I have literally flown in every single type of helicopter that can carry a human being, CH (Cargo Helicopter).  Due to my type of &quot;Job&quot;, I have come into contact with most AH (Attack Helicopter)types.  Reason why I&apos;m saying this is, I know how they sound.  It&apos;s kind of a show-off technique that I can name most Helo&apos;s by the sounds of their rotors.  Each one, each type, each speed approximately can be relatively determined by the the sound of the rotors and how many rotors they have.  I can also fairly judge the distance and estimate where and abouts their &quot;buddy&quot; is, since no single helo can fly alone, there is always a buddy located nearby. Also, I know what loud vehicles sound like, sounds can identify many things without seeing them.  My times in Iraq fine-tuned my ability to identify sounds, especially while on patrol.  All this being said, here is my account of what I have seen and heard of through my military career.During MCT (Marine Combat Training), approximately 15101999 0200, we experienced an earthquake. My instructor was livid in the morning, his truck which he had parked off the side of the road was rattled off the cliff.  Yes, a cliff.  You can imagine the pain we experienced that morning, he was quite mad.  Later on that evening, the instructors were commenting on the report given by the firewatch during that time.  Apparently, a helo came hovering by at a rapid speed.  When asked how fast, &quot;it was fast&quot; was given the answer.  Now consider, the Marine was probably 18 and never exposed to such things until then.  So &quot;fast&quot; in Marine terms: It was flying at ridiculous speed.  I know, I was young once too and would have said the same thing.  Also, he said it made weird sounds and was close enough he could have thrown a rock at it before it dipped into the valley.  Camp pendleton has numerous valley and hills.  Later that day, when asked, no one felt the earthquake and still, no one has really been able to explain how the instructors truck was pushed off a cliff sideways, when nothing else moved nearby.  I would think that if a truck could be rattled and shaken enough to move it sideways, things around us, such as ourselves since we slept on isomats on the ground would have moved also.  I think I would have awoken when I felt another man pressed up against me!  At the time and still to this day, it&apos;s a funny as hell story. Looking back though, it&apos;s always intrigued me just how...odd it really sounds.Next account, jets don&apos;t fly over pendleton unless it&apos;s when the President or another very high staff member comes to pendleton.  Due to the runways limited size here, it&apos;s a helicopter Air Wing, few planes land on the runway.  Mainly small jet type passenger planes.  So, when something flies over your car, on Basilone road, at the speed of a jet, you take notice.  Especially when it&apos;s about a hundred feet over your car.  Basilone road is a road that cuts through base from I-5 to vandergrift rd.  A very long and lonely stretch of road at 2 am in the morning.  That&apos;s what time I was Designated Driver to 2 friends coming back from the bar.  This was around Christmas time the same year as the one account prior to this one, 1999.Next account, a close friend borrowed my car to go see his girlfriend in San Clemente.  The drive from Oceanside to San Clemente is about 20-25 minutes on the I-5.  When he came back that night to give me my keys, he said the strangest thing happened, a bright green ball of light flew along the coast, up and over the car, then headed back over to the coast, the entire time heading in a northerly direction.  He said it flew way faster than a helicopter and when it was about 1000 meters off to the side and in front of him, the thing just &quot;took off&quot;.  Faster than he had ever seen anything go. His girlfriend, now wife, said exactly the same thing and she was &quot;totally freaked out&quot;.  On a side note, the stretch of highway has few lights where this happened.  What lights there are, do not reflect green off your windows.  That was my first assumption until driving down the same highway several times over the years, at different times, and I have NEVER seen any type of green light reflection.  Only yellow or white.In Okinawa, Camp Schwab, I was snorkeling with several friends at Naha island, about 1000 meters from shore.  I&apos;m sure Naha Island is not the actual name, just our name for it. Naha means south.  There is an area on this island where it&apos;s covered and is quite cozy and perfect to have a sort of camp fire party.  In other words, it&apos;s canopied and we could have a fire and get very, very drunk without anyone seeing us or caring to swim out there to investigate.  Around midnight, some of us went to the closest cliff to &quot;relieve ourselves&quot;.  The cliff faced away from base. While, doing this, one of my buddies who was apparently gazing up at the stars in a slight stupor, pointed out, &quot;Holy shit man, you see that?&quot;  Yes, that is exactly what he said, still funny to this day. We all looked up and about 2000-4000 meters above us,  It&apos;s sort of hard to judge distance slightly intoxicated, there were three lights spinning but not spinning...it was like they were rotating about 45 degrees and back again but 75 degrees that time.  Thinking about it now, I don&apos;t think it was rotating as in parallel to the ground but was an illusion.  I think now that it was more or less tilting in different directions. What ever it was, if the lights were separate craft, I have never seen helo&apos;s do that in such perfect unison.  Odd thing was, it didn&apos;t just &quot;shoot off&quot;, it moved slowly away from base, over the ocean until it was gone.Next account, flying back from Okinawa a few years later, around 2003, I looked out the window of the plane and saw several objects off to our left moving the opposite direction of us.  Probably around a mile.  Could have been planes.  They had to have been larger than C-130&apos;s and were definitely not passenger planes, unless they fly escort for one another.  Reason why I know they weren&apos;t C-130&apos;s, they were large.  Huge would be a better adjective. While in Iraq, I did see a Hercules plane. That was about how big those craft were.  Could have been that but still, I&apos;m pretty sure I would have been able to see the shape of the wings.  Those planes are massive. Either way, I thought I would include this one since it is a iffy situation.Next account, Al Anbar Province, Iraq. I was on a night raid in a village in Bubaydah. I&apos;m sure that spelling is incorrect. I was in the turrent of a Humvee. My LtCol asked me what the hell are those Helo&apos;s doing here. This was a very important operation, Helo&apos;s do not fly close to a &quot;snatch and grab&quot; for obvious reasons. My captain got on the hook and radio&apos;ed whoever it is they radio to find out who and why someone was compromising our mission. Radio reply was they didn&apos;t know but be advised, jets are inbound. Bebeydah is very very close to the Syrian border, cause for alarm was very just. I was watching the light for about 5-10 minutes. During that specific time, it just sort of moved around, like it was searching for something. It was about 5 miles distant, 1000 meters altitude. It was bobbing and weaving. Acting much the way a Helo would during a sweep mission. Then I noticed, where is his buddy? If it was a Cobra, a Huey would be flying at a higher altitude and a little distance. If it was a &quot;Huey, then the cobra should have been able to be seen around it. Cobras are difficult to see unless their light is facing you and at that distance, it would have to face us for us to see it. It could have been there. That&apos;s what I was thinking. When the jets arrived, thankfully not over the city, they closed in on the Helo. I swear to this day, I saw them shoot rockets at it. I saw four contrails following the glow of four rockets headed straight for it. I know what rockets look like at night, you can see the smoke through the burn of the rocket, it lights it up, hard to explain typing but, I know what a rocket looks like. When those rockets got close to the Helo, they just lost power and fell. Still moving forward, I&apos;m sure of that, inertia and all but, it was the craziest thing I have ever seen, the burners just stopped, when that happens, usually an explosion can be seen, not this time. They just winked out. When this happened they were about 3 miles away. The Helo, and I&apos;m calling it that because, it could! have be en at this point, started chasing one of the jets. Not really chasing it because it would fly in front of it, behind and then under it. I then realized, this wasn&apos;t a helo. Helo&apos;s don&apos;t fly as fast as a jet, especially maneuvering like that. Common sense does replace rationality eventually. After about 3 minutes of this &quot;taunting&quot; it flew off. Simple as that, no explosions, only sound was the jets. Eventually, they took off back to where they came from. This occured in 2006.So, that&apos;s my experiences. I have heard of many many more. Specifically the lights that follow you and pass you on the I-5 going to LA. I&apos;ve heard probably 10-20 accounts of that. As I said, I&apos;m a skeptic. Not really one to accept an explanation without hard facts but, I also know, if the facts don&apos;t add up, then how do you explain it? I&apos;ve seen some odd things and usually at the time, I blow it off. The incident in Iraq pretty much made me reassess those situations that I kind of didn&apos;t really care about the first time. Thinking back, I should have looked a little closer and took notes a little better. So, I think you should possibly check into sightings over Camp Pendleton, especially along the coast. On another side note, my fiance was telling me about how she saw a craft rise out of the ocean from her house. She on the other hand, fully believes in greys, white&apos;s or blues, whatever color they are referred to as. She is a conspirasist to the utmost degree. Needless to say, I really don&apos;t take her seriously, but, she apparently has seen some things while living in Carlsbad that she explains as UFO&apos;s. She also said something about Illinois but I hate to say, I kind of tune her out after awhile.Thank you for reading this and I hope it somewhat helps you out.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

At about 5:17 pm, &quot;Harvey&quot; noticed a strange moving bright light and brought it to &quot;Steve&apos;s&quot; attention.  Quickly, they stepped onto the deck and both observed the object for about a minute, sharing a pair of Bushnell 7x35 binoculars for a closer look.The object, about 35 degrees above the horizon, appearing bigger than a star or planet but smaller than the moon, was moving quickly and soundlessly on a level path from south to north, eventually disappearing behind a cloud.  The object was orange in color, glowing softly in the setting sun, and was shaped like a slightly elongated ball or globe, although rounder on the top and flatter on the bottom.  No empennage or other features were noted.  There was some kind of secondary motion seen, as if the object might have been pulsating or rotating.", "West Texas to Carlsbad, NMThis was told to me by my mother and my uncle.  Sometime in the summer of 1952 or 1953 my family was in a two car caravan going from Texas to California.   At the time, it was fashionable to have a spotlight like police cars on your car.  The lead car was my mom and dad.  The second car was my dad&rsquo;s childhood friend to whom I refer to as my uncle, but he is just a family friend.My mother said they were traveling at night, the time was about 3 am. This sighting occurred between midnight and 3 am. She kept waking up and noticed a bright reddish orange light at a distance. It seemed to be tracking the cars. The road was a two lane road somewhere between Pecos, Texas and Carlsbad, NM.She finally woke up at 3 am and told my dad that that light has stayed right along with them for at least two hours and many miles. She said no way it could be a water tower beacon after so much time had elapsed. He would speed up, it would speed up. He would slow down, it would seemingly slow down.Finally, they stopped in the middle of the dark desolate road. My uncle in the car behind stopped and they all stood in the middle of the road wondering what in the heck the thing could be. So, my uncle set his spotlight on the object, and it took off and away from them at breakneck speed. They were all horrified and amazed, but continued their trip to California.When they arrived at Long Beach, California, my mother said she bought a newspaper and read an article that the day before something flew over several sunbathers on the back that same day.My dad never wanted to discuss it. Years later, I asked my uncle about it and he said it was indeed a true experience and it happened the way my mother told me.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I had just gone to bed, and happened to be looking at the stars from my bedroom window.  I saw what I thought was a meteor&hellip;.At that point it was traveling from the  south to north. It was orange and had a tail.  I jumped up out of the bed, to see where it was going to hit, because it was close.The strangest thing happened at that point.  It stopped in mid-air, and the tail appeared to disappear within the object.  It hovered for a few seconds and then turned to the east and disappeared over Saddleback Mountain.I ran down the stairs to tell my husband what I saw, and of course, he told me, &quot;Go back to sleep.&quot;  Well, I had only been in bed for a few minutes and was not sleeping or dreaming.It was frustrating not to be believed, but the next morning, the news,  might have been KFI as I like that station, it was that reported a UFO was  seen over Fountain Valley.  I said:  &quot;There, do you believe me now?&quot;  He didn&rsquo;t say anything.It was reported on the radio that there were several military planes in the vicinity, and they attempted to chase it, but it disappeared so quickly over the mountains that they realized there was no way they could follow it at the speed it was going.It was seen over Arizona, and New Mexico within minutes.  I have no idea what I was looking at, but since I was listening to KFI again this evening, it was urged that I report what I saw.  This is what I saw.  I still am amazed by it. I have never seen the likes of it before, or after that night.", "We were standing by our car parked at Anjean, WV, waiting for my brother after a good day of ruff grouse hunting.  The first saucer came out of little clear creek into big clear creek and stopped about 15 feet off the ground while hovering for a couple of minutes about 150 feet from our location.  Then another saucer followed and stopped about 10 feet above the first one.  Both craft were identical (30 ft in diam and 10 ft high) being silver clad with large (3-4 sq-ft lights) around and encircleing the perimeter of the craft. The lights were impressive as they were very bright red, blue, and yellow lights.  This was a very beautiful sight to behold.  After a few minutes, the craft moved up big clear and over the mountain at the head of the hollow while our bird dogs (english setters) barked at them.", "Saw 6 UFOs in 3 sightings and got 3 pictures of the objects.I had to look after my Uncles house in a village just outside of the town I live in. Me and my brothers were in my Uncles paddock when we had our first sighting. One evening we saw 2 white round objects moving across the sky. The sky was clear with no clouds and there was no wind. One object was bigger than the other. The objects were white like a bolt of lightning, that kind of light. These objects were silent and we watched them move across the sky until we couldn&apos;t see them anymore. When we first saw them the small object was behind the bigger object but it was moving a bit faster so it over took the big object. The objects moved at a steady speed, not fast or slow but fast enough to travel across the sky in a few minutes. The big object was about the size of a full moon and the smaller one about 1/5th of that size. The objects were quite far away, at least thousands of feet and didn&apos;t appear very high in the sky. We didn&apos;t know what these objects were.After this sighting we borrowed my dads camera just incase we saw anything else while we were looking after my uncles house. On the last night at my uncles we were outside, it was a clear night with no wind and my brothers were messing about taking pictures and getting the typical Orbs in them which are mostly caused by moisture and dust, later that night there was an intense fog and we think the moisture in the air caused the Orbs in the photos we got. After being outside for a while we saw something coming towards us flashing a bright white light. The object was round, silent and moving slowly and we didn&apos;t know what it was so we got a picture of it as it was overhead. As we got the picture of it we noticed another one coming which was identical to the first. As this second object was overhead we noticed a smaller white object travelling with it that wasn&apos;t flashing and we took a picture. The way the bigger objects would flash was that the entire object would flash a white light, the light would decrease and go out, then the light would increase and flash and keep doing this in a regular period of time. It was only after we saw these objects that we realized how strange they were. We had never seen anything like them, couldn&apos;t think of anything they could be either. They were low in the sky and moved in a straight line. Its likely that these objects were the same we saw the previous night but this time the bigger objects were flashing and there was 1 more of them.Then on the last day I was at my uncles house my brothers had gone home and I was waiting for my uncle to come back. I was outside smoking a cigarette, I had the camera with me because of the sighting the night before. I happened to look up and saw something moving towards the house. The object was silent, moving quite fast, wasn&apos;t flashing and looked quite dim. I didn&apos;t know what this object was so I took a picture which came out bad as I was holding the cigarette. I took another picture and the object was in focus. The object moved over my uncles house out of sight. I have no idea what this object was, it was different to the other objects we had seen and I wouldn&apos;t have noticed it if I didn&apos;t look up by chance as the object was silent and wasn&apos;t very bright.I have been in touch with Timothy Good and he didn&apos;t know what the objects are and recommended I get in touch with Nick Pope. I got in touch with Nick who also didn&apos;t know what the objects were and said that he wasn&apos;t in a position where he could find this out but that I should send the pictures and my UFO sighting report to the Ministry of Defence. I got a letter from the MOD saying they don&apos;t investigate all UFO reports, they only see if there was any evidence of a threat, they remain open minded about UFOs and that they would file away my report and pictures.I have sent the pictures to Ball lightning experts from this list http://ae.nsstc.uah.edu/AE/addresses.html The people who responded to me said the objects aren&apos;t Ball lightning because there were no storms that night and the sighting lasted too long. I have put the pictures onto a few UFO forums hoping someone has seen the same objects and would be able to identify them but so far no one has been able to.", "I saw a fast light moving across the sky and thought it was a shooting star.

The lights then moved to what appeared to be the same altitude and seemed to be flying in a formation.  They then seemed to stand still in the air.  We were traveling in a car and pulled over to observe for a few minutes.  There were other cars pulled on to the shoulders - we assume watching the same thing.  Not sure how long the event lasted, as we continued on our trip.  It looked similar to the photo that someone else had submitted and seemed to be close to the same place.

It is a very bright, deep red light that does not strobe or blink in any way.Recently at 4:30 AM 01/17/09 I noticed my wireless internet abruptly cut out, and I went to the window to see if it was there, and sure enough it was.  This frightened me somewhat, being as that it keeps coming back, and this time it seemed to directly contact me in getting my attention by knocking out my wireless internet so that I would come to the window.  It was less than 100 yards from my house, and I know this because my road curves at around 100 yards, and it was clearly In front of a driveway no more than 100 yards away because the road curves there.  Clearly it was at eye level also because it was clearly a driveway.The past two times I have seen this bright red light it has stayed completely stationary.  The first time (around 01/09-13/09) it disappeared when a car was starting to come around the bend 100 yards down the street where it curves.  It simply just vanished instantly, like at the speed of light.  Absolutely NO FADE OUT.  The second time, it was like it directly contacted me and got my attention, knocking out my wireless internet!  I feel like I somehow knew it was there so I went to my window and sure enough, there it was, in the EXACT SAME SPOT as a few days ago.  It started to make me somewhat scared so as I was looking at the bright red object I simply told it  &ldquo;You are kind of scaring me a bit, you know...&rdquo;  So after observing it for about 30 seconds, Within 2 or 3 seconds of saying what I said looking directly at it, it disappeared!  It&rsquo;s as if it was being considerate, and obviously showing signs of intelligence???  I live on a very suburban dark street with minimal street lighting and lots of retired folk, and almost everyone is in bed on my street at 4:30 AM I would assume except me because I am a college student still living with parents.

I then decided to go outside for a closer look. I went out site and noticed the stars were slowly moving in the sky... sometime in the midst of all this I saw something drop about 25-50m away on the other side of some trees and I can recall a strange steady beeping noise... beep. beep. beep. beep. then I went inside and came back out for another look this time I decided to look around the corner of the house for some reason and there was this huge thing with lights on it hovering must have been 15ft above the power poles I quickly ran in and got my mom to come see it as soon as we opened the door three flying objects flew through our backyard about 20ft over the trees.

All you could see was the crescent moon to my right and a bright star below it. I looked up momentarily and something caught my attention. It was a unique red star, it didn&apos;t look like the red of a plane. It looked more like mars but even brighter. It went right under the moon and moved towards the north. I thought it&apos;s gotta be a plane at first but as I kept watching it, I saw no flashing lights. Planes always fly over from the north and so as I was watching it a plane flew by and the object started following it. It was moving very slowly and would move subtly up and down as it went in a northern direction. Then it went more towards the west, and sort of stopped in one spot (turning into odd shapes of lights) and started coming back towards me. This is when it got weird, Instead of being one bright red light I saw 2. Then it was coming even closer, and I saw 2 red lights and an almost orange light. It was not flashing. It then turned it&apos;s shape or did something and had 3 red lights (sort of orange hue) in the shape of a triangle. It then flew slowly right over my head. I could actually see the outline of the object. It appeared to almost change shape before my eyes, but I made out a triangle. It flew over me and then went back towards the east, almost did an oval shape. At this point I was convinced this was not a plane or a helicopter. It started moving back towards the north. I was standing outside of my car with my lights on so I flashed my lights at it. It then actually came back towards me after doing this. I yelled at a co-worker to come look at it. It was changing from white to red erratically. Not flashing, just changing. Like possibly rotating or changing its shape. When I flashed my lights at it, it was pretty far away and once I yelled at the co-worker to come look it started coming back towards me, this time lower and even more over my head. After it went over our heads, it had 2 bright light wh! ites on the back. We could see the shape of it. It was triangle but had other things on it. He thought it looked like a satellite but agreed it was way too low. It then went back towards the north and I stopped watching it.

We were heading from our home down Cross Creek and traveling due south on Bruce B Downs blvd at about 45MPH.  It was a clear Florida afternoon with clouds only in the distant horizon.  Upon crossing the Tampa Palms region my boyfriend had spotted something in the sky and was laughing about how normally people who see UFO&rsquo;s depict an object which seems very unlikely to be a UFO at all making the whole possibility even more far fetched.  I looked up and saw an object in the sky just beyond the power/telephone lines crossing the road, and once we had passed under these I could clearly see the object without interference.From the passengers seat of his SUV,  the object appeared to be close to a 45 degree angle from the horizon, and about 5 degrees to the left of our car&rsquo;s heading which looked to be just to the left of the center of the windshield from what I could tell.  The shape was horizontally ovular with more of acute sides on the left and right forming near points.  The texture seemed to be quote slick as the light  reflection from the sun and shadow underneath were relatively free of distortion.  The color of the object to the naked eye seemed to be silver hues or possibly a very metallic white,  but either way the surface had very reflective properties.  The top was very bright white with sunlight,  but the bottom were tones of silver and grey with shadows that looked like slight reflections of the tree line below.Being an aspiring scientist I immediately thought about all the possibilities and scenarios in my head and concluded it must have been a weird shaped blimp for an advertisement at one of the local stores near Amberly dr.  I ruled out a plane instantly because it did not change size to indicate a northern or southern trajectory, and it did not waiver side to side in our view either.  For the clarity of the sky and close proximity to us,  I was able to rule out a helicopter instantly also.  The object made no sound,  had no impact on the tree line below, and no propellers or engines of any sort were visible.Me and my boyfriend stared at the object while slowing down in our drive and I made the comment,  &ldquo;You know if this is what people seen when they reported UFO&rsquo;s I can see how they make that assumption,   after seeing this blimp,  I would nearly claim it were a UFO if I had been startled or had bad eyesight myself.&rdquo;   As we got a little closer I started thinking how weird it was that the blimp/balloon had no advertisements on it,  no personnel carriage underneath,  or no tie down to a building below.  We kept staring at the object as a full minute had passed with it in our sights and we still had no reasonable theories as to what it was.My boyfriend laughed and stated that it must be a UFO then,  and I agreed since it would be the simplest solution to the situation,  and right when I had said jokingly ,&ldquo;Yay aliens,  how neat!&rdquo;  the object vanished right before our eyes.  As bizarre as that sounds,  I know.  It reminded me of those home movies where a kid holds up a ball and says, &ldquo;now it&rsquo;s here&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..now it&rsquo;s not (and the camera recording breaks for a moment)&rdquo;  then the ball is suddenly not in the kid&rsquo;s hand due to 2 separate recordings being edited together.  It was a quick and abrupt vanishing act for this object.  Now neither of us were laughing.I continued watching, scanning, and searching the sky as we drove all the way to campus.  There were still no clouds around,  no chemical trails from an aircraft,  no noise of an engine accelerating rapidly enough to be gone that quickly.  Yet the object was nowhere to be found with no trace of where it went.  It was gone before I could blink right before my very eyes and for the first time in my life I had no clues to lead me to any sort of conclusion.We waited the last few days to see if any other reports surfaced in the news explaining what we saw,  but to no avail.  While I would love to have an alien encounter,  I&rsquo;m not sure what it was we saw and am not entirely convinced It was a UFO,  I would like to put it out there for anyone who would like to find answers and put all these puzzle pieces together for us and the rest of the confused world.

We live in a house with a lot of trees around it so I had to position myself just right to see the stars. I had been looking up for about 30 seconds and then I saw something that caught my attention. It appeared to be a star slowly moving across the sky. I could tell it wasn&apos;t an airplane and it was moving to slow to be a shooting star.I blew it off for a few minutes thinking my mind was playing tricks on me until I saw another one.  After I watched this one slowly drift across the sky, I raced inside to get my sister to come see this.  She walked with me outside and we looked up at the sky.  I explained to her what I saw and she wanted to go back in.  I told her just stay a few more minutes.  Sure enough about a minute and 30 seconds later, we saw another one!  We watched as i behaved just as the other two and then it disappeared.As we sat there a few more minutes we watched a few more pass over us.  We finally grew tired of watching and went into the house.  About 5-10 minutes later we went back out side.  We began watching the sky again and saw a number of airplanes now circling above.

D.C. I awoke about 3:30am because I had to go to the bathroom but didn&apos;t get up immediately. As I lay there, I was on my left side facing a large double window a few feet away. As I lay there a large triangular craft passed over the roof of my unit passing over the roof of the the units directly across the courtyard from where I was and then I lost sight of it. I would estimate the altitude of this craft to be no more than five-hundred feet and it was traveling in a north-easterly direction. It was moving slowly and I estimated the speed to be in the neighborhood of thirty-five miles per hour, give or take. I didn&apos;t make any sound that I could detect. I would estimate the size of the craft to be about three-hundred feet on a side; maybe a little larger.Although this happened in the middle of the night, the sky does not get really dark here because of all the lighting in the area so I saw the craft fairly well. It appeared to be flat-black against the lighter sky and there were low intensity lights at the points of the triangle. There were no visible windows that I could see but I only had a view of the bottom of the craft. The best way I can describe the movement is that it appeared to just slide effortlessly across the sky rather than fly as would a conventional aircraft. I told one other person who lives in the community about the incident but I could tell I wasn&apos;t believed so I kept it to myself. I would have reported the incident to a Government agency but I know how that would go so I didn&apos;t bother. I can state that this craft did not depend on air moving over the surface to keep it airborne because it was traveling far too slow for that to be a factor. I can also state that whatever technology this craft possessed was far advanced to anything that I am aware that this country or any other country currently employs.", "Big ball changing color and move in zigzag motion up and down to right to left.My wife ask me to look for a strange object and is was very bizarre i take my camera and i take some video .

I drove under a sign that hangs over the interstate, once past this sign the object was gone. Never did see it again.The weather was perfect. No clouds in the sky, bright sunny day. Air temp around 60 degrees.", "Large gray disk, appears to be at least 15 to 20 time bigger than airplane in the vicinity.A friend of mine took this picture about 5 p.m. about 6 weeks ago.  He took the photo because he was looking at a plane that he thought that was not leaving chemtrails but contrails (a rarity in the last many years).He took the photo and then look up and notice a bright star and took another photo about 10-20 seconds later of the star.While looking at the photo at a later date a nephew noticed, after blowing up the photo, a UFO to the left of the star and airplane trail.  Then they blew up the other photo and saw the same UFO but at about a ninety degree angle difference than the first photo.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

The driver indicated to the passenger that there was an object visible through the windshield. The passenger confirmed the sighting.Both witnesses described the object as a boomerang or triangle shape.  Three lights were visible on the object.  The object was moving soundlessly at an altitude estimated to be just above the tree top level.  The object was heading south east toward the city of Jackson.  The speed of the object was described as faster than the car, however they were still able to keep the object in sight for about 60 seconds.The size of the object was described as being larger than a helicopter and larger than a house.", "It came from the direction of the city, when I stood on a hill in total darkness in the countryside. It was moving strangely,  not straight forward, but shaking a little left-right, like a drunk, wiht a slight noice.When it stopped for a short time, I suddenly heard a sudden bang and human like scream. Then it was gone silently. Maybe somebody was abducted? It was definitely no  helicopter..", "Clear photo of UFO over Greenland at 35,000 feetI was 35,000 feet up over Greenland, I looked out the window, I snapped this photo.  I know that this is real.  I know now that we are not alone.  A sphere is not in our aircraft arsenal to my knowledge and this is not a balloon.((NUFORC Note:  Photo shows a tiny object, seemingly suspended, and possibly outside the aircraft.

Lights moved horizonitally back and forth and then stopped and contiuned much like a landing zone or run way, then looked like a angel wing display emitted from a c130. This is the best I can describe, as I have no comparison ever seen by myself before.", "Bright white sphere pulsing to a amber colorOttumwa , Iowa 9:00 pm  2-3-09   My friend was on his way driving to pick me up . On his way he notices a bright light hovering above the high school football field. He picks me up and tells me to check out something  and we go over  the hill on iowa avenue  and   he says &quot;look&quot;  i see it right over what i can say is either the field itself or over the center of town.  It is a bright white light and sitting there , i think is this a helicopter  coming dead on at first. I roll down the window and no sound and so sign of red or blue lights ?  So we turn the corner and shortly after the thing begins to Pulse and turns from white to  a amber color  with a white streak to the left  and is gone! We are looking in the same area and then look and see it way off to the south west of town but dimmer .    It is in the direction of the mall , now we begin to trip out !!! Now this is where we are not sure it is the same thing or another craft . So we head towards its direction and this thing moves to the north west and then hovers over from what i can tell is the tree line and descends in a fielded area where mostly corn fields should be .  I have portions of this footage on my digital camera and him on his cell phone  during half the chase. Unfortunately i did not record the footage from when we first saw this thing at it&apos;s brightest. I will say it was as intense as the moon but smaller hard to say what size it was. It clearly was not a conventional air craft , planet , and performed excessive speeds.This was not a Chopper a Plane or Venus this was a moving object that traveled in 4 directions and changed color and defied what we know. My friend wanted to chase it in to the country side and i was against it. So we abandoned the chase.", "I noticed a bright light on the northern horizon over Lac de la Sucrerie (46 degrees 07 minutes 00.23seconds North, 74 degrees 54 minutes 11.88 seconds West) that I thought was a star, however it started to get brighter and bigger after a few minutes of staying still.  After a few more minutes the &ldquo;star&rdquo; began to lower and fluctuate in intensity.  This is when I realized it was a UFO.  As it got closer I could see a red and greenish glow under the object, which by now was moving slightly erratically left to right, up and down.  At this point it was in front of the mountain, about 50 feet above the lake, and about 1 kilometer in front of me.  It just stayed there, silently hovering above the lake for a couple of minutes, and then slowly rose back into the sky, and further behind and above the mountain until it was looking once again like a bright star, like venus looks like. The light grew with intensity, and then faded.  This happened a few times until it disappeared.  About half an hour later, I went back outside to see if it was there, and I felt a sort of vibration that vibrated the whole cottage, and even the ground, (kind of like an earthquake, but more of a vibration than a shaking), which was followed immediately by a sound high overhead like a fighter jet would make, but not quite as loud.  Unfortunately I did not have my video camera because I forgot it at home!  It would have been one of the best UFO videos ever!  I&rsquo;m so sorry I forgot it!", "3 lights low on north horizon outside of Wasilla, AK 01/20/09 @ 7:15pm local time.I saw three lights low on the horizon, looking north off of my balcony near Wasilla, Alaska at around 7:15pm Alaska time on Jan. 20th, 2009.  I frequently go outside at night to watch the stars and I noticed this set of lights, which weren&apos;t supposed to be there. The lights changed in intensity and changed position as if they were attached to something.  When I first saw them, they were a perfect triangle.  They moved to form an elongated triangle pointing east, then reoriented again. I didn&apos;t hear any noises.  What seemed to be the &quot;center&quot; light was brighter than the other two.  The center light was brightest when oriented head on, forming almost a straight line, then turned again, becoming a smaller looking triangle. It didn&apos;t move quickly enough to be distinct, if that makes any sense.  But they definitely moved quickly enough as to change the arrangement of the lights within 10-15 seconds. I called my girlfriend out to see them, but all we could see was the center light.  Then, they began to move again and the triangle was visible.  I called her back out and she saw it, too.  She said it was creepy. At first, I thought they might be helicopters flying in formation.  There were no other blinking lights, but they did &quot;twinkle&quot; like stars, which is what made it seem so strange. I am not an avid ufo enthusiast, but I do like to watch the stars.  This is the first time I have seen anything like this.  I do remember watching something on the Science channel about triangular lights which behaved exactly like these did about a month prior to this event.  I don&apos;t think that influenced what I saw, but it definitely made me watch them closer. After about 15 minutes of watching (it was fairly chilly), I came inside to check if there had been any reports.  I didn&apos;t really know where to look, though, and I found this site through a google search on how to report sightings. When I went back outside to continue watching, the lights were gone, as far as I could tell.", "3 lights (triangular) entered the sky like a shooting star, faded away and repeated this process til out of sightmy fiancee and i went outside to have a smoke when I thought I saw hugh shooting star.

So, being the internet age and all, I thought I&apos;d search for what I saw that night to see if anyone else reported it.  I think I found the exact &quot;thing&quot; I saw in the sky as reported on http://www.ufopicks.com/.It was the early 80&apos;s and I was approximately 10 years old.  My older sister was in the phone with her friend and told me that there was a &quot;flying saucer&quot; outside.  I quickly ran to the front window (facing east) and saw what appeared to be either a relatively low flying circular craft with rotating lights (Like L.E.D.&apos;s) slowing pacing in an exact line from west to east and then back again from east to west.  Or it was huge and much higher in the sky than it may have appeared.It was a clear night.  The &quot;thing&quot; was right above our house on it&apos;s east to west and back again pattern of flying.  I was mezmorized.  I was old enough to know that it wasn&apos;t a plane or copter.  It made no noise and very smoothly went about it&apos;s business.  I didn&apos;t see it &quot;exit&quot; the aky because it would come into view for a minute or two before going over the horizon and back again... then at one point it never returned from the horizon.  It seemed as thought it was surveying the area because of it&apos;s straight back and forth flight... it would move just a little to the south on each and every &quot;trip&quot;.FYI... this &quot;thing&quot; was somewhere in between Warren and Ford Road (east - west roads) and seemed to disappear from the horizon once it hit Inkster Road (to the east) and Middlebelt Road (to the west)... due to the horizon being limited because of houses and trees.Here is the exact location of where I was viewing this object: http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=6607+Deering+Garden+City+Michigan&amp;sll=42.328981,-83.314819&amp;sspn=0.100384,0.21595&amp;gl=us&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=42.335073,-83.316836&amp;spn=0.025094,0.053988&amp;z=15&amp;iwloc=addr  If anyone else remembers the exact year or can add to my memory, please do so.  I KNOW I saw it, as did my sister and the friend on the phone that lived about a half mile to our west.The exacty description of the &quot;thing&quot; was a perfect circle with LED type of yellowish-red lights that rotated around this &quot;thing&quot;... It seemed to have a top and bottom (both circular)... with the LED&apos;s (or whatever) around the middle.  I could not make out the body of the &quot;thing&quot; because the lights were too bright.I&apos;m not crazy... really. It was there.

Quite stunning to watchOn saturday evening I went outside onto the deck and was observing the clear sky over Auckland as I do from time to time, after 5 minutes or so of looking I saw what I thought was a shooting star going across but then to my amazement it changed direction suddenly on about a 45 degree angle to the left for approx two seconds then went straight for another two seconds then it changed direction on a 45 degree angle to the right and continued this staggered movement until it went out of sight. I can only drscribe it as being a light and unable to distinguish any shape being it was so far away which is why I first thought it was a shooting star. I was totally flabbergasted seeing something in the sky changing direction suddenly to the left straitening up and then altering it&apos;s path to the right and doing it at random again and again.", "zigzag flight on high altitudeAt 18:45 on clear night sky, about 11 degrees down the Moon (SW) a single light made a &quot;zigzag&quot; type flight with a variable speed 200-500kmh.

I looked out the drivers side window and saw a fast moving aircraft parallel to the car [traveling south towards Portland airspace], I noticed it was traveling much faster then any other plane then I had seen. I then looked back towards the road and asked the two passengers to look out the windows and spot it.  Once they found it, it had changed course and was now perpendicular to us, moving west.  We all agree that it looked as if it was more in Portland airspace then in Washington, but distance is relative. The odd thing is, on top of the Incredible speed, was the fact that the craft was purely white in color, I do believe that FAA standards regulate for a navigation light on at least the wings and tail.  There were none of these.  Only white lights all around the craft with one white strobe light. Again, it was going faster then I&apos;ve ever seen even an F-22 fly.", "6 or 7 black flying objects in the skys of Bury St. Edmunds, UKFeb 28, 2009 @ 1705, My daughter and I were at Bury St. Edmunds, UK.  We were in the Abby Gardens when we noticed a formation of what we thought were black balloons (thought they might have been a cluster of parachutes too)   Each craft looked as if 2 hot air balloons were side by side and connected.  There were 6 to 7 total.They were ascending and descending and moving left to right for the first couple of minutes.  I was able to capture a small video clip on my phone.  I do not know if the quality is any good yet.  I stopped a man to verify my sighting, and he agreed it to be a UFO of some kind (I did not get his name).  We watched them ascend out of site by 1710.  The formation was much more scattered toward the end. On the way out of the park I noticed a lone UFO craft that was speeding toward the direction the other craft had gone (1713).I swear and affirm this story to be true. I even studied the local bird patterns to verify it was a UFO of some sort.  I have tried repeatedly to find a reason these were not UFO&rsquo;s and I cannot find any.  My 10 year old daughter also witnessed the entire event from start to finish.  We were not on any substances or drugs nor do we suffer from any medical or mental conditions.We will be contacting the Bury Free Press newspaper with the story to see if there were any other reports.

Now, this is right near the Deer Valley Airport, but what I saw was not an airplane. I saw a triangular shaped craft that was inky, inky, jet black with 3 lights.  It was very ink-black against the dark sky and one could differentiate the fact that it was a much darker black than the night sky. It was VERY big and was hanging like a thin black mirror in the sky, point down. This was the second UFO I&apos;ve seen in my lifetime, and this one made me feel very afraid.  I think because it was so large and so black. Next, the triangle began to rotate, with the point of the triangle going up and the other points turning in a clockwise motion. What was so strange is the lights of the triangle then began to stretch and the inky blackness of it dissipated and the 3 lights shot off quickly in separate directions. This was just northwest of the Deer Valley Airport.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I was outside alone enjoying the warm weather. The sun was shining brightly and there were no clouds in the sky.   I was looking up at the sky in a northeast direction with my back to the sun.  I saw what looked like a flock of white birds flying in an oblong circular formation around one single bird. As this is nothing strange to see in the country, I started to notice that the &quot;birds&quot; had no wings. Also, they were flying much too high to actually be birds. After closer inspection, they now appeared to be silvery white egg-shaped orbs. This realization happened within the first ten seconds of seeing them.  As I looked closer, I could tell that the central &quot;bird&quot; was much shinier than the others. Then they broke their formation and started to dart out in all directions, flying around in circles on their own. Each craft circled and stayed relatively within its own zone. This happened about 40-50 seconds after I had begun watching them.  At this point, I counted nine of them, including the shinier central one.   Then they began to move in a different series of maneuvers. They began to spread out more; flying closer back to the center and then farther out again. Then, in another change of maneuvers, they started to scramble all over the sky.  At about 90 seconds into my sighting, they started flying in what seemed to be straight lines jetting out from one another and making very abrupt and sharp turns.At this point, I started to think I should run and get my camera, but I had become so amazed by what I was seeing that I could not tear myself away. I quickly turned in a circle to view 360 degrees of the sky around me in case there were more of them. I then quickly turned back and started to watch the crafts. They started looking farther and farther away from me.  This was about two minutes into my sighting. At which point, the one that was farthest to the left disappeared.  Then, about five seconds later, the one farthest to the right disappeared as well. This now left seven egg shaped orbs to remain, still looking very white and silvery gray.  Then the orb that was closest to the bottom of their dissassembling  formation disappeared. Then the two that had been above the center one disappeared.  While the last four orbs remained, three of them made a formation in the shape of a pyramid, or triangle with the point on top surrounding the shiniest one in the center. Suddenly, all three orbs in the triangle formation disappeared. The only one left, the one that seemed to have a metallic almost aluminum shine to it, darted left, then right, then down, then up, then back to the center point. Suddenly it just disappeared.As I stood still staring up at the sky, I then started to realize that I had seen something very out of the ordinary, and that I might have just witnessed a UFO sighting. At that point, roughly two minutes after the last orb disappeared, three grey military jets, coming from the west, flew by in a spread out formation all flying in the same direction and at the same altitude where I had seen the orbs.  The middle jet flew right into what could be considered the center of the orbs&rsquo; flight pattern. The jets also appeared to slow down a bit once they got to the exact area the orbs had been. Once the jets flew by and I could see where they were in the sky, I gauged that their altitude must have been somewhere between six and ten thousand feet.  It is also important to note that all three military jets were letting off huge chem trails. After a few minutes the sky filled with long, thin and spreading clouds. I saw birds were now in the sky and I could tell that the wind was again blowing.It is not strange to see any airplanes fly by at a very high altitude, or see one of the many small ultralites or hobby planes flying at a low altitude. After living in this area for the last 20+ years, I have witnessed many varied aircraft on their way to and from the Oshkosh EAA annual Fly-In as well as normal air traffic. The only times I have seen low flying military jets in this area is when they are on their way to the EAA annual Fly-In or some other public event.", "Hugh lighted area at the horizon moving slowly, then stopped and disappeared at 5:30 A.M.On February 24, 2009 at 5:30 AM I got up to let my 2 dogs outside, at which time it was still very dark outside.  Our house faces North an at a distance on the horizon, over the tree line I could see a very, very large lighted area.  I kept watching it wondering what it could possibly be.  It was way too large for an airplane or star.  I went to 3 different windows and could plainly see the light.  It looked as if the light was lighting an area as big as a footbal field or bigger.  As I watched, this thing moved slowly from left to right or from West to East and then stopped.  I walked into the kitchen and came back and it was gone. It would take a very large craft to light an area as large as I am talking about.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

We were in the worst part of a windstorm with SW winds sustained at 34MPH (54KPH) and gusts to 62MPH (99KPH).  As she was finishing up brushing her teeth I took a look outside to see the trees swaying in the high winds and saw an aircraft in an unusual position in the sky.Living outside Rochester, which has an international airport, it is not unusual to see planes, mostly incoming, approach from the east, headed west along New York state route 441 which later becomes Elmwood Avenue and leads a nearly straight line to the Rochester airport.  On this night, however, the aircraft I saw was at least a mile north of route 441 and had a spotlight similar to those I saw on police helicopters when I lived in Los Angeles.  It also had blue and red lights, but the spotlight was most noticeable.I opened the door to get a better look. My daughter, a firm believer that UFO&rsquo;s are not real, saw what I was looking at and her exact words were &ldquo;Is that a UFO?&rdquo;  I told her it looked like a helicopter.  However, within a minute it was nearly overhead and we couldn&rsquo;t hear it.  Its&rsquo; speed was much slower than most planes, and the spotlight (which was pointed toward the ground, but slightly to the right of its&rsquo; flight path) was very bright.  The speed and the spotlight seemed to suggest that it was a helicopter, except there was no sound.The object continued past our house where it seemed to pick up the path of route 441-west, towards the Rochester airport.  My daughter captured some video on her cell phone but it was captured through a closed window and appears to be a speck of light in a dark sky when viewed.  The flight path, the red, white and blue lights and the speed all seem to point towards a helicopter, or maybe even a small plane flying into a 40- to 70-knot headwind. But why would a helicopter be using such a bright spotlight? There were no police chases here that night.  And, its&rsquo; speed was faster than any possible police chase on these curvy, hilly roads.  It traveled at least 5 miles in about 2 minutes. And it was at a height of several thousand feet, too high for the spotlight to illuminate the ground.  It was cloudy and windy, but no fog or rain or snow to explain the use of the bright spotlight.  I also considered the possibility that an aircraft had landing gear trouble.To both of us, this seemed like it might have been a UFO and it might have been a helicopter with a bright spotlight.  It is possible that the wind was howling so loudly that it drowned out the helicopter sounds.  This sighting was unique enough to get my un-believing daughter to think it might be a UFO.  I&rsquo;ve seen much stranger objects, back when I lived in the Hudson Valley region of New York State; objects the size of football fields that moved unlike any aircraft, and this sighting does not come close in comparison.  The object we saw, though, is still unexplained as far as we are concerned.  We are also aware of the obvious implication of seeing something unidentified flying across the sky on Christmas Eve night, but for now we&rsquo;ll just call it a UFO.At the time of the sighting, we were at 43.15 degrees North, 77.34 degrees West looking East initially, then South, and lastly Southwest as we lost sight of it.", "orange lights in the sky over clairemont san diegoI was just driving my daughters boyfriend home when we saw these weird lights in the sky. I got my daughter to take this pic on her phone.  They were orange and there were 8 lights kind of in an M shape and they were all hovering round their own area, kind of circling.  It wasn&rsquo;t a plane because  one came past at the same time.  The lights looked to be in a similar distance perspective.  Cars were stopped in the street looking at it", "Semi-transparent white ball sighted in Queen Creek ,AZI sighted a white semi-transparent round ball coming over my house from the Northwest traveling Southeast approximately 400 feet in the air. It covered approximately 2 miles in 40 to 45 seconds , just skimming the top of the San Tan Foothills. The weather that day was 75 and Sunny no clouds at all in the sky, winds were 5 mph. There was no noise coming from the ball (object) and never changed altitude the entire time it was in sight. If I had to estimate the size of the object I would say it was as big as a king sized bed. Again ,it was translucent or semi-transparent white in color with no metallic features at all.

Arrowhead shaped object with blunted edges approached from the west, very fast and reaching an elevation of about 90 degrees then, turned south and performed an S turn maneuver.  The only light coming from it seemed to be as a result of reflected ambient light from the city, sort of grey or stone like in color. This &quot;thing&quot; was moving so fast, as they always are.

I stopped to get a closer look and when I did I noticed right above the light was an large dish shaped object.I could not tell the color of the disk just the outline of it. It had to be about an acre long. On the dish there was many different lights all shaped like circles and flashing. The color of those lights were red,blue, and green. The ship just seem to sit there.Then all of a sudden all I saw was a bright flash of light zoom across the field before and their was a loud humming noise as it left.

The garage faces a little south of due west.  I was using a Nikon D80 with a zoom lens, Nikon model DX AFS Nikkor 18-135 mm 1:3.5-5.6G ED, with no filters.  The clouds were coming straight towards the open garage, and there was a very light rain falling, so I was standing slightly inside the garage to minimize water drops on my lens.  After taking some photos to the west, I stepped out of the garage and looked back to the east, where there was a faint rainbow, which I also photographed, along with some tall clouds to the south.I noticed nothing unusual during the photo shoot, but when I went inside, downloaded the pictures to my computer and looked at them full-screen, the cylindrical object was evident in a picture taken facing due west.  At first, I thought the object had been blown into the air by the strong winds, and only made jokes about its possibly being a UFO.  I didn&apos;t remember ever having seen images of cylindrical UFOs.  But after about a week, I got curious, and found numerous web sites with images of cylindrical UFOs, which is what I now believe the object in the photos was.There was a second photo that showed probably the same object, less clearly.  It was taken from the same position as the first, but facing southwest.  The second photo was taken less than 2 minutes, but longer than 5 seconds after the first.  The first photo was taken at 1/180 of a second, the second at 1/100 of a second.  In the second image, the object appeared to be somewhat larger, but the lens was zoomed in slightly compared to the first.I am not aware of any other potential observers of this object.  I saw no objects first hand, only after displaying the photos on my computer.I am a 65 year old, retired PhD physicist, having worked as a research physicist for the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health from 1975 to 2003, and then as a US government contractor until 2006.  I am active in community instrumental music groups and in amateur photography.  I have never before seen a UFO, to my knowledge, certainly not an unlighted cylindrical one.", "Egg shaped Bright Light in the sky , it appeared to glow bright white but the photos taken only showed it to be red and turned to blueOn Monday evening 18:10 pm I walked outside of Baptist West Hospital ER to have a quick smoke (my wife was in the ER nothing to serious) anyway I lit up and turned around and looked up for what ever reason and at first I thought it was a star then I thought it might be the comet that was viewable that night.

As I walked I looked at it and noticed it was moving east away from me at a hight rate of speed. I stopped to  get a perspective of the object moving and it was moving fast. What caught my eye was that it was bright and seemed to be at a high altitude and it did not have any distinctive lights as aircraft would. Their were no navigation lights, or anti-collision light, it was just a bright white ball of light.I just watched it accelerate away, it took no longer then 2 minutes for it to disappear from my sight.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

The light was as bright as the evening star. We were walking near the corner of Citrustree and Santa Gertrudes in East Whittier. It then disappeared, but then reappeared very faint. It continued to travel at a high rate of speed getting larger as it came closer to us. The light traveled in a Southeast direction, but change color from white to orange to red then back to white. Each color lasting for for a few seconds. There were no trademark flashing lights like aircraft, and it was not in the typical flight pattern of this area. We have lived here in Whittier, CA our whole life right under the LAX final approach pattern and it looked nothing like an aircraft. It was traveling much too fast to be an airplane or helicopter.

We lived in a huge mint green farm house about a mile out of town.  Many of summer nights we would lay on out trampoline and gaze at the stars.  Sometimes we would see what we thought as strange activity, such as lights that would disappear and reappear and lights that would fly at each other and almost touch but I told myself it was my imagination.  In town we would hear stories about people seeing strange objects in the sky and I never thought much of it because I didn&apos;t see it myself.  I was in 7th grade at the time.  My mother and little brother picked me up from the Junior/Senior High school a few miles down the road.  At the time, I was in basketball and I had just got done with practice.  We were almost home when we saw a little (I think red) car stopped right in front of our house.  We got very close to them and I saw they were looking up at something. I looked up.  The car sped away (so I know someone else saw the same thing).  Right in our huge roundabout was a hovering object flying above us.  It was feet or inches above the tall oaks.  There was no wind, no sound.  It was triangular with spot light in the middle.  It had a white light in one corner and one side had a row of white lights with one red light.  It was spot lighting the grass and trees in the roundabout then it flew a few yards and spotted the house and then the back field where we had a huge garden on the corner of a farmer&rsquo;s field..  As it moved, you didn&apos;t see it move.  We all gazed in amazement and fear.My mother pulled in the drive way, put the car in park and ran into the house to get my father.  My brother and I started to scream and hold each other.  Then it was gone.  All the while, it never acknowledged us but of course it had to see us, right?   What is weird is that I don&apos;t remember telling my dad or the rest of the night, maybe because it was not important or because I was slightly traumatized.  The next morning I drew pictures but for some reason my memory had changed.  Now, I could only remember clearly how I felt and what I was thinking as I looked at the object and the things around the object but the exact memory of me staring straight at the object was gone.  My mother said she can&apos;t remember as clearly either.  What is strange is that I remember in pictures.  We didn&apos;t talk about it much.  My mother thinks it is a governmental experiment, not aliens and I like that answer.  This is what I tell myself and I find it reasonable.  There is an air force base very close by.The next day there were military helicopters flying all around.  What this means, I don&apos;t know. Were they looking for something?   Was this a foreign government spying on the U.S.  If the object didn&rsquo;t want to be seen...then why fly into peoples yards and hover around.  Why did it care about us and what could it possibly learn or want from us.  I guess we will never know.  I don&apos;t expect you to believe this because I wouldn&apos;t.

Altitude was unknown, as no relative size of the two points of light could be discerned. Objects hovered for about 10 seconds before slowly fading away. As they lights faded, they appeared to have a light &quot;halo&quot; surrounding them. No navigation and/or anti-collision lights were seen at any time. Time was about 1:15 before sunrise, so reflected pre-dawn sun was probably not the cause, nor Iridium &quot;flash&quot; due to lights being two distinct objects.Objects appeared to be about the size of Venus, only side-by-side. Neither Venus nor Mercury nor any other bright celestial body was out at that time of the morning. Further, Venus was, at the time of the sighting, in the evening sky and does not appear as two bodies.

So, this bright ball of light was very pronounced in the sky as it was incredibly bright compared to the rest of the sky.

It was about the size of a baseball to me from around 2 miles away.  I had a friend in the car with me and she saw it as well.

It was in the Western Sky.  We drove out of our small town to the west to get out of the surrounding town lights and To make sure the light was not close to town so that we could judge the size.   The unknown light stayed the same.  It still looked the same size as we traveled west on country roads.Description:  Large white light.  At intervals very small red lights would flash.(around the edges) These red lights were so small and hard to see that I had to watch for awhile to make sure I was not seeing things.   The intervals were not constant.  The light would undulate, getting larger and smaller ( or brighter and dimmer?)  The light did not move.  The stars were out and clear.  DFW airport had multiple planes flying and there were 3 helicopters that we could see in the distance.  We used these to compare with the large white light.  The large white light was nothing like I have ever seen.

The night was very black.  At the time of the sighting, we were patrolling the Bearing Sea north of the Alaskan Peninsula, bearing north at about 20 knots.I was on watch at the starboard 20mm gun, second deck (galley deck).  It was around 2300. My gun turret was above the deck house and there were no obstructions hindering my field of vision, allowing me to have a clear 360 degree view of the sea around the ship.  There were four of us together at the starboard gun (I can get crew names and captain&rsquo;s name).The attention of both port and starboard gun crews was drawn to a row of red lights off the port side, traveling parallel to and slightly forward of the bow. I did not see the lights when they first approached so do not know the direction from which they came, or if they came out of the sea. There were at least eight lights in a row, evenly spaced, canted at about 15 degrees to horizontal. I would estimate the lights were no more than 100 yards from the ship. The lights held their relative position to one another throughout the sighting, and appeared to be about 10 feet apart. I would say that the light closest to the water (the lights were canted diagonal to horizontal at approximately 15 degrees) appeared to be about 30 feet above the water.I estimate that it would require a cantaloupe held at arms length to cover a single light. I could not see a structure associated with the lights as there was nothing but blackness between the lights. The lights were a very deep red and did not cast a beam.  The lights moved parallel to our ship, holding their position relative to the ship throughout the entire sighting.The lights continued to pace the ship as I watched. This continued for at least one hour. I was relieved from watch at 2400. When I went below the lights were still visible. I was too tired to stay on deck and went below to sleep. The next day, the midnight gun crew said that the captain turned the ship and &quot;tried&quot; to chase the lights. I don&rsquo;t know the outcome of this maneuver. I don&rsquo;t know what the circumstances were when the lights disappeared. But I do know that I have not seen anything like this before or since.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

When we looked at what she was talking about at first we thought it was an airplane and then realized it wasn&rsquo;t so we pull over into a parking lot.  When we were watching this craft is was circular and had different lights flashing from it.  The colors were red, blue, green and white.  It also had an aura around it.  We watch it for about an hour.  It just kept on floating from left to right and up and down.  Also coming closer to us then fading back away.  Then all of a sudden my husband decided to look directly up to see if there was anything else in the sky.  We saw these small circular objects moving so fast through the sky, moving left to right and diagonally.  One of the objects went directly towards an airplane it looked like it was going to hit it.  We think the first craft we saw might have been commutating with the little crafts.  During this sighting my husband had called his mother and his brother to tell them to look in the sky toward the east to see if they can see what we were seeing.   After a few minutes his brother saw it and then so did his mother.  His brother also saw the little crafts going toward the airplane and zipping back and forth in the sky.  We were all amazed at what we were seeing, it was very weird.  This was my first sighting of a UFO, this was my husband&rsquo;s second sighting.  It all seem too weird to be true but it was since his family seen it too and they were on the other side of the town.  Well needless to say that it was our daughters&rsquo; first UFO sighting, she was really scared and kept her eyes closed and said can we just get to the store already.((NUFORC Note:  Object may have been Sirius.

We noticed what looked like a very low flying aircraft, flying west to southwest, something about the way it behaved just seemed odd. It appeared to be triangular in shape, but it was difficult to really tell. It had 3 white lights. We stopped at her place to pick up a hat and then proceeded back up Lake Emma Road going north and started seeing a lot more lights that seemed rather low for planes and something about the way they were moving, while similar to a plane, was just a bit off.  The movements of the objects was smooth and steady, flying in one direction, but something just didn&rsquo;t look right for a plane or helicopter.When we were on Greenway Blvd., almost to my house, we saw a larger, brighter lit object, with at least 4 bright white lights going very low and descending near the water treatment plant. This object seemed to vary in speed and almost appeared to be stationary for a short moment. We tried to follow it down the street to see where it went, but it quickly was blocked from our sight by trees. We did not hear any sounds from this object. We turned around at the library. On our way back could not locate the object we had seen several minutes earlier.When coming up the street next to ours moments later, we saw another large brightly lighted object flying very low, going west, but it to was quickly blocked from our sight by houses and trees. It appeared to be right over our neighborhood, within blocks from our house. We heard no sound from the object. The speed seemed too slow for a plane. This object looked like the object we had seen over the water treatment facility several minutes earlier.We went to my house on Whittingham Place and stood out front and out in the back yard off and on for about an hour. Over the coarse of this time frame, we saw at least 30 more lighted objects. The lights on the objects varied. Some had one or two white lights with one red blinking light. Some had only white lights, at least 2 or 3 and were blinking very fast, all at once or all at different times. Some objects had bluish-white lights with red blinking lights. There were a variety of blinking patterns and number of lights on different objects.I went out again around 10:30 pm, within 5 minutes I saw at least 12 more lighted objects, some were going southeast, some were going east, some were going west, some were going north. About half of them seemed to be flying abnormally  low. Several of them seemed to be much higher in altitude.I went out again around 11:00 pm and in one minute, saw 7 lighted objects. There were 2 objects going to the southeast and I could hear what sounded like a helicopter or small plane engine.I go out and look at the stars and moon often and have never seen this many objects  and ones that appeared to be so low or had the variety of lights and blinking patterns.

Somewhere close to the midpoint of our trip the entire sky lit up with a teal green light (the EXACT location is somewhat of an estimate - I used the GPS on my Blackberry to mark the location on Google Maps but I guess I didn&apos;t save the location as a favorite and lost it). I don&apos;t know what I was thinking at the time, but I must have thought it was a shooting star or lighting or something along those lines because as soon as the light in the sky faded I leaned forward so I could look up. I scanned the sky fairly quickly left to right and right under the headliner (I&apos;m estimating 60 or 70 degrees up from the horizon) I saw a greenish light fading out. It appeared about the same size as an average star in the sky aside from its color. As soon as I spotted it, it was already fading out (I watched that particular spot in the sky for 2 or 3 seconds max). I leaned back in my seat and I didn&apos;t say anything immediately until the driver said something along the lines of &quot;what the ____ was that?&quot; or &quot;did you see that?&quot;. He described the light in the sky nearly identically to how I did and after we talked about that for a moment I realized that it didn&apos;t just light up in one spot like a flare or shooting star, but it lit up the ENTIRE sky. We were riding in his Expedition so we had plenty of surface area on the windows around us, but I couldn&apos;t fathom what would have lit the sky up to the point where I saw it out peripherally as well. Also, I guess he leaned forward before I did or locked onto the object before I did (I don&apos;t know which one as I wasn&apos;t looking at him or paying any attention to his movements because I was completely focused on what was going on) but he saw the object moving horizontally across the sky before its light faded out. He said he leaned forward just enough to see it moving (from his perspective) about 2 inches under the point where the headliner and top of the windshield meet and it moved in a line almost completely parallel to this point. The sky was slightly overcast but I did notice that stars were fairly visible at that time. We were in the car another 90 minutes and I distinctly remember the sky being almost crystal clear when we got to the cabin at Lake Cumberland (we were fairly high in the hills there and had a great view). There weren&apos;t many cars on the road at the time (Highway 127) but I did notice a car that was about 300 yds up ahead tapped their brakes a couple of times as soon as the sky lit up.", "i saw something in the skyI was taking my dog for a walk with my friends, when I heard a strange sound that got my attention.

I noticed something that caught my eye to the NNW, it looked to be a dark colour, round in shape and just static in the sky.  It then moved ever so slowly and then remained static again.  I ran in and grabbed my camera and when I came back outside I managed to take two pictures taken on a Canon Power Shot, one taken on normal view and the other on a maximum 16x zoom.

I returned back indoors for a while but popped my head out again to see if it had returned and saw another object the same as the one I saw but more to the West.  I grabbed my camera from the kitchen but failed to pick it up on my viewfinder and when I looked at the sky the object had again vanished.I cannot find a rational explanation for this, it certainly wasn&apos;t a bird as it was too high, certainly not a plane as no noise and no contrails [the plane that went past it left contrails and made a noise] and it was far too high an altitude for a stray helium balloon to be seen with the naked eye, nor a helicopter.I have seen and reported to NUFORC on previous occasions other objects I have seen and have always been open to other suggestions, but this time I was left with a very eerie feeling and it actually shook me up compared to any other objects I have seen.The photos are timed an hour out as I have never changed the time on it when the clocks changed.", "I seen a large craft hovering still about 1,000 feet away with 3 lights in the form of a wide obtuse triangle.At approximately 7:30-7:45, I was traveling down Grimsley Station rd. heading towards Christoper rd. and I seen a &ldquo;craft&rdquo; that was about 1,000 feet off the ground and a little more than 1,000 feet away.

By Witnesses.At around 18:20, on June 18, 2008. While swimming in their above ground pool at 18:20 the first object seen was by Witness in the east direction of the sky. Object was shining like a chrome balloon. It was wobbling and seems to be going east from west and gaining altitude or getting smaller. Speed of object was slow in moving east. But in climbing altitude was moderate. After about 5 minutes the object could not be seen in the eastern sky. Witness and his wife reported having difficulties seeing well after that object left. They both saw white spots in their vision. And about a minute their vision was restored. The spots can be due to focusing on a small shinny object on a light blue background.Now at about 18:30 they continue to look in the sky at an eastern direction and the first contact of the second object was his wife. His wife told him &ldquo;what is that!&rdquo; they both starred at the second object. The second object was moving in a straight line north and wobbling like a top making no sound what so ever. It passed through the neighborhood and that object was seen for about 2-4 seconds by Witness and his wife. They both looked at it when it went by. His wife moved up the pool stairs to see more of the object as it was moving out of sight. Witness stood there in shock and did not seen more of the second object as it moved out of his sight. The second object was seen by Witness for about 2-3 seconds. And his wife had seen the second object for 3-4 seconds. After it had passed by they did not move out of the pool. Then Witness yelled for his father-in-law but he was not home. His father in law is a UFO believer because he had a sighting in the 1950&rsquo;s when he was a young boy. Of a flat black saucer shape with a top hat look, in the city of Norwalk as well. Witness yelled to his wife&rsquo;s nephew in side the house for the time and it was about 18:34-35. Witness nephew is ^ years old. Witness and his wife were confused and startled. They both were confused and at first did not know what to make if it. Object 2, was flying at about 4-7 stories high. Speed is estimated at 5-25 miles per hour. The second object was about an estimate 200-700 feet away from their pool and house. Approximate size of object 2 was about 15-50 feet in diameter. The second object was traveling north from the south. The type of object was a Disc or Donut Disc Saucer shape. It looked to be round if not oval shape. The ends or corners of the Disc shape was rounded like a donut not thin like a common Saucer shape. The top was slightly rounded like a dome. The bottom was almost like a donut. With a dent or if not a hole in the middle bottom of the second object. The color was satin metallic dark silver. It had a type of shading to it lik! e if the color would get darker when it would turn or move direction. For example there is a cell phone by T-mobile that is called the Wing. It is blue metallic color but when you move the cell phone it makes its color darker. The second object was like that when it moved as it was wobbling, but a satin silver color not blue. There was no sound what so ever from object 2. The wife noticed a slight glow of red under the second object. Too ad there was no visible markings or windows on object. And I did not look like it was spinning but wobbling only.At about 5-10 minutes after the second object was seen, another object in the sky was seen almost like the first object. A shinny chrome object in the sky wobbling. Going east from west and gaining altitude or getting smaller. And it was gone after 2- 5 minutes. Just like the first object seen at around 18:20. After that no other object was seen. Afterwards Witness father in law came home and went swimming with Witness and his wife. Witness explained to his father in law of what happened. At around 19:30 Witness and his wife got out for the pool and went inside the house and went to the second floor of their room and looked outside. And then ran outside a few minutes later in front of the house where the second object was seen.

We kept looking at it and took some pictures, but the movie pictures just looks like a white speck moving back and forth.  The movies look nothing like just looking at it with the naked eye.

Unfortunately, my little brother, his friend, and my step-dad had just went inside. In any case, the object looked like a plane at first, but without wings, and it was traveling way to fast, stopping, and going again. It looked like the path of lightning, but the object did not have a tail. It was headed NE about 5 miles East of me when it passed by. It disappeared just above the tree line and was gone. After  I thought it was a plane, I thought it may have been a dandelion petal, because we have dandelions in our yard, and some of them are in bloom. However, it was traveling too fast, and there was not a strong enough wind to carry it. Also, after seeing a commercial plane fly by headed north, I could estimate the crafts speed at anywhere between 2,000-2,500mph. It went roughly 4.5 times the speed of the jet. I haven&rsquo;t told my family. This is the first time I have seen a ufo, but my dad did once over the water in Tampa Bay. He was with someone who also saw the bright object hover over and lift of the water that night.

I tried to resolve its shape but I could not until it had moved off to the east.  The window screen pixelated the view and I finally convinced myself that the the orange ball of light actually had a vertical diamond shape, although that was not readily obvious.  Most of the time it seemed to have an amorphous, ill-defined shape.  The light was seen for about 30 seconds. It was completely silent.

Very quickly, we noticed that it appeared to be unusually illuminated as though there was a very powerful red light (like firework)on the top of the aircraft enabling us to only see the silhouette of the Hercules.The aircraft continued to fly in a straight line, yet the light moved from being on top of the aircraft to following it from a close distance. It did this for a short space of time and then suddenly burst infront of the aircraft almost half a mile in less than a second. The acceleration was unbelievable. The light maintained this distance for a few seconds and then once again burst backwards at very high speed and continued to follow the aircraft. The light then stopped in mid air, and then shot up into the sky at an immense speed.The light appeared to have a very intense, almost white, oval shaped centre which was possibly a 1/4 of the Hercules&apos;s lenght. When combined with the &apos;fuzzy&apos; light which surrounded this bright centre the light was possibly half the lenght of the Hercules.

Days surfing and nights at a camp ground 12 miles due West of Ocean City, N.J.Slightly after midnight, with a very clear sky, we sat outside our tent looking at the stars.A line of large, prop-driven, military cargo planes were passing directly overhead, going North.  A yard stick held at arms length would have been the length of their wings tip to tip. They flew so low their engine&apos;s noise prevented any conversation.   With the Vietnam war at its height, these flights were common along the coast.We heard the 1st plane coming minutes before it was directly overhead and the noise was intense until it moved on.  The 2nd plane, which appeared to be a mile behind the 1st was no different.  As it passed over,and onward, there was a flying disc shaped craft directly behind it by about 1/2 mile.The disc was as wide as the plane&apos;s wings, tip to tip. It didn&apos;t wobble, made no sound, and flew in the formation at what appeared to be the same speed as the cargo planes.  It had a few solid red lights on each edge as if marking the four points of a compass.As it glided off, following the 2nd plane, we saw that its middle was as thick as the cargo plane and tapered toward the edges.  No leading edge could be seen nor could we see any markings or windows.In disbelief we were questioning each other as to what we were seeing when our speech was soon overwhelmed by the noise of the 3rd cargo plane now passing overhead.Adding to our shock was the sight of another identical disc shaped craft tailing 1/2 mile behind it.  It was so silent we could here the crickets chirping as it went directly over our heads.No more disc were seen as the remaining planes, perhaps six in all, continued out of site.I haven&apos;t seen any U.F.O.&apos;s since nor has Tom.", "I was driving on a highly used freeway across a bridge.

Approx. 9:00 PM, Downey, CA.   I went out to my car to go to the market.  I always look up and watch the moon and Venus (earlier this month or late last month you could see Venus, Mercury and Jupiter up there).  Anyway I was looking toward the southwestern sky, then instead of getting into my car I started looking up at the dipper in the southeastern sky and wondering which stars made up the handle.  A few seconds into this I notice 2 white objects, round but not sure if spheric, way up high in the sky, almost blending with the stars, but la bit larger and not as bright.  As I looked up the two objects seemed to be about the width of 2 fingers apart and moving west at an angle of maybe 25 degrees.  No blinking lights, no sounds.  As they passed what would be an imaginary line dividing the S/E and S/W sky, one seemd to move either upward or south and I lost sight of it, while at the same time watching the second one, which seemed to linger in a slow change of direction and began moving in a pretty much straight line toward the northeastern sky.  I followed its trajectory until somewhere high in the N/E I lost it.  As I turned to look back south, I saw 2 more, similar objects, same direction of travel initially as the first pair.  This time, the lower object continued toward the west, I believe I saw it looking sort of reddish, I kept looking back and forth between the two, then lost sight of the one headed west.  .  I looked back and saw the top one now turn also toward the N/E direction and followed the same trajectory as the one other one from the firts pair.  I thought that was strange movement for what I thought at first might be helium balloons from a party maybe.  But the night was still, the leaves on the trees around me were not really moving, unless there might have been some high winds way up in the sky.  But it they were balloons and there was wind that blew them from the S/W to the N/E, why didn&apos;t BOTH objects get blown N/E?   How could one go west and another sout! h up jus t upward?  So I don&apos;t think they were balloons, and they didn&apos;t look like nor behave like airplanes that I know.  Anyway, I saw a THIRD pair coming from the same S/E area, same trajectory as the other two pairs, but this pair did not go as far west as the first two pairs.  This third pair seemed to separate almost due south from my vantage point, not disappeared form sight maybe going further south or just &quot;up&quot; and the other took the SAME trajectory as the other 2 going N/E.  Finally I saw ONE SINGLE object coming again from the same S/E location, went twestward o about due south from me, turned and travelled toward the same N/E direction as the other three.  That made FOUIR going N/E, ONE went west and TWO went either south of me or just &quot;up.&quot;   I think I can rule out party balloons and I think I can rule out airplanes because airplanes would need a wider area to change directions like these did.  What else they could have been I don&apos;t know.  I just did not see any details on the objects, such as lights, lines, windows, etc. - just a roundis;h-looking object.  By the way, these were not moving slowly like a balloon might be, and as they travelled N/E they seemed propelled and not just blowing in the wind!  If this is what an UFO does then I saw 7 of them.

But they WERE!", "Bright light flickering in the night sky in New Bedford, MA.For about a little over a hour and a half I noticed outside my 3rd floor window a bright light.

It was foggy outside and dark so the object was bright in the center and the color dissipated from the center (bright in center, fading on the outer edges).I couldn&apos;t tell how far away the object was, but it was large to the eye and easy to see.  It appeared large enough that the object would have struck the earth&apos;s surface, and it was definitely enough to startle me.

There could easily have been 1,000 of these flying saucers. They had lights in the middle bottom part of them and this &quot;light&quot; is what seemed to propel the crafts. They landed three-at-a-time and the moment they landed, three others would launch. They seemed to hover momentarily, then in a beam of light, they would be gone, straight up and out of sight.With the other cars traveling behind me, I knew that I was not the only one who had witnessed this hard to believe sight so I pulled to the shoulder of the highway, exited my car and began walking toward the oncoming cars. I waved and pointed upwards in hopes that someone might have a camera to document the incident. It surprised me when the driver of the first vehicle accelerated and kept going. Soon the second and third vehicle basically did the same thing, leaving me there alone.At that point, one of the smaller saucer-shaped spacecrafts traveled directly toward me, stopping almost overhead, hovering without sound above me. If I could have picked up a rock and thrown it, I know that I could have hit it but it never crossed my mind at the time. There was a noticeably lit dome on the top of the craft which was opaque so I couldn&apos;t see into it. I had the distinct feeling that I was being confronted and fear overcame me. I ran to my car, jumped into the driver&apos;s seat and with seconds feeling like an eternity, I turned the key.The engine strained and I thought I was doomed but soon, miraculously my car started. I threw the car into gear, floored it and never looked back, however, it seemed to me that I drove away in extra slow motion as the car strained but seemed to continuously pick up speed. It was still dark when I sped away however, looking back on it all now, it seems that I somehow lost several hours.I remember arriving home around daylight the next morning and my wife accused me of being out all night, drinking with the guys. I remember that she had said I was &quot;a day late,&quot; but at that time I just shrugged it off and was just so relieved to be home.In 2005 I was diagnosed with an AVM in the left lobe of my brain. I have never considered that I could have been &quot;abducted&quot; that night, but I know without a shadow of a doubt that I actually saw what I saw. I am positive the other people in the cars behind me saw the incident as well, however they did not stop as I had expected they would. It upset me that nobody stopped to talk about it with me, but now I realize that they were probably just extremely scared, exactly as I was the moment I realized I was alone.I haven&apos;t talked about this incident to too many people. I probably wouldn&apos;t believe the story, myself, had I not experienced it first hand.I have often thought about that incident and have wondered who the people in those other three cars could have been so I Googled `UFO sighting in Texas City/Galveston in October/November, 1981. Anyone remember this?&apos; and I saw the story of the guy who said he could see in his peripheral vision that the other driver was pointing upwards. The question I have for that reportee, is, &quot;Was this other driver a tall, skinny guy standing outside of a yellow 1969 Toyota Corolla?&quot; If the answer is yes, then my question is, `Hey buddy, why didn&apos;t you stop? Do you know I could have been killed, or worse yet, abducted?&apos;  The people in those three cars probably thought I was crazy, but I honestly thought they&apos;d stop, otherwise I would have probably never gotten out of my car. If I would have known they were going to leave me standing there, I would have stayed in the car, too, then floored it and left, but being the social type . . .. I have to say that as I stood on that dark, deserted freeway late that night, that was one time that I wished I hadn&apos;t been as tall as I am.My current wife said that in about 1973 or 1974, after a Friday night visit in the wee hours of the next morning, she and her family were walking some (visiting Channelview, Texas) neighbors out to their car in Sheldon Woods, north east of Houston, Texas. She said that as a group, four grown adults, a 13-year-old boy (my wife&apos;s brother) a 12-year-old girl (my wife) and a 9-year-old girl (my wife&apos;s little sister) witnessed, slowly traveling north over the housetops of the houses in that neighborhood, a huge, though silent, 400 to 500 feet-long rectangle-shaped spacecraft with lights all over it that seemed to be actively surveying the quiet neighborhood.Although as a group, they all just stood and stared up at the hard to describe spacecraft, my wife, her little sister and her parents remember the incident but her brother and the other two adults profess that they don&apos;t remember the incident. In fact, they never discussed it until recently.My wife joked that her big brother and the two visiting adults must have been abducted therefore they probably don&apos;t remember. She is kidding, of course, but entertaining the thought that I could have been abducted that night in October or November of 1981 (and it could have been 1980) is actually not an entertaining thought. I&apos;d be interested in reading what others may have to say about what the chances are that I could have actually been &quot;abducted,&rdquo; and if AVMs are associated with this type of scenario.I will say that at times I have had an extremely difficult life with more than a normal person&apos;s share of trials and tribulations. I have always said that most of the difficulty I&apos;ve experienced has been from the unwise decisions I&apos;ve made, so it would be comforting to learn that it was never me, but the ALIENS, all along.Seriously, despite the health problems and other difficulties I&apos;ve had, I&apos;ve now got my life headed in a direction that I&apos;m content with. After making two incompatible choices for marriage partners, I was blessed with six beautiful children so I am thankful for these women for that. I finally married my high school sweetheart, (who has six children of her own, making it a dozen for us altogether.) She happens to be a professional writer and helped me put this hard-to-believe actual U.F.O. sighting into a flowing, readable story so I truly thank her for that.If you were one of the people in one of the three cars behind me, then it would be great to have someone validate my story, and if you feel like I have felt all these years, have me validate your story, too.Most people report seeing one strange U.F.O. or experience, I&apos;ve never heard of anyone else ever seeing this many U.F.O.&apos;s in one sighting.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

The reason I&apos;m reporting it as a UFO is that it had no markings or lights on it as required and was hiding in the clouds.I was driving West from Florence Jct. on Rt. 60 towards Mesa at 18:00 just before sundown and was still about 20 miles from Mesa when I noticed it among the clouds North of Mesa.At first it looked like 4 small clouds floating South but then 3 of the clouds continued to float South while the 4th one turned and went back North over the mountains when it looked like it might end up out in the open over the city.At that time I could make out the football shape and was able to identify the craft as a Zeppelin or something similar. I continued to watch it for about 30 min. as I drove West until it disappeared in the shadows over the mountains to the North.I&apos;ve seen the Goodyear blimp and the Fuji blimp and it wasn&apos;t either of them, it was much too big, all gray and had no lights or markings on it and looked a lot like the one moored to the Empire State Building at the beginning of the movie Sky Captain.  The odd thing is I searched for Zeppelins on Google and the last one seems to have been decommissioned around 1940. This sighting was before the Phoenix Lights so I figure something like that carrying a structure underneath with some lights on it at night could have been the cause of some of the reported sightings.Then, last year I saw a story about a new model Zeppelin that was flying across Texas and Arizona on it&apos;s way to California about the same time all the UFO reports were coming from Texas. It was on the local news in Phoenix because it stopped briefly in Tucson. Here are some photos and information about the craft that flew to Calif. but I believe this one is smaller then the one I saw: http://zeppelintransit.blogspot.com/", "Black dot in sky breaks into 4 pieces--then collapses back into a single dot.

Headed towards Higgensville to get on I-70. We were going to a christian concert called I-hop at the Bartel hall in Kansas City, Mo. My friend was driving the van and I was the passenger.

It was up to the right of the van and coulndn&rsquo;t have been any higher than a very tall tree.  I yelled for Kim to pull over . She couldn&rsquo;t see anything but light and didn&rsquo;t know what was going on. I grabbed my Nikon d70 digital camera(I went to college and took photography classes) and when she stopped I yelled for her to get out and look at this thing and I started taking pictures. I remember her crying and saying ,&rdquo;lets go, please.&rdquo; I could only think of getting a photograph of this thing. I think I was just in shock!

It was round and had about eight lights around it and every three seconds would flash on and then off. When the lights would go off, I remembered every thing was completely dark. I had to count, 123&hellip;to get a picture. I did get nine photographs, Which later I discovered matched exactely to one I spotted on the internet on you tube that someone had taken! I got in the car because my friend was crying. We pulled up to 1050 rd. and called 911. I spoke to an officer . He asked a lot of questions about what I saw and then said that he was going to get his camera and head out there himself. He said that he would come out the next day and see the photos that I got and he never called. I later discovered My arm hurt and We were sick.We went to the concert that night although we were in a daze and very shaken up. We were headed back on I-70 about 1:30 a.m. and we suddenly saw to our left the object was landed in a field. I know this sounds crazy but it is ! true.

One is an extremely bright star- looking object that moves slightly  (my perspective). It is not a plane, helicopter or other familiar flying object. Always at the same time another enormous, slow- and low-flying object circles above my house and neighborhood. It is low enough to view pretty well as it has a red light that flashes quickly while it is moving. You can only tell that it is large when the light flashes, but I cannot tell the shape. It is either completely silent or makes an unusual humming noise. My landlord prefers me to smoke cigarettes outside, so I usually am in and out of my house. It is almost always between 7:00 and 8:00 pm in the evening and has gotten so close at times while I am watching it, that it scares me and I run back into my house. Sometimes there are several of the star-like things in the sky, but only one of the large objects, and only one of the star-like objects is closer than all the others. The one that appears the closest is always in the same vicinity. After reading some of these posts, I realized I am not alone in what I see.  I am a little embarrassed to ask any of my co-workers, etc. if they see what I see. I live alone. I took two pictures with my camera phone but they just look like dots.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I watched it as I drove and then pulled off the road to get a better view and determine its speed, size, etc.  It was cone-shaped, with the open part up, but very nearly an isosceles triangle from my vantage point. It had what appeared to be a thin rod projecting from the bottom point of the cone.  At the end of the rod there appeared to be a shiny sphere.I watched it as it floated in a stationary position.  After about 3 minutes, a C130 took off from SDF, flew by the UFO, and then headed west.  The UFO then almost immediatly headed east and increased its altitude.  The craft appeared to move at about the speed of a helicopter, but remained perfectly vertical from what I could tell.This craft was completely black except for the shiny sphere at the end of the rod.  My theory is that its visual stealthing wasn&apos;t working properly.  I did not take a photo because I was concerned about getting in trouble.  My assumption at that point was that it was a US military stealth drone of some sort.

I quickly knocked on the car window and my family got out. We watched for a minute or so and finally saw a single light to the south for two or three seconds. Within a few seconds, we saw a single light in about the same place where I had seen the first one. This light quickly split into the four lights again. Within just a few seconds it was gone. During this whole period we also saw several white lights slowing blinking and moving around slowly in random directions. These lights were not real bright, about what you would see from a plane, but the blinking rate and random movement appeared very unusual.I don&apos;t know if the bright planet in the west in the evening is Jupiter or Venus, but the amber lights we saw were several times brighter than this planet.

It was on December 17, 2008, on my way home from Marshall, Missouri when I first noticed the strange lights. I was driving North on 65 hwy in the direction towards home. Not yet out of town, by our local radio station, KMMO, I saw a small red light resembling a planet approx. a mile above the KMMO station. It was moving in small circles, slowly getting lower to the ground, closer to the hwy and dangerously close to my car. The light changed in color to a yellow green and white, and a possible shape took forward as a string of lights appeared in a disc shape resembling a Frisbee but I saw only the lights. It was raining quite hard this night. The object got closer to the hwy and my car. When it was no more than three car lengths in front of my vehicle and going no more than 20 mph, I slammed on my brakes, afraid of hitting the object, though all I saw were its vast lights. No more than a few feet from the ground and getting within a car length of my car, I started to panic and dig into my coat pocket for my cell. I called home and described to my Dad exactly what I was witnessing. By this time, the object had stayed this car length from my car and took up both lanes of the hwy spanning at least 30 feet in length but no more than a couple of feet in height. I was close to my gravel road, country road 425, a right turn from the hwy about 7 miles from town. Hesitant, I turned. The object was out of sight for a moment and I was relieved. My car died and I reached for my cell once again. My cell appeared dead. I turned the key and my car started. The lights came into view again to my left on the gravel road but at least 50 feet out in the fields. Appearing to be intrigued by my vehicle the lights moved as my car moved but remained in the field. At the second turn, the lights still in view, my car died again. The object moved closer, at least a car length, to the left of my car, and though it was raining and I had my windshield wipers as fast as they would go to keep my vision from being obstructed by the rain, it appeared the rain had stopped. I looked in front of me and saw the lights from the church on our gravel road. It was still pouring, if not raining harder. The closer the object got, no rain fell on my windshield. I started my vehicle again and looked to my left. The object had distanced itself from me but continued to follow along side my car. A mile and a half on the gravel road, the object stopped in an empty field to my left at least 100 ft. from the gravel road. The field where the lights settled a few feet from the ground often floods in rain and those crops are lost in the summer. My car dies again but starts easily a third time. I continue to drive home but the object did not follow but remained stationary in the field,  a good 30-35 ft of lights, parallel to the horizon. The object was still in view a good mile through my rearview but seemed to not move. Over the railroad tracks my car died again. I find the constant dying in relation with the encounter strange, since I had my car only a month and it was fairly new: an 07&rsquo;. I made it home, the object, I assumed still in that field. I ran to the house, falling a few times in my frightened hurry, to my dad on the computer in our dining room. I gave him a brief summary and suggested we drive down to the object in a different vehicle. My dad was not in a huge hurry. We left a half hour later. Not to my surprise, the object was gone. I did call the Sherriff&apos;s Dept. to report the incident. The dispatcher said they&apos;d send someone out to investigate, but no one came to question me.

Before I had enough sense to take a picture with my cell phone to show some actual UFO proof to my friends and family the two disks quickly escaped my view. I always thought people were lying about these kinds of sightings, but seeing it for your own eyes is surreal!", "zero to very fast moving star and meteor glows the night green. Crash &amp; burn at Vandenburg &apos;95So long ago now i can&apos;t remember the exact date, but but this was the only sighting of anything odd that i ever had and thought i&apos;d describe it here. Summer of &apos;95 laying in the pool looking up into the stars.......... i noticed one of them was moving. Thinking it was probably just an aircraft of some sort i followed it (visibly) for about 10 or 15 seconds and it stopped. I kept my eye on it so not to mix it up with the stars as it was about the same size and brightness of most. After watching it where it stopped for another 10 or 15 seconds the &quot;star&quot; accelerated at what appeared to be 90 deg. direction from which it original came from.... leaving a streak and promptly disappeared. I continued to watch the sky thinking i would see something else and approximately 15 or 20 minutes later i did. I believe it was a meteor coming into the atmosphere from the south east towards the north west at the same place as i just saw the moving &quot;star&quot; (as if it were marking the location). All this taking place (generally) over Edwards AFB and also near China lake Naval station...... i always wrote it off as possibly a military ufo, but a couple years later i heard a story right hear on nuforc about and object that crashed (touched down)and burned on the coast near vandenburg for a week. One last thing.... my cousin i found out just recently saw that so called meteor that lit up the sky green so bright it could have been day time, so i&apos;m thinking there were atleast more people that saw that to possibly comfirm the date. My opinion is....if this &quot;star&quot; was a craft from this world then we have some wicked awesome technology.", "Metallic Oval hovers in broad daylight at Great Falls International AirportThis sighting changed me.  Previous to it, I dismissed all claims of sightings of UFO&rsquo;s as explainable.  However, I saw the object in such broad daylight, in such clear sight, for a period of time, that it was totally inexplicable to me.  I even had time to go inside and get another person as a witness.Unfortunately, I did not think to scramble for a camera or a video recorder.  Although, I do have another witness who saw it as well.I tried for some time to find out whether there were any reports of activity at the air traffic control tower, or any reports by any other civilians; however I was unsuccessful in doing so.Now, I will also say that I did not think of the sighting as a &ldquo;UFO&rdquo; at the time, but rather just something to think about.It was probably 1-2 years later, when watching TV and seeing recorded footage of the same object sighted and recorded by many in Mexico, which according to the program made Mexican News, that I was struck by the fact that I had seen exactly the same thing.I believe it was Easter or around Easter in probably mid 1990&rsquo;s.  (I believe it was 1995.  Might be able to reconstruct better timeframe with effort).  I was in my early 20&rsquo;s, and was visiting my family.  It was probably between 10am and Noon, it was sunny with a few clouds and was pretty still.  We lived just below the airport,  as it is situated on a prairie rim.  From there I could see the air control tower, as well as some buildings, and of course commercial and military jets taking of and landing.  I was very used to seeing weather balloons, which I could also see very plainly when they went up.What I saw was a shiny object, mostly metallic-chrome-like, not completely round, oblong-round, just hovering in the sky approximately in vicinity of the air traffic control tower.  I never saw it move.  It seemed small, much smaller than even the F-16 jets that would take off.  I do remember turning away and returning minutes later, and it was gone.  Then later it was there again.  There was no movement ever witnessed, and it just appeared to maintain its position perfectly.I witnessed it for minutes.  I went inside and got another person to come out and look at it.  I asked, &ldquo;do you see that?&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; they confirmed.  &ldquo;What would you say that it is?&rdquo; I asked.  &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; they said.  &ldquo;How would you describe it?&rdquo;, I asked.  &ldquo;Like a metallic object, just floating there,&rdquo; they said.  We then returned inside.  Soon we came out again, and it was never seen again.Given the years I had had at the same residence, looking at the same buildings, same air traffic tower, same sky, planes, weather balloons, etc., I am totally convinced of what I saw.  I do not profess to know anything of what it could be.However, I have really wanted to know how to investigate weather air traffic control (FAA) reported anything, whether the Air National Guard also at same site reported anything, and whether there have been any other civilian sightings fitting that timeframe, date, time, location, etc.", "Fire fight in the sky.On August 4th, 1994  around 10:30PM my husband and I were star gazing from the open upper deck of our home in Sedona, AZ.  It was close to a new moon so the sky was dark and we had a clear view of the evening sky.We were facing in the direction of  Cathedral Rock which would have been northwest of our home.  I first noticed what seemed to be a very bright star just to the west of Cathedral Rock and pointed it out to my husband.  Within minutes after we noticed  a white laser type beam came in from the east and hit this object which I thought was a star.  We could see the object flare at first and then about 20 seconds later it exploded causing a firework type of effect - sparks floating down.  There was no sound and we just sat there shocked at what we had just seen.  About an hour later we received a phone call from friends in West Sedona telling us that there was a fire going in Secret Canyon (west of 89-A), but they didn&rsquo;t know much about it. We told them of what we had seen just a hour before and we all wondered if it might be connected.By morning the fire in Secret Canyon was quite bad, but because it is a very remote canyon the Forest Service decided to just watch the fire rather then try to fight it with water planes.  We went into town to a local coffee house and meet a few other people talking about the fire and the night before. One couple stated that about an hour before the fire was reported they saw a small flaming object fall into Secret Canyon and they thought that was the cause of the fire. That would have been right about the time that we witnessed the explosion in the sky.The people of Sedona watched this fire burn for ten days, many sitting for hours at night on Air Port Mesa looking out over Secret Canyon.  When the fire finally began to reach the area of resorts in Oak Creek Canyon the Forest Service decided to fight the fire.In itself this story doesn&rsquo;t sound like much in the way of a UFO report, but at that time in Sedona many locals were aware of something strange in Secret Canyon, and another area, because many hikers into that area had been turned away by military type men in black uniforms with M-16s to back them up. There had even been two off duty police officers hiking there  that had been turned back and told to not return.After the fire was put out the whole canyon area was closed off for about 3 months and many trucks were seen going into that area. Many of the locals at that time felt that there might have been some type of aerial fight between two &ldquo;UFOs&rdquo; and the one shot down fell into Secret Canyon.  Many of the locals were talking about it and many tourist over heard and asked questions - and then a few days later some of the locals working in the shops had visits by men dressed as tourist in dark sunglasses. I was one of those locals, a man entering the shop and came &ldquo;nose to nose&rsquo; with me and said, &ldquo;I hear that you know a lot about UFOs, tell me about them&rdquo;.  I knew exactly what that was all about and said nothing and the man left. There were enough locals afraid after that to just remain quiet.  One local rancher had already had much trouble from different government agencies because of UFO reports he had made and so it put the locals on pins and needles.There is a LOT that has, and still does, go on in this area revolving around UFOs and alien life forms - people just don&rsquo;t talk openly about it anymore((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))", "This sighting was EXTREMELY similar to &quot;Endeavor&quot; space shuttle night time fly-by&apos;s.I have seen many UFO&rsquo;S in Yuma for quite sometime, and have been always disappointed because I never had a camera at hand until today during this sighting.I was able to instantly recognize that this was very similar if not exactly what I have seen in previous times in Yuma.They are major military bases in Yuma, and I truly believe that these bases DO withhold technology from which you will see in my video.I have seen events of the space shuttles zooming across the sky&rsquo;s at night, if you have seen that happen then you can DEFINITELY compare how this event looked extremely similar.It was a bright white light that floated across the sky, catching my intention, enough to run inside and yell at my parents at the top of my lungs to come outside and witness this.I was so sure that this is what I have seen in the past multiple times, I even told them that this light would zoom away at thousands of miles an hour once it reaches the outside skirts of Yuma. This light did just that. My father said that that was the most significant part of this sighting, because I predicted or just pretty much knew it was going zoom out of sight at supersonic speeds.Earlier this year I sighted what had been supposedly the space shuttle &ldquo;Discovery&rdquo; or &ldquo;Endeavor&rdquo;. Our local Yuma Daily Sun news report gave approximate times for the sighting of the space station flying past, and me being a constant observer of our skies I had seen this space station one night thinking it was a UFO later to find out it was &ldquo;Discovery&rdquo; or &ldquo;Endeavor&rdquo; that was flying by. I saw this light two nights in a row. Both nights sighting were extremely similar to what you seen is this video I took that I am now reporting to you guys. The only difference being between this sighting and the &ldquo;Discovery&rdquo; or &ldquo;Endeavor&rdquo; sighting is this video is shot while the sky is lightly lit. The sun was up enough to see the sunset on the horizon.This UFO was bee-lining across the sky at a steady, slow , floating pace. It was about 30 seconds later after this video ended, due to lack of memory on the camera, that the light zoom off at supersonic speeds right as it reached the outskirts of Yuma County.While I was shooting the video I was stating that the flashing red light was &ldquo;BELOW&rdquo;  white light. It &ldquo;WAS&rdquo; below the white light just before I shot the video. I did not realize the flashing red light from the plane had been coming toward us almost directly and had risen above the white light which you see in the video. The only conclusion I can get out of that is either this white light was below this plane and the plane gained altitude, or this white light is just outside the atmosphere and created an optical illusion even to myself. So the white light can appear to an observer to either be below the atmosphere in the skies of Yuma County or it was moving at incredible rates outside the atmosphere and floated across the sky very similar to that of the satellite.So let&rsquo;s say if this object was in space then it being its size and the brightness of it, this object must be gigantic enough to reflect the sun&rsquo;s light off it to appear so large. So one way or another the size of this thing is massive , and you can compare it to the plane flying past. Because the plane was flying by is going to make it much easier for you guys to study the size of this object and the direction its going. And myself living in Yuma since day one, and can bet my bottom dollar that the flashing red light was from a Jumbo Commercial Airliner, no doubt in my mind, that plane is heading right for California. The fence you see in my back yard it going parallel with North and South. The airliner is heading west. The light is Heading NW from what I observed.Let me make this very Clear. This Object did not have supersonic speed until it reached the outskirts of Yuma. AS SOON AS IT DID it zoomed up to supersonic speeds and the lightly gradually at a somewhat fast pace got smaller and kind of dimmed smaller and smaller. A satellites light doesn&rsquo;t even dim out like that. Satelites that I have seen in our skies did not move at same high speeds as this. Had the white light actually be in space. If it were then this white light would beat any satellite up there in a race hands down. And that was when the white light was just floating across the Yuma sky, so theres no telling just how fast this white light took off at the end of its descent.I watched this white light come across the sky from the deep south of Yuma, and I could bet my bottom dollar it was in Mexico&rsquo;s air space before it reached Yuma. Do our space shuttles travel from South to North? From what I understand they do not.I would love it if you guys could get back to me and let me know what you guys think of this and if this helps you with your research. Thank for taking the time to read this.Thanks a billion!", "Shift and Light Shifting object high over Copperas Cove, TexasI walked outside my home at 10PM last night to let the dogs do their business.  While out, I was looking around the sky because there seemed to be very few stars out.  When I looked West, I saw a lone bright object which appeared to be about the height of a high flying plane.  Although I expected it to move across the sky until it was out of sight, it didn&apos;t move.  Then as I was watching, it turned from a white light to a red light, then back to white.  It wasn&apos;t really blinking as it stayed approximately one color for a minute or two before changing to the other.I went inside and got my binoculars and came back out.  Looking through the lens, it appeared to go from round to long and back to round.  That was coordinated with the light changes.  My wife was expected home so I went inside to wait for her and show her the object so that I would have verification.  About 10 minutes later, I went back out with her but the object was gone.((NUFORC Note:  Venus??  PD))", "I saw two lights about to collide then suddenly one circles the other before they take off at rapid speed.I was driving home from work, and as I was approaching a stop sign on the road, I saw two lights coming straight towards each other. I thought it was two planes about to crash.  I noticed that they were moving very fast and the objects were a solid colored light and not blinking like a regular aircraft.Just as it looked like they were about to collide, one light circled the other and they both took off in sync at a rapid speed going West. I stopped in the middle of the intersection because I was very frightened, and through the trees I saw them break off and travel slower at a more normal speed.I turned the corner and straight ahead out the window  the lights were in sync again now traveling  faster going South. Far from where I just saw them before, then out of sight.", "Around the end of July 2007, I was sitting in a chair on my back porch enjoying the warm weather under cloud cover which was at the normal height for low clouds, with a small break of blue sky scattered throughout the clouds.As I was looking at one of the small blue breaks in the clouds above me and slightly to the west, when suddenly I noticed a round craft going through the break in the clouds heading from the northeast heading southwest.The craft was cloud-white colored on the bottom with the top part that I could see silver with a purple-blue dome on top with streaks of gold on the back part of the dome.I saw the craft for about three seconds (or less). Since I have realized that what I saw was a lot bigger than I thought at the time.The craft was thicker through the middle than the sides.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))", "Diamond shaped craft sighting followed by missing time  In the spring of 1983 I was driving to through a rural area of Washington county, in Mississippi to see my father and his brothers, who were having a semi-annual get together in a cabin in the woods. I was 16 and planning on stopping by for a few minutes on my way home from work. I was within a few miles of the cabin when I saw a light in the sky, peripherally, to my left. It was bright white with a smaller green light just below and seemed to be diamond shaped. It was descending rapidly, but not straight down. It arced slightly in the direction from which I was coming. It disappeared behind the trees very quickly, the entire sighting lasted only seconds.  I can&rsquo;t say how far away it was from me, but it seemed to be approximately a mile.Simultaneously with the sighting my car suddenly died. It coasted to a stop on the dirt road. There were no houses nearby, and I was so upset about being stranded in the middle of nowhere that I wasn&rsquo;t really concerned about the strange lights I had seen, and assumed I was just having car trouble. The last memory I have is my hand on the key, turning it in the ignition to no effect. In the next moment (or so I thought at the time) my hand was still on the key but a feeling of disorientation and confusion washed over me. I knew immediately something was wrong but I had no idea what. Instinctively I tried the ignition again, and to my intense relief, it started right away. I started driving in the direction of the cabin again, feeling quite shaken but not knowing why. When I arrived my father told me about the electricity going out in the cabin and while I don&rsquo;t remember why, I had the impression it had been an odd event in some way. But I wasn&rsquo;t concerned until I gathered it had happened a couple of hours before hand, which prompted me to look at my own watch. I was stunned to see it was about 2 hours later than it should have been. I quickly made an excuse about feeling ill, and I did feel nauseous at that moment, so I could go home. Right then I felt an overwhelming desire to leave the area, it felt extremely unsafe being there. Strangely though, I felt no qualms about leaving my father and uncles there, I felt no threat to them at all.For a long time I tried to convince myself that I had somehow fallen asleep at the wheel, and imagined the whole thing. I told no one what I had seen, sure that they would think I was mentally unstable. A few days ago, some 26 years after the event, I told my husband of many years of what had happened to me as a teenager, and his unquestioning belief in me has led me to explore my experiences further.Although I didn&rsquo;t consciously dwell on what had happened to me, it did affect me. For the next several years after the event I was unable to sleep unless the bed was pushed against the wall and my back was against the wall, literally. My anxiety levels were sky high, especially at night. I had frequent insomnia and nightmares, a problem that continues to plague me to this day. My most disturbing nightmares all have the same theme, involving the extinction of mankind at the hands of an alien race. I know this is not a memory of any kind, but a manifestation of deep seated anxieties that for some inexplicable reason , I never tied to the event until I spoke about it with my husband.To this day I have no memories whatsoever of what happened to me during that missing 2 hours. I currently hold a masters degree and enjoy a fairly wide breadth of knowledge but have never been able to come up with a reasonable explanation.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))", "Bright green &quot;fireball&quot; seen overhead and headed towards woodline; no crash, whistle, or bang heard.I was walking outside in my back yard to feed my dog when I saw a bright green object go over the trees. It resembled a comet or flare, but it was green. The object had the intensity of a welding torch, but did not burn my eyes; the tail behind was, as I stated earlier, a bright turquoise-green. I saw it out of the corner of my eye and watched it go over the tree tops. There was no boom, there was no whistle or pop, these led me to believe it was not a firework or bottle rocket.In a possible unrelated event, a few minutes later, a plane came flying over from the horizon. All that were visible were the lights on it, but rather than flashing like a normal military or commercial plane, it flashed similarly to that of a police car. I didn&apos;t stick around to see where it was headed, as it was cold, so I went into the house.My house is about 25 to 30 miles away from an air force base, but in the 10 years we&apos;ve lived here, I&apos;ve never seen anything like the green light.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))", "Large, floating metallic sphere with a single &apos;headlight&apos; and atleast 3 red lights on its bottom-sideOn January 15, 2009 at approximately 12:05 AM in Rockville, MD 20850, I witnessed a UFO silently moving across the sky not too far away from me.  I am a college security officer and was out patrolling the campus when I observed a bright light West of me.  At first I assumed it was an airplane with an extremely bright light and I thought to myself &lsquo;that is a really bright light&rsquo;.  The sky was somewhat cloudy at times but it was clear enough that stars were visible still &ndash; more like a hazy/cloudy sky at the time of the sighting.  If one has seen an airplane traveling through clouds before, one would have observed that the headlight is distinct and the light forms a triangular shape; this object I was watching was doing the same thing only it was at least twice as big as a light from an airplane.  Throughout the approximate 2 minutes I watched this light, it began to move South and I thought to myself &lsquo;either that plane is about to crash into me or it is flying dangerously low&rsquo;.  My assumptions that it was an airplane were backed by 3 flashing red lights beneath it (resembling a planes wingspan).  As it began to turn South from its seemingly stationary position, I thought that it could not be an airplane and that it must be a helicopter.  The only problem is that this made no noise that I could hear what-so-ever (when police helicopters fly anywhere near the campus, they are extremely loud and obvious, unlike what I saw).  As it turned I caught a very clear sight of the actual object on its side in the bright moonlight and at that point I ruled out the possibility of it being a helicopter.   The object most simply described was a large, dark, metallic sphere floating slowly in the air, possibly a few hundred feet above the treetops.  I was unable to assess how large this object was, but from my view, its size was about the same as the moon&rsquo;s size from my view.  I even considered the possibility that it was some sort of remote controlled toy but it was too big and I thought that it would be ! silly fo r anyone to be playing with something like this at midnight.  It was heading out of my sight and about to be hidden behind a building and large bare trees so I ran to get to the other side of the building to get a better look but I could not find a trace of it anywhere.  I did see what seemed like an airplane traveling very far away in the distance but could not understand how it could have gone that far in a matter of 15 seconds or so.  But I am 100% sure of what I saw; a large sphere-like object with a single intensely bright &lsquo;headlight&rsquo; on its side facing a downward angle and at the least 3 red flashing lights on its bottom side. One housekeeping staff working through the night noticed a bright light in the sky not moving but did not think enough of it to watch it because it was too cold outside.  He went to throw out garbage but on his way back he noticed that it was gone. One other security officer claims he saw red lights in the clouds above him not moving but did not see the actual object as I did as he drove around in the security truck but did not pay much attention to them. The duration of time of what I saw was about a total of 2 minutes but I only saw the actual objects body for approximately 10 seconds.  Never in my life have I seen anything that could have been a UFO before today.  It clearly was what I said it was.  While speaking with the housekeeping staff witness inside of a building, we both heard what sounded like a rocket being fired.  An example of this sound is what the fireworks sound like during 4th of July celebrations as they are fired into the air.  But there was no sound following this whistle.  This is possibly unrelated but in my 2 years of working this shift at this job I have never heard anything like this.  After hearing it I ran outside to see if there was something to see but the sky was clear.", "Sphere-like aircraft flying in circle eight pattern at a flying height of a commercial airline.This day I noticed, what I thought was a flock of birds circling, a group of sphere-like flying objects several feet in the air. Approxmate height in the atmospher is around the level a long distance commerical flight would fly. I thought at the beginning it was a flock of birds, but they were hard to make out and appeared to be 1/3 of the size of a commerical plane flying by seconds after they disappeared. 10-12 sphere flew in a circle 8 pattern in two separate locatioins in the air and flew at a rather high speed considering the height in the air. They flew in two separate locations for approx. 10 minutes. They disappeared as soon as two commerical airlines flew into view from the south and east. It truly an amazing sight to see with our two 2 year olds and 5 year old as we viewed the the sky from the front yard of our house.", "Bright light(s) witnessed in Carlsbad on 2/2/09I spotted a very bright orange/yellow light in the evening sky just north of Carlsbad.  I couldn&apos;t tell how far away it was, only that it was large enough to know it wasn&apos;t a star.  I watched it for about 20 seconds then I went inside to get my husband.  It took me about 10 seconds to get back outside, and it was gone.  I waited for a couple of minutes, then I saw it again.  It was in the exact same spot.  I called out for my husband again but then it slowly disappeared behind the mountains.  I waited again then I saw 2 lights appear out of nowhere.  The larger light was there and a new, smaller light.  The smaller light began to disappear, but the larger light stayed in its position.  I called out for my husband again and he finally made it outside in time to witness the light.  I asked him what it was, and he said he didn&apos;t know.  I asked him to get my cell phone so I could record it.  The light then slowly began to dim and finally went out.  It didn&apos;t go behind the mountains.  The light just started to dim and then disappeared.  I was unable to catch the light on my cell phone.  After it disappeared, I didn&apos;t see it again.  I came directly inside and got on the internet to see if anyone else had reported it.", "Bright light above the mountians north of Rancho CucamongaThere was a very bright light hovering above part of a mountain north of Rancho Cucamonga. It was an orange/yellow light that would change to red and green. I first saw it when I was some 10 miles away and I drove right past it. It was to high off the mountain to be a communication tower, there is none there. It was to slow to be an airplane, and it was far and to windy in the Cajon Pass to be a helicopter. I drove on three sides of the mountain and the light never dimmed, nor did it look like it struggled to move in the wind like an aircraft would in such high wind. I watched it move slowly a few miles when I lost sight of it behind another mountain.", "Bright green light.I was drivig home heading up the Steese Hwy. towards Fox.  I was about 1/2 from the Chena Hot Springs exit when off to my left I saw an incredibly bright light falling.  It looked just like a shooting star only much brighter and much closer and it was green.  It looked as if it would hit the ground in the valley behind Curry&apos;s Corner.  I had my 3 children in the car with me and they were just as amazed as I was.  It looked white as it was falling then the closer it got to the ground the brighter green it seemed to get.I believe it was debris that had entered our atmosphere.The strange thing is that a couple of weeks ago less than 6 miles away a friend of mine reported the exact same sighting on her way to work.  There were many witnesses in both incidences.Any clues as to what is falling from the sky here?  Satellite debris maybe?", "I saw a large black triangular shaped object hovering over my back yard.On January 18 2009 @ 8:30 pm I walked to my backyard and noticed three white lights very low over my back yard. I noticed them because the clouds in the sky were very unusual, they were low and wispy. As I was looking at the lights they began to rotate in a clockwise direction. It was at this time I realized that the three lights were connected to one large object. This object was triangle in shape and seemed to be black in color. The white lights were fixed on each corner of the object. The object was very low, slightly higher than the tree tops. It was hovering in the same spot as it rotated. As it hovered I noticed a very faint hum. Other than this slight hum it was silent. After the object rotated one time it slowly began to move South/Southwest. As it began to move is when I yelled for my partner who was still in the house. He came out in time to see the lights pass over our house. The three lights did not blink and seemed to be on the bottom of the object. As the object flew away it began to gain speed and altitude. The object turned and banked several times.  It seemed to move effortlessly almost like it was in water. We live right next to the Burbank Airport so we are used to seeing airplanes and helicopters. This object was like nothing I have ever seen. It was larger than my house just hovering with virtually no sound and no wind. I have been searching for more reports on that night but have had no luck. I have always been a skeptic but I know what I saw and this event has changed my perspective.", "Interesting light in sky, definitely space-object, behaved like satellite, but was momentarily very, very brightIt was right around 6PM local time, Sun had barely set, and I was standing in my backyard enjoying a cigarette. Was not looking at sky but eyes drawn to sky by radiant light suddenly appearing in the sky. It was as bright as an airliner&apos;s landing lights, when viewed about ~2000 feet above and ~2000 feet away from you, aimed in your direction. The light suddenly and rapidly dimmed into the very low apparent brightness of a satellite, and it cruised at satellite speeds directly overhead towards the southeast. I&apos;d say when I initially saw it - when it was really bright - it was about fifty degrees of arc above the eastern horizon.I&apos;d normally think it was a satellite. Speed was right, direction was right, and it crossed in my vision with the Sun below the horizon, and could have hit the satellite at just the right angle to make it very bright. But this thing was BRIGHT. It would have been a massive satellite to glare like that from so far away. I watch the ISS sometimes - actually look where it is on the internet and plan for it to fly over me in that very type of lighting situation - and it wasn&apos;t the ISS. In that lighting situation ISS does not get as bright, and then does not get so dim, as this thing did.The other odd aspect of this thing&apos;s illumination was it did not ever get totally dark when it crossed the terminator heading to the southeastern horizon. When I&apos;ve observed the ISS in the same situation, it rapidly turns a gorgeous red and then fades into black at some point before crossing the other horizon. The ISS is spectacular when it does that. This thing did not disappear when it crossed the terminator. It was a very interesting phenomena.", "Inflight formation with two diskI&apos;m currently a 25,000 hour pilot (2009), but on March 21, 1978 I only had around 5,000 hours.  I have reported this incident to Dr Haines and Dr. Friedman, no one else.I was flying an Aero Commander 680, on a the last leg of the day on a freight run from Klamath Falls, OR to Medford, OR at about 4am.  I had climbed to an altitude of 15,000 feet on this night in order to top icing conditions resulting from a fast moving cold front that was at that time about half way between the two cities.  I had a passenger with me sitting in the copilots seat.About 15 miles from the Medford VOR, I broke out the side of clouds into a perfectly clear rain washed sky, with full moon setting on the horizon ahead.  This of course, left me very high for landing at Medford...so I canceled my IFR flight plan and headed directly to the airport, arriving there at an altitude above 8,000 feet where I began circling to descend for the traffic pattern.As I was passing about 7,000 feet, I was circling to the left over the airport on a southeasterly heading when I noticed what looked to me like the landing light of a relatively slow moving aircraft flying in the opposite direction.  I called the tower and asked if they had other traffic in the area, they said they did not, I was not too surprised to hear that in as much as we were both above the towers airspace so contact was not required.  As we passed abeam each other at about the same altitude and within about one mile, the craft silhouetted against the full moon on the western horizon, when I could see that the craft had no tail and a light on the back as bright as the one on the front that I originally thought was a landing light.  Thinking this was unusual, I turned toward the craft, to the right.  As I turned the craft, also turned to the right and accelerated.  When I started the turn, I was southeast bound, as I turned steeper and steeper to keep the craft in sight, it continued to accelerate in a turning arc about 2 miles out side my turn until I lost sight of it over the top of the aircraft, then in about a 60 degree banked turn then headed to the northeast.  I continued the turn all the way around to a northwesterly heading when I rolled out, not having caught sight of the craft again in the turn.Shortly after rolling out of the turn heading to the northwest....two flying disc pulled up on my left wing, no more than ten feet off my wing tip and perhaps 5 feet higher, where we flew together in formation for perhaps 15 to 20 seconds.  The furthest one was lit slightly ahead of the nearest one which was not lit.  The lights of the city were shining up from the ground in the rain washed air.  I could not see much detail on the lighted craft due to the bright lights on the front and back, but I could see good detail on the nearer one, both craft appeared to be the same.  They were disc shaped, white or light gray in color and I could see what looked like scotch marks on the bottom. The were about the same diameter as the wing span of the Aero Commander or about 55 to 60 feet across.  I could not see any openings of any kind in either of the craft and could not hear any sounds from the craft over the sound of the planes engines.At the time I was flying at about 160 knots, after the 15 or 20 seconds of formation flying the two craft accelerated to about 190 knots and pulled out in front of us about 2 miles when they instantaneously accelerated to a streak of light heading into space.  I looked over to my passenger, who was a little white in color....I&apos;m not sure if he was sick from the high G turn or stunned at what we has just witnessed.  After we landed it took a couple of minutes to get him out of the plane.  I saw him about 5 years later, he still did not wish to talk about it.  As this was occurring I was telling the tower these events as they happened, who never did see the craft....I can not understand why.", "One bright red light in the southeast sky alone for 10-15 min. joined by two more bright red lights from the east staying for 10 min.At approx. 20:50 hrs. myself and my wife noticed a stationary red light in the southeast sky.

There were four army jets traveling as fast as they could and taking evasive actions. Then a second or so later a silver cigar shaped craft came over the house.The Jets and cigar shaped craft were quite high (I would assume 1,000 feet or more high. I would also assume the cigar craft was 100 feet long. The UFO chased the four jets across the city of East Bernstadt . I did not hear any noise from the craft; but it sis leave a very short contrail. The jets and craft were going East to West. When the cigar shaped craft got over a hill we could see in the distance it stopped and hovered there for 10-15 seconds then went straight up out of sight at a great rate of speed.Two weeks later I saw the same or similar craft traveling slowly from the north west to the south east over the same town.My friend and I tried to tell others about this sighting but they teased saying that we saw the Goodyear blimp.

I first thought nothing of it and presumed it must have been light from a car headlight. Then it happened again, but this time the light moved very quickly and zigzagged through the window.Thinking that some kids were playing with a torch, I looked out of the window so see the source of the light. I waited there for roughly 40 seconds before I noticed a light 0.5 miles away on the other side of the lake, behind a small wooded area opposite the harbour. It appeared to be a ball of light, perfectly spherical with what I would estimate to have a diameter of 15-20 feet and pulsed slowly.The sphere moved at a jogging pace and weaved aimlessly through the trees. It would appear to slowly move down to the lakeside and stop there after completing a circuit of the wooded area. The sphere appeared to rotate as it would beam light every 1 minute, which I believe I first saw beaming through my bedroom window.I woke my wife and she was curious to what it could be, so she went to look in my son&rsquo;s room for binoculars. By the time she returned to the bedroom the light had stopped, but then over the lake, probable 0.8 miles from the wooded area where we had seen the light, a strobe light flickered and then disappeared over the banks of the lake at 25 mph.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The day started out very pleasant, then just after mid day we had a storm roll through. I remember this storm quite well, because we had a fair amount of Thunder and Lighting, which seemed scared my 2 yr old son. The loud cracking of the thunder prompted him to run over and ask that I hold him. After the storm had passed my wife took our Dogs out for some potty time, but when she came back into the house she said &quot;You have to see this rainbow outside&quot;. Much like anyone else this got me curious, so I walked out onto the deck to see this brilliant rainbow. It was the only rainbow I had ever seen that was entirely complete. At that time I decided I should snap some pictures of it, as I thought a complete rainbow was pretty cool to see. I walked around our house just taking random snapshots of the rainbow hoping that I could get an angle that showed the entire thing. A few days had passed and I decided to dump the pictures off of my digital camera onto my computer. After the process was complete I starting trolling through the pictures that I had taken over the past couple of weeks, and then noticed the rainbow pictures in thumbnail view. I opened the first of about 10 or 15 photos I had taken of the rainbow and started looking at them. When I reached the 3rd photo in the sequence I noticed a bright light under the left side of the arch. My initial thought is that it was simply the sun peering through the clouds. So I zoomed in closer to the anomaly on the pic and immediately said WTF is that! I quickly called my wife over to take a look at this and her response was the same. I was a bit perplexed because I did not see this when I was taking the photos. After further review we noticed that there looked like there was another one of the same objects just right of the center under the rainbow, but it was clearly too far away to be sure. At this point we definitely thought what we were looking at was a UFO. As you can see in the photo there are 3 or 4 individual round objects (lights) that appear to be emitting this bright white light from the UFO, or whatever it actually is. Also, by the length of the light trail, coupled with the fact that they are so large in the middle of a sunny day looks as though this object is moving up and to the left at a pretty impressive speed. Again, I did not see this at the time I was taking the picture, which leads me to think that this &quot;UFO&quot; was moving very fast, faster than the rate of capture by the human eye, and my camera just happened to catch one single frame during its travel. I really do not know... Take a look at the photo yourself and let me know what you think?  Also, for your reference I was facing north east and the sun was behind me, as it was late in the day.", "11/11/2005 600 pm ont. white spere  Ball of white light zoomed about a 1000 yards above tree lineSitting in my treestand,a white ball zoomed above the tree line about a 1000 yards above it.It had a long tail and the whole scene was very bright.Then 5 smaller balls flew of it.These objects looked perfectly seperated around it.Then it was gone.I just want to know what you think it is?", "Pemberton, NJ (Mt. Misery) - Life Changing UFO, Big Blue and White Lights, Silent as Slience Itself.PEMBERTON, NJ.  SUMMER 2007.It was the summer of 2007. Two friends and I drove to a Weird NJ location known as &ldquo;Mt. Misery Rd.&rdquo; I was driving my car that night, which was a green Ford Escort. So we drove around for a while, exploring this creepy, heavily wooded area in the Pine Barrens of Pemberton, New Jersey. We&rsquo;ve been there plenty of time before, but this particular time we took a different road to switch it up a little bit.As I was driving and talking about nonsense with my two friends, I didn&rsquo;t realize how deep I had driven, and I paid no attention to any of the turns I was making. Inevitably, as a result of my mere stupidity, we became lost, trying all different ways, but could not find anything that pointed us in the right direction. Of course, that&rsquo;s when I noticed that all of a sudden, my &frac34; full gas tank was now was empty to a point where the E-light was on. At this point, we were all starting to panic a little.Then we saw it, this HUGE, slow-moving object in the night sky. I&rsquo;ve always been interested in UFO&rsquo;s and all things similar, but up until that night I have never seen one, nor have I seen one since, but this sighting, that night, has changed my life and my perspective of everything.This giant thing in the sky was quieter than silence itself. My two friends kept telling me to &ldquo;Go,&rsquo;&rsquo; &ldquo;Leave,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Get the hell out of here!&rdquo; But I was not about to jet away from this amazing experience. So I stopped the car (but left it running, totally disregarding the E-light), and I stepped out of the driver&rsquo;s door to get a better look. It was breathtaking. It was even bigger than I had originally thought and it was moving towards the car. Well I don&rsquo;t know if it knew we were there or not, but it was flying overhead anyways. The underside was beautiful. Four bright blue lights and two or three white lights. The shape of the object was hard to make out, but it kind of looked circular, but not flying saucer. Whatever that thing was it moving too slowly and too silently to be anything man-made.Then it was time to leave. Gas supply was running really low at this point. Eventually, somehow, we made it back to the main road, and started on our journey home. Over the tree tops we were still able to see whatever it was we saw out in &ldquo;Mt. Misery Rd.&rdquo; Not too long after it finally disappeared though, I look at my gas-gauge. It was once again &frac34; full.I SWEAR ON MY LIFE THIS IS NOT A HOAX OR AN EXAGGERATED STORY. IT REALLY HAPPENED. I WOULDN&rsquo;T MAKE UP A STORY JUST TO GET SOME INTERNET FAME. NO ONE BUT ME WOULD KNOW THAT &ldquo;I&rdquo; WROTE THIS, SO FAME WOULD GO TO NO ONE.

It was difficult to determine if the object was providing its own source of light or was merely reflecting sunlight as it seemed to emit a &quot;welding-arc&quot; type of brightness. The shape was cylindrical and it appeared to be in an &quot;upright&quot; position.The truck I was riding in was stopped behind a schoolbus picking up students. I observed the object remain stationary in the sky for a couple of seconds, then watched as it dropped at a 45 degree angle at a phenomenal rate of speed and simply disappeared from sight. There were no objects to obscure my line of vision as I observed this. The object for all intents and purposes vanished from sight. The driver of our vehicle, to my delight, also witnessed the event and expressed his surprise as well.It would be extremely difficult to not have noticed the object as its illumination was quite vivid. There were no interior lights on in the vehicle and as we were stopped for a schoolbus (as were other vehicles), no chance of another vehicle&apos;s movement reflected on our windshield.As someone with an interest in unusual phenomena, and trained to look for rational explanations before declaring anything to be beyond that - this was pretty breath taking.

It had  3 very dim lights on the bottom?  The lights were in a triangle pattern moving very fast, silent and NNW direction. It appeared to be bending light around it? It was like it was invisible, like you could see though it in a way, except for the lights on it. The lights didn&rsquo;t blink at all and were white in color with a very slight gray yellow tint, and was very dim and hard to see. Very stealthily, no sound at all. The bending of the light around the lights reminded me of the movie &ldquo;Predator&rdquo;. Like when the creature was kind of visible yet non-visible. I&rsquo;m in the flight path of the Jets that come in to land at the Salt Lake City International  Airport, it was about the same height of the jets that come in to land but slightly higher and just west of me. My thumb held at full arms distance would be able to cover this object. The sighting was less than 4 to 5 seconds. See the 1st sketch below  (2) I&rsquo;m excited to see such a thing, so I stay outside and watch the sky intently. I&rsquo;m on the cell phone telling one of my friends about this sighting, he lives near Ogden City, about a 45 minute drive on the freeway. While I was telling him about the 7:10 pm sighting, I see another dim set of lights come straight towards me. Except this is Huge! It was a single row of 3 lights (dim) on a 45 degree angle. It moves straight over me with no sound at all and again in a NNW direction. The sighting was about 3 &frac12; seconds, In 3 &frac12; seconds it was gone! It was as low as the lowest jets fly that are preparing to land at the SLC Int. Airport. It appeared to be having light dimly radiating from above and around  it with almost a shadow like area around it too, I could almost see a craft on one side where the row of lights was. Over towards the right was where most of the light emanated from above the thing. It was like one side of a V of lights that were visible.  This thing also seemed to be bending light making it was very hard to see. If I held my arm fully extended with the palm flat against it still would not fully be able to cover this object. Like I said earlier it was huge! The time was about 8:30 pm. I had binoculars around my neck but was so dumb founded at this object I didn&rsquo;t even think of the binoculars or of the camera in my pocket, plus it was so fast! See the 2nd sketch below  (3) I&rsquo;m still outside watching the sky&rsquo;s (8:45pm). My neighbor comes home and see&rsquo;s me outside with a coat, hat, gloves and binoculars. With a puzzled look come over and asked me what I&rsquo;m doing. I tell her and she starts asking me where I seen the object etc. So I&rsquo;m telling her and  all of a sudden I see another object barely visible in a sense and very high traveling in a NNW direction. I immediately remember my binoculars this time and quickly find this object in my 10x50 power binoculars. It was like a flying wing with about 9 round lights forming a slight V formation. It was fast and silent. The sighting was about 4 seconds long. Her eyes were better than mine. I asked what she saw and she also saw a triangle pattern of lights. I can&rsquo;t say that I could see much more than the lights. But it did appear to be dark between the area of the lights in the form of a wing type V pattern. We also noticed it had no sound what so ever. See the 3rd sketch below  (4) It&rsquo;s cold out and I&rsquo;m still out watching the sky, 3 in one night! What&rsquo;s going on! Anyway it&rsquo;s about 11:00 pm now, I&rsquo;m in my back yard now, earlier I was in the driveway. I&rsquo;m looking to the south. All of a sudden I see a dimly visible row of lights in a slight V pattern but yet almost straight across. It&rsquo;s coming fast and low about the same height of the jets that come in to land at the airport. I quickly view this with my  binoculars. I&rsquo;m shocked! It&rsquo;s not one thing, it&rsquo;s a group of white triangle&rsquo;s. They were moving in a, a moving formation 15 to 17 of them in triangle formations in each triangle pattern the lead one would drop back to the rear and then move back to the front again, this was happening in unison along this formation line, from one side to the other(One triangle of formation with one in between the next triangle formation with one on each side of the triangle formation. They changed pattern about 4 times). It was very strange and puzzling. It also reminded me of birds in flight but different too. The sighting was no more than 4 &frac12; seconds. I would guess each craft was a little bigger than a small airplane. They had no lights on them but had a white glow to them with a Ripley effect around them. They were not bright at all, dim yet very solid looking triangles. They were a perfect triangle shape with a slight V notched out the back edge of them. They were silent and fast moving in a NNW direction. They went right over me. I stared at them intently with my binoculars. The width of the formation was wider than the palm of my hand flatly held out at arm&rsquo;s length. Please see the 4th sketch below. I stayed outside until about 1:15 am, I didn&rsquo;t see anything else peculiar. All of this in one night! I will never forget this night!

I put down the binoculars to get a better look since they were moving much faster then the first sighting, also they looked to be at apx. 1500 to 2000 ft.

Eratic motion and behavior suggest none-human aircraft...First off, I&rsquo;m going to say that I have always believed in life on other planets. It&rsquo;s really egotistical to believe that the earth is the only planet in the whole universe that supports intelligent life. But at the same time I have always been skeptical of UFO&rsquo;s visiting earth. Honestly, I thought that earth wasn&rsquo;t interesting enough. We&rsquo;re destroying our planet; we are loosing all of our natural resources, and over all, were not a very friendly species. Why would an alien species be interested in us? Well, my skepticism was tested one night.The day was July 4th, 2008. It was after dark, and we were all sitting in our lawns on our lawn chairs watching the fireworks that people set off over the lake. (I live on a lake) We did this every year, gathered with our friends to party and watch the fireworks. Anyway&hellip; Someone had just set off one of those giant fireworks, you know, the ones that shoot up and explode into a flower of colorful embers. It was an orange/red one, if I can recall. As the embers faded and burnt out, I noticed that three embers remained. I wasn&rsquo;t the only one who notices, considering all of our attention was too the sky from the fireworks, its not surprising that we all saw it. I thought it was really strange; these three lights were in a triangular formation. And just when I thought I was seeing things, the lights began to move across the sky. I thought, maybe military aircraft; considering the formation they were in. But they were far too high up. They were so far away that they looked more like stars than aircraft; beads of light moving across the sky. At some point in time, a fourth light, moving much faster than the triangular formation, raced to join the other lights. They stopped for a bit, then started moving again. They were also moving relatively slowly at the time, giving us plenty of time to gossip about the strange lights.Suddenly, however, one of the lights veered off in a different direction at angles far too dramatic for a human aircraft to maneuver; the light literally took off 90 degrees in the other direction. I watched this light speed off, going extremely fast, until it eventually disappeared; maybe going invisible, or maybe just leaving the earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. I was stunned. After this, of course, I turned my attention to the other two stars. Eventually, the second of these strange lights did the same thing, but went forward rather than changed directions. It shot off very fast, and then vanished. The third light would just vanish without moving. It stopped, and then vanished. The fourth light, oddly enough, came to a halt, and stayed there most of the night; disguising itself as a orange star. I recall looking back on it sometime later that night; it was gone.I really was stunned. I had no explanation for this. Some would say weather balloons, but they were far too high up, and the erratic change in position and speed could not be explained by this. And unless the government has secretly developed some sort of spherical aircraft, noticed only by one light, that can move at 90 degree or less angles then vanish, I highly doubt it was anything man-made. It baffled me, it baffled everyone else. I really have no explanation for it.I wish I had a camera on me at the time; it would have validated this a bit more; or maybe even a video camera. But with the fireworks, and considering how high up they were, I wonder if I would have even been able to record them. All I have is my sight, and my memory. I&rsquo;m sure others at the party dismissed it, but I can&rsquo;t help but feel that there was more to those lights than they all think.", "I hope someone else can report on this!it was pertty dark but I looked up and you could see 4 lights one on each side of it, and the outline of the circle around this object was clearly visible.

Nightly occurance. No sound.Marlton /Medford, NJ UFO Observation Report February 02, 2009  I have been observing an object in the evening sky which strobes occasionally (white, green, blue and red), and is almost impossible to focus in on with binoculars (7X35 power). When close to focus the object looks like a cone or jellyfish with colors continually changing. No sound. This object moves erratically and quickly, up, down and left right also in circles but, stays within a boundary of approximately 5 miles (educated guess). The objects position is typically trailing the constellation of the Big Dipper in the Eastern skies starting at approximately 15-20 degrees above the horizon at 18:00 hours and then moving in the same trajectory as the Big Dipper later into the evening. A guess that it is at 50 to 100,000 feet above sea level.

It was easily the brightest object in the sky and the sky was very clear and I could see many stars and even the faint milky way, since there isn&apos;t much city light to diminish the view of the stars where I live.  I was not aware of any planetary sightings during this period, and was most certain that what I had spotted was not a plane or satellite, I watched closely and made a call to my ex-wife who lived on the other side of town.  She went outside and spotted the object as well, noting as I did that it moved in an ever so slight wobble.  Being that it was around 29 degrees outside, she went back in to her home.  I stayed out side and watched this object float around the general area that I had initially spotted it in for 75 minutes.  It&apos;s movement varied from random wobbles to slow vertical movement.  There were approx. 18 aircraft that traveled in the visual area of this object and as these aircraft flew through my view ( I kept constant watch of the object.) the object would move in a seemingly defensive direction, but not drastic in relative distance.  At 20:15 the light very slowly began to fade until I was able to discern a somewhat shape of a disc and from where the light appeared to emit, the color turned from yellow to red then the object completely disappeared.  I did shoot 35 seconds of cell phone quality video.  You can not see the stars or planes that were flying by, but clearly see the object.", "Home and Yard Lit up By Solid White Light, Surrounded By Colored LightsI&apos;m visiting my parents in Michigan, and at 1:30 AM my dog wanted to go outside very badly.  She started barking incessantly after a few minutes.  When I went to let her back in I saw that the home behind (and 4 doors down from) my parents home was encased in a bright white light.  The light was very strange in that I could not identify the source.  However, it reminded me of looking at a football field lit up for a night game -- the light is directed squarely on the field but darkness surrounds the field.  This is how the light behaved that shined on the house (and only that house and it&apos;s yard).  The light was much whiter and much brighter than what would be achieved by floodlights.  Furthermore, a band of relatively large colored balls of light surrounded the home itself.  To borrow from another analogy, it looked like a band of Christmas lights surrounding the home.  However, these lights were much, much larger than Christmas lights (about the size of a fist at arms distance).  The colored lights were bobbing up and down slightly.  I remember seeing red, blue, and possibly green lights.  No yellow color.  There was no sound other than my dog incessantly barking directly at this home. The sighting lasted about 35 seconds (from the time I saw the white light), and suddenly the white light &apos;turned off&apos;.  The colored lights remained around the home.  Therefore, the white light was 35 seconds in duration (but I caught it after it was first present), and the colored lights lasted much longer.  It was very late, and very cold in Michigan, and I therefore did not go outside to investigate further after the white light &apos;turned off&apos;. I am making this report because the light, in my opinion, were absolutely not floodlights or &apos;party&apos; lights, and the source of the white light was far above the house &amp; yard (but I did not see a &apos;craft&apos;).", "cigar shape at 7:40 am just west of I-85 near PowdersvilleI was driving north on I-85 and a light caught my eye at 1 o&rsquo;clock.

It still seemed to just be an airplane but I continued to follow it for about a mile.  When I finally got close it didn&rsquo;t seem to be moving.  It was cigar shaped somewhat but was indented slightly in the middle (almost lip shaped).  By this time it was at 9 o&rsquo;clock and I went to grab my phone to take a picture.

There also was a white trail following after it. The trail was sparkley like diamonds that began to fall and fade out of the sky. The object remained in the sky for about 30 seconds.The craft seemed to move slowly in a slow  clock-wise fashion in a straight line from South to North and then suddenly took off with unbeleiveable speed before it disappeared. The white trail remained for one minute or so after the UFO was out of sight. This is diffeent than the one I saw before. It made my windows vibrate with the low humming sound that came from it.

I followed it with my eyes for several minutes. Later, I went inside to look for the number of the FAA. I called the number I found, and the woman I talked to emphatically denied that is what I saw, and suggested that I was seeing things.After I went back outside after talking to her, I looked up and the disc, or whatever it was that was under the 747 was going in reverse direction in a straight line above my neighborhood, where it had originally appeared with the 747 jet, at about 20,000 feet, it was a mostly clear day with a few scattered clouds.After I talked to several others about this event, they suggested that what I saw was a stealth bomber below Air Force One. This seemed to be a very logical explanation.The disc was dark and round shaped and small enough to be noticed below tail of this aircraft. The FAA was never recontacted about this and would possibly deny the presence of a second plane (object) at all, if that is what I saw.I hope someone else out there sees them too one day, and gets some good pictures.There are helicopter and planes above my area all the time, day and night, and I am just west of Arlington, VA.", "On video&apos;ing, and photographing, UFO&apos;s are positioned in front of our view of both Venus &amp; Sirius.I am reporting two main objects.

They are both UFO&apos;s, or UFO docking stations of some kind.One is the bright starlike object in front of our view of Venus. The other is the bright starlike object in front of our view of Sirius.    As one who has always been a sky watcher, and who takes photos daily &amp; nightly, I know what I am seeing.    These objects are at lower altitude than a planet, or star, and block our view of these natural objects.I&apos;ve been watching &amp; photographing them for months.Description:   The SW object changes shapes which can be seen visually, and the lights appear to change colors.  It also seems to react to being photographed with more light pulses, brightening.  The object in front of Sirius shows the same characteristics.Both followed the natural path of Venus and Sirius across the night time sky.  If you get a camera on them, they are no further up than the usual low altitude UFO&apos;s that glide above many of our neighborhoods at night.   I would estimate the faux Venus object to be about 1 mile up, at most.  The faux Sirius object is probably 1 1/2 to 2 miles up, judging by it&apos;s size when video&apos;d.This west side of Houston is a little known hot spot, with activity most days &amp; nights when the weather is good.I will include video links at the email address you have provided that include photos, both original and enhanced to bring out the detail.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I was seated over the wing on the starboard side of a Boeing 767.  The captain had just come on the radio to say that we were flying over Nevada and knowing that we were getting close to our destination, I looked out the window over the wing staring at the millions of stars in the sky when I noticed one particular object that seemed to be moving with the aircraft at least 50+ miles (approximation) as it was visible just off the far edge of the wing.  I thought possibly this was simply an optical illusion, so I focused on another object only to watch it move to the rear of the wing and out of sight.  I then refocused on the moving object keeping pace with the aircraft when it suddenly had a burst of acceleration. Mind you we were flying at 380mph (I asked the pilot when we landed) and this object sped forward at least 4 to 5 times that speed because it was out of sight in less than a tenth of a second. I thought the event was over when the object came back on its same trajectory in reverse then moved forward at the same rate as the aircraft. It performed the same maneuver several times then shot straight up in a vertical motion at the same speed it used when it moved forward and backward. Only a few seconds later it returned in a downward trajectory at the same rate and stopped at the same altitude just off the wing. That&apos;s when I noticed two other objects performing the same maneuvers. It almost seemed like they were playing a game of &quot;catch me if you can&quot; moving upward, downward, forward and reverse in Nano seconds. It was an amazing sight to behold. I looked around to see if anyone else had noticed this event but most of the people on the flight were sleeping, or had their window shades closed. At one point all three crafts met stood at the same location for a minute or two, then without warning one moved forward, one moved rearward, and the third flew vertically. All t! hree cra fts were flying at well over 600 mph during the maneuvers. I was absolutely amazed by what I was seeing, three UFO&apos;s performing a series of maneuvers impossible to be normal, jet aircraft -- and of course being in very close proximity to Area 51. After approximately 40 - 50 minutes of maneuvers, all three craft took three different trajectories; up, forward and rearward and then they were all gone. It was an amazing event, and one I will not soon forget. This was only the second sighting I have had, the first in 1976 when I experienced a glowing, golden orb that followed my car at low altitude (approximately 50 feet) parked itself in the sky in front of my home, then landed in a field around the corner from my home (see August 15, 1976, Hatboro, PA). Just for the record, I do not drink alcohol when I am on an aircraft because it dehydrates your body. I drink 8 ounces of water every hour that I am on the flight.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

What am I doing I Thought.... The next morning, some almond eye&apos;ed people came to my door and wanted to read from the Bible. They were not Jehovah&apos;s but something different... Elohim something.... They read from a NIV Bible and it was something about Israel from the sky. Their look was different two women, one extraordinary beautiful. So I was happy to chat longer... So thinking this was some Internet Cult or a weird coincidence that night I said the prayer again to check this out. I did see, orbs and flashes the first night. I could not believe it, I saw Yahweh?  Next night, summer, I just had to see one more time, another simple prayer, pure and true.... 3 minutes or so a huge flash and another orb. OMG!

Sunset was at 7:11 and I was situated at Latitude: 35&deg;32&apos;4.77&quot;N and Longitude: 117&deg;32&apos;43.80&quot;W I got the sunset time from the internet. I got my camera gear out and got it all set up so that I could be ready for anything. I sat down in my easy chair until it was time for the stars to start showing themselves to the world. One by one they appeared. If you are not fast while you are watching for the stars, they will sneak up on you. Looking at the First Quarter Moon that was to the south of my vantage point, there was a bright star/planet that showed up to the east of the moon and just a little higher in the night sky compared to the moon. It was very bright and steady. I turned around only to find a brighter star/planet on the horizon where the sun had just set. When I turned back around, there was a second star even farther east of the star that was near the moon! It too was bright. &ldquo;sorry, I only know that a planet does not twinkle and stars do&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t know the names. Anyhow, I started my scan around the heavens to see what was appearing and by the time I got back to the bright star/planet east of the moon, I noticed something very odd. The star/planet to the left of the one that was near the moon was now GONE. One minute it was there and the next minute it was gone. I know it was not a plane as it just sat there in one place when I first noticed it. As the evening progressed, I noticed two objects passing on by. One of them looked like it was headed towards LA and about a half hour later I saw one that was headed north away from LA. Ordinarily I would suspect that they were planes, but there were no strobes on these two objects that looked like stars passing in the night sky. Even though there was no strobe to them, I just noted them as planes. Same speed, no deviation whatsoever. It was about 8:30pm when I looked to the north and off of the big dipper to the right, I noticed this light. This light started to get very bright and all of a sudden, I had surmised that this thing was coming right at me. It just kept on getting bigger and bigger. I turned around and grabbed my camcorder and stand as a complete unit, and when I turned back around, I had to say to myself, what&rsquo;s the use. It, by the time I turned around started to get smaller again. So I just stood there watching it as it eventually disappeared. This object did not go up, go down, go from side to side or anything. It was as if there was a very high candle power light that was being turned up and then back off slowly. This lasted for about 15 seconds. I have no idea what it was, but I can finally say: I have seen something in the nights sky that makes no sense to me. Twice&hellip; In one night&hellip; A disappearing planet and a light that made no sense. I would go back out again, but the bugs are so bad as the sun goes down that I did not have fun due to these bothersome critters. I was so busy swatting them that I lost sight of the fact that Rattlesnakes were out and about. A video that is called &quot;Contact has begun&quot; with James Gilliland. I had never seen it before and I did not know it was James in this video when I downloaded it. I only downloaded it because of the title.

It was about ten times brighter than any star in the sky that night and about 5 times larger. It would go from being extremely bright and fade to almost no light.The object was orange in color. At one point I went inside for a couple minutes and came back out and it was gone. I later came out about 5 minutes after that and it had reappeared. It continued to fade from bright to dim. It was closer than a star yet further than an airplane. An airplane flew underneath the object in the sky and the object didn&apos;t seem to be much further than the airplane.

Out of the top, right corner of my windshield, I noticed a very large, very shiny, silver object in the sky, absolutely frozen in place. Compared to how the sun appears in the sky, the object was maybe one-and-a-half times as wide and one-fourth to one-third as high. I watched it for as long as I could, which was maybe four to five seconds. I had to take my eyes off it to negotiate the curve. When I came out of the turn a few seconds later, the object should have been directly in front of me, but it was gone. The object appeared to have been a little way out over Lake Pontchartrain, near the Causeway, just outside of New Orleans. This would put it a few miles from the airport, but there&rsquo;s no way it was a jet or plane. It was much too big, much too shiny, and it never moved during the time I saw it.", "Red lights over Leicestershire EnglandWhilst standing outside smoking a number of people witnessed several strange lights that seemed to float above us at a very high altitude.  They seemed to be spaced at equal distances from each other, and glowed with a redish glow.  A few people managed to take photos and video on their telephones as they went over.  Once they had moved away a short space they then seemed to rise and disappear.

My wife is an educational consultant with a private school system, possessing a Bachelor&apos;s Degree.We have lived in our current area for just over 20 years.As I walked down our driveway after taking the garbage cans to the road late in the evening, I saw a very bright light in the western sky. The light was approximately 30 degrees above the horizon and appeared stationary. It caught my attention because of it&apos;s brightness, clearly much brighter and larger than any stars in the sky.I initially thought it might be a passenger jet with landing lights on as we are on a glide path to the major airport to the east. After 5 - 10 minutes of observation it was clear it was not a plane. It did not change position in the sky, however the light appeared to fade and return periodically.After 10 plus minutes of observing I went into the house and asked my wife to look at the object with me. It was cold and she did not wear a coat so her observation was limited to about 3 minutes. She confirmed it was not a star or a plane and that it appeared stationary.I then picked up my binoculars and viewed the object with those. I was able to determine the object was round or oval, had multiple flood or spot lights emitting the light I saw, and appeared to have at least one red and one green light. The white lights were spread across the oval/round diameter of the object in such a manner as to appear to be &quot;wall to wall&quot;. As I watched with the binoculars, it appeared the object was turning in some way as the white lights would nearly disappear and then reappear. This occured approximately every 3 to 4 minutes. I never heard any sound associated with the object.Unfortunately my video cam was not serviceable. I watched the object for approximately 25 minutes in total, and during that time it never moved. I was then becoming cold, there was no apparent movement or action with the object so I came inside. I have not seen the object again since that evening.((NUFORC Note:  Venus.

It was quiet and made no sound. It traveled from the sight that i saw it tothe next sight that was probably 10 miles away in the blink of an eye.

Here are the event details:  my husband and teenage daughter went out to run some errands.  I&rsquo;m not exactly sure what time it was when he called me to see if I could see it from our house.  Indeed I could.  I studied it for a moment and concluded that it was not an airplane; I am familiar with the light patterns of airplanes, and this craft was flashing red, yellow, green and blue and seemed to be hovering in the night sky.  I grabbed my digital camera and took some pictures.  Looking at the craft with the naked eye, there were no &ldquo;tails&rdquo;, however, the &ldquo;tails&rdquo; were captured using the camera.  I then proceeded to use my digital camera to record a video of the craft.  In the video, we could see the movement: back and forth, up and down, and side to side, with no regular pattern.  My husband proceeded to tell me on the phone that he and our daughter were trying to drive to the craft&rsquo;s location, but every time they got close, the craft would shoot to another location within view.  Duration of sighting was at least two hours.  Only one craft was sighted, its shape was hard to determine due to the distance, but seemed to be a bright light (extremely bright) with flashing red, yellow, green, and blue colors.  Its motion was sporadic at times, but seemed to hover in the same general area in the sky.  The weather conditions were as follows: very cold (approximately -20o) with clear skies.  It was evening (after 6 pm Central time).  The next day, January 16, 2009, a relative from Mason City, Iowa called to say that their family of three also saw the object in the sky (I posted the video on the internet and sent them pictures as well).  Our teenage daughter also captured some pictures with her digital camera, showing more erratic movement and green &ldquo;tails&rdquo;.  Distance was very hard to determine since the movement was not visible with the naked eye.  I was standing at my patio doors, filming above my h! ead slig htly.

The first craft appeared to be glowing red and I would imagine, very hot. At 23:00 I could not get to bed, so I got up to hangout in the living room. Then all of the sudden, I heard an eerie droning sound. Scared, I got up to look out the window. There were 2 craft that seemed to be lowering a kind of large tray in to the river. This lasted for 30 minutes, and then the craft silently sped off to the west. After that period of 30 minutes, I started to feel nauseous and had a headache. I threw up and then went to bed.", "Vertical rotating rectangle in sky over ChicagoIn relation to the 2006 Schaumburg, IL sightings, I am quite stunned because I thinkI saw the same aerial phenomenon the following July.I was leaving a tradeshow in Chicago in a cab with maybe four other people and a driver. I was next to the driver taking the highway from downtown Chicago to the O&rsquo;Hare Airport. It was around 5:00 PM, and everyone who was in the cab with me was, like myself, tired and relatively quiet. We had just finished taking our booths down and mostly wanted to just go home to our own cities.I sat in the front passenger seat (we crammed in and split the fare to the airport&hellip; very economical&hellip;..) and just watched local traffic when off to the north, which was to my right, I spotted something hovering in the sky.  The object may well have been moving slowly or even stationary, and was clearly rotating very slowly, and after a few minutes of mentally triangulating (admittedly not terribly accurate&hellip;) I gathered it was approx. one to two miles away, located probably a thousand or so feet in the air, and was solid and dark.The sky was blue and calm, with only occasional clouds. Periodically planes could be seen flying, and they were very easy to identify. There was no sign of a balloon supporting this object, nor of a plane pulling it, or for that matter a pole holding it up.The very curious aspect to me was that the three or four times that it completed a rotation it would be so thin as the edge appeared that it would actually disappear, and then the other side would become visible. It would be like holding up a rectangular piece of cardboard in landscape orientation, but vertical, and rotating it counter-clock-wise. The rectangle had to be at least a few hundred feet long and maybe a hundred feet high, with almost no thickness.After seven or eight minutes I remembered I had a digital camera with me and I fished it out of my briefcase. I took a few seconds of video (I accidentally clicked &ldquo;off&rdquo; too soon and didn&rsquo;t realize it&hellip;) and the object appears there, but very distant and not clear enough to make any useful analysis of. All it does is confirm to myself that I actually saw something.At this point the driver asked me what I had been looking at and I told him and the other passengers, but no one else had seen it, and by this point it had faded below the line of site of the buildings and trees.For my own experience I can&apos;t believe I was so ill-prepared to think to grab the camera when there was a much better shot of it.", "red white and blue lights rippling black on the bottom huge!!  500 Lights On Object0: Yestravling west on highway 40 saw a large light in sky then out of nowhere it was beside my car it was soild black a light on each corner red white and blue. it followed me for about 1 mini was scared 2 death my children were with me.i exited the highway and called a family member.i have no idea what it was the bottom of the craft was rippling blackalmost shining.", "Nothing WE have, could have done what we all saw that night.I was a witness of the famous &quot;Phoenix lights&quot; mass sighting back on the eve of March 13th 1997. This event changed everything for me...  Later that year my wife left with the kids, followd by a nasty divorce.  I tried to forget what I know I saw...  for 10 years I made it, working nightly in the same outdoor welding shop that I was working in, on THAT night. The guy on the radio starts talking about the upcoming 10 anniversary of the &quot;Phx Lights&quot; mass sighting, and it was like a switch in my head came on.  I was instantly awakened...  no longer can I hold back on what I saw, and it has become an obsession.  I then reported my story on any ufo website that had the ability.  That&apos;s been a few years now and I have yet to be interviewed on what I saw. The vision of the massive yet elegant airshow that was displayed to those who were watching that night, will continue to play on my head like no other memory I can think of.  As I watched it silently make a banked turn as it glided gracefully at the same elevation (or below) as the South Mtn range that it was effortlessly floating along as it flew away from me.  When I first saw it, it was floating over the S.East end if the airport area, and it was in a semicircle pattern about 5 miles wide.  Each of the orbs that made up the outline could move individually (and a few did).  The light of each orange/red orb came from within and didn&apos;t radiate out (like molten metal).  The orbs started moving and formed into a V shape with one side lopsided by on or 2 orbs.  when it pivoted to start moving the orb in the middle became the nose of the now V craft and when it pointed as if it were going to come my way...  I panicked and turned to run...  I then realized that this thing my be 9 miles away from me.  I turned back around and instantly my fear was gone and as I watched it for the next 15 minutes, I tried not to blink, as I didn&apos;t want to miss a second of it.  I then told a few people and mentioned it to my wife, and it lay dormant in my head until t! he hype of the 10 year anniverssary of it brought it all back. The &quot;flare&quot; explaination is insulting to my intelligence...  I&apos;ve lived here in the Phx valley all my 52 years and have seen my share of flare drops...  Not even close.

Well we traveled to 86th and Hague Rd back to my house and then to the southside on the interstate. All this time this star is getting closer as we head south. We were about 1/4 mile from the Raymond exit when we noticed this star was moving toward the interstate. My friend was like is that a round thing, i said OMG what is that.

It was so unusual and SO LOW in the sky that it appeared you could touch them, i.e. they were reachable somehow at the treetop line.  These lights could NOT be ignored.  Anyone who saw them would have stopped in wonder.  THIS WAS NOT A PLANE OR A BALLOON OR A STAR.  These lights were each BIG and the formation stretched out about the distance of a couple football fields, I would say.  They were NOT spotlights.  There was no trail or wake of light or aura.  We, ALL FOUR of us, saw the exact same thing and actually turned the car around to park to get a better look.  The lights were hovering at the 8, 10, 12, 2, and 4 o&rsquo;clock positions and appeared to be part of a whole, but there was no &ldquo;body&rdquo; or &ldquo;craft&rdquo; perceptible.  They seemed to have been there awhile, because they were still where we had first noticed them and not moving.  We stayed and watched them, discussing it for about 5 minutes (What to do?  Was this a UFO?), when &ldquo;it&rdquo; suddenly &ldquo;seemed&rdquo; to move very slowly over a field beyond us not far from its original location but out in the open.  &ldquo;It&rdquo; was no longer above the trees but at the same height or a little higher.  It was very difficult to calculate distance from the ground because the lights were so big, they seemed very close.  They seemed to be in the &ldquo;air&rdquo; near the ground not &ldquo;high enough up in the sky&rdquo; where a plane would fly.  We drove that way in the car, as it was on our way home, and continued to look as we drove by it.  We could not see anything but those lights (white) in the same formation.  Then it literally vanished in less than a second.  No noise was! heard, no perceptible movement in its departure.  We thought to report it, but my husband said &ldquo;everything is explainable&rdquo; so we didn&rsquo;t want to appear foolish.  Others MUST have seen this, though no other cars were on the road where we were at the time.  We laughed about it and our 11 year old said it might be Santa.  We left it at that, but it has been bothering me and thought I should report it.  It was just very strange.", "5 lights moving at a high speed with no apparent order but naked to the eyeThere were about 5 moving lights hovering over Spring Hill,  The speed of each of them ruled out anything man made.

Around 8:30 pm I looked up to the sky from the center of the lake, over the area of Mt. Arlington, and saw 3 red blinking lights in the sky.  It was in the eastern direction.   The 3 red lights were in the shape of a triangle, blinking, and stationary.  The blinked for about 10-15 minutes then disappeared.  At first I thought it was a light tower, but it was much to high, especially compared to the tower we could see in the same area.  Not planes either, as the airport has a holding pattern over the lake and we could see several airplanes flying in the same direction, in comparison just didn&apos;t look like an airplane.

At first I thought it might have been Venus, so I went downstairs to check a computer program I have that shows the night sky in real time.  Venus had already set behind the mountains.  When we first saw it, it was about 15 degrees above the horizon.  It was moving slowly in a northerly direction and began descending toward Chief Mountain northeast of us where finally disappeared below the horizon at about 2135.  When we looked at it through binoculars, we could see it was oval in shape with a yellow top and a red, non pulsating light on the bottom quarter of it.  It got dimmer as it descended but brightened sometimes.  My wife observed it looked blue as it descended.  It was clear and cold (-8 degrees).

A little before mid-day I was standing at the marked place (on wikimapia.org) waiting for my friend who was in a meeting. I was looking at the clear blue sky with very faint clouds and I saw this extremely shiny object in the sky. It seemed stationary and was very bright. I was amazed at the brightness and concentrated on it trying to identify what it could be and then I realized that it was moving very slowly, as if it was drifting. I thought maybe it could be a weather balloon (It probably could be, I am not sure. It was just a few hours that I was in Yavatmal and I have absolutely no Idea if weather baloons are released there. I believe weather baloons are white in colour but this thing seemed to reflect like it would be a foil. This thing looked like a perfect shiny sphere although in the  photograph it shows a different shape. I believe it could be because of &apos;camera shake&apos;. The picture is taken from a Cannon PowerShot A560 zoomed to the maximum digital 16x. It does make it shaky and difficult to catch a object so far away on the LCD screen and click it with a steady hand.A few seconds later it seemed to slightly pick up speed. I am sure the wind on the ground was in the opposite direction this thing was going westward. It kept on accelerating gradually and then it stopped, looking brighter than before (or maybe I imagined that it looked brighter). It was hard trying to focus the eyes on it. Two of the workers there too asked me what it could be. I said it could be a weather balloon but I wonder if they knew what a weather balloon is. I wished I was carrying my binoculars that time. At that time I took a break by looking down cause my neck was feeling the strain looking straight up. When I looked up again I could not see it. It could not be, cause it was only a couple of seconds . . . It just could not disappear. It had not disappeared but it was way away westward and was moving really fast almost at the speed of a plane flying high. And then at one point it stopped and it started shrinking in size rapidly and then it was gone. I would attribute to the shrinking in size to it going higher and away.The accompanying photo was taken when it seemed to be steady. I could not bring it in frame (on the LCD) when it was moving faster. I realize now that I could have used the viewfinder instead of the LCD.  This is the only shot that I ve taken.Oh one more thing I would like to mention that earlier I had seen two vapour clouds (one stretching east-west and the other north south) that a fighter jet leaves. I did ask my friend that time whether there is a air base nearby. I do believe that 2 to 4 vapour trails are left by jets over Yavatmal skies each day.I forgot to mention the above incident to my friend but at least two of his workers have seen this with me. Could be even more cause I was staring at the sky like crazy and I am sure many must have seen me staring and they too would have looked in the same direction.", "My son &amp; I were driving from Gettysburg, back home to Littlestown, PA. We saw 8 lights (very bright) in the sky. I asked him what that was, he didn&rsquo;t know. So we drove down a back road toward the lights.

When I backed into a driveway to turn around, I heard a whooshing sound &amp; they both took off.It took me all of about 10 seconds to turn around &amp; they were gone.

We turned the corner and went toward the beach when we both saw four lights in a row, the same orange-ish color(the color of a street lamp) and they slowly faded one by one like it was rotating. At first my Mom thought it was a plane but the lights completely disappeard and then reappeared instantaneously a very good distance away.  Too fast to be a man-made craft.  Then I didnt see it for a minute or so.  We drove down to the beach and I looked up and saw a small, very distant light (it was the size of the stars) in the sky which abrubtly turned around and did like a bell-shaped turn in the other direction, changed to a red color and then disappeared quickly.

Then in THAT moment I  thought, &quot;Who&apos;s firing an illegal-grade bottle rocket&quot;. Upon hearing  a second LOUD boom that shook the ground enough to notice, not violently,  I thought, &quot;Oh My God, has a house blown up?&quot;. I turned to look out  the window to my west because the motion lights came on outside  due to the movment of the taller shubbery in a stiff sudden breeze.It was aleast a 20-25 mph gust from the north. The sonic incident  lasted a total of about 7 to 9 seconds, and there was no light of any  that I noticed. The gust of wind was short-lived. I was headed for  the telephone, so I did not time it.Fearing a gas leak/explosion, I called 911. This was at approximately  3:20 AM. The operator did not even ask details of my home address,  however, she did ask if I was near certain streets in my neighborhood.Within 30 seconds numerous police and fire vehicles were headed into  my neighborhood, and I went out to see and speak to an officer, telling  exactly what I experienced. My husband was asleep, but was awake when I  called for him, he says something woke him, but he did not know what it  was. He did mention feeling a tremble or shaking. He was upstairs.At 3:30 AM my neighbor was walking from the north end of Woodlawn Avenue,  to his house at the next block south. He does not wish to be identified.He is a retired, very well educated professional in educational and  technical fields. He was awakened by the second loud boom, percieved that  it was at ground level, and had headed down the street because he was  sure someone&apos;s house had blown up. We dicussed, I told of the preceding  boom and whoosh-hishh, and that strange wind gust. It was very cold, and  I went inside, and called your hot-line.Police and fire sirens were continually heard from 3:20 AM to at least 4:45 AM by me, going all around the surrounding area from downtown to  northern Greensboro.I checked the weather conditions, because I wondered that this could have  somehow been a meteor event that was somehow without visible light. The  ceiling was 3500 feet and below, winds were 5 mph, the clouds were thick,  the humidity only 44%, temperature was 29 degrees F.I am 50 years old, well-educated I suppose, and a professional musician.I often work at night in my home. Unless someone tells me otherwise, I  know that first BOOm was above ground, sonic in nature, and am doubtful  that it was produced by military aircraft. My father was a pilot, and  in the 1960s we grew up under a sky where the military practiced sound  barrier breaking. That whhosh-hisshh was a descending sound. The second  BOOM was near or on ground level, the floor did shake. The wind, possibly,  associated with the event, I can&apos;t be sure.There is an expansive park in the area where, from my perspective, this  event concluded, and the fast wind came from that area. As of now, no news  of damage, explosions, mischief, or anything else are known to me.

As soon as the last one lit up, the first one burned out, followed by the second and so on.  There were four in a row that did this.  I arrived home and continued watching them.  The lights sporadically burned out and lit up again, not always in single file this time.  Some would not quite burn out, to where my fianc&eacute; and I could see them dart back and forth, then light up again.  While doing this, the lights would leave tracers.

I ran in to get my glasses.  It was still overhead when I got back and we could both make out that there was a sort of cone-shape on top of the bright light.  There were no flashing lights and the light was not the normal color of a plane.  We are very near an airport and see jet lights constantly.  This craft was not going towards the airport.  It moved very slowly and with NO SOUND at all!  We watched it for at least 10 minutes.  As it moved south, it seemed to stop and hover over the city (Los Angeles) for a minute or two before it continued south.  We only stopped watching when it was out of sight.  This happened only 20 minutes ago!  It was not a helicopter.  We have those overhead constantly too &ndash; police and news copters every day.

I watched a silver disc (saucer if you will) I would assume it was about 30 feet across and about 7-10 feet high.

The blinds are the same as the lower level, and the light comes through them well. So, there was a good amount of light in my room. I was still trying to come to a full awake state. My arms and legs were disabled, but I could move my mouth and see with my eyes. I was sleeping on my right side of my body in a half fetal position. The being was standing at the side of my bed, facing me, at about the halfway point of my mattress. It was staring at me. I stared back at it, and I was a bit frightened by the appearance of this being: especially due to it being at my bedside as I woke. I attempted to move my arms and legs, but to no avail. This angered me. I then proceeded to show my teeth in a fierce manner to this being. I guess I did this because it was my only method left of self defense. I was very unfortable not being able to move my arms and legs. This being disappeared right in front of my eyes. One second it was in front of me, the next it was gone. No movement. Just gone!  The being was brown in color, but unlike the previous contact being. This being had a human-like appearance in bodily form (legs, arms, round head, etc.), but looked nothing like a human in any other way. It had a dark brown color to it. It almost appeared to have a slimy texture to it (outward skin). Further, although I can not completely recall: I think the being could change the coloring of itself slightly. I am not saying brown to blue, I mean dark brown to light brown. I was scared for a few days after this. I had issues of not wanting to fall asleep. It seems that this is the time they appear, and catch me off-guard. I would much prefer if I was walking in a field, and saw them 30 feet in front of me. Then, we would be on a bit more of a fair playing field!  Whatever is going on, I know that they are here now! I know they can do things that I can not do, whether it is some type of technology that enables them to disappear or it is biological.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It was a dull silver color and looked like the flying saucers in old sci-fi movies.

The particular discussion on the type of objects seen in and around Phoenix, AZ at roughly the same time made me think there was something more to what I saw.After returning home from a friend&rsquo;s house on the evening of the 13th or 14th of March, 1997 at approximately 10:30pm (I remember it was around this time as I had returned from a vacation shortly before, but can&rsquo;t remember if it was a Thursday or Friday), I went out on my back deck to look at the Hale-Bopp comet which was clearly visible with my small binoculars in the North-Western sky.  At that time I was and still am a Financial Analyst, but have always loved backyard astronomy since I was in Jr. High School and had an issue of Sky &amp; Telescope which told me where to see it.While looking at the comet for several minutes with the binoculars, I saw a distinct flash of light, which caused me to lower them and look to see what had cause it.  For about 10 seconds or so, I saw 5 lights in what seemed to be a triangular formation move quickly from South to North from my perspective.  It moved very fast to the North until it was out of sight, but it was visible long enough to see that the triangular &quot;V&quot; formation was kept throughout.  There was no noise or contrail(s) visible (I expected to hear jet noises thinking it was a formation of fighter planes, but there was none). Unfortunately, it moved too fast for me to determine if it was a solid object.This obviously was quite exciting and unusual.  After spending a few more minutes trying in vain to see the object(s) again, I thought this was peculiar enough to report to someone. I looked in the phonebook for someone to call and eventually spoke briefly to a person (whose name I cannot remember) at the local MUFON contact number and gave him the description of what I had seen.  As it was quite late, I agreed to call back the next day to go over the sighting in more detail, but I did not call again.  After thinking it over and keeping in mind that the simplest explanation is most often the right one, I determined that it had to be a formation of fighter planes or maybe a stealth fighter which sort of has that shape.After seeing this documentary and subsequently researching the so-called Phoenix Lights on-line, what I saw and especially the time I saw it is a little too coincidental. I have never seen anything like that before or since, but due to the similarities with what was seen in Arizona, I thought it was time to report what I saw.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

We were intruiged and kept watching, and then the object began to change speed and move more to the north, before speeding up significantly and then curving towards the east again.  It was orange and bright at first, but once it started moving north it faded to a dull orange color and was not bright anymore.  It also did this pulsing, circular movement -- there was a brighter spot that kept circling around and around, as if it was an arm or an extension of the object that was rotating.

I remember yelling at this being, while I was laying down. Further, the being looked like an insect, but stood upright. It had antennae coming from its head. The idea I got after I woke was that it was a locust being. I compared it to a locust for some reason. After I woke, whether dream or not, I recall a loud humming noise above my place outside. The sound was subtle, but noticeable. I hear these sounds above my house after waking up all the time (always in the middle of the night). Generally, I will go to the bathroom after waking, and hear this sound of some craft, plane, etc. before or during my trip to the bathroom. Many times, I hear this, but do not feel any other strange symptoms or problems after waking. One thing for sure is: I have never been harmed,, to my knowledge, in any way.

Before Culver exit, I glanced to the west and briefly saw a nearby tilted disc hovering directly over the northern part of Irvine&apos;s Preservation Area. Disc appeared reasonably large - maybe 40 feet in length, but viewing perspective made it appear very thin. The disc appeared to be very &apos;real&apos; and solid in nature; I did not see any form of glowing or radiation of bright color. Object was gray/brown - I believe. It was hovering and completely/effortlessly static. Notably, it was tilting distinctly to its southernmost side. I viewed the object from the freeway, but could not alert my wife&apos;s attention to it quickly enough before a freeway bridge and trees obscured it from my view. I pulled off the Culver exit and drove west over the freeway to attempt a better view, feeling sure that we would be able to view something explainable, but the object was no longer visible. I often question if I had actually seen the object, but cannot account for how I could imagine the length, flatness and angular titling of the disc if I had indeed been confused or subject to some kind of illusion.

(Yes, there were fireworks going off and no, these were not fireworks!) As a bit of background, I&apos;ve been a Police Officer for 17 years, all of these being on operational duties.  I served in the Royal Air Force for six years and I have a life long interest in aircraft, thanks to my father.  I would say that I am very knowledgeable about aircraft types.  I am always looking up at aircraft so I am used to seeing things in the air.Just before Midnight on 31st December 2008, my wife and I went into our loft room in order to watch the fireworks going off over Cardiff.  The velux windows in the loft face north and we had a view of 180 degrees from west to east.  The weather was dry with a slight haze.  Even with the haze, visibility was good.At about 00.05 hours, I saw an orange coloured ball of light over the west of Cardiff.  I would estimate that it was about 3 miles away from my position and at a height of about 5000ft.  There were no strobe lights on this object and it moved at a steady pace from south to north, in a straight, horizontal line.  It was in sight for about 10 seconds before disappearing, and it did just vanish from sight as there were no objects between it and me to obscure it from view.  When I first saw it, I pointed it out to my wife who watched it as well.Within about 5 seconds of the first object disappearing, I saw another one, this time directly in front of my position so it was over the north of Cardiff, at about the same height but I would estimate at a distance of 2 miles.  It was exactly the same colour as the first and moved from east to west, again in a straight, horizontal line, remaining at the same height.  It remained in view for about 10 seconds and then just disappeared, like the first one.Within 10 seconds, I saw yet another object, exactly the same as the first two and exactly the same colour.  This one was above my position and was moving from east to west.  It was bigger than the first two and I believe that it appeared so because it was at a lower height.  Again, it moved in a straight line and was visible for about 5 seconds before vanishing.  Also again, there was nothing that could have obscured my view of it such as a building it could have flown behind etc.At this point, my wife decided that she had seen enough and went downstairs and, unfortunately, I had to go with her.  The sight of the lights had spooked her.I have mentioned these lights to colleagues and one of them put forward the Chinese lantern theory but the lights just appeared, travelled in a straight, horizontal line and then disappeared.  They were in three completely different places and they did not have the flight characteristics of a floating lantern.These things weren&apos;t travelling at a high speed.  I would say the speed was about that of a helicopter.  In fact, when I saw the first light, I thought that it was the Police helicopter but the colour of the light and the widespread locations as well as the complete lack of any strobe or other flashing lights on the objects soon dispelled that idea.I have no explanation regarding the identity of these lights.", "8-12 Bright Red Objects in  a V formation observed at 8:30 on 01/17/09There were about 8-12 objects bright red in color in a v formation not moving.

It appeared to stay in the same position (approx. 10:00 position) 30 minutes or better with the intensity never changing.  During this initial observation the object never came closer or farther in respect to our viewing location; basically the object size never changed.

The object was than observed through the side sighting scope of an amateur telescope (D: 60mm; F: 700mm) where the following was observed: object had a dark center, with a white band with red and blue colors radiating outward from the white outer band perimeter. Object remained a full round shape 90% of the time.  However, it changed from that frontal view round shape and rotated on its vertical axis maintaining same vertical size, but it changed its&rsquo; vertical shape to half the original frontal view; then its&rsquo; shape shifted like a saucer rounded on one edge and flat on the other edge; then it rotated and titled some more and its&rsquo; shape became an oval and went into a horizontal position.

It was triangle shaped with three super bright white lights on the three corners.At this point, I could see the object race back and forth overhead crossing the interstate from right to left and back. sort of in a &quot;swooping&quot; flight path. At the same time, it was turning and rotating and the lights were shining down on the road, in the air, and all over.

About a mile north before the city of Bountiful, Utah traveling south on I-15, I saw above me through the front windshield a bright white/yellow falling star traveling north to south my same direction. The &ldquo;star&rdquo; traveled quickly across the sky then &ldquo;stopped in mid-air&rdquo; over what appeared to be the ensign peak area between Bountiful and SLC.  This startled me and I said, &ldquo;What the heck is that?&rdquo;.

After that it traveled south towards the 7th north exit in west SLC desending at a high rate and disappeared from our site. I am a private pilot and aware of natural speeds and maneuvers a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; plane or helicopter would make, but this to me seemed to fast and erratic in behavior. My wife thought she could see blinking lights around the main light. I could not see position lights only the white/yellow light it emitted from all angles.

Both dots were about the size of pinheads. The red dot was &ldquo;orbiting&rdquo; the white dot, moving from its left to right side, around it. The white dot moved slowly down and towards the mountains (my left), then up and continuing left. It appeared to be moving farther away, since the red dot was beginning to be harder to see, but I could still make out when it crossed in front of the white dot. This was about 15 minutes in. The white dot then started to make small counter-clockwise circles, stop, then make small clockwise circles. It repeated this about 3 or 4 times. It was very tiny at this point. Every time I looked away to try and make a phone call, it was hard to locate again.

Just a note I am an armature astronomer with an 11&apos; Schmidt cassigrain telescope. So I am families with the night sky. I immediately thought the light was not a normal occurrence. It was motionless. As I looked at it for a minute or so the light literally began to shrink until it totally disappeared. I&apos;m thinking that was weird.

Our deck faces due north. When all of a sudden there is another light of the same magnitude to the north. My wife asked me what star or planet it was and I informed her it was neither.

The sighting occurred one evening at approximately 9:00 PM during that interval; the exact date or time was not recorded.My wife and I had an off-base apartment just off the beach on highway 90 which runs through Biloxi. We had been for a walk on the beach and were returning to our apartment, looking up at the night sky. Simultaneously we both saw a black, triangular object go across the sky from south to north. The flight path was from the Mississippi Sound and over the western side of Kessler AFB, which was approximately 1/2 mile from our apartment. The object had no lights and made no sound. The object appeared to be black, and it was mainly seen because it blocked out the stars as it flew overhead.The object appeared to be flying at an altitude of between 500 and a thousand feet, with an airspeed of 100 to 150 mph. It was shaped like a equilateral triangle with sides of approximately 100 feet. However, since the object made no sound, and it flew directly overhead without any distant landmarks to compare for size, it is difficult to estimate the size, speed or altitude of the object with any certainty. I could have been an even larger object, at a much higher altitude flying at a very fast airspeed. The size, speed and altitude are simply my best guess based on my recollection of an event that occurred over 30 years ago.The strangest aspect of the sighting was the absolute silence of the object. It made no sound whatsoever. It was also strange that it was running without lights, and the shape was like no aircraft that I know of from that era. It could have been a test version of the B2 stealth bomber, but that doesn&apos;t explain the silence. There was no engine noise that either my wife or I could hear.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

She was born in April 1986 and this sighting happened in the fall of 1986. I believe it was near the end of October or the beginning November. On this night, my husband and I had put our three daughters to bed at about 9:00pm. We stayed up late watching T.V. and talking. At around 3:00am I was sitting at the end of our bed watching an old movie on T.V. and my husband was lying in our bed watching the movie.As I was watching the movie, I realized that I could hear this sound coming from outside of my bedroom window. At first I didn&apos;t think much of it but then I thought to myself, what is that noise at 3:00 in the morning? I sat up straight on the end of my bed and listened. It was a vacuum cleaner! Who would be vacuuming at 3:00 in the morning? And Outside! I said to my husband,&quot;Someone is vacuuming this late at night, or should I say this early in the morning?&quot;  I asked him do you hear that? He said yes. I said &quot;Is someone drunk or something why would someone do that? He said, &quot;I don&apos;t know, someone being crazy.&quot; I said that I could not understand why they would be outside on the patio vacuuming. We had square cement patios off of our diningrooms in the back yard. We lived in a two story building so our bedroom was on the second floor. I was trying to make sense of hearing a vacuum cleaner running at 3:00am. I told my husband, &quot;Maybe someone knocked over a potted plant or something and they were cleaning it up&quot;  but at this time! I said I am going to look and see who it is.When I got to my bedroom window, I slowly opened it so who ever was outside would not know that I was watching them. I wasn&apos;t going to say anything to them I just wanted to see what was going on. I pushed my face against the screen and looked down below to the direction of where I thought the noise was coming from. I was expecting to see a porch light on and someone vacuuming their patio, I know this sounds crazy but its true. There was no light on. It was totally dark on all of the patios that ran along the back of the building. I thought was is that vacuuming noise? There is no one out here. I was pushing my face against the window screen looking back and forth across the back of the building. Nothing. I had been hearing the vacuuming sound for about 5 minutes by then.After finding no one down below vacuuming their patio, I was confused and looked out over the back yard. It was a big open field with a grove of trees stretching across the back of the field. I still heard the vacuum cleaner running. I don&apos;t know why but kneeling on my knees looking out the window, I slowly looked up, what I saw took my breath away! I had to make myself breathe. My mouth was hung open, I could not speak. I could not be seeing what I was seeing! There above the grove of trees a little to my right was a space ship! I remember shaking, my mind was frozen as were my eyes on this huge, massive thing floating before me in the air! All I could think of was to call my husband over he has to witness this, so later on when I told people they would not tell me I was dreaming it all.I could still here the vacuum cleaner sound it was coming from this huge space ship. I remember in my state of shock thinking how can this massive thing only be making such a small sound as a vacuum cleaner? I called my husband, but I dared not look away for fear that it might take off. I could not take my eyes off it, I wanted to remember everything about it. I called my husband again, he was getting annoyed because he was tired. &quot;What?&quot; he said to me as I am trying not to pass out from shock and fear. &quot;Come here, Oh my God, come here!! You are not going to believe this!!&quot; &quot;What is it?&quot; he asked me. &quot; You wouldn&apos;t believe me if I told you!&quot; I said to him. My husband gets up off of the bed and walks over to where I am and bends down and looks out of the window. He was looking down below and out straight ahead.&quot;What is it?&quot; he said to me with anger in his voice. I pointed up in the sky and said &quot;Look over there!&quot;  My husbands knees gave way and he was kneeling beside me staring at this huge space ship.&quot; Oh my God, Oh my God!&quot; that was all he could say. As we both knelt there staring up at this thing I asked my husband do we have any film in the camera, he said no. We just kept staring. We were both in shock. Oh my God is all that either one of us could say. I wanted to run and find the camera but I was afraid it would be gone when I got back and I wanted to stare at this thing for as long as I possibly could before it flew away. I noticed that the trees underneath the ship were not moving. You would think that the force of the engines would have been making the trees dance around but they were standing still. I could still hear the vacuum cleaner sound coming from this thing.I said to my husband,&quot;Lets try to remember everything about the way it looks.&quot; I told him, how could such a huge ship make just the sound of a vacuum cleaner. He said he did not know and kept staring. At that moment a chill went through me and then fear, we were staring up at this thing, what if they were staring back at us! I told my husband to get down so we both bent down on our hands and knees to where just our eyes were peeking up over the window sill. I said if I see a beam of light coming towards us I&apos;ll have a heart attack! My husband said, you and me both!  This whole sighting lasted about 3 minutes from the time my husband came to the window. I will describe to you what we saw. It was huge, it was as wide as a football field and it was perfectly round. It was shaped like, the best way to describe it was like a round football stadium, like the old one in Atlanta. It was thick on the sides, not like a saucer. I saw that it was made from some sort of   black iron or metal, I could see metal beams crossing at different points and some kind of huge bolts holding them in place. There were round shaped humps of metal going down the beams.There were a row of lights going around the middle of the whole ship. And I think the lights did not go on until it started to leave. Because as soon as I noticed the lights, the vacuum sound got higher pitched as it lifted up slowly, then with a sound of wind it took off and within 3 seconds it was a tiny light in the sky. We were in shock, we just knelt there in silence. I don&apos;t know how much time passed before we could talk. It was amazing, shocking, frightening and thrilling. My husband doesn&apos;t want to talk about it.I could not sleep. I couldn&apos;t wait until it was late enough to call my family on the phone. Well, a couple of hours later my phone rang and it was my sister yelling on the other end of the phone that a ufo had been seen in her town that same night. She lived in Newnan, Ga. almost an hour away from me. I told that I knew, that my husband and I had seen it.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

While I watched, it turned so that a circle of white lights could be seen.  Just as quick it turned again showing a triangle shape on the other side, which was dotted with white lights.  This object jumped up and down, left and right but never left the same location.  At 0345 went from this space to a location north of itself, without a trail and within a blink of the eye.

I looked to my left to see a disc that was like reflecting metal or a mirror in the sky. Freaking out slightly I kept it in my head the sun was on the opposite side of the sky starting to set also round. But it sat there and riding down the highway the trees were passing in front of it. Then it was gone. Scanning the sky rationalizing some type of weather anomaly I looked up and there it was.... very close. Helicoptors were coming from all directions at it. Then it disappeared. So at that point I lost it....my bf was driving telling me to calm down it was nothing. I looked back and it was far back in the distance and there were helicoptors upwards of ten surrounding and coming in on it......then it was gone.... Getting off the highway... I was just contemplating all the thoughts of what it could be in my head.... We arrived at the house to look at a used saab for me and we took a test drive. I was in the back seat. We went down a long road and I saw this huge gated factory. I asked the woman what it was...she said sikorsky airport they manufactur helicoptor engines. So there was my answer...reflection of a test helicoptor. Maybe some type of directional things in the sky for the testing of the helicoptors..... there was my answer.... So we bought the car and left it there untill we obtained the paper work... we drove off in my bf rx7 and missed the highway we saw a small diner and the lights on and in the car were dimming so my bf backed into to look at the car....looking out the front window I saw the biggest brightest circle/disc and it was close really close...and helicoptors were swarming it circling it and more and more were coming across the sky at it....then it was just gone.....blink of an eye...so now I am losing it....and the car is fine so we take off back in the direction we came. Then it happened again the car was bucking lights going off everything..... then it went dead. It was freezing...I pressed my faced up against the window to see what looked like the same ufo (call it that now :) and I literally opened the door falling out from excitment.....It was cold and the ground was frozen and muddy....I was just staring into this disc that looked like it was sitting on the tree tops...no sound....helicoptors flew in all around it and they were coming from all directions the yard I was in went up a hill and it started to move very very slowly unlike before...I saw it move and the helicoptors moved with it....all I could here was them and barking dogs......I couldn&apos;t see cause the street lights were out were we broke down.....I ran looking up crying my eyes out from happiness disbelief some type of spiritual experinece...idk but I ran as fast as possible in my heels sticking throught the ice and mudd and it went up over the hill and disappeared....I could still hear the helicoptors so it was still there....I was disappointed it was gone....I turned around to walk back and in the sky far in the distance was 20 to 30 of the same disc/circles in what looked like a pattern sitting in the sky....but further away cause they were smaller....then they started blinking out or flying away (not visible to the eye) just gone....they were all gone.. The lights helicoptors everything...... I am so a believer now...it&apos;s not funny. I want to go back and sit around the same area to see if it is something that I can rationalize with that is common to us or something that is so unidentified openly and get the proof.....if anyone would believe me. You know I honestly told two people because I knew that everyone would think I was joking or losing it.....", "UFO Sighted at school in Albuquerque, NM  SO I was walking home from school...when I saw this weird thing in the sky.  It was black and very thin, moving around sort of crazy.  My friend saw it, but did not believe in UFO&apos;s.  So, I stood there watching it fly, spinning, the turning into a sphere, then disappearing and coming back.  It repeated that for about one minute, and then it was gone.  I stood there for another minute, but it did not come back.  There was no lights, or any other thing besides the flat circle.  I was going to take a picture with my cell phone, but it would not turn on.  So I thought the craft in the air was intercepting with my phone somehow.  Once it was gone, my phone turned on.  I was not scared, but very excited I actually saw a UFO.-Eli In Albuquerque", "Bright light  with flashing red and blue lights underneath.  Moved in a circular motion.  Red flash across sky directly underneath.My husband went outside with the dogs around 20:45 on the date mentioned. He called me to come outside to look at something. When I came out, he pointed to the sky and stated this figure, that resemled a very bright star, was making a circular pattern in the sky.I ran back in the house to find my camera to try to get a better look with a zoom lens. I looked at it closer and noticed red and blue flashing lights at the base of the figure. While I was watching, it made no sudden movements but directly underneath it, I saw a fast moving red light flash across the sky and disappear.My daughter had asked what we were looking at so we showed her. She said that when she arrived home about and hour and a half prior, she saw the light and she and her Aunt had dismissed it as a planet or star. After she said this, we all went back inside, so she wouldn&apos;t be frightened.Around 21:15 my husband looked outside again and the figure had disappeared from the sky.((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Sirius??  PD))", "Clear daylight sighting of a bright object which rapidly accelerated and disappeared.My sister and I were standing on the front porch of her office, enjoying the unseasonably warm and clear weather.  I noticed the apparent reflection of sunlight off an object in the air Southwest of our position, traveling in a Northerly direction, at what appeared to be roughly the same altitude and speed as commercial airliners.I called it to my sister&apos;s attention because the reflection was much, much brighter than I had ever seen from an aircraft at that altitude and it left no contrail as other aircraft were doing that day.  My sister said &quot;Wow, that looks like it&apos;s vertical.&quot; (i.e., oriented perpendicular to the Earth&apos;s surface, rather than parallel, as an airliner is.)  We watched it for 15-20 seconds, during which time it traveled about the length of my index finger (held at arm&apos;s length, maybe 8-10 degrees of arc), then just disappeared.What made this sighting unusual was that after the reflection disappeared there was a brilliant flash of light further along the approximate track of the object.  This flash occurred maybe a half-second after the reflection first disappeared, but the gap between disappearance and flash was about  the same distance as the object had traveled during the initial (continuous) observation.So, during the gap between disappearance and flash, (using the formula Distance/Time=Distance per UnitofTime) the object seems to have accelerated to somewhere around 400% of it&apos;s initial speed in less than a second.", "Bright Orange Light over Grand Blanc, MI.One ball shaped UFO seen in the clear night sky.

I saw 2 synchronized flashing lights hovering about 500 feet above a ridge that is about a mile from my house. The craft, (assuming the 2 lights were on the right and left edges), was around the size of a half dollar held at arms length. I watched the flashing lights for more than 5 minutes &amp; they did not move. Curious, I stepped outside to watch them more closely. Unlike helicopters I have seen and heard in the area, there was no distinguishable sound.I have not lived in the house for more than a couple of months, so after about 10 minutes of watching the lights, I decided that it must be a communications tower that I had not previously noticed. I went back to bed.

Revelations of my UFO sighting have always been met with ridicule by the family and friends I&rsquo;ve shared it with. The only reason I&rsquo;m writing this now is because an &ldquo;open-minded &ldquo; friend who I shared my experience with happens to listen to a &ldquo;coast to coast&rdquo; on the radio and seemed to hear specifically about sightings of the same type in the same location and time as mine. I admit my recollections of details are a little fuzzy but many memories are clear as day. Here goes: I was a student at UW-Madison in the late 80&rsquo;s &amp; early 90&rsquo;s and was coming home for Thanksgiving vacation to be with my family. I caught a ride with my cousin who also lived in Madison and liked to take the &ldquo;back roads&rdquo; home to look at all the Christmas lights in the small towns. I recall that we were heading  west on a country highway at night when my cousin pointed out some odd lights far in the distance. I agreed they looked strange and we continued to watch the progress of these lights. As it happens our course turned in a North &ndash;South direction and it was clear that the lights were getting closer and if it continued on the same course it&rsquo;s path would lead it right over us. I told my cousin to pull over to the side of the highway so we could get a better look. Insanely, I recall opening the front passenger window and sticking my head out to look up and was mesmerized by what I saw. What I recall seeing  was  &ldquo;layers of lights&rdquo; moving slowly over our vehicle at a low altitude. What struck me most was that  this large form was &ldquo;silent.&rdquo; As the UFO moved over our car I pulled my head back in the vehicle and said to my cousin excitedly , &ldquo;you have got to see this!&rdquo; When I looked back out the window seconds later &ndash; it had vanished. My question to myself was &ndash; &ldquo;what on earth can be that large, airborne, silent and disappear without a trace?&rdquo; In my opinion this was no weather balloon! I&rsquo;ve lived quietly with this experience in my memory and only wish I&rsquo;d reported it sooner to a reputable source such as yourself. My interested friend said that he knows someone in law enforcement that witnessed something similar in the same time frame and location as myself. He said that he may be able to get  &ldquo;audio&rdquo; from the police car as it followed a strange UFO. I am wondering if in your database anyone has had a similar experience. I would be very interested to know more if such is the case.  Thank you.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I had just finished watching a PBS documentary.  We stepped outside at 9:56 p.m.  I put a white bandanna on my dog to see him in the dark.  The dog going out was a nightly ritual.  It was cold out and I was fully awake.  I waited for him to make his rounds and return.To the South I witnessed a reddish-orange light low in the sky.  I assumed it was a helicopter.  It dropped something and sparks of red made their way from the light to the ground.  I thought, &quot;I hope whatever that is doesn&apos;t hit someone&apos;s house.&quot;  I then watched it move from south to north towards me.  I was waiting to hear the blades and engine of the helicopter.  I heard nothing.  The red light then proceeded to drop another sparkling type of light down toward the ground.  I was relieved to see it do this again as I was not sure if I could believe my eyes the first time I saw it do this.  The night was cold and there were ice crystals in the air; but this did not look like lighted crystals, it was different.  It looked more like what a meteorite looks like as it falls to earth with a tail coming down.  It did not make sense but I was just observing this taking place so I was not trying to make sense of it all.As it approached me it seemed to be higher in the night sky.  I thought I heard an engine which relieved me as I then thought it had to be a helicopter.  But, this noise was from a train in the area moving south to north.  This light object did not make any observable sound.  My dog was standing at my feet by the patio.  I was worried that whatever was dropping might hit him or me so I stayed by the back door.  I proceeded to put him inside. I then looked up and it started to drop another sparkly charge but this time I did not see the material come all the way down, it stopped almost upon starting to drop down.  Maybe the position above me was wrong for viewing it to the ground?  It then kept moving toward the northeast across the top of my apartment complex and I followed it as it moved.  I rushed inside to get a binocular so that I could see what it actually was.  This took fifteen seconds.  As I came back out I did not see the light anymore in the sky.  I walked north behind the apartment complex with the binoculars but could not relocate it in the sky.  I then went inside.  I watched television for another hour, as I always do until 11:00 p.m.As I thought about this it made no sense.  The light, the sparkly discharge to the ground, the movement from south to northeast.  It was all very nonsensical and hard to understand.  I do not know what I witnessed? It is the first and hopefully last time I will witness something like this.", "Rhode Island, Providence, Nantucket, 19th January - formation flying craft of ther skyWe were driving home from a meeting of our local sports club when 4 bright lights passed in front of us, above us, following the path of the highway.

I took two pictures of the dot.  At the time my only thought was that the dot seemed to be too high for an airplane.  The airplane I saw and photographed a few minutes earlier was nowhere near the white dot.The dot made no sound, but it was moving slowly westward.
