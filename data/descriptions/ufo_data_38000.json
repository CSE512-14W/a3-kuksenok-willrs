["Fleet of white triangular airplanes, circular center with three lights, rear again trangular.The night was comfortable for August, despite heavy clouds all day threatening rain.  I&apos;m not a good judge of distance, but my guess is that the cloud ceiling began at about 500 to 700 feet. The airborne vehicle was inside the clouds, seemingly trying to hide in them.  As the atmosphere around it swirled about, different views of the ship came into sight.  Eventually, the complete outline was revealed. The nose of the ship was gently rounded, the body, triangular with rounded corners.  The circular center had three &quot;running lights,&quot; two white and one red.  The rear section was again in a triangular shape. The ship was silent, still, completely white except for the running lights. There was no engine sound.  As other portions of the huge cloud formation swirled,  I noticed part of another craft, exactly like the one I was watching just to the right, and then another to it&rsquo;s left.  As my gaze moved over the low cloud cover, I could see portions of other crafts in front of it and behind it.  The object I first noticed was part of a fleet of ships and because of the swirling masses, most of what was up there was obscured.  As far as I could see, and that distance was extremely limited, the area of sky over my head was filled with them. Did anyone see what I saw?  Can anyone help me verify?", "triangle pattern of stars moving from South to NorthHi My Uncle lives on Guler Rd in Trout Lake Washington. Our family has been coming to Trout Lake since the family settled there in the many years ago. We always camp in my uncles back yard during the Trout Lake Fair and on Friday/Saturday nights we play guitar, sing, and stargaze. Often we are up until 2:00 or later watching for shooting stars and we did so again this weekend. Sunday morning 8/6/2006 at 2:30 am my wife and I were in uncle&apos;s yard looking up at the Milky Way and facing east. The weather conditions were perfectly clear and great for watching shooting stars. Out of the South appeared a triangle pattern of stars from behind the trees at the edge of the yard. This formation about was about eighty degrees up from the horizon and slowly began to cross our wide open view of the sky from South to North in the direction of Mount Adams. We first thought this was our eyes playing tricks on us because the lights were the same intensity as most of the stars except they were all three moving North in a formation that moved without deviation of speed or shape. This was not a solid object but rather three points of light as we could see the other stars in the middle of the triangle as it moved. This was a large Triangle, lead across the sky by two stars and the third one following at spacing slightly larger than the other two, but exactly equally spaced in relationship to the first points of light, then forming a triangle. Since there were several friend and family all camping in my uncles yard I began yelling for a friend Buddy to get up, knowing he had just went to sleep in the back of his pickup truck next to us. He got up and came to where we were standing and we asked him what is that? Do you see what we see? He said yes, those three stars are moving!  At this point the formation was crossing the Milky Way but still bright enough to watch them. Buddy watched them with us until they were blocked from our view by trees to the North. The entire time it took the three points of light to cross the sky took about two minutes. I have looked at the night sky for years and I have never seen anything like it. It left my wife and me with an uneasy feeling about how weird it was, and then we went to bed", "storm clouds very threating at edge very dark out toward ocean was light clouds didn&apos;t get there yet took 6 digital pics. when i got home put them on computer , was shocked a round disk was in the photo i am not going to try to explain anymore, first i have to talk to someone, this is the real thing i have been taking pictures since i was a kid i&apos;m now 71. i do not want to give these pic to the media gentlemen this is the real thing the ball is you hands to advise. i will not send photos or give up photos (because of the importance of the pics until i&apos;m advised)", "White Cigar Shaped Craft seen over Waterloo, IowaOn August 5th, 2006 I have seen a &quot;White Cigar shaped craft&quot; in Waterloo, Iowa.

It was 70-85 feet in the air just over the tops of the tallest trees The Tallest trees being 45-50 feet tall. It was a sight no one would forget. I watched this craft for 4 and half minutes!

We see a light in the distance but I quickly shrugged it off as an airplane because of the red and blue flashing lights.  We BS&apos;d outside for a few more minutes before we realized that the object hadn&apos;t moved in the sky (or atleast not enough to be a plane).  We got our camera with a high powered lense, and were able to get a better view.  The object was undoubtably saucer shaped, with a red light that was traveling around the object, and a blue light that appeared to be stationary at top.  The red light was very prodominant every time it circled around the object.  The longer we watched the object, we realized it was starting to move West.  It moved West, a really really long ways for almost 45 minutes, to the point that it was getting a bit more difficult to see, but the strange thing is the red light was still very prominant.  You could tell it was a red light (looking like blinking now) but it was thousands of miles away at this point.  The object then changed course and started heading north.  It was obviously too far away to really see it moving from looking at it.  But we used landmarks (trees, other objects) to be able to tell when the object was staying still, or moving in a particular direction. I know of no aircraft that is known to the public that can produce the results that we saw tonight.  Hopefully someone else saw it !!!!  I believe the object was someone over our coast range when we first spoted it.  Then again I am not expert on telling how far away objects in the sky are.", "Strange Light Ball seen floating in sky.On the night of June 23rd 2006 I witnessed a very strange ball of light whilst outside conducting a sky watch in the sky minutes before I had been viewing a star and at first I thought the UFO was that star I had been monitoring for the past 5 minutes as the UFO had the appearance of being a star. But the only difference was this UFO was moving very slowly across the sky in a sort of floating motion a movement I have not seen matched by any aeroplane. It got to 10:35pm and as I looked up at the tree tops which sit very close to my home in Sunderland which is in the north east of England, UK, I saw a strange light ball UFO going across the sky the UFO was about the size of a golf ball if you were to throw a golf ball up into the air. The object was completely silent there was no sound of any aircraft or any other aviation related craft as the object was completely silent and unlike planes that pass by it had no flashing lights at all. I successfully videotaped the object going across the sky I videotaped for 1 Minute and then the UFO went behind the trees and out of sight. I got to a higher vantage point but the UFO was nowhere to be seen below are a few details about the video that you should all remember while viewing it. When I was viewing the object I had time to think of explanations but none seemed to be credible it is definitely unexplained and the object is definitely an Unidentified Flying Object. I have had many sightings in the past and this one has got to come somewhere in the top three it was amazing seeing this light ball floating in the sky it felt like something off the X-Files TV program. Video Details: In the video I shout &quot;I thought It was a star minutes ago&quot; that is not true I made a wrong assumption at the time as I had been observing a star that looked very similar moments before.

These lights then appeared to follow hin into his bedroom becoming blue and green rays? He then blinked to ensure he was awake got pretty frightened and ran into my room, I followed him back and looked out of the window also but there was nothing there. My son then left the light on all night I asked him if it was possible he may have been dreaming but he asured me the noise woke him up and he was wide awake?

The light was bright and intense for about 5-10 seconds and then it dimmed...not out but dimmed. The light then proceeded eastward into the sky.

It was freaky sleeping afterwards.**NOTE: We didn&apos;t see all six UFOs at once.**  At about 10:45, I sent my younger cousin downstairs to ask his mother if we could go outside to watch for UFOs. We&apos;ve seen them before while looking up into the night sky, so why not look again? Anyway, she said no at first. So we just sat on the bed, then the twins were acting up and the mother was angry. She was trying to get them to bed, since they were only six years old. I finally talked her into letting us go outside. So we sat on the chairs outside at about 11:00 PM. We sat there looking up for a while. We were talking about dreams about aliens and UFOs and the such. About the Roswell incident, about the government and them making deals with aliens. Suddenly, my older cousin sees a white, round light moving in the sky. I would&apos;ve thought it was just a plane or something like that, but it wasn&apos;t making any noise. Nor was it blinking. We just sat there looking at it move across the sky. Then all of a sudden, it disappeared! We didn&apos;t see anything after that, so we went over to another spot. Then, one of the freakiest things happened; We saw 5 of the same lights moving. They were a bit dull, but were still visible. They were moving, shifting directions, passing each other up... real freaky stuff. Then, it gets freakier, they all disappear. Not all at the same time, but they do. We can&apos;t see anything after that, so we sit down and talk about aliens and UFOs and stuff.

We were looking at the sky(There is virtualy no light pollution on ocracoke island so stargazing is as involuntary as sneezing around here).We noticed very high up some of the &quot;stars&quot;moving in erradic patterns.At first we thought we were seeing very high planes but then they would grow brighter and fade while moving at high speeds.We could not tell if we were seeing one object appear and reappear in another part of the sky or if there were several.Each time we would see a bright flash that faded as it moved sideways.We have all seen this before,we agreed it was a strange thing to see but we have always blown it off as military aircraft since we live close to so many airbases.After watching these lights for 30 minutes or so(they appeared in the south and to the west)we noticed a dim cloud high to the west over the pamlico sound.It was difficult to make out at first but as we watched it appeared to grow in size and brightness.The cloud was extermely high it looked as if it was occuring in the outer atmosphere and it was its own source of light.The 3 of us flabbergasted decided to go to the southern tip of the island to get a better look.As we walked the cloud kept getting brighter and took on a strange greenish hue similar to the bioluminecent green we sometimes see in the waves at night.Once we got to the state ferry dock the cloud had elongated and formed an arc.There at the docks many others had gathered to look at the massive glowing cloud.There was an air of silent awe and disbelif as people were asking each other,what is it?One man started yelling that we were all witnesses to a major event in history.This is history here!! he kept yelling.My friends and i decided to move away from the gathering crowd so we found a small pier to sit on and watch.As we sat there the glowing cloud seemed to be sort of billowing sideways extending itself in a slowly lengthining round tubilar form.It looked to me as if something massive had entered the atmosphere and was slowly making its way down through the diffrent layers.THIS IS VERY DIFFICULT TO DESCRIBE.The inside of the cloud had small wisps in it that were brighter than the gas around them.They had longish tails and ranged from white to light green.I asked each of my friends to describe to me what they were seeing so that i could be sure i was seeing what i thought i was seeing.One of my friends said that to her the shape of the cloud looked like the long curved neck of a crane(the bird).As an hour,then 2 passed the &quot;arc&quot; OR &quot;cranes neck&quot; had turned on its side as it decended lower in the sky and continued to spead out.As it spread the light it carried weakened and the wisps within the cloud disappeared.By 2 in the morning the cloud had completely turned on its side and continued to spread out growing ever dimmer.At three oclock there was still a faint glow in the sky although the shape of the cloud was nolonger decernable.I must backtrack here to try to better descibe what appeared to have happened.It was clear that the cloud had begun much higher than where it vanished.There was a clear sense of depth and dimension in the clouds shape and movement.It seemed that its entry into the atmosphere had affected it via the different layers of air and tempreture it had passed through.By this i mean to say that the turning motion of the cloud appeared to be caused at least in part by air currents.(yes all of this was visable even at night,that is how bright and massive this thing was)What was I thinking?First it was frightening,an event of that magnitude no matter what is a major deal.I came to many conclusions with my friends.1,it was a collision of whatever aircraft we had been witnessing before.2,It was an outer atmosphere nuclear test by the military.3,it was an electromagnetic blast caused by HAARP experiments or 4 We were finally being invaded by someone from out there.But none of these theories explained very much.On its own the cloud was a magnificent phenomena but coupled with the other strange lights in the sky it becomes simply unexplainable a UFO.As I sat in silence with my friends watching the cloud disappear i assumed i would read of it in the paper,or see it on the news,no matter what i thought i would pursue it for the rest of my life.It never made the news that i could tell.My friends contacted others on the nieghboring Cape Hatteras sea shore.Even as some descibed seeing the same cloud thier sightings differed from ours by hours.I decribed this event to a good friend that also lives on the island but was not present that evening,he told me that he had been told the same story a year earlier by a man living on the mainland.The event that I witnessed with so many others had been seen before in the same place.It has taken so long for me to report this because i was unaware of this website.I am hoping that someone else who was there that night will also end up here in thier search for answers and put down thier own description of this awesome event.It may never be revealed to me what this was but it will always remain clear and unforgettable in my mind and i am quite pleased to have seen it.((NUFORC Note:  Date of the sighting may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

Shortly after that, ATC calls out to &quot;ALL aircraft flying fetween 30,000 and 40,000 feet to report in and ID themselves, I assume that ment to set a specific IFF code on their transponders. About 10 aircraft called in  and then ther was silence for a short while before the normal ATC chatter started back up.. Local Sacramento time was about 09:00. After thinking about this I think that was the case of an unknown flying object with no flight plan or nor IFF. ar", "small object sitting still above seattle, extremely far away, wavering a littleI was alone walking up Denny Ave. in downtown Seattle, and I looked to the sky - enjoying the clouds and saw what was no bigger than what a star would look like in the night sky. I stopped and watched it, thinking it might be a jet - but it stayed in the same spot, behind the clouds, for a number of minutes. The object was extremely far away, but I could tell that it was metallic. I thought I saw it wavering back and forth a little bit, but it was hard to tell as it was so far away. I stayed in the same spot and watched it for about five minutes, at which point clouds rolled over and I lost it. I couldn&apos;t find it in the sky after that point, but the object never fully came out of the clouds.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

And then suddenly out of nowhere this strange light appeared to come down from the trail and appear just below it. The light then appeared to get brighter and I could make out the object I was seeing was orange in colour and then the strange light went upwards and it could no longer be seen but I am sure it was still there. I kept on seeing little flashes across the sky and at some points I could see objects flying around and at one point I even noticed the object was in the actual trail of the plane. I am positive it was not a Plane, Helicopter, Satellite or Flare I have seen all four of these and this object looked nothing like any of them for one Planes and Helicopters cannot move in those amazing ways neither can flares or satellites.

It was aprox. 4-5 ft. circumference and about four feet thick. I pulled off the road and into a subdivision to get a better look and saw that it was directly above a house, perhaps fifteen feet from the roof (the house was aprox. thirty feet high). In what I suppose was the front of the craft were two lights and in the back was one longer strip of lights, both changing colors in synch with each other. The craft was completely silent and slightly swayed from left to right. Furthermore, another car drove past on the same road that I had been driving on, and as it drove up the hill its head lights reflected off of the UFO revealing metal panels. The car slowed down, but did not stop. I was too scared at the time to contact the house owners and instead drove to get my girlfriend to see what she could make out of the situation. However, when I returned with her, it was gone.

We have assigned an arbitrary date in 2004.  PD))", "An extremelly bright circular orange/amber light traveled NW to SW pausing for 20 sec. 3x. Not far awayI was working in the grocery store while my co-workers were outside the store, taking a break. One of my co-workers yelled from the door for me to come outside, quickly. I ran, suspecting some altercation or car accident. As I got outside, my co-workers were standing in the parking lot looking north east. I imidiatly saw a bright orange/amber light about 30-40 deg. above the horrizon. I then ran due east to the edge of the parking lot to gain darker skies. There is a field direcly east of the store, with less light pollution. We stood for about 10 minutes, facing east and watching this &quot;object&quot; move from left to right. It paralleled the horizon in that its over all altitude with respect to our location deviated only slightly as it stopped and remained motionless for up to 20 seconds. It stopped 3 times. Each time the object began to move again, its altitude remained some what stable. It did not appear to move on an exactly strait path but the deviation in alltitude was minimal. When I first saw the object, it was large compared to regular air traffic. If I tried to &quot;pinch&quot; the object with my thumb and index finger, arm strait, the object would be 1/8&quot; to 1/4&quot;. I am 6&apos;1&quot; tall. The distance from my eye to my thumb, held in this manner is 2&apos; 6&quot;. About half way along the objects path, it encountered the marine layer of fog that is common this time of year here. The object lost some brightness and some size, but it still apeared larger and brighter than any normal air traffic. also, I did not see the object &quot;pause&quot; until it had encountered the marine layer. This is where the object lost some of it&apos;s disk like appearance. I mean disk like the sun, and not like a frisbee. Before the fog there was a slight whiteness to the center of the object, but it remained mostly dark orange, not red, but a rich orange that I have never seen on any air craft. I have seen orange in many air craft lights, but never that rich and intense a color. The only noise we could hear was our own conversation and speculation with respect to the object. The object gradually began to deminish in size and brightness and did look like commom air craft in the last minute and then dissapeared. In the last quarter of our observations, the object looked very much like Mars did the last time Mars was at it&apos;s brightest. The object seemed to cut a path between the Sonoma Valley and the Napa Valley. This would put it about 5 to 10 miles away from me. I must add that I have eaten lunch in the same location for 7+ years. I am very aware of the normal air traffic attributes here. Sitting in the same spot in the dark for 7 years, you would think that I might have seen something sooner. I am an amature astronomer and have made several sundials. I have seen many &quot;Life Flight&quot; Helicopters and Sherrif helicopters. I have watched the air traffic surrounding the Sonoma Valley from home and to work, and I have never seen any thing like this. I know what it isn&apos;t.", "Bright white object that moved extremely fast and appeared out of nowhere.My friend and I were driving back to my house.  We decided to go a longer way then usual.  As we stopped at a stop sign, we both fell silent as we saw a bight white object moving quite quikly across the sky.  It literally came out of nowhere, like someone turned on a light.  It was falling away from us diagonally.  The object was VERY bright and white.  It was a full moon that night and yet this object was just as bright or brighter then the moon and even as it moved away from us it didnt lose ant light.  And it was obvious to both of us that the object was moving AWAY from the car, meaning that it couldn&apos;t have been a plane or helicopter light shining directly at us (it was much too bright anyway).  From our view point the object was the size of an eraser head of a pencil.  It was heading towards the highway and when I stepped out of the car to continue watching it over the line of trees, I saw it quickly go straight up and disappear just as quickly as it appeared.  I have been interested in astronomy much of my life and I know the difference between a comet/meteor/shooting star and this was without a doubt none of the above.  Both of us were completely amazed by the speed and how bright the object was.", "Cylinder shaped object hovers near freewayWhile driving east on interstate 24 going into murfreesboro, at a break in the tree line that runs parallel to the freeway, I noticed a cylinder shaped object suspended at a level even with the trees.I first noticed this out of the corner of my right eye.Which would be the passenger part of the front windsheild of the truck I was driving.    It&apos;s hard to guess how large the object was.It was in a veritcal position with a curved dome top,and it had some smaller boxey parts attached to the side I observed,also at the bottom of the craft there was something hanging out of it toward the ground.The grass was tall so I could not see if this line or whatever you want to call it was actually touching the ground.There were no lights visible,but it was clear that night and of the many cars that were on the freeway that night anyone could have seen this if at that tree break they would&apos;ve looked to the right.", "Large Orb Expands, Then VanishesI was sitting outside on a hot evening, looking at the sky towards the NNW. I noticed an object that appeared to be a large and bright star, similar to what Venus would look like at its brightest.  Within a few seconds, this object expanded, became bigger and even brighter, then suddenly disappeared. I watched the area for a while longer, but saw nothing re-appear, nothing else unusual.  This object never became unnaturally large or bright, but it was odd in that it increased in size before completely vanishing.", "brght blue flashing discI work for the railroad and was riding a railcar into a clear track when i noticed a blue light out of the corner of my eye. The object I saw was a bright blue disc traveling from north to south at a low rate of speed.I immediatley stopped the movement of my train.The object then became a brighter shade of blue and began accelarating leaving a short white trail it then flashed brilliantly and seemed to flash out of existence.I know from a lifetime of working nights that I did not see a meteorite it was clearly a blue disc flying on a crystal clear night.The whole experience lasted 4 to 5 seconds.", "The stars are aliveI was driving home from getting coffee this morning,and noticed two stars,one bigger than the other, well I thought it was stars. I was about to turn and then the bigger star moved, I mean enough to get my attention and make me pull over and get out. Time seemed like it paused for a while,a man and his friend was walking up the road and they started pointing up. The regular size star just stood still while the bigger one moved towards the north. Just when I was going to pass it off for just a falling star, the big one started moved sideways and faster. It flickered, and then vanished and reappeared back by the spot by the regular looking star. A hugh square of the sky around the two objects went black and the big object sort of disappeared in the darkness, but the smaller one still shined like a star.One of the people that were watching began walking away saying that he had seen enough, I stayed.The big object seemed to appear grayish as it reappeared from the darkness. ( and that was the strangest part to me, you could see color at 6:00am in the morning, that far up in the sky.) In about 40 secs the big object started away from the small one and seemed to go faster and faster away.

We layed down in the field looking up at the stars. we layed there bout 20 minutes and we noticed an object moving from west to east in the sky. We thought it was a plane at a distance, but as it moved closer we noticed it was a triangular shaped object. There was 4 lights on it total. 3 on the corners and 1 underneath it. It flew directly over us. What made it even more odd was there was NO sound to it at all. It was probably a few hundred feet in the air. And the size would be of an average passenger plane.

One voice very powerfully vibrated through the air and me said, &quot;I AM JEHOVAH, the Father Almighty, the Creator Almighty.&quot; (note: this means the tetragrammaton. i was standing there amazed, with a broom in my hand and i noticed i was still holding it and i immediately thought of the moses movie and took off my shoes and put the broom on the ground and did the same thing, got on the floor on my knees, and started praising God.  i thought to ask HIM. HE asked me to be HIS Wayshower, and showed me a vison of a misty white large road in the sky with viscous black walls on either side, and that the light of the Creator fell on on this road.  HE said, &quot;If anyone argues with you about what you think, do say and testify to leave them by the wayside.&quot; i was shown a image of me grown up as an adult showing a indian man into the viscous wayside, where GOD looked down on his entrapped form crying and turned away from him with finality.  i then said l&quot;let everything i think, do say and testify to be of you and not of myself so that otheres will know you have sent me.&quot; then i worshipped THEM and i looked up from where i was bowed and they were gone.  in the afterward, my foster monm and two child siblings entered the house and said to me &quot;what happpened? you&apos;re glowing very bright.&quot; I was lit up like a neon sign, and they put a sheer curtain over my head so they could look at me.  afterwards, there was a ufo silver disk, with a bulging ring of protholes, about 15&apos; across that landed in the next week while i was up at the nextdoor neighbors camping out and i ws &quot;abducted&quot; from the tent, given a physical examination and tatooed with an egyptian heiroglyphic that is the name for NIT- a weaving shuttle- on my right groin area over the ovary.  my stomach bulgeed and i felt like i had radiation sickness for the next 2 weeks, causing my family to be tightlipped and very worried, but they refused to tell anyone because my dad worked for the government.  the blue book came out and white curtained the area of the landing, because the craft burnt depressions into the asphalt road at the bend right past the house where i lived.  I peeked over the edge of the hill and was pspotted and photographed (glowing) because i wanted to see what was going on behind the white curtains. that fall, the family doctor gave everyone a complete physical examination and photographed my tatoo for the FBI (i saw the markings card marked FBI which the doctor with alot of excalamations filled out and took a one step polaroid picture of the mark.  i didn&apos;t tell him the truth.  and that began to be the first of countless ufo contacts with the good guys of Heaven.  unfortunately, years later, the two other girls with me in the tent have succumbed to cancer, although that didn&apos;t happen till they hit their adult years.  i began to be very talented and did amazing things which my foster family couldn&apos;t get over, like levitation and fire shooting from my hands and body.  i was a pretty good little girl, and i was known as a mindreader and very pronounced psi talented.  athere were other events, but this is where it first started, although i remember instances in milpitas california as a baby where shadowy &quot;white&quot; people like ghosts used to come into our house and visit me, telling me not to forget what i was here for, to be with me when i was scared at night, etc.  alot about don&apos;t forget the promise, the plan.  that&apos;s all for now.  these are not all the details of what happened the first time for me on doerner road in oregon.  oh, and the guys that got off the craft were humanlike, with golden blonde short, curly hair and gold and purple close fitting jumpsuits and white silverish boots.  they didn&apos;t seem to have seams in the clothes who piloted the craft that burnt the holes in the road.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Up ahead, an object &quot;hovered&quot; across the road in a diagonal fashion. Though I was tired I knew right away that it was NOT a car, as there were no crossroads where it came and went, just straight road. The object was slightly off the ground, and it was slowly rotating, displaying red blinking lights. It happened so quick I wondered if I was seeing things, but my boyfriend, who was wide awake and driving looked right back at me when i looked at him in awe. We both just knew it was nothing man made...when we passed the spot it had crossed, of course there was nothing to be seen there!

It did so due to the fact that we&apos;ve got a very low celing - at 2:08 it was reported to be at 1600 ft. with only a 5 mile visability (It&apos;s drizziling in some locations). It was traveling east to west at a very low altitude and totally cleared my visable horizion in 5 or 6 seconds. No noise, no descent angle, very smooth yet very fast and absolutely no other colors or strobes, just almost the color of a green traffic light. I&apos;ve seen many, many various aircrafts in my life at day and night but this, for sure, was no conventional aircraft that I&apos;ve ever seen. Due to the weather conditions, it struck me as being so very odd that I&apos;d be able to see any aircraft whatsoever in the sky, let alone one this low in altitude and traveling at such a speed(not blazing speed - but very fast but yet so very smoothly - it&apos;s difficult to describe).

Under a clear sky filled with stars (or at least as clear as it gets in the Los Angeles area) I looked straight up, as I often do, for a panoramic view, and to scan the sky for any oddities or any airplanes. Suddenly, the burst of what appeared to be the tail of a small comet, or shooting star, shot across the sky, very high up, and from a thumbnail perspective, left a trail perhaps three to four inches long.This was a bright fiery white burst and by all appearances, was indeed a shooting star, as far as I could tell. However, it is noteworthy because they are relatively rare in the Los Angeles area since they cannot always be spotted from beneath the suburban and urban skies. This one had a long tail and left a trail of sparks.There was nothing to obliterate my view and the appearance of this is apparently what I saw. I continued to stare up at the sky for a little while afterwards; however, I saw nothing else that I could deem as being unusual.I would be very interested to know if anyone else saw this, and whether it had essentially the same appearance to them.", "I know it is a UFO.

I was 17 years old at the time and had lived on Air force bases for most of my life and was quite used to seeing airplanes at night, but it concerned me that this one appeared to be quite low and unusual even at a distance. I poked my head inside the front door and called for my Dad to come check out what I was seeing. (My dad was a Retired Air force Colonel) and had been a pilot for 30 years. My dad and I watched the object as it approached and as it got closer and passed overhead it presented itself as 5 seperate white lights in a triangular shape.  It flew a steady heading and there was no sound whatsover.  It is unlike any object that I have ever seen in the sky, it appeared to be low (2 or 3 thousand) but it really is impossible to tell at night.  But if it was much higher, then what doesnt make sense is how it appeared when I first saw it appear on the horizon...at that time it looked just like a large jetliner does when it is coming right at you with its landing lights on. Several other neighboors watched it pass over, and while it was not spectacular, it was certainely unusual, and it did not have any red or green navigation lights, just white lights in a triangle shape.

I would have guessed that they were man-made satelites, but they didn&apos;t travel in a continuous straight line across the sky, and they moved slower than satelites.  I would also have guessed that they were extremely high-flying aircraft, but their movements were not like aircraft--they would move slowly in a straight line for a while, then make turns that were too sudden for an aircraft, sometimes at angles close to 90 degrees.

I made a comment on how strange it looked and how low it was flying. We slowed down and watched the lights until they were out of sight and then almost instantly forgot about them. Both of us don&apos;t actually believe in UFO&apos;s so it was easy to put out of our minds. But tonight when I saw that show it made me wonder.

Carson is about 18 miles south of down town Los Angeles. It was about 5:30 PM on a weekday in July in 1978 or 79. My folks house is in the suburbs with curbs, gutters and alot of homes.  As I pulled up in front of the house an old friend pulled up accross the street to see his family. We stood on the sidewalk talking. It was a perfectly clear afternoon with a strong breeze, no clouds and a real blue sky. A blue sky is very important to me. There were several kites flying real high in the sky. As we were talking I noticed that one of the kites was very high. I point out how high it was to my friend but he looked and didn&apos;t see it. He always had bad eyesite so I just let it go. While talking I kept looking up at this one kite. It didn&apos;t act like a kite. It didn&apos;t bounch around in the sky like a kite, it just stayed still in one spot. Then it quickly came down lower. I told my friend the string must have broke. He looked but still didn&apos;t see it. Then the kite starts moving from spot to spot in the sky. It moved real fast. I said to my friend this isn&apos;t a kite. Then I noticed it kept changing colors. It changed from light gray to dark gray, almost black. My friend still doesn&apos;t see it. Then it hit me, this is a balloon. It&apos;s a silver gray balloon that is not fully filled and the wind causes it to change shape and the dark color is really shadows on it. Then it dropped down lower and I could see it. It was not a kite or a ballon. This flying thing was about 1500 feet above Carson High School and I&apos;m about 1/4 mile south of the school. The sun is in the west and I&apos;m looking north. I can see it clearly. It was not as long as a fighter jet but was wider. It made no noise or so little I couldn&apos;t hear it. This thing is 3 sided. Best way to discribe it is if you took a football and cut it in half from end to end. Now throw the bottom away and just use the top half. Now flaten out the sides so they meet at a ridge on top.The sides and bottom are not flat but slightly convexed. So this thing has a bottom and 2 sides with a slightly pointy front and rear where the sides and bottom come together. It was odd shaped. It is mostly a shinny gray. There are no windows or joint lines that I could see. There are no visible lights but there are light and dark gray lines that move from end to end along the sides and along the bottom. These lines look like gray bar codes that randomly move quickly and slowly from end to end. That&apos;s why it looks like it changes from light to dark and also seems to have shadows at a further distance. So here is this shinny gray thing rippling with gray bar code lines in plain site and my friend can&apos;t see it.  He&apos;s squinting and I&apos;m pointing to no avail. Then it takes off straight up and out of site. About 10 seconds latter it comes back. This time it is a little lower then before and a little clearer to see. My friend can&apos;t see it. I can&apos;t believe he can&apos;t see it. Half of Los Angeles has got to be looking at this thing. It is in sight for about 30 seconds slowly turning from side to side. Then again it goes straight up and again out of site, never to be seen by me again.  5 to 10 seconds later I saw 4 military type fighter jets fly over Carson and go straight up in the air after it with after burners roaring. There was no way they were ever going to catch this thing, it was far faster then the jets. I ask my friend did he see the jets? He said he did. I watched this thing for about 5 minutes.  I checked the paper and watched the news for days but nothing was ever reported. Haven&apos;t seen my friend in many years, bet he probably still thinks I&apos;m crazy and until about a year ago, I had my doughts. Why did the military and apparently only myself see this thing? I think my daughter unknowingly figured it out. She is an artist, a painter, she mixes and creates colors for her art. I have blue gray blindness. I only see certain shades of blues and grays. Most of the time, I only see grays. To me, the sky is mostly gray with a hint of blue on occasion and only on a few days out of the year do I see a bright blue sky like the day in question. While talking to my daughter, she said that I am missing alot by not seeing the different shades of blues in the sky. Then it hit me. It&apos;s not only what I don&apos;t see, it&apos;s also what I do see. This thing in the sky, it wasn&apos;t gray it was probably blue and the bar code lines, they were probably shades of blue not shades of gray. This thing could camouflag itself to the sky. That&apos;s why my friend and everybody else couldn&apos;t see it when it was in front of them. The military saw it with radar. I saw it because its camouflag colors fell outside of my color spectrum because of my blue gray blindness. Maybe on a grayer day for me I wouldn&apos;t have seen it. Its grays to me would have blended together to a camouflag but on this day with a bright blue sky, it stuck out like a soar thumb. Over the years I&apos;ve learned not to talk about the stuff I see in the sky like this thing and the other stuff because people do look at you like your crazy. On this day I know what I saw and it was real.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date in July 1978 is approximate.

The light was very faint and at first glance seemed to be a satellite, just a pin-prick gliding in a southerly direction away from me... as I watched it, it&apos;s brightness seemed to fade and then suddenly started jerking around in the sky- It seemed to be VERY far away, as I said earlier,(Like a sattelite in orbit) and was making 90 degree turns and sudden stops... it was very impressive as well as the 10 minute duration of the display. This continued untill a SECOND light came across the sky towards it, though this time it was most definetly an airplane of some sort with trademark blinking lights and flying in an even and steady path... as the blinking light of the air-plane approached the jerky &quot;UFO&quot; light, it instantly darted downward and over the horizon, while the air-plane continued on a straight easterly path.

I estamated the alitude of the object at about 15 to 20 thousand ft, as it went east over the mountian range east of my house. It appeared to be a circular object and was very bright and then dem. I thought this was odd and watched two more jets come around into my view. At that point in went inside and go my binoculars and came back outside and looked for about 15 seconds until I spotted it again and put the glasses on it. As I watched it the jets just kept coming around in circles. There were four of them, two each close to each other, maybe 20 seconds apart in my view. As the went by they were always under the object. As the jets came around the object went higher. I watched until I could no longer hear the jets or see the 0bject in my view through the glasses. The jets were military and I could make them out very well when it first started. I have watched many objects at night here in AZ but never reported them. They are always to the east southeast, in the direction of Phoenix and the air force base.This was the first time I have seen an object in the day light that was that clear and close that I could tell that it was not an airliner or military jet.

It just hung there, just at a little above rooftop level.  I could only see the bottom of it, as I remember the top of it was cloud or mist covered (although it was sitting not far off the ground).  There were lots of people already pulled over to the side of the road and out of their cars, gesturing and pointing towards it.  I absolutely begged my then husband to please stop, stop, I wanted to look at it, but he wouldn&apos;t, just kept looking straight ahead with the pedal to the metal.

The object was a V shape but came to points. The object had faint lights on the tips of the wings and on the front tip. The object moved in a zig-zag path but didnt appear to be making much distance.

I do not drink nor take drugs which would interfere with my vision. I hesitated for several weeks to report this anamolous phenomenon because sky conditions have not been ideal -- thunderstorms and clouds, not to mention the urban light scatter that makes observations in Atlanta difficult.  However this sighting has repeated itself a dozen times in the last few weeks and I felt compelled to report it.  In each occurance several hovering lights have been observed out of my bedroom window which faces almost due east.  This view looks out on a main air traffic corridor in and out of ATL (Hartsfield-Jackson International) and PDK (Peachtree Dekalb).  On these evenings I would observe the normal comings and goings of the aircraft, with their landing lights, wing lights, strobes, etc. and what I observed was obviously not an aircraft.  I would see one perhaps two lights hovering in position from just above the horizon, perhaps ten degrees, up to almost directly above.  On one or two occasions the light would appear just after a flash like a strobe,  On others the strobe flash was diffused by a high overcast.  The lights, which varied from a reddish white to a bluish white, would remain stationary for thirty seconds to five minutes, then would fade and in their place a line of lights would appear, usually canted from the horizontal, like a wing making a turn, or sometimes three red lights would appear in the same spot in the shape of a triangle, equilateral or isocoles, then would morph back into a light and move quickly, probably too quickly for an aircraft, to the northwest or southwest, DIRECTLY ACROSS the flight patterns of two airports.  It is extremely difficult to estimate altitude but would not be surprised if they were manuvering over fifty thousand feet.  As I mentioned the cloud cover made it difficult to track them completely across the sky but the consistency of the pattern is remarkable.

The exact date is unknown now but documentary evidence from the event indicates it was definitely between mid September and mid October 1991. We were sitting in my car looking at the water at the Port of Olympia, Washington. Time was late evening, with clear sky transitioning from dusk to night. Exact location was parked at the KGY radio station tower at Port of Oly facing north looking over the water of Budd Inlet, with West Oly to the left, East Bay Drive and Priest Point Park to the right. There was a very bright star (or so it seemed) shining singularly in the sky out over the water directly in front of us, but looking quite far away, as all stars normally do ( ! ). We must have sat looking at it for a good half hour while talking about life and random things. Quite suddenly this star &apos;expanded&apos; for lack of any other way to describe it, exactly the way that a Hoberman Sphere does (I found out many years later what a Hoberman Sphere is, and just about crapped myself the first time I saw one in motion its movement looked so similar), but with no visible structure, just one point of light expanding into numerous points of light, perhaps 20 or more, moving quite fast into a giant and perfectly spherical formation of several star-like lights. The formation resembled a grid over a globe with a light at each connecting point between latitude and longitude, but again, no visible structure, just lights in this formation. This assemblage proceeded to rotate there, HUGE, the lights traveling around the far side of the formation visible through the front side lights moving the opposite direction, in the air for several seconds while we stared slack-jawed in disbelief. I sat silent and stared while she repeated like a mantra &quot;this is not happening&quot;. As suddenly as it had initially expanded (and after rotating there in the air for a very long moment) it collapsed in an instant into what appeared to be a single star again, the same as we had stared at while talking all that time before. Just when we were wiping our brows and &quot;WTF!!!&quot;-ing over what we had just seen, it slowly began turning red and pulsating. Then it divided. The star (as it were) remained stationary there and began ejecting duplicates of itself (for lack of better description), 5 of them if I recall, appearing one at a time from the stationary light, same color red, all pulsing in time with one another, traveling at an even distance from one another at a constant and relatively slow rate across the sky away from their starting position, heading east / southeast. As soon as they were evenly spaced and enroute the original &quot;star&quot; took up a trailing position in the single file formation and they all flew off slowly over us and eventually the treeline and out of sight. All of this, start to finish took maybe 2 or 3 minutes. The whole thing happened in complete silence, whatever it/they were made no sound at all, which hit us when, as they were flying away, we noticed a small general aviation airplane flying a different direction but at a much higher altitude. We could just make out the distant drone of the prop engine from the airplane but could hear nothing from the light formation traveling visibly well closer to us. This was when it also dawned on us how much closer the whole event had to have happened to us than it looked to the eye at first. We were praying that pilot would see these things and perhaps react in some way we could take as confirmation he saw it, but no, they were below and behind him and heading away from his position. He flew right on wherever he was going, apparently unaware. Optical illusion? Sober group hallucination? Swamp Gas? In all the years since, I never have figured out what the hell that thing was, and I would be shocked if I ever did. It / they moved with obvious coordination which implies some kind of intelligence / control, it was like nothing I&apos;ve ever seen before or since, I am (after seeing it) hard pressed to believe it to be anything of &quot;known&quot; terrestrial technology, I have resigned to the likelihood that I will never know what it was at all. I would have written my own self off as nuts the very evening I saw it (I was never really a ufo &apos;believer&apos;) if not that my girlfriend had sat right there beside me and witnessed the whole thing too. I went back over a partial video shot of the event (yes believe it or not I had a video camera in the car but the battery had been dead and was only holding a residual charge from sitting around, it was enough to power the camera about ten seconds), the video is completely useless because it was getting dark (everything was plainly visible to the naked eye, but with this cutting edge late &apos;80s video camera, all one can really make out is a blank screen with a few strange flickering whitish dots on it that seem to come and go. The only anecdotal content of any value is the audio track of my girlfriend and myself freaking out (apparently I wasn&apos;t silent the whole time!), ((allusion to profanity deleted)) etc in the few seconds. Unfortunately I didn&apos;t have the wherewithal to hit the &quot;show date/time&quot; function in those few seconds. The best I can do is note that the unrelated video clip shot immediately before it was on September 17th, 1991.

When we got to a cross road by our home we stopped , got out of the car, and looked up and was dumbstruck at what we saw. It was a clear open area (the crossroad ) and it was directly overhead, maybe 300 feet in the air ( very low ). From directly underneath it was round with 4 white lights and a red one in the middle. It was probably 75 - 100 yards long. It completely covered all the stars behind it and sat there for maybe 30 seconds hovering above us with NO noise what so ever. It then started moving away from us behind the trees and out of sight.

We continued to observe this &apos;star&apos; for a minute or so before it abruptly started to move and very quickly crossed several degrees of the sky. Just as abruptly it stopped at its new position. The acceleration and speed was remarkable.. Once in its new position it again appeared to vibrate on the spot.

It was multicolored, red, white, green etc.   It moved very very quickly and did all kind of shapes.  It looked like a snake shaped but it was also horizontal rectangle.  It seemed to have a white circle on one end as it was moving so fast into spirals, figure 8, zig zag, and it was just moving into all kinds of shape as this snake shaped or worm shaped so called star was moving around and jumping around.

It is interesting that it looks like a star but what got my curoisity was the multicolor of it and it seemed to move the clouds as it moved down, down more than a gravitational force I think.

Almost all of a sudden, this smooth, almost polished silvery object passed silently across the sky. I never pointed towards the sky or called out to anyone (since it was very short, and I felt I would probably be ridiculed to no end) when it happened. It didn&apos;t last very long, possibly a minute or so. There was no portholes or windows on the object, it was completely featureless, with no lights of any sort, and was seemingly completely level during the entire sighting. Never did any acrobatic maneuvers or &quot;showed off&quot; or anything like that. Seemingly just darted across the sky just fast enough so I could see and nothing else. The shape of it, an elongated wedge, is best described as taking a three-sided pyramid and taking one point and stretching it. There&apos;s a picture in one of the special issues of UFO Universe (can&apos;t recall which one) of a drawing made by a young girl in Israel of her UFO sighting, that had a shape (possibly of the craft itself) that looked just like mine, except hers had lights. The text of the drawing was all done in the Israeli writing, so I am not sure if that&apos;s the case. The object never left a trail, there was no haze about it, no emittance of beams, or anything of the sort. And no noise ever came from the object during the entire sighting. It also remained absolutely level, and performed no acrobatic maneuvers or rose upwards at a very high rate of speed. It also never slowed down, as the speed seemed to be very steady the entire sighting. No one else talked about it, so I don&apos;t know if the other kids saw it or not. I never pointed it out or called anyone&apos;s attention to it, preferring to keep it to myself in case I was ridiculed for seeing it. The &quot;several&quot; on the witnesses box is only technical, since the other kids were out playing around, but none ever saw the object or said anything about it at the time.

It was turning around, so it went to a 45 degree angle and to a 90 degree angle then very thin again as it went from South to North.

The neighborhood was very quiet with no cars passing by on the road. My friend and I were walking somewhere to join other friends to &quot;hang out&quot;. Though we did at times use alcohol and marijuana at that age, we were both very sober and &quot;straight&quot; at the time of this occurrence. We both looked up when we noticed the very large, silent, slow-moving object passing over our heads above the trees at a slow speed. It was about the size of a football field, shaped like an elongated, irregularly shaped triangle. Its appearance was most like that of a gray rock though it did have the shape I have noted. It was silent and had a bluish glow from the back as if it were emitting some sort of flame or exhaust. This was the only light visible and we only noticed that after it passed us. When we saw it we were both amazed, exclaiming to each other, &quot;what the (expletive) is that?!!&quot; We began to run after it, in the direction it was moving slowly and soundlessly (North by Northwest) until we realized that there was no way we were going to keep up with it.

I honestly shook my head and blinked my eyes in disbelief! As the object moved closer it seemed to get smaller but remained fuzzy in appearance, almost like a dandelion bloom. Buy get smaller I mean it did not seem to become larger as it came closer. Therefore I can only assume it performed some shrinking act while it moved from the clouds closer to the Earth and our yard. I would also add that it appeared larger in form as it first came out from the cloud cover. After about a minute of it buzzing around a small area -- much in the fashion of a dragonfly -- it went out over the trees and swamp near our home.

I did and shortly after steeping out on the back patio I saw a white round shaped object traveling from the North East to the South West almost straight overhead - maybe 15 degrees off of vertical. The night sky was clear with a few scattered wispy clouds and stars were clearly visible.  The object appeared to be a satellite, but I thought it as a little large to be a satelling and though it might be the space station.

I and watched it travel along a straight line until it was approximately 30 degrees from the horizon.  The thought that it could be a UFO came into my mind and I thought &quot;Well, if you are something not of this world then show me a maneuver so I know for sure.&quot;  I really wasn&apos;t expecting it to do anything as I was still sure it was a man-made craft.

Both the airplane and the object appeared to be traveling at roughly the same speed. The object continued in the same direction as I got up to get a better view.

I called the local airports- no reports; however, confirmed the altitude of cloud cover to be 1000-3000 miles up. Also, ceiling was 1100 miles in Petaluma(10 miles W). confirmed altitude of object from observer to be 26.75 deg. from observation point.did this by locating a star that matched location of object at the same time the following night. By my calculations, this object would have to have a diameter of 10.1815 feet at .4629 miles away. Or a 27.7679 foot diameter at 1.2624 miles away. These are actual diameters based on the visual size of 1/8&quot; at 2&apos;1/2&quot; away from my eye. Interestingly, there has been a 4.4 earthquake just a few miles from the observation point, 5 days later. This location matches the origin of the object. Could this have been &quot;earthquake lights&quot;? I have no frame of reference to confirm this possibility. Upon reflection, I see aircraft in nearly the same location, only never North to South, always South to North on this same path. Please feel free to scrutinize my findings.

I wasn&apos;t tired, so I stayed up late to work on a computer project. I went outside to the front of my home at approximately 5:15 to have a cigarette. I was standing in the driveway of my home, facing the house (so I was facing east / northeast) and looking up at the stars. I was amazed with how clear it was. Usually I can only see a certain number of stars due to light pollution in my area. This night was incredibly clear though, and I could see constellations I only see once every so often. I noticed an airplane fly by. It was high enough so that you couldn&apos;t hear the engine, but you could still clearly make out the red and blue lights on the wings. It went off into the distance and there it was obvious there were no more aircraft in sight. As I stood there a few minutes longer admiring the stars, enjoying my cigarette, I noticed a pinpoint of light almost directly overhead. This was much different than an airplane. With an airplane (especially at night), you can always see the wing and tail lights which are often red and blue. This was a single white point of light that appeared. It flashed overhead for about 2 seconds, then disppeared. About 10 to 15 seconds later, it appeared again, heading in a southerly direction. It flashed again for 2 seconds and disappeared. Then, after another 10 or 15 seconds had passed, it flashed again. That was the last time. If I had to measure the distance between the flashes, I would say it was equal to the amount of sky that two adult hand widths would cover side by side, extended at arm&apos;s length. I followed the path of the light to see if it flashed again, but it did not. This is what made me even more suspicious because there were still stars in the sky above where the flash would have appeared that were clearly visible. There were no clouds over the house at the time and, again, I was amazed that the sky was at clear as it was. I wondered if I could have been seeing a satellite, but it didn&apos;t make sense that it would be flashing or that it would only flash three times and disappear. The brightness of the flash was about equal to the brightness of Mars or Venus on any clear night. Less than a minute after I spotted the light, I went inside to look at the clock on my cable box. I used this clock specifically because the time is set by my local cable company and it would make sense that it would be the most accurate clock in my home. The time was 5:22.", "Harlan, Indiana mayhurst drive disc shaped craft with multi-flashing colors of light going around counter-clockwise on side of craft..UFO sighting back year between mid 80&apos;s early 90&apos;s  This sighting had to have been mid  80&apos;s  early 90&apos;s I dont know the exact date but I was a young boy at the time living in harlan, IN. on Mayhurst Dr. street very end of street on left side was the house I lived in with my family my childhood first home until we moved not far to a double story house on st. joe center rd. you can see on a google map the road and the cementry circle satellite view on map street is mayhurst rd. at end of street left house. Harlan Indiana look for post office use map zoom in you&apos;ll see a mayhurst rd. with circle  that was were we lived at  cementry next to it which was a little spooky. but this I know without a doubt happened for real. I know because the behind our back yard 2 neighbors were standing in the driveway looking straight up at this thing. it must of done something to our physci or memory  because we all saw it including my mother she remeber&apos;s but only slight trace&apos;s of the memory  the best I can recall and remeber is seeing this thing floated or hovered silently about 38 feet above the ground at about house level it come across the corn field and stopped directly in plain view out of our back yard just above backyard&apos;s neighbor&apos;s house or gravel drivewayop level it made no noise was a classic circular on sideview all around the disc shaped craft was perfect circle lights going around counter clockwise in a timed unison every circle that light up was a different color like red green orange blue white It seemed these counter clockwise flashing of lights which was flashing half a second or so probably had to do something with its propulsion of the craft it was clearly not of this planet I tell you like an anti gravity craft something I never have seen. While staring at this craft with awe I remeber I looked back at the sliding glass door from back porch and my mom was looking at it too, I then  looked and 2 of my neighbors from the house&apos;s driveway it was hovering above with these flashing lights  going around and the 2 neighbors were standing directly below it pointing and marveling at the bottom of the craft. The ufo was a brownish color like metal. this ufo had to of done something to our memory because the only thing we could remeber next was it fading away in the distance hovering at an unknown rate. I drew a picture of it to my mom&apos;s friend but we were all like in a state of denial or something but it really happened! This thing was for real I know what i saw but god i wish i had had my mother take a snapshot with the poloraid camera we had back then you know the instant flash  and picture. It was so weird but happened and I guess its one of those things when you see something like that you dont think of anything else rational or think of getting the camera because all you can do is stare at this thing that is really there but you cannot believe it. messes with your physci because your brain can&apos;t register what you are seeing as normal or  rational but it&apos;s there. I&apos;ll probably never ever see another ufo in person again because it is  so rare but I know this was real and happened maybe if I had hypnotic recogoniction or something  I could unlock the rest of what I saw but can&apos;t remeber it happened id bet my mother&apos;s life on it  that this was for real.", "light grey oval object travelling at speed/no flashing lights or trails and not bright direction sw/ne/ ..no noisegrey oval shaped object travelling sw to ne across the night sky sometimes through existing light cloud cover. very clear evening. object unlit but grey in colour traversed the sky from the sw crossing the rear of my house towards the ne travelling faster than normal aircraft that we see on a regular basis heading for heathrow london. no flashing lights...no trails but consistant straight direction. whole incident lasted approx 7/8 seconds.", "Rectangular lights, same yellow/green color as fireflies with red flashing light.Thought it was a &apos;swarm&apos; of fireflies.

Before describing the actual details of what happened that night, please allow me to describe the general geographic background.New Delhi, though an emerging cosmopolitan city is still lacks from high rises and military exercises which are anyways apparent during the republic day rehearsal and that too once an year or two in the locality i live in. The gist being, its a calm locality at night where one can see all the stars as clearly as in any other location.Ever since i was a little child, i had always been taking routine walks on my terrace late at night after studies or for a cigarette or two. The time period ranges from any where between 12 AM to 3 AM, with most of the visits occurring after 2 AM.Date: 21st July 2006. Time: Around 0150 hrs.During my yet another late night walk, i saw a huge ball of light emanating from something which looked spherical in its shape. I am not able to describe it&apos;s exact shape, but because of the light that was coming out from it, it resembled a sphere which was on fire. I am totally into astronomy and space sciences and for long have been an observer or night skies, hence, i am completely able to discern a commercial aircraft from something this spectacular.The UFO (as I&apos;ll call it) was spotted on the eastern horizon, almost exactly aligned with my line of sight. It was not a light coming from a Mobile Receiving Station, it was very high up in the sky and was non moving. For once, i decided not to pay any attention as generally i don&apos;t expect such things to crop in New Delhi sky (i thought they could only be a part of lives of people belonging to developed countries) But once it stayed still at its position, different from any air borne object i&apos;ve seen in my whole life, i came to deciphering that it has got to be something Unidentified. i kept a close look at that thing. To describe more about its appearance, it looked like lots of stars have conjoined into one object to emanate a big ball of fire, which some times kept low and sometimes kindled to life again. (By this time, it was already 3 - 4 minutes into the whole phenomenon) Out of anything that came into my mind, i decided to light a cigarette, i went to bring a cigarette from a room which is on my terrace itself, but to my utter amazement, i could now see the same Craft from a big frame less window from that room itself. It had the same properties - stayed still in the air, glowing very very brightly and differently from any other object in the sky. To confirm what i was seeing was the same Craft i saw 4 minutes ago, i rushed back to the same spot where i had spotted it initially. And to my utter amazement - It Was Not There. I went back to that window again. I could now see it brightly staying still in my south - western line of sight. The &quot;thing&quot; had almost covered more than half of New Delhi within seconds of its appearance and disappearance. I rushed to the stairs to call my father and by this time i could see the &quot;thing&quot;&apos;s light going down slightly. But when i bought my father upstairs to witness the phenomenon, it was not there.Date: 22nd July 2006. Time: ~ 2315 hrs My little reported seeing exactly the same kind of Craft (that is today at the time of writing this) of exactly the same appearance and at exactly the same position.

It was a full moon and we simultaneouly saw a light appear, move and stop about 15,000 feet above downtown Phoenix. The easiest way for me to explain its movement is to have you hold your extended arm straight out in front of you, then hold your thumb and index finger about four inches apart - that is how far this thing move in a second, after appearing out of nowhere. After acting like a satellite, it just stopped and hovered in the same spot for 20-30 minutes. We had convinced ourselves that we imagined it before it moved about the same distance in downward and behind a desert tree. Before moving, two airplanes with navagational lights passed over the orb, and Phoenix at approx. 30,000 feet. The orb was a good 5 miles from us. The round, glowing craft had colors &quot;scanning&quot; around it which reflected off what seemed like a mist around it. Two of the lights coming from the orb appeared to scan a wide swath around my friend and I. The first was a bluish color that was wide and tall, and it moved up and down. The second &apos;beam&apos; was more focused and white, and it seemed to come directly nears us and scan through us in a sideways motion. Pink and red colors were also present in the overall rotational pattern. About that same time, strange noises were coming from the brush on the other side of the cattle-guard, steel fence surrounding the house and pool area. The nearest house was two hundred yards away with open desert and tall brush between houses. On two occasions, and in two different areas, I swore that I could see a blue glow that seemed to be coming from a specific point 100 yards into the brush. The first noise was like a muffled duck call, very quiet and over and over again from different areas. Then the brush moved violently as though something ran through it in one area. Then crackling was heard in another area. The other noise sounded like pieces of hard wood knocking together because something was moving around, or communicating from different areas of the brushy desert - multiple somethings moving around with them around their necks or something. The hair was standing all over my body at that point. My friend concurred. I felt as though I was begin watched from outside the fence by something, much like an animal in the zoo must feel. Then there was a flash (like a camera flash 100 yards away) and all the noise in the brush suddenly stopped. It was deadly quiet! Even the dog quit barking. We joked that the aliens took the dog (it barked again later).  I have since left my friend&apos;s house and have been watching the orb. It is now 12:46 and on the move again. It has now moved two inches straight down and to the right since 12:11 (at least it is straight down the side of my window. By 12:55 it was five inches farther in same direction and then blocked out of my view by highway 202. It looked like it was slowly going west across the city toward Buckeye when I lost it.((NUFORC Note:  A sighting of a genuine UFO, which lasts for almost three hours in the vicinity of a major metropolitan area, is quite unusual.

He then saw an object appear as it cleared the trees and told me to look. When I looked up I saw an object with multi-color lights that faded slowly from one &quot;set&quot; as another set of colored light started to light up. The lights were scattered uniformly all over the bottom of the object as it slowly floated moving west to east until it past over my friend&apos;s house. We were in his back yard when we saw the object. The object was dark other than the colored lights but we could make out it&apos;s silhouette as it floated past the stars. It was a clear warm night and the object appeared to be very high in the sky yet very large and circular although it was difficult to make out exact dimensions. I still remember clearly seeing those colored lights slowly fade from one set to another much like new Christmas lights can. My friend and I went inside and reported what we saw to his mother and then made a drawing of what we saw. My friend may still have the drawing.

The first time was when I awoke I assume in my sleep, a kind of outer body experience is what I call it, to look outside my window to the front lawns.  I noticed that it was a more than an average stary night as if there was no light being generated from Earth to hide the stars, basically it was very clear and the stars seemed closer and larger than usual.  As I looked out, what I describe as a small triangular craft with one round bright white light at the end of each point landed outside the front of my house.  It was totally silent.  I noticed the texture of this craft, which was a pure black and a shiny material, quite outstanding.  Whatever it came for, it stayed for some 5 minutes, then took of again and as quickly as it came.  Now we have all heard about people who have whitnessed triangular craft before, but after deliberation, some I am sure have been lucky enough to whitness these strange phenomena, I beleive.  Either way, as so many claim to of seen these triangular craft with simular descriptions across the world to what I have whitnessed, there appears or must be something behind it, rather than the scientists claiming it may be a trick of the mind, or a weather phenomena, which I beleive is an insult to the intellegence of the average person.  Why would someone make up and go into such great details, and why so many people?.  To  gain attention?, I think not, not in my case and I am sure not in many other cases. Now last night, what I can only describe as a larger triangular ship that can only be from the same means, whatever it is was hovering above my house.  But this time, it did not land, and it was at least 5-6 times larger than the one I had seen previously several years earlier.  It was the same material for sure, was the same shape, and I suppose as mad as this sounds the only way I can describe this shape, as being something like the US military would design going on maybe a larger stealth bomber style maybe?.  I was not scared of this, felt at great ease and I was allowed to observe this craft which I am obviously in awe off and honoured to off been allowed to view as it was quite magnificent. This is one of many strange experiences that have happened to me since I was around the age of 5 years old when I have experienced a number of major outer body experiences &quot;OBE&apos;S&quot; I beleive people call them, such as waking up within my sleep I assume?, and being unable to turn lights on and feeling either the energy of mother nature making its buzzing present, or an unknown force nearby etc, etc, if that makes any sense.  But from 2001 they had been more prominent in my life, where seeing and doing stuff out of the norm such as (spinning into pure light, and being helped and guided to the exact spot in order to do this by what I call the &quot;unknown force&quot;, whether mother nature or other?) seemed to happen on a regular basis.  I am far as I am concerned, this is one of a number of unexplained things that have happened to me and I am convinced others have the same ability, or have experienced simular phenomena, which I have tried hard to understand, but I still have not quite got to grasp with what it is I have been whitnessing through my life, whether I am simply going mad, or whether there really has been something aiding me through my life in general, or something trying or has been communicating with me?.  One thing it has given me is faith and belief in myself which has made me a far stronger person for it.  Is this simply a mind thing, am I mad, or have I genuinely whitnessed something out of this world?. Also is it possible that one can gain information about future technological breakthroughs via the subconscious mind?, before they have happened or been discussed, such as Fusion technology to name just one, even though one had no knowledge of this before?. I realise this mail is somewhat jumbled and may look like jargon to many of you.  But remember, when these things happen to people, to explain them in a mail is harder than you think. I am open to suggestions and I have not made my final decision as to what I think it is.", "Some light or fireball hovering over a small townMe, some family members and friends were outsided talking about of the day of the dead like what is done in our mexican culture. I cant remember the exact day but i know for sure it was no so far away from holloween. Well, the 7 of us were talking in front of a friends house, from this view we could see another town across which is like less than a mile away and we can have a good view of the whole town. Since i was the only guy there i was just standing near the entrance door. There was steps in the entrance door so when i was standing on these stairs near the door i had a way better view of the town and the road the travels along the side of the town. Since my friends were talking aobout some spooky stuff, i wasnt paying attention. At this point i was just standing by the door looking around everywhere and mostly directly to the other town. Forgot to mention that the town i was looking at was San Miguel Tecuitlapa. My parents home town has a name but i rather not give it. I was looking around everywhere. Sky was dark with stars in the sky, cold, little bit of breeze. During this month, there is usually alot wind and is very cold doesnot rain is like dry cold and in the mornings there is always alot of fog then fades away like at 10 am. But at night its all clear. Since i was standing up all the time, i sat down, i could still see the town from my position, then i started wondering again, trying to keep warm, and for some reason i turned to that town i had an urge to look, i saw a light. First i thought it was the towns radio guy, since his big speaker sticks out and has a flasing light(only turns the light on when he is on standby and has important anouncments to make to the town, which is rare). But i double checked and the light was right above the town cuz, first it wasnt blinking and second there was no blinking light on the anoncers house. i king of just like didnt care at first. But the light was there for 2 min already and i started to wonder. than i told everyone else about it and started looking. They started talking about what the light is, like legends and stuff, that that like is a witch and stuff. I told them &quot;no it cant be, why would a witch stay hovering like that for more thatn 2 min, thats an easy target for any sharpshooter around there&quot;, and everyone kept quite. everything was quite, no breeze, sky was clear, cold, then i started telling them &quot; its a UFO,but be quite lets observe very well. Dont freak out okay&quot; and so we were mostly quite just whispering. The object was moving slowly and didnt move alot its just move probobly like 200 ft at most. We were still whispering and all of us were just looking at it, didnt move our eyesight from that point. Suddenly it just disapeared. JUst faded. The light just faded as in a light bulb turns off when u turn of the lights. got small and disappeared. Everyone freaked out everyone went to their houses exept me. I stayed with my friend at the door, i just stood their.............had goosebumps....my friend asked me if i was okay...i said yeah im good........im going home lol......i got home connected my camera. Now i have the best room in the whole housei get the view of pretty much the whole town i live in, i can see San Miguel, this other town called Santa Ana, part of San Juan Atenco, the road that travels along San Miguel.........so i stood by my window for a while and nothing.... That was it i was hoping to see it again and record it but no .....nothing...... Reminder: Almost all towns are surrounded by thousands of acres of crops..Around San miguel there isnt much, but on the back of the town there is lots of hills with alot of green. Behind our town there are alot of big hills and lots of crops, lots of trees and really dark at night. Around San Juan atenco there are alot of Fields of Corn around there that widespread all the way to Santa Ana. Our town has historic places....like two old Ranches that were big before.

It&apos;s very particular, the way it was going : I don&apos;t think that there was any engine in the object, the propulsion was very weird, like if it was just gently glide, but fast!  I don&apos;t know how to explain it in another way (in french it would be easier). It was going like something floating firmly in a particular way (to the west).

What I remember the most about this event, is the strange feeling of &quot;something weird&quot;, you know.  It wasn&apos;t a birds flew, because at the end, those should go scatter, not disappear.

I work the night shift and when I came home, I noticed I needed to get milk for the kids in the morning and went outside to go to the local gas station to get a gallon.  I forgot my wallet and began going inside the house.  I had just peeked up towards the south sky for a second and thought I had seen a satellite or fireball at first moving across the sky. I took a couple of steps back to see around my roof line by my front porch and noticed not only 1 large star, but one small one directly under it and moving exactly with it. Measurements are hard to describe but it must have been low and very large as I will explain. As it moved east slowly, I noticed it must have been a solid object since it would block out other stars in between the two star type lights. It suddenly stopped and began going south, now directly in front of me, and as the lights seemed to dim and become closer and go up higher , the more stars would show around it so I know it was moving upwards and away from me at the same time. The size must have been huge although I cannot honestly say how big. We don&apos;t have any type of blimps, laser displays or anything of the sort here as it is a small area with mostly woods and a lake. The only example I can give is to look at the two end stars on the cup of the big dipper as that was &quot;aproximately&quot; the distance between them, and picture those two stars moving in unisen sideways. There was no noise at all, not even a whoosh or anything, like it was gliding in a sound proof room.

I was laying down on my lawn looking up at the stars and wondering about how nice it would be if the city removed the street lamp from in front of my house that way there wouldn&apos;t be that glare interferring with my view of the stars when I saw an unlit object traveling north.  At first I thought it was a balloon but it was traveling too fast and too straight for a balloon, plus there was no wind blowing at all for it to be a balloon traveling that fast. I started thinking maybe it was just a rock formation of some sort floating through the sky because surely if it was an aircraft I would have seen some sort of light. It was very faint but I could barely pick it out with my vision and there is no doubt in my mind that it was moving. I called my wife but she couldn&apos;t hear me so I decided not to tell her afterall for she might think I was nuts. Plus when my focus returned to the object I could not longer find it in the dark sky. But soon after I saw another (I would say 10 minutes after). I chirped my friend on the Nextel and luckily he was on the line immediately. I chirped him because he is the type of guy who has a telescope for the stars and is all in to aircrafts and knows about Astronomy somewhat. I told him what I had seen and asked him to check the sky. Of course nothing else could be seen for a while until I seen another to the east of where I was at and I couldn&apos;t pinpoint the coordinates to him from my house in time for him to see it. Realize that after a minute or so it became lost in the haze of the darkness. I was trying to explain to him to where the object was in relation to certain bright stars but it was difficult to explain since I know nothing of Astronomy. I thought Orion was out and according to him the 3 stars I was looking at was not Orion so we were lost for a while. Until we established two points of reference in the sky the 3 stars which I thought was Orion was the secondpoint and the first point was the brightest star to the East with two faint stars which sort of formed a triangle. So time passed and eventually he had a couple of friends visit him and I could hear them in the background and then like at 10:30ish I saw another object, also traveling north that coincidently was crossing right by the first point of reference which we had established and that was the brightest star to the East of the second point of reference. This one however we both saw. I chirped him on the Nextel and asked him to look at the first reference point and apparently all the guys who were with him also looked up at that exact time and saw what I had been seeing, except this was the fourth one that I had seen and only their first. One of the other guys that was there said immediately that it was a satellite. And they unanimously agreed that it must have been a satellite but I still had my doubts. The fourth one did something different than the first 3. Since the fourth one passed right through my first point of reference (the brightest star)the object seemed to get brighter as it passed right by the point of reference. It seemed to reflect the brightness of that star and as it passed it the darkness began to swallow it up as it again grew fainter and fainter and finally disappeared. We then began a big discussion on satellites and the speed they travel and how many there are as if we knew what we were talking about and to make a long story short I still have my doubts because I could not Identify this object, thus making it a UFO for me. If you could identify it then I guess it will no longer be a UFO but the fact is I saw what I saw.That&apos;s it. I hope my info could help solve other mysteries or clear misconceptions.

I had a hard time finding the objects in the sky again, as they were so high up, and so small.  Finally, we located them.  We watched the three that were in triangular formation change positions and were no longer flying in a triangle.  My neighbor started counting all the &quot;dots&quot; and counted at least eight! They kept on changing positions, moving to the left or to the right. We noticed some in pairs (briefly, then they&apos;d change position again) They looked about the same size as a satellite, that you see at night.The speed they were traveling across the sky was about the same speed as a satellite travels as well (maybe a bit slower).  They were flying from the NW to the SE. We were able to watch them for a minute or two before they were not visible to the naked eye any longer. We heard no noise, and they did not leave a contrail.

The size and shape of this triangle remained constant, with the balls at each &quot;tip&quot;.  The sun was reflecting off the balls and also the &quot;lines&quot;.  The lines also seemed to glimmer in the sun, as if irridesant. This object appeared to be drifting slowly in a southern direction, coming across the tree tops into a clear sky.  It moved so slowly that it appeared to not have propulsion for movement.  I knew this object was moving because of the treeline, but I would not have recognized the movement without this point of reference.  The triangle was moving very slowly and still humming. This sound was very deep, vibrating in my stomach and ears.  There was a very slight breeze moving the tree tops back and forth.  I watched this object 5-7 mins.

After the games, my cousin and I went out for a walk in my street, it was about 9-10 pm. Just about 2 houses away from my house, something from the sky caught my eye. I looked up and I saw 2 spheres(?), can&apos;t clearly classify it because the objects were far away, however they were clearly visible due to their illumination. After spotting the objects, I looked at my cousin, in which he was staring at it in the same amazement as well. Having to be skeptics of everything, i quickly suggested that it was an airplane or star of some sort. However, my theory was proven false after 10 minutes of staring at the objects. See, we&apos;ve always noticed that airplanes have blinking lights, however these objects did not have any. Another thing, these objects moved in a wierd manner that they were like chasing each other. Also, after moving fairly fast, (unfamiliar to our eyes )they would just stay in place and be stationary for a minute or 2. Later they would resume moving around. Having to be a bit scared, my cousin and I were satisfied that these were UFO&apos;s. However, it doesnt stop here. After 10 minutes, the objects would suddenly dissappear in a flash, either they migrated in the speed of light, or they just turned off all their lights. So my cousin and I were looking everywhere, and still no sign(let me note, it was a clear night no clouds). 30 seconds or a minute later, they would reappear again and do the same routine, they would chase each other around and then stop all of a sudden and hover in the air. However it gets even wierder, one of the objects shoots some kind of light(laser), in which the light dissappears after a while it has been shot. We were thinking, that either the object shot the light towards the other object, or towards the ground, i don tknow, because like i said the light dissappears after a while it travels in the air. After all this they become stationary again, and all of a sudden one of the objects flashes away into the sky, and the other one follows. (again in such a speed, not familiar for us to observe). The whole siting took about 20 minutes, and those 20 minutes were standing in the same exact spot that we were, when we first spotted them.

I am quite familiar with this highway as I live in Hutchinson, not far away.  At approximately 18:20 I saw three very bright amber lights in the sky to my right and ahead of me.  At first I figured them to be on an airplane approaching for landing in Wichita, but then realised that these lights were not on the normal landing path, and also over several seconds and then minutes, did not move.  The lights were evenly spaced with the one on the left being a bit lower. The highway slants to the left (north-west) at the place of this sighting (near Moundridge), so I figured them to be somewhere west of McPherson at the time. They were lite up when I first saw them so I do not know their total duration, but after about 20 minutes I watched as the one in the center went out, then the one on the right, and a couple of seconds later the last (lower) one went out.  During this event I phoned a couple of knowledgable friends asking about the colors of flares, and this orange/amber colr was not a typical flare color. I then proceeded north and a few minutes later, four more lights appeared, spaced evenly as before with one slightly lower than the other three.  These may have been there for some time before I saw them.  This time the highway was going straight north so I could see that these lights were over the city of McPherson.  I then rolled down my driver&apos;s side window and reached for my digital camera and began pointing and shooting in the direction of these lights.  During the photos, I saw something dark brush me directly in front of me.  As I approached the Highway 56 exit, the lights began to disappear in the same fashion as the earlier ones that I saw. While sitting at the dock in McPherson getting loaded, I downloaded the photos into my laptop. Most of the photos are jiggly but some of them captured the lights.

The night was clear with millions of stars and also a shooting star. No clouds to be seen. There was heat lighting miles away past the mountains. I didn&apos;t hear any thunder. Just a quite night. My bedroom is on the top floor which has sliding glass doors so I can see everything clearly. I noticed this object which was sort of orangish coming our way. It wasn&apos;t moving like a plane or helicopter so I told my husband to check it out. We were baffled because it was roundish, but not perfectly round and was moving slower than a plane and was about the size between a golf ball and tennis ball. It came closer to the house and I was a little scared because I thought it was coming closer and closer to my window. I almost thought maybe it was a comet at first, but then it turned and went towards the cornfield next to us. I did not see any tail on the object and the way it was moving clearly was not a comet. We watched as it just floated quietly but also had like a wavy bounce to it so it didn&apos;t look like it was traveling perfectly straight. It looked like something that was observing its surroundings. We watched it just floating along just slightly above the treelines as it dissapeared over the treelines so we couldn&apos;t watch it anymore. I was told maybe it was a fireball from the lightning, but the lightning was miles away and this thing was hovering in a bouncy wavy effect for over 5 minutes treeline level traveling slower than I would think a fireball would.

Over a span of the hour and a half these objects moved left, right, up and down while gradually moving NE without breaking their original space in between.

PD))", "I saw several high speed sphere shaped objects with purposeful erratic turning ability , with night vision gogglesIn the early morning hours of the 3rd or 4th of September immediately after hurricane Katrina. I was volunteering my time at the 4th district Police Station in New Orleans. I  was a Paramedic for about 25 years and was CEO of a large EMS until 2004 when I sold the company and was in retirement. The sky was full of stars, there was no power for close to a hundred miles in all directions, everything was pitch black in the City and, the sky was bright. This was the first night any of the military showed up and we started getting additional manpower from ICE and many Police Departments from all over.  I was waiting on the commander,I usually road with him and the Leiutenant. We had two military guys that were there when I arrived. One of them was playing with a Pit Bull puppy that was hanging around the station. He had two night vision goggles with the single scope. I asked if I could try them out and he told me to knock myself out. I looked around a few minutes then turned to the sky. Ihave never seen so many stars in my life the sky was glowing and I was in awe. I was looking to the west nw when I saw what appeared to be a really bright shooting star very high crossing to east se. It crossed the sky within a second or so and it was well east of us when it stopped, made a purposeful movement like a semi circle then shot directly south and disappeared. I was freaking out and couldn&apos;t believe what I saw. It was about the size of a pea with a tiny haze around it when it made the turn it seemed to have a slight distortion in the haze.Almost like a tiny tail. I kept looking in astonishment and I kept seeing them all over the sky. I pulled the night goggles off and I couldnot see them at all. I got to thinking they could be  birds or bugs or maybe a bats. I went near a light run by the generator and with ina few minutes ruled that out. I kept looking in fascination I saw other objects that flew straight over with an angelic glow or or aura, but these looked like they were orbiting. They traveled straight and lower in the sky at a fixed altitude.This I felt confident was a satellite. The UFO&apos;s were completely different,They moved much faster had purposeful movement and made very erratic turns not capable with any aircraft I know of. A captain from a sherrif;s in Iowa was sitting with me and saw them as well, we were taking turns with one pair and he was as amazedas me. About 3 or 4 am some clouds moved in partially blocking the sky.I was looking up and saw one coming from the west when it made sharp turn came directly over them staion  under the clouds, it was huge and fast, it covered my whole feild of vision in the goggles.It moved so fast it was like a blast of light moving over, no wind,no sound.  I tried throughout the night to film it with the google over my camera but it didn,t  work. The cloud cover got thicker and I didn&apos;t see them after that. I am convinced that ! you can probably see these on clear nights with good night vision goggles. I saw too many of them for it to be afluke and I would be interested to know if any one else reports similar experiences.I saw at least fifty of them over a three hour period. I have never seen a UFO before this and I really don&apos;t believe that aliens could reach us if they do exist, but I saw what i saw.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

It made a high pitched screaming sound, we covered our ears because we couldn&apos;t stand the sound of it.  Our car started to go out of control, the car pulled up on the side of the road by itself.  We were panicing, because the object had stopped about 50 feet away from us. Within, a few seconds it took of into the night. My mother and i were really frightened but we started the car and drove home, we didn&apos;t get home till about Midnight.

This particular night, as i was leaving my mothers second floor apartment,on her back porch,(10 ft high)my daughter was comming out to tell me goodbye, i happened to see out of the corner of my eye, a very unusual light comming from the west. It was kind of far away, and i at first thought it to be a plane, but there was no sound yet, and its color was a brillant, bluish/white. It flew towards the southwest(to our left) slowly across the sky. By this time, my mother had planned on walking the dog, and she came out and saw it.It moved so very slow, almost like a plane that was coasting,it seemed too big to be moving that slow to me, especially with no wind currents or sound. Then , it turned east in a path directly towards us. We kept watching, and slowly, very slowly, it moved increasingly forward and got about 20 ft away before i could hear it. It was a&quot;type&quot; of jet engine sound i would say, that is, it had a whine like a jet, but this whine was a very low pitched whine, thats the only way i can describe it.Now its even more desturbing to me, because even though i can hear some sort of engine, it was still too quiet. The engine whine did not match to either the slow speed, or the size. This thing seemed to float in the dark sky. Now that it was about to go over the top of the house, i tryed to make out quickly the shape of the thing before it was gone. For the life of me, i could see no shape in the middle.It just had three lights spanning the front, and three spanning the back. It seemed that between the center of these lights, the shape, or craft moved, i could see something wobbling. Another thing is, when it turned to cross over the top of the house, it didnt turn like a plane, based on the movement of the lights, it seemed to lay on its side, then turn, then lay flat again. All the lights ! blinked in unison, which i knew was wrong from the start, and they were all the same color. For a split second, i thought it might be a blimp, but it moved faster than a blimp, and more jerky and irratic.The sound waves didnt seem to reach the ground like a regular jet does, the whine was up with the craft.Ive talked to a vietnam vet that i work with, and he told me that because a jet cant fly, it has to keep a constant speed of 175mph to stay in the air. This thing cralled.As i drove back to work(east)i looked for the continuance of its path, but it was gone. Later at work i realised that i was so worried about getting a look at the shape that i didnt even see what color the lights were, when i got back from work, i asked my mother, she said orange. The next day, my daughter(13) and i were talking about it, and i mentioned that i asked my mother about the color and what she said, and my daughter agreed. I told her i was upset that i couldnt see a definate shape, and she said she saw it, and it was a disk.

My son and I left our house traveling west bound on seventh standard road  just as the sun was setting, The sun had already dropped behind the mountians, but the sky was still illuminated enough to see. The moon was in the southwest portion of the sky over the city of bakersfield. The moon was halfway between straight up and the horizan, The sky was completely clear. There was enough light from the sunset that you could still makeout a blue tint to the sky. The moon was 1/3 crescent and looked like a giant sized cereal bowl slightly tilted as if it was spilling some of it contents. Thats what attracted my attention to the moon and I said to my son jokenly, Look the moon looks like a cereal bowl, maybe thats what GOD eats his breakfast out of. My son who was 12 years old at the time started asking me some questions about the moon so I pulled off the road to look at the moon safely. We exited the car looked and talked about the moon for 2 or 3 minutes or so and just after I answered his last question. &quot;remember the sky is clear and there is still just enough light to see faint blue sky&quot;.

It was like the cloud/ship? was only visible as it moved in front of the moon and only at the right edge of the moon as it moved across. This is where it really get strange and hard to discribe. As this thing moved from the right side of the moon to the left, as more of it moved in front of the moon it changed from fuzzy dark smoky cloud looking to horizontal lines as it moved across in front of the moon. But the lines where like see through so you could see the moon through it. But you could still make out the lines. It was like this ship, craft whatever it is. Was projecting an image from the outerspace side of it to the earth side of it and was having technical difficulties and not doing a very good job of it. It only seemed to have trouble projecting the moons image, Because before it moved in front of and after it passed the moon it was invisible. As for the size. It must have been huge because it covered the whole moon with its lines/image as it passed. The lines where something like when you get to close to a bigscreen TV. It was like there was a image line then a thinner black line then image line then thin black line etc. The speed seemed slow.

However, the object drifted, and then immediately corrected its position by moving very rapidly in horizontal, vertical, and diagonal fashion.  It did this several times, at times getting much brighter.  Then there appeared to be sparks flashing around/emitting from it in different spaces and at irregular intervals.  It made no noise at all at any time.  I woke my wife (who at first thought I was crazy) and she came outside with me to watch.

We went back inside and re-awoke at 5:00AM (about 45 minutes later while it was still dark out) to find the objects gone.  We have never witnessed anything like this before.

The two lower objects were very bright about -1 magnitude (twice as bright as Vega) and the third object on top was less so. Acoording to my buddy he had observed this for 20 seconds or so trying to determine what it was. As I glanced over at it the top object began to move in a south westerly direction while the other two stayed stationary and very luminus. After five more seconds I raised my 10x50 binoculars to my eyes to get a better look and the two lower lights vanished while the third, top light moved away in a northerly direction.", "Fireball observed in N.

It lasted about two seconds and once the triangle passed the lighted moon surface, I couldn&apos;t see it anymore. It looked, from what I could see, to be just a dark black surface- no lights on the object but with clear lines defining its triangle shape against the lighted surface of the moon.  About 5 minutes later another black triangle moved over the moon&apos;s surface from bottom to top.  This second black triangle moved much quicker, about a second or less, with the same black surface and clear lines.  Approximately 3 minutes later, another black object moved diagonally across the upper left hand side of moon&apos;s surface from left to right, very quickly, faster than the first two objects.  The third object was moving so fast that it looked to be more like a sphere, but with the same deep black color.  It was the color that I could clearly see against the moons surface.  All three objects had clear lines against the backdrop of the moon and dissapeared once they had passed the moons surface.  The first two objects had a clear delineated shape of a triangle against the moon&apos;s surface.

It takes me a couple of days to get back to sleeping normally after I finish a big project.  Since I was up, I decided to take out my telescope and enjoy the full moon.

I leaned my head back to look at the sky, bored, while we were waiting for the light to change. The sky was clear blue, but my eyes immediately fixed onto an object. It was very high in the sky. I couldn&apos;t make out a shape, but it was reflecting light. It appeared stationary in the sky. I tried to determine if there was any movement at all. The light turned green and we rolled forward to the next cross street, Frazee Road. The light was green there so we rolled right on through. I never looked away. I could tell where we were because the road goes uphill from there and turns slightly to the left. I removed my ballcap and tried to keep an eye on the object. I didn&apos;t say anything to my friends because at this point, I was believing this to be one of those food store balloons you usually see at the register. I thought maybe a kid had lost one. Then I saw the object appear to reflect light in two spots, like maybe there was not one but two objects. Still, I thought, maybe they were two balloons tied together. The strange thing was, I couldn&apos;t really tell if the object drifted any. I wasn&apos;t in the best circumstance for viewing them, I realize, and they may have been just balloons, maybe even a weather balloon, but the thing that seemed off to me was that they did seem perfectly still in the sky. *shrugs* Posting it here just in case it was something more and someone else got a better view of it.", "Spinning objects in sky over Pacific Ocean in Lincoln City, OR @ Sea Gypsy Hotel on BeachIt was a wonderful evening on my first trip to the Oregon Coast. I was staying at the Sea Gypsy hotel, which is right on the beach in Lincoln City, OR. I had spent most of my trip just sitting in our room in front of the open window watching waves for hours. My partner had settled into bed, lights off, and I was still sitting at the window drinking coffee. Around 12:30-1:00am I leaned out the window to have a smoke and was looking up at the stars. From the South over the Pacific Ocean I saw what I thought was a bright, large group of stars. As they moved North, I noticed that there were six of these stars, all perfectly 6 pointed in shape, with no tracers from stars look you usually see. There were almost blue they were so white, and WAY more intense that the brighest star. These 6 &quot;stars&quot; were spinning individually, and they all spun in a perfect circle together as if orbiting something. Then all of the sudden they started spinning faster and would rotate from large to small to large to small orbits around this invisible center. It did this while traveling North in a spiral direction. Very hard to describe. Zoomed off faster to the North Pacific and disappeared. I sat there for 2 or 3 more hours and saw nothing like it... although I did see planes and a couple shooting stars, but this was unlike I have ever seen. I get home and tell my sister about this, and she tells me at least 15-20 years ago she and my aunt saw something exactly similar over the open ranges in Eastern Oregon. I know others saw what I saw... I saw 3 people walking on the beach that night, the 1 man alone freaked and yelled up to me to ask if I had seen that too, and he confirmed with the other 2 walkers that they had also seen it. We were not near each other, nor do I know these other witnesses. I also heard from the man at the front desk that other UFO sighting have regularly occured along the oregon coast. Definitely not a plane, rocket, satellie, meteor... or anything else that can be explained! Oh, also I could n! ot see a nything that these may have been attached too, so I don&apos;t know if they were 6 individual or attached to something much large that was invisible to the naked eye!

I had been awakened by the sound of a large animal, possibly an elk, moose, or bear  fording the river about 75 to 100 yards away and got up to see what it was.  My son joined me.  Never saw the animal, but started looking up at the night sky.  It was clear and the stars were bright.  There was a waning moon rising.  Two other objects caught our attention.  One seemed to hover over the south end of the range and the other, off to the left, appeared to be over the central part of the Wind River Mountains.  At first glance  they both looked like stars or planets.  However, both &quot;danced&quot; around a bit, entirely unlike every thing else in the night sky.  These two lights did not act like airplanes.  And the Mountains over which these appeared are over 13,000 feet above sea level, so it was doubtful they where helicopters.  There was no sound except the nearby stream and occasional sounds of wildlife moving around in the willows down by the bridge.  The two odd lights both rapidly changed color; red to blue, to white, to ornge, over and over in very short repetitions.  Now, weeks later, I can&apos;t be sure what order the colors appeared in.  But it was very strange.  We watched for about half an hour, until we just got too tired.  We had a big day hike planned for later that morning, and needed to get some sleep.

They were actually at 2 different times. Also I need to point out that I live close to an air force base. There are times when I&apos;ve seen obvious unknown military planes and one would suspect these as being &quot;UFOs&quot;. As we all know, not everything seen can be said to be from another planet. The first object i saw was in the middle of a large amount of air traffic. I was in the backyard taking my dog out and happened to noticed how much air traffic was flying over. There are several distinctive paths where the airlines fly and over the years I&apos;ve come to know where in they sky they usually are. There was plane after plane. Probably about 5 minutes apart in sightings. All of a sudden there was this one object that came across the sky in a totally odd flight path. It had lighting like what you see when several windows of a commercial plane is glowing. There was probably 8 double windows down the side. It sort of had a banana shape to it actually. There were no other lights. No red blinking light underneath. No landing geat lights either. Just these lights. It seemed to hold some reflection from the ground as there was a slight glow. Not a glow as if it were from the object, but just reflected up from the ground. It didn&apos;t really have a feel that it was flying straight either. I got a sense of a &quot;tumbling&quot; while watching it. It went over in an &quot;S&quot; shape too. It came from the north flying southwest, then southeast, then back southwest. It was wide curves and not sudden direction changes. I couldn&apos;t say there was no sound either as there was still many other planes flying over. The second object came a few hours later. I decided to go back out to see if I could see something else. Just something you do I guess when you see an object like that. Sort of a hope that you see it again I guess. As I was looking up I noticed a &quot;star&quot; out of place straight over head. I know the constellations pretty well so I knew this light shouldn&apos;t be there.

It kept travling the same path and became dimmer and dimmer as it move toward the Earth&apos;s shadow. It was just like a satellite in everyway, just extremely slow. The complete time of seeing this object would be around 12 - 15 minutes. Both of these object could easily have other explainations rather than &quot;UFO&quot;. They are UFOs though in the sense that I had no clue what they were. I don&apos;t think any other regular average person could have said either. But I thought this was worth reporting. I would have sent info in sooner but I had teken pictures of the first object and was trying to get something to show up. I used a digital camera and had the settings wrong.

She was the first who accidentally photographed invisible UFO that was following the plane. Eugenia Kazarinova saw nothing but a beautiful landscape outside the illuminator, but when she took several photos she noticed strange lights on them. She was worried and showed the photos to other passengers. They began to take photos using their cameras and mobile phones. The strange lights were present on almost all the photos. The passengers became panic stricken because the lights didn&rsquo;t look like another plane and couldn&rsquo;t be seen with the naked eye. Today experts can&rsquo;t give any official explanation of this strange phenomenon. Some of them say that it could be the reflection of the plane but the photos reject this hypothesis.

Im 49 yeas of age and  I have live very close to Nellis afb for the past 15 years. Within the past 5 years I have been a regular night sky watcher . While things have been real slow the past 2 years ,it certainly was not the case 3-4 years ago . But I still take time to view at least once or twice a week .That being said , While laying on my back looking and scanning skyward ( I use nite vision due to so much light pollution here and I have managed to darken the street lamps around my location ) expecting at best to view a few satellites or un explained light movements since it is extremly hard to distinguish shape and form at the usual distance I encounter as  I work the sky  in quadrants I was totally taken back when from the NNE I caught the outline of a V shape closing in. At that initial distance I thought it was a repeat of the diamond formation of four indivisual craft That I viewed 3 years earlier ,As it became closer I realized it was a single craft, very large, how large I cannot say as I had no reference pointsbut easily seen with scope  sillouetted against a las vegas night sky . B-2 was a quik second guess as it had more ov a delta shspe but this was quickly elimanated as it passed directly overhead it was more delta shaped leaning more to a boomerrang -V shaped another thing that i found aerodynamically strange was one side being slightly more elongnated than the other, there seem to be darker pod shapes under each side (wing??) still no lights and no sound and no contrails of any kind and was not on a glide slope of any kind as it was definitly under its on power. Also never has there been any commercial traffic use this path that I can recall in all my years here . Its speed seem to be at a pretty good clip my guess is at least 400 knots but hard to say as I had very little reference points as to size, height  only that it covered f! rom my i nitial sighting which was approx 20 deg above the north horizen (darker sky &amp; better viewing) to where I lost sight as it approached the more lit up sky over the strip approx 11 mi away in about 40  to 45sec .

In the center of the town is Offut Air Force Base, so perhaps the crafts that I have been seeing are somehow military-related. Lately, me and several people I know have been seeing strange lights in the sky. The first occurence happened on probably about the tenth of august. My friend was in a park with his girlfriend, and they were staring at the sky, looking at stars that were out. Suddenly, their attention was drawn to a bright light that was hovering in the sky. It seemed to dance around in the sky for a few minutes. My friend then noticed several aircraft approaching the light. The light then took off directly into the sky and dissappeared from sight. The aircraft that had chased the light away then flew a grid in the sky and flew off out of sight. Since this date, Me, my girlfriend, the two people stated above, and two of my other friends have seen strange shape-changing craft in the sky, all sightings occured on the same road, Harlan Lewis road, known as Base Lake road to the locals. The first occurence I witnessed was on about the 18th of august. Me and my girlfriend were driving home and making a turn onto Harlan Lewis Road. We saw a helicopter approaching in the distance. As we drew closer to the helicopter, we thought it was changing shape. We were soon driving under this aircraft, which now resembled an X with several flashing lights on it. It stayed as this shape only while directly above us, then changed into the shape of an Airplane, and it changed the pattern of its flashing lights. The second occurence what on the 23rd of august, when me, my girlfriend, and two of my other friends were driving down Harlan Lewis Road. One of my friends pointed out a helicopter that was flying not too far from us. It then flew behind some trees, out of view, and when it emerged from the other side of the trees, it had changed into the shape of an airplane, and also changed its light pattern and color. The other friend in the car didnt pay any attention to the sky during this, so he never saw anything. But everyone who did see it was 100% convinced that the aircraft changed shape. Also, all of the described objects above made no sound at all, as a plane or helicopter would.", "Bright Copper Glowing Object, emits burst of light and debris or object is deployed and falls toward northern Orange CountyMy significant other and I were going to a friends house in the city of orange, as we were knocking their door, I looked up to check out the moon on the southern sky. (I Had read the day before in the &quot;Orange County Register&quot; that a European Satellite was being made to crash land on the moon and that the Impact Flash would be seen from Orange County) Since I did not see anything different with the moon, I scanned the whole night sky for any stars or planes or any other peculiar object. To my surprise, I saw a bright Star just north of 90 degrees (from the top of my head)  At first I thougt it Was Mars or Jupiter because It gave out a really bright orange, almost Copper like Glow. As I watched it, all of a sudden it got really bright, and then it seemed to have had a burst of light from one side, and something like fire or some debris seemed to be expulsed from it and began to freefall, and as it did, it began to loose its glow. If you ever seen fireworks as the sparks began to freefall and loose their fire glow, that is almost what it looked like, but this definitely was thousands of feet up in the air. My Significant other saw it too, and she thought it was high enough to have been a satellite, but neither of us have seen a satellite that stays static up in space.  I don&apos;t know if this bright object that we saw, was deploying another object or if it had been hit by something else causing it to be damaged and loose material from it. this happened just in a matter of seconds, by the time it was over, my friend had opened the door, and when we looked up again it was gone.

We had left Parker on the Calif/Arizona border and were on Hwy 62 going toward Desert Center and I-10. It was midweek and late at night, so there was no traffic at all and very dark night.Coming toward us over the road and from above, came a very fast large white light that swooped down at our car and then straight back up.  It was moving so fast it trailed light as it went. It made no sound and it arched sharply as it went back up as it approached the car.  We both leaned forward over the dash to try to see it as it went up.  It happened so quickly, but we stopped the car immediately and got out. We could see quite a distance around us, but it was already gone in a matter of seconds.  Over the years, I did the usual guessing &quot;it must have been a top secret government plane, etc&quot;  But as a reasonable person today, I know for a fact that there is nothing today that could move like that, and certainly nothing that many years ago.  I am convinced that the UFO spotted a single light moving in what must have been a vast amount of ground darkness and came down and buzzed us to see what we were.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

We were returning home from seeing a movie, and we were driving westward on New Scotland Rd, Albany, NY to our home in Slingerlands, NY.  I commented to my wife that &quot;the plane&quot; outside the car was flying really low.  This also seemed odd because the object was is not in the normal flight path of planes coming to or leaving from the Albany International Airport. I slowed down my car, turned off the radio and put the windows down.  It was surprisingly quiet, emitting a sound that was similar to a jet engine from far away, but the object was very close.  It was either moving very slowly or hovering in one location.  My wife commented that we were traveling faster than the object and I would estimate that my speed at the time was around 30 mph. The object was in the general shape of a plane.  It had 2 &quot;headlight&quot; like lights in the front of it, that were emitting beams that could be seen in the overcast skies.  There were several other points of light along what looked like its wing and also several points of light along the fuselage.  The object&apos;s &quot;headlight&quot; beams were pointing in an eastward direction. The object was just too bizarre so we had to stop and pull over.  I pulled the car into the lot of a private school, Albany Academy of the Holy Names.  The parking lot curved back towards the east and at that point the object began flying away.  It disappeared from our sight in several seconds, most likely less than 10 seconds.  It appeared to be heading in an eastbound direction. We waited approximately a minute and we could not see or hear the object.  I turned the car around in the parking lot and headed back towards New Scotland Rd.  Just before we turned right onto the road (heading west towards our home), we saw the object very far away heading in a northbound direction.

She said she had seen the flashes of light the night before but did not want to tell me, because I might think she was insane. so i stood out looking over the ocean for about 10-15 min. then i saw what apeared to be a redish flash of light come on then go off within a second or so, i at first thought it was a plane, then i saw the same light apeare a little bit to the left of the last light then fade out now i thought it was just a plane moving to the north, but within a few minutes i saw the same light again in the exact same spot as the first light to the south.(let me add that the ball of lights themselfs do not move) next i saw someting that really freeked me out, the light to the north lit back up with three other lights almost apearing out of eachother. then i thought how the hell can a plane move from the south to the north then back to the south and then back to the north giving birth to two other objects all within a few minutes. this sighting of either a ufo or a plane realy scared me and my mother. me and my family have been visiting myrtle beach for years and now own a house on the beach an we both have never seen anything quite like this, and by reading other reports of these sightings in the area we would love to know what caused these flashes of lights over the ocean? we have asked family members that have spent their lives in the airforce and do not know of any aircraft that can emite these types of lights.

(i later found out that shirley mc claines &quot;center&quot; is there and they confirmed the sighting, which makes it less or more credible but i&apos;m unsure of which)as soon as we reenteered the freeway we saw a huge cone shaped foggy light approx 300 ft wide at the base. it was loosley defined in shape and was surrounded by a white foggy mist although it did maintain the shape of a cone/christmas tree throughout the event duration. we pulled off at the next rest stop (maybe 3 minutes farther north) and got out to watch it. one car pulled off, threw away a soda can, and left without looking. a truck driver was parked and out polishing his grill (at night?) with his back to it. at the top was a single point of light that seemed stationary but was then shot off like on a rubberband. we then drove north to trinagulate it&apos;s position, size and shape and exited several times to do so. we were able to determine that it was very large and was centered just slightly north over the munds park exit, slightly north of the freeway onramp on the west side if going north on I 17. at one exit we pulled off to get closer for more details and a truck passed us coming out of a dead end dirt road. we then turned around and crossed the highway to the east side of 17 and drove up to see the object from a higher vantage point. we then got back in the car and rushed to pull off at our exit, kachina village, we went into the small convenience store. the clerk was overwhelemd as the police scanner was processing tons of calls. when we arrived home a few minutes later, i phoned our local npr station at nau and was told other reports were being ca! lled in.at approx 6am the following morning a formation of seven black helicopters flew very low over our home in the direction of the sighting. they came form the north. it was later said to have been a launch at vandenburgh afb BUT both of us are from california and have seen MANY launches. this was not a launch. we later confirmed (to absolutley convince ourselves with proof by comparing what we saw to an actual launch as seen from the excat same location) we further validated this by taking a friend to the launch which the three us witnessed from the munds park rest stop in jan 99. it confirmed that what we saw in oct was definately not a launch from vdb afb, not even close. the person at npr relayed this answer/info to us the next day (10/9/99). my immediate feeling was that most who saw this would be convinced by this explanation hereby redecuing a majority of reports. the clerk at the store said that as the reports continued that evening on her scanner, the sighting was reported from as far south as phx and as far north as the utah border. several times after the event we attempted to get to the exact location but were unable to do so. for years now i have waited to see another report on this date and have decided to share now for clarification and/or coinciding info or events. as much as 40 minutes after the sling shot effect, we could still see the north end of the mist from our home. the oddest part was that the mist hung in the air and stayed in a loosely shaped cone for more than 45 minutes as it slowly disspated. this is the first and last time i&apos;ve seen this type of event. i will file a report about another incident near corvalis or, in 1996, where a triangle formation was surrounded by a bluish mist before it disappeared. lastly, i will file a report for may 10, 2004 which occurred at la cienega lake on the white mountain apache reservation. it was three lights in a triangle formation but as there was no occlusion we determined there were three seperate objects/lights. they may have been the NOSS! sat&apos;s h owever it differed from other possible NOSS sat sightings reported to you. i noticed today that az had alot of sightings in june 2004 and for ours there were 4 sane witnesses. again, we &quot;felt&quot; compelled to be at this particular spot and time to see something and indeed we did.", "using f4.5 13.1 inch reflector telescope with a wide angle 40mm ocular obseving beehive star cluster 2am thursday august 16 2006. into field of vision fast moving object was able to track toward horizon.

I was driving home from shopping at an all night supermarket and noticed some very bright lights ahead about the height and intensity of stadium lights.  That location did not have any such lights so I presumed some may have been added.  The night was very dark - I don&apos;t recall if it were overcast or just dark, but I could not see anything but this panel of lights in the distance.  As I neared the lights, which were just barely to my left and very high I looked out my window and tried to see them better.  When I looked up it seemed as if I were looking at the bottom of something, but I couldn&apos;t tell because it was so dark.  I could not even make out a shape; I only could see this row of lights and darkness behind them.  I drove by very slowly with the window down.  No noise and no movement came from it.  I decided to come back the next day to see why/where lights had been erected.  I drove to my home in the town up the road.  As I drove up the cross street to my street I was shocked to see these same lights moving very slowly up my street, perpendicular to my car.  They were about 20 feet in the air; they clearly were not on the ground.  I stopped the car, opened the window and turned off the car lights and engine.  I watched these strange lights go to the end of my street, across the street I was on, and continue over the field on the other side.  The object produced no sound at all the entire time I watched it.  I was totally spooked by this time and drove into my garage as quickly as I could.  The next day I went back to where I thought lights had been erected and found nothing but an empty field with a few trees.  Strangely enough, three months later I came down with cancer.  Years later I was watching a UFO report where an entire town sited a UFO.  They cont! acted a nearby air traffic controller who could not see the UFO on radar, but could see it with his naked eyes.  The description the controller gave of the lights and the representative drawing showing the orientation of the lights were identical to what I saw.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I pulled up at my House Outside of Craig, CO. at apx. 3:00am.  When i pulled up to my driveway and got outa of my suv, i noticed a unusual beam of light to the west shining over the Rockies. The light changed from white to a bright purple color and strobed like a strobe light changing colors. Than about two mins later the light stopped flashing and faded in a unreal way. Just thought I would share what I have seen. Have a good Day!((ADDENDUM FROM READER))upon reading the report of a UFO sighting in Craig colorado on September the second 2006 I can not but find trouble with this report. I was born and raised in Craig Colorado and now reside in Southern Illinois. In the report the subject claimed &quot;i noticed a unusual beam of light to the west shining over the Rockies.&quot; Now as a former resident of this town, and someone to have knowelge in geography, the Rockie Mountains are to the East of Craig, and not to the west. Now the writer may have meant hey noticed the lights to the West of the Rockie Mountains, and not to the West of Craig, but I don&apos;t know for I wasn&apos;t there. I do know when I lived out there I whitnessed UFO&apos;s, it was a green streaking glowing light travlening from the North to the south, so I&apos;m not trying to say the individual didn&apos;t say anything, but may his directions were wrong. If I wouldn&apos;t have seen something with my own eyes there I would say he is crazy, so I hope with this either he re-thinks where he say the lights, or if he saw anything at all.

I thought that it might crash onto Veirs Mill Road!  It was moving slowly as it crossed the road, which caught my attention, as I&apos;d never seen anything like this before .  I saw 3 white lights on the bottom of the aircraft, no red/yellow/or green lights, just 3 white ones.  The craft looked to be triangle in shape, and not very tall.  it looked like a flat triangular object. To the west of me (on University Blvd) were 2 radio communication towers.  I watched this aircraft fly slowly towards the 2 towers.  It made a sharp right turn and faced the towers.  There it hovered for a few seconds, as if it was trying to maneuver the craft around the towers.  The aircraft lifted straight up and then flew over the towers.  It then made another sharp right turn (which I didn&apos;t think was possible with modern aircraft) and flew several feet.  It then made another sharp left turn and took off quickly into the night sky.  This all happened within a matter of a few minutes, while I waited for the light to change.  I wanted to get out of my car and ask the folks around me if they saw it too.  But I was dumbstruck by the whole thing, so I didn&apos;t get out and ask anyone.  I did keep pinching myself while watching this and telling myself that I wasn&apos;t dreaming.  After I got home I told my husband about it.  He fully believed what I was telling him because, as he told me, &quot;I know that you don&apos;t believe in aliens and UFOs...so for you to say that you saw something like this, I believe that you did.&quot;  Of course, others thought I was nuts and asked if I had been drinking or was stoned.  I was neither of these things, but I know what I saw.  I&apos;m not saying that it was a spacecraft filled with little green men, but it was something weird.  I brushed it off as some kind of highly-classified aircraft based out of Andrews Airforce Base, which is in the Washington-area.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

There&apos;s no flashing lights and it&apos;s at an altitude much higher than even a military aircraft...like I asked before, it seems to be at the same altitude as a satellite but I don&apos;t think a satellite can make turns that quickly or move side to side as it&apos;s tracking across the sky. The first time we saw it was the night of the Perseud meteor shower and then again about two weeks later. It came from due north and was moving towards the south but when it got almost directly overhead, it took a sharp turn to the southeast. The second time we saw it, it stayed on a &quot;straight&quot; course but started to zig zag very rapidly for about two or three minutes. Once again, there are no flashing lights on it and it looks to be very, VERY high up. It&apos;s about the same size of any average, very bright star in the night sky and we&apos;ve only noticed it (twice) in the wee hours of the morning.

When I noticed it a mile or to later it was in the same place in my passenger side window. When I noticed it again it seemed as though it was flashing once in one spot next second many miles away. Then a few miles south of I-94 I noticed it remained in one spot perhaps one hundred yards above a farmfield. It no longer looked like only a small blue flashing light but hundreds of times larger and every time it flashed I could clearly see a massive square structure made up of transparent tubes of a variety of sizes at the bottom.

I was telling coworkers about what I experienced when I was nine years old at my elementary school about my UFO sighting.  One of my coworkers went on your website and found where someone else had reported basically the same thing that I experienced.  This happened at school and from memory it was called Crestview Elementary School and was in Opa Locka, Florida.  This happened in 1966 from my recollection.  We were in school and all of a sudden our teacher told us to be very quiet and not get up from our seats.  It seemed like we were sitting there forever, when finally I began to see Military men with Air Force hats (caps) on walking around outside our classrooms.  They came from the Homestead Air Force Base.  I was told that later.  I remember that finally they allowed the kids who walked home or rode bikes home were allowed to leave the school.  As I was leaving I remember looking to the North by the playgrounds and looking up towards the street light and saw a shiny silver disk shaped saucer (ufo) by the street light.  I remember my mom asking me why I was home from school early and I told her to call the school that they sent us home early. One block over from us lived the Science teacher who had her classroom in the portables in the playground.  My mom talked to her and she said that if you hear that something landed next to the portable that it was true.  She said that she was worried about her job so she wasnt suppossed to talk about it so that is why she told my mom that if she heard about something landing at school it was true but did not come right out and tell her that that is what happened. I wanted to assure the person who reported this to you on 7/15/2004 if they are still looking for someone who remembers this incident, I do.  Just like they said, it seemed exciting to us, but I was scared also.  Probably because of the appearance of so many military men in our hallways at school.  I seem to think that something was printed in the paper about this being a weather balloon. I agree with the other person who reported this incident to you about the military doesn&apos;t evacuate schools due to weather balloons and they would not seem worried as they seemed to be to me. I would like to be able to talk to this person who also reported this same incident to see if anything else strange like this has happened to them over the years.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

My immediate, knee-jerk response was that it was a shooting star, but the object was good-sized (round, white though not overly bright, shaped something like a small but distant moon) and didn&apos;t disintegrate, but kept moving intact across the window.  I was sitting on the sofa with a friend, saw the object at first out of the corner of my eye, and ran immediately to the deck on the west side to try to see more of it.  I live in the mountains in the Santa Fe Nat&apos;l Forest and so what I saw on the deck was through several trees.  The object was moving north, into the forest, and by the time I reached my deck it was no longer a pale round object but was something bright, elongated (rectangular like a train with segmented/lighted windows), and it seemed quite close.  My friend also saw this (though she did not see the round object through the window because she was sitting with her back to it).  I want to add that I am one of the most rational people on the planet, have never given much creedence to UFO stories or sightings (though I contingently acknowledge that given the size of the universe, there cannot but be intelligent life somewhere other than here--that&apos;s if you take the current situation on this planet as created by &quot;intelligent&quot; life--so I tried to explain the light I saw from my deck: a plane (flying that close and headed directly into a forest? not likely)? a helicoptor (there was absolutely no sound)?  So I was and am left totally mytified by what this was.  I was so curious, in fact, that I convinced my friend to come with me and drive out into the forest in the direction it was headed.  We drove for probably ten miles or so on the forest road but saw nothing at all.  The next morning I saw on the morning news that other people had reported seeing something which the Los Alamos Lab said was probably a meteor, though it had not registered on their radar (the person interviewed! said th at this might be due to the fact that there was not enough light radiating for the radar to pick up the object--this couldn&apos;t possibly be the cause since this oject was quite large for a meteor).  No one reported seeing anything elongated, such as the object I saw from my deck.  I&apos;ve been watching for more reports about this but have seen nothing else.  I&apos;m very curious about any other sightings on that night.

I started getting a little bit worried, and me and my brother both started to wonder and panic a little.  All of the sudden the light started moving very slowly but straight west from the field toward the road (we were travelling south).  It proceeded to travel at about 30 kilometres an hour (I was going regular high way speeds, but was so fixated on the light that my brother had to scream at me to stay in the right lane).  The aircraft travelled RIGHT ABOVE US!  My brother opened the window and looked directly up at the aircraft, and I stared at it as it went by.  We both said at the same time, &quot;What is that thing!!??&quot;  We both saw that it was triangular, with one main light on the bottom of it in the middle and one small light on each of the 3 sides of the aircraft.

At first, I thought nothing of it as I believed it to be nothing more than a flickering star.  However, the more I stared, the more I realized it was much more.  At first, the object was stationary in the sky and began flashing every 5-7 seconds.  After about a minute or so of this activity, another object to it&apos;s left flashed once.  Then, the object I initially viewed began moving toward the north.  For whatever reason, it then moved back to it&apos;s orignal location.

She was taking a long time getting ready to go out for the evening so I went outside and laid on the hood of my 1970 Mercury Montego looking up at the evening sky.  There were some stars out, but not excessive.  After awhile I saw what I thought was a shooting star.  The star, however, stopped amazingly suddenly.  I figured that the actual shooting star must have disappeared behind a nighttime cloud and I must be focusing on a different star.  I kept my eye on it anyway.  It quickly became apparent that the star I was focusing on was something strange.  It was gyrating back and forth fairly rapidly.  After approx. 10-15 seconds of gyration the &quot;star&quot; shot across the sky just like a shooting star.  As a matter of fact, it looked no different.  It was too high up for me to make out any particular shape.  It was a white light just like all of the other stars.  I was sort of blown away but then I figured I must be tired and imagined what I saw.  Although I knew what I saw, I could not admit it to myself.  If made me sit upright on the hood.  I was going to get up to go tell my girlfriend what I saw when suddenly another shooting star raced across the night time sky just as the first one and stopped in the EXACT SAME PLACE!  Now I knew I was really seeing something very weird.  It also started gyrating, and traveled in a perfect little triangle pattern, stopped for a minute, gyrated, and took off in the same projectile direction as the first, looking just like a shooting star.  One again, I was about to run into the house to tell my girlfriend what I was witnessing.  The adrenaline was flowing and my heart was pounding.  A third came out of the night sky, stopped in the same place, raced around in a circle (not a triangle) and split really fast just like the first two.  I did not wait around to see it there were any more.  Now I wish I did.  I ran into the house and yelled to my girlfriend, Where is a phone book?  I need to call the Hudson police department.  She sort of freaked out and yelled, what&apos;s wrong!!?  Still in the shower, she could not come down.  I saw one of those emergency stickers on the side of her phone and called the Hudson police dept., hear pounding out of my chest.  When someone answered and asked if it was an emergency, I got a grip.  I realized that I cannot embarrass myself by reporting UFO sightings.  That would be absurd.  I hung up.  I never reported it.  My girlfriend politely acknowledged what I saw, but I think that was the beginning of the end. Looking through her eyes, I think she thought I was nuts.  This was either on a Friday night or a Saturday night.  When I got to work on Monday I could not help but to confide in a coworker and tell him my story.  He laughed and said, your full of shit, you read the paper.  I asked him what he was talking about.  He said that there were several UFO sightings reported over the weekend in NH.  None were reported in Massachusetts according to my coworker.  The only one I remember him describing to me was a low down light in a field in NH and other low altitude sightings?  It did not sound like what I saw but the same weekend, never the less.  I tried, tonight, 23 years later, to try to substantiate this to my wife by Google&apos;ing a search for New England UFO sightings hoping to find a newspaper article.  I did find this:  7/7/81 Pittsfield Darryl S. Perrault, 18, Carl E. Perrault, his father, and Ann Delsignore, his girlfriend, saw a UFO through binoculars for 45 minutes. When first seen, it shot across the sky like a meteor, then suddenly stopped. Darryl said, &quot;It was oval-shaped, with red and white flashing lights around the outside like a ring. No way it was a plane or a sattelite- it shot across the sky too fast.&quot; N.E. UFO Newsletter #23 Oct. 1981 p. 18  Seems pretty darn similar.  My search was prompted because myself, my wife and my two daughters watched a UFO special on TV and my wife said, girls, don&apos;t believe any of this crap.  I of course encouraged them to keep an open mind.  I am a college educated individual who had nothing to gain by making up a story.  I am speaking the absolute truth.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

My first thought was that a State Trooper must have been laying in wait up ahead but as I maneuvered into the left lane to overtake a line of tractor-trailers, I saw 2 green lights probably a couple of hundred feet above the northbound lane and I guess about one quarter mile away. The lights were very bright, they sat side by side and as I watched I noticed that they appeared to be moving in a southerly direction. As I watched I noted that the lights were indeed moving to the south at a slow speed and I was rapidly gaining on them. My next thought was, that it was a police agency employing an aircraft with speed detection equipment. I could by this time see that the lights were part of the same object with one being on each side. This object appeared to me to be moving too slowly to be regular fixed wing and appeared too large to be an ultralite type aircraft so I assumed it to be a helicopter. At that point I decided that I had better be watching the road or &ldquo;that chopper&rdquo; would be life-flighting me to a hospital in St Louis. Just before I came along side the object I got a very intense feeling of dread. It was an almost sick feeling like when you unexpectedly get incredibly terrible news. As I approached, the object was still over the northbound lane, it was slowly moving south, as I could now definitely see it moving past the trees. The traffic in both lanes was still moving but at what appeared to be below the posted limit. I could now see the lig! hts clea rly and they appeared to be running lights on some type of aircraft but I could not determine just what type of aircraft it was.  The sky had been darkening for a while but there was still some natural lighting available as was illumination coming from a rest area that we were approaching. I could make out a dark shape but it was hazy. By this time my view was of course still from behind and the object was at about my 10 o&rsquo;clock position and I&rsquo;m guessing about 200 feet above ground. As it came into about my 9 o&rsquo;clock position, a bright red light appeared to form an equilateral triangle pointing south. At nearly that same instant two other things happened. The sick dreadful feeling in my gut worsened and the aircraft/object stopped in mid air. Immediately the 2 green &ldquo;running lights&rdquo; as I call them, both turned bright red and the object rotated one half turn to the left. It spun itself about, completely 180 degrees in place. It reversed its direction of travel and began moving north very slowly. I slowed my vehicle to a near crawl in the passing lane and watched as the red light that formed the lead corner of the triangle turned a brilliant white. A beam of blindingly white light was projected toward the ground and swept about like a searchlight as the triangle moved northward at a crawl. The beam of light swept back and forth behind a thick copse of trees that line the interstate. I could not see the beam sweeping the ground as whatever it was apparently &ldquo;searching&rdquo; for was on the opposite side of the tree line.The entire time I watched the object I looked very closely between the lights to determine just what I was looking at. I could see a triangular outline with length, width and height but could not make out any structural details. It appeared as if it was not completely solid. It was a misty blackish, dark color, darker than the night sky. I could not see through it although again I say it did not look entirely solid. I put my driver&rsquo;s side window down and stuck my head out as I passed the aircraft,! thinkin g maybe the light factory applied tinting on my vehicle&rsquo;s glass was interfering with my seeing properly. I heard no sound nor could I see any means of propulsion like props or what might be intake or exhaust ports for a jet. When the object was about 100 feet away to my left and about 200 feet above me I quickly held up my hand to gauge size. The distance between the lights along all 3 sides was a little longer than the length of my left hand. I realized that I was still in the passing lane and I was either going to run over someone or get ran over myself. I felt that I should not stop, the thought of stopping made me nauseous so I changed to the right lane and I watched in my mirrors as the object continued northward, shining its spotlight into the woods with cars passing below it like nothing was wrong. I took my eyes off the mirror and glanced at the road ahead and when I looked back the object was gone. I did not see the object change direction left or right; I did not see it go up or down. I just looked back and it was gone. I turned around in my seat and looked rearward but still did not see anything. By the time I reached Dix, IL. my usual exit, I did not feel like driving the country roads home. I continued on to Mt Vernon at exit 95 and went home on more traveled roadways. I did not sleep well that night thinking about seeing whatever this was. I can&rsquo;t help but wonder who else saw this. Of all the vehicles on the interstate that night surely I am not the only one that was intrigued enough to look.", "Everyone in my family remembers the nightly sightings of 5 orange cigar shaped objects that appeared in the sky over several days in the summer? 0f 1960-63?

What caught my eye was that it seemed to hover, then dive, then bounce back upand make quick, abrupt changes in direction.  The object stayed in the same general air space for approximately 1.5 hours.  I attempted to take some photographs, but could not zoom in enough to get a clear shot.  We tried to get a video camera from neighbors but could only find a pair of binouculars.  When we viewed the object through the binoculars, it appeared to be dark in color and somewhat amorphous in shape.  At times, depending on the angle, it looked like a black blob with a tail, like a tadpole.  Later, it appeared to look almost like the silouette of a bat, like something you would see at Halloween.  It also appeared to have something smaller trailing it.  I am not sure, but they may have been connected.  My neighbors and I watched the object until the sun went down, at which time we could no longer see it.", "After my evening run I was standing in my back yard and stretching. As I was stretching I noticed movement in the sky. At first I thought that it was a bird catching the reflection off of the stadium lights from the nearby college. As I watched more intently I noticed lights on the bottom of the object that appeared to merge from one color to the next. The object was diamond shaped and moved rapidly in several directions. The movement was dramatically faster than anything that I have seen in my military experience recently in Operation Iraqi Freedom. The object was changing direction in a short period of time and then shot straight up in the air and disapeared. My wife was freeked out when I told her.

I am certain it was not a dream.  I woke up at 3 am for no apparent reason.  I was compelled to go over to my window and open the window shades in my bedroom that sits on the second story and faces south east.  When I opened up the window shade I began fixating on a brighter than usual star in the clear night sky.  A moment later the &quot;star&quot; light began to move at a moderate pace toward my position. I began to get a little anxious as this was happening.  The circular light kept on getting brighter and larger as it approached.  At this point I was beginning to freak out.  The circular light was then about 500 feet from my window and was incredibly bright and large in shape.  My guess is that it was 100 feet wide by 100 feet tall maybe.  The object at this point was about a 20 feet above me in height. What I remember is that it was taking up most of my field of vision.  At this point I slammed the window shade and ran quickly into my parents room to wake them up.  We went back to the window, my dad did I was too afraid and there was nothing there.  Now this sounds like a bad dream, but I know it was real.  I have had bad dreams though they take place in my bed not standing at a window.  My sister too this day remembers this night as well, as the night her brother claimes to have seen a UFO.

As we were drving east on a country road we noticed what seemed to be a very bright flashing star very high on the southern horizon. At first we ignored it but then noticed something was odd about it so we stopped in the middle of the road. The object was moving very fast towards us while the bluish-white lights were almost blinding. I was trying to point out to my roommate the object but in a few seconds it had bypassed over the car so I could see what seemed to give me the idea that it had a very old space-capsule body (like Gemini)as well as dull red lights that were permanently shining in the center although they couldn&apos;t be seen with the major lights on and facing towards you. The object passed over the car and it disappeared to my vision although my roommate was able to see it. He saw that the white lights seemed to be a pair and that they were maybe of a part of a propulsion system. He also saw that it had some dull green lights also before it moved out of range towards the north horizon. All of this happened without the seen vehicle making any sound for ten minutes. We continued on our way to work and for 7-8 minutes we kept an eye on it before it literally vanished. An hour and a half later in a very close proximity to where we had left it we saw the same type of object at a distance from us. The bright bluish-white lights were rapidly flashing although the vehicle was suspended while moving in a circular pattern. Instead of parking like the first time we continued with our work while keeping tabs on the vehicle which didn&apos;t move from the spot we now saw it at. For a good two minutes we saw it here before driving away towards the south. I do not drink or do drugs while my roommate wasn&apos;t under any influence either; this we were wondering what this was with all ideas flowing from planes, secret service vehicles and satellites but it was too slow, moved in a south to north direction and didn&apos;t make any sound whatsoe! ver the whole time we had an eye on it.", "TRACKING A FAINT SATELLITE, AND AN EMERGING FLASH!This time of the year is a good time to star gaze..

It appeared to be burning up or something, headed down at an angle cutting across the sky.  Similar to a shooting star but much larger and far closer.  Definitely NOT an airplane!  The shape was square-like, but it appeared to be flaming (whitish, some pale orange light) so it masked some of the definition.

Just as we started to go to bed I was looking at stars to the east and suddenly there was a VERY bright flash of light. This light was not accompanied by any sound and seemed within decent range of where we were camped. The light was very bright and then quickly formed into four (4) distinct circular shaped lights: two on one side and two on the other. The new lights were shaped in a very strange, hard to explain way: they were very well formed light sources and the light from them stayed in a round shape as it came shone out from the craft (in fact we never really saw a &quot;craft&quot; per se). This object flew at a much quicker pace than any of the airplanes we&apos;d see that night and moved towards the west. About 6 seconds into al this the lights went off and became a &quot;pinpoint&quot; kind of light...looking a bit like a satellite does. It then moved VERY fast westerly and then completely disappeared. All of this really intrigued me so I stayed up for another two hours and saw a total of six (6) of them all moving in the same direction. Some just quick, small points of light and others looking like fluttering wings made of light...very blinky and fluttery and fast in their light. Two of them changed colors from white to red to blue and back, but most were just white.

He first mentioned it and then I saw it too. I thought he was talking about some lights from a plane since I couldn&apos;t see anything at first, but the object came into view. I knew it was something different because this light was way too big. I didn&apos;t have my glasses on and lights of jets and planes appear small in the sky for me when I don&apos;t have my glasses on, but this light was big and I was able to see it clearly without having to squint.There was also no noise coming from the object as it flew past by. When I&apos;m outside, helicopters flying over leave sound even if they are far away from me. This object left no sound.The object did change colors.

My husband and I went to the window and looked out, seeing what we at first perceived to be a planet. Our daughter told us that she had seen two other bright objects right next to this one, but that they &quot;left&quot;. I remained watching this object, as something did seem off about it- it appeared to me to be flashing, a yellowish light then red, alternating in a somewhat pulsing manner. It also seemed a little brighter and larger in the sky than planets I have observed. I watched the object for about an hour, noting that it wasn&apos;t moving (at least not perceptively, I *thought* I might have seen it move in a slightly zig-zag way, but I cannot say for sure). What I *did* notice was what seemed like extra air traffic that night- we don&apos;t get that many planes flying over us, but at one point I counted two about every five minutes. I finally gave up, thinking that there must be a reasonable explanation for this object, and went about getting ready for bed. An hour and a half passed after the first sighting by my daughter when my husband looked once more, and noted the object was completely gone from the sky. I double-checked myself, and there was no trace of the object.

It picked up something from the ground and studied it and then returned to the bright light and left.

For years I have seen what I would always rationalize as stars. The image of flashing bodies of light all of which emit whit, red, green/blue flashes in each body.  I am familiar with Jupiter and some of the other mention of celestial bodies that do this, however cannot find any documentation on the reports that I reviewed concerning the area of the south east coast of Florida.

On several occasions laying on my back on the beach there are clusters of them up to the number of single lights, 12 forming all the designs I have mentioned.  They are completely well defined as still compared to moving air craft, as I mentioned before they move quite slowly when they deminish as they are moving what appears to be away from me, or are easily shrouded by cloud cover but remain after the cloud is gone.   All of them do sparkle as you have described as &apos;light hitting a diamond&apos;.  the colors are all the same with my eye anyway, red, green, green/blue white.  they do flash however side to side.  They do not have a starburst effect. They are easily seen with binoculars and the flash is side to side on all of them.

Three of the five have knowlege of constellations and none could not explain what we were seeing.

It came into my view as it passed over my head look toward and above the 3 story apartment building NV of me. It was a dark, triangle craft, about the size of an old caddilac car.  There were dim, rectangle shaped lights from the point to the back, but not across the back.  Stranger yet was that there was one more light on the left size than the right side, like one light was out. It was about a 4/5 second sighting. I won&apos;t forget it.  I screamed for my roommate to come see, then passed him on my way back through the house to get outside to try and see past the bigger building.

My job entailed me to walk between two factory plants, throughout the night.One of the plants, is a secret place, that has been built in a small dip, out of site.This site is involved in the manufacture of some sort of catalyst, that is used for something in the nuclear IND.Anyhow, one winter night while walking to the catalyst plant, I couldnt help but notice what a beutifull clear night it was, and how all the stars were out.After about a 5 min walk, and approaching the crest of the hill that hides the plant, I saw a bright white light. I didnt think anything at all at first, as there is nothing unusual about seeing a white light in the sky at night, IE planes and helicopters ect. But, there was something different about this light and I couldnt figure what it was. I first spotted it when it was maybe, 3 miles away.The light was coming directly at me from a slight angle { 2 o,clock }.Flying at a sort of horizon level to where I was standing.There was something that intreiged me to stop walking when I reached the top of the crest.It was now getting very close. It was a white light of quite high intensity, yet it did not seem to project any sort of beam. I would estimate the light to have been approx 12&quot; in diameter. It travelled accross the sky at about an estimated guess of about 50 mph ground speed. As it aproached the plant it slowed right down and actualy stopped above the roof of the plant. I would guess this to be about 30 meters above. By this time I had actualy walked about 20 meters down the other side of the crest, which put me approx 75 meters from the light source.Because I was still someway up the crest still, I would guess this put the light source about 10 meters above me, and about 75 meters in front of me at about 1 o,clock. A number of things realy botherd me about what I was seeing ! First off, was the fact that there was no red or green lights, IE plane etc ! Second, I knew that this thing was very close, yet there was no noise.This was about 3am early morning, and you could have heard a pin drop from 20yrds.By this time,Im thinking OK, what have we got that would explain what it is im looking at. Answer, Stealth helicopter. I dont know if such a thing exsists, but it has to be something that can fly slowly and hover and do it in total silence.I then realised, that because it was so close, and the sky was so clear, I should actually be able to see the craft, whatever it was ! I then realised that under close scruttiny, when I looked just above the light I could actually see a star ! This told me that the light must be on the upper part of the craft. So this gave me the idea of sorts of looking to the sides and below this light. I was in dissbelief when I found that I could actualy make out other objects like the trees on the oppossite side of the hill.At the realisation of the fact that this light that I had seen so far travel accross the sky and then to stop almost in throwing distance from me, actually had no body, actually made me a little nerv rattled.I had actualy been watching this thing intentley for about 10 min or so by now, I wasnt 100% convinced that what I was looking at was a UFO at this time.I was certainly wondering if this was the case and if that had been it I would probably never have known ! As I said, as it was winter, it was biteingly cold, and this eventualy won me over to get inside for a warm, leaving the strange light still hoverig above.I took, maybe 3 steps towards it and it shot through the sky in the direction from which it came. There again, was no noise. There was also, seemingly no acceleration as such. It went from zero speed, to what I can only describe as comet type speed. It was gone in a streak of light in about two seconds.It reminded me of a comet I saw when walking home from school as a child.I know we will always have secret technoliges ect but no way, have we gone that far ! I SAW A UFO. That is a fact ! No amount of crap about reflections ect from whoever could ever convince me in the slightist that I didnt see what I saw.If only there wasnt so many idiots in this world, claiming allsorts where ufo,s are concerned, maybe we would know the truth about how many are seen and how often etc. This happened to me about 20 years ago, and I still think about that night quite regualry. This is the first time I have ever recorded this incident.It seems strange even now addmiting this happened. I know now, that they exsist !

It was a clear night with many stars visible beyond the canopy of the trees. We suddenly noticed a light in the sky brighter than the other stars. We first thought it may be Venus, usually the brightest object in the sky at night. The light began to move slowly from side to side that suggested it may be a helicopter, only there was no sound. I would guess that the object was a mile from us but moving toward us. It made erratic movements.For example, it would move very fast in one direction, stop suddenly, then move in the opposite direction. The object was very close to us now but it still looked like a bright star. We also heard no sound coming from it. Then suddenly it came to a stop, and sped to the south of us faster than any manmade flying object I&apos;ve ever seen. Maybe a minute or two after, two fighter jets flew in the direction of the object at top speed. It was the only time we heard any sound. At the time of this incident the naval air base in Weymouth, MA was still oporational and I believe the fighter jets were scrambled from there.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

At first glance it looked like headlights on a car in the sky.  They (the lights) appeared to be spinning.  The two disc shapes had red and green lights which blinked in a radom pattern.  Below the two disc shapes a very small solid color green or blue light would appear and go toward the discs and back. We live within 20 miles of Fort Knox.

A bit long ago but I hadn&apos;t got any needs back then to share the world with my and my two friends&apos;s story. I have told a few people about my sightings but they wouldn&apos;t believe me and I don&apos;t want to realy talk about it either because the most people will think I made this up. Wich I realy don&apos;t. That night it was a bit cold but the sky was clear so I could see a beautiful lot of stars. I realy like to look at them because they make me feel so small in this world. Suddenly I saw a vague round shape in the sky. It was a sort of brown O with in the middle a red light a sort of dot. The object was realy small and I could not determine the distance. It could be realy big and far away but also small and just some miles away. I realy had to look good because I could see it hardly, even though it was a realy clear night. It flew from the south when it was heading North in a straight line and realy fast. Then it stopped and just stood still in the sky. This was the time I called my friends to look up. I pointed at the object so my friends could see it too. In a fraction two others just appeared and joint the first one. Not in a straight line this time because these two seemed to play with eachother. These two circled a bit around and then just dissapeared. The first one was still hanging there and faded away to the north. I realy don&apos;t know what it was. It could not have been an airplane because they don&apos;t move this fast and certainly they can&apos;t and play. The seem reason why it was not an satalite. I&apos;ve seen satalites often and they look like a small star that is moving slowly in one straight line. I&apos;m realy glad my friends saw it too because I was thinking that I was going crazy. I have never seen this strange sight again. This is then one of a billion stories of an UFO sighting. I realy hesitated to place this story because of these lot and I think the larger part is made up just to get some attention. Anyway the reason for sharing is that I would like to know if somebody have seen a comparable sort of apearance, nothing else. I do not believe in alien invasions or hostile creatures that want to take over the world. I don&apos;t believe in alienmade circles in cornfields or that some people are taken hostage by aliens. I would not exclude it all because I&apos;m openminded and I live in harmony with myself and others allthough I&apos;m not religious. I do believe in life beyond earth but I think we&apos;re not ready yet to meet up with an alien sort of life because we can not even accept our own species. A matter of time I think that would reveal life from somewhere else then earth. Thanks for reading my story. For the investigator; I don&apos;t have any pictures or other proof of my sighting exept for my two friends. I hope I have given enough information but for further explonations please send me a email with questions I will answer as well as possible.

She was still driving her green 47 Chevy, she left the engine running and the heater on. We noticed two triangle shaped objects comming down the Hudson from the direction of the George Washington Bridge they seemed to be at an altitude lower than us. They came very close, perhaps 1/4 mile or closer. We were looking down on them they were above the water perhaps 300-400 feet. As they passed the Chevy stalled and the Heater blower also stopped. The Blower started running when they were some distance out to sea.  About two minutes later two aircraft that I think they were F-80&apos;s they had wing tanks.Shortly there after the two objects flew past and up the Harbor toward the George Whashington Bridge at a high rate of speed the two F-80 were close behind.  The objects appeared to be playing with the jets. They slowed down and sped up a couple of times turned sharply and headed out to sea over Coney Island.

This is my second time reporting about objects like these in the same area(2 miles east of downtown) except this time, the object was much closer than before.  Almost every night you can see balls like these moving across the sky.

As we neared it we saw that it was hovering just above the trees. As we got closer we saw that it had blue and red lights as well as white ones. It was so close that we couldn&apos;t really see it&apos;s shape, and the lights were very bright. Some of the lights were blinking, and some were scrolling across the bottom. Less than a minute after we passed it, we went back to get a better look -- and it was gone. The following friday night we saw it again at about 9:45. It was a bit higher in the air that time, and my daughter watched it go up and speed off about a minute or two after we passed it.", "Pulsating light gets smaller as it makes an arching movement in the night sky.Sunday August 6th, 2006 at 10:30 PM, I was taking my dog out to do her business before going to bed.  As I walked out of my house, I was greeted by a beautiful full moon which was slightly orange at the time in the NE sky. As I walked to the rear of my yard, I noticed what I originally thought was a very large planet in the N sky (about the same size as the moon that night).  About a minute or two later, I returned to the spot where I seen the &quot;planet&quot;, and stood and watched it for about another minute.  Just then the circle pulsated very brightly, and made an arching movement in the sky.  As it was making this arching movement, the circle got smaller and smaller until it vanished which took approxiamately 5 seconds. The sky was very still and clear that night with no wind or clouds.

Just before the first of two sky watches was held, a bunch of us headed for the parking lot for our lawn chairs and jackets.  Someone yelled to look up at the eastern sky, and we observed an object that I could not explain -- it was a tiny dot that would flare brilliantly (white) into what I saw as an almost triangular shape.  I swear I also saw what looked like two faint stick-like protuberances on either side.  The object then went back to its regular very faint dot, then flared brightly a couple of more times before becoming so faint that it eventually disappeared.  I frankly was so taken by the beauty of the thing that I didn&apos;t pay much attention to speed (it was moving from north to south).  It would be interesting if some of my fellow witnesses would come forward and give their own version of what they saw. I found that this was the best sighting (for me) of my three days there.  I sat for several hours in the sky watches and did see some objects that did not behave like the airplanes, shooting stars, and satellites I did observe in the beautiful crystal-clear night skies outside of Trout Lake.  I suppose you would call these UFOs since I could not identify them!", "UFO at a Dave Mathews concert at the Gorge in George Wa.It was at the Dave Mathews concert at the Gorge in George Wa.   After the concert people were pointing at the sky and exclaiming about what an odd light was moving around and was very high up and very bright.  The object appeared to be as high as a comercial jet liner (20,000) or more.  It traversed a mile or more back and forth at that height and then resumed a static position in the sky.  Its movement took place over less than 2 seconds.  It would move and instantly reverse its direction.  It did this a few times.  Everyone leaving the concert witnessed it.

We did not drink nor do drugs so our vision and minds were not under any influence.  In the dark, all of a sudden, a UFO flew by silently and right above the 2 story dining hall building that we sitting outside of.  It flew by us in a split second.  One friend looked at me shocked in disbelief.  I would not have believed my own eyes, except my friend saw it too.  The other (third) friend never saw nor heard anything and was convinced that the two of us who saw it, had fabricated the story.  That shows you how silent and quick the UFO flew by. The shape was the classic saucer shape.  The size was huge - bigger than a helicopter, but smaller than the building.  The UFO was a dark silver color, and had one string of lights going around it, on the side I saw. The amazing thing is that it was so close and yet so absolutely silent.  I have never seen anything ever again that flies so silently.  I always felt bad about not reporting it, but we didn&apos;t know who to report it to.

At the time it would have been highly unlikely to see anything in the sky due to the hillside and trees on both sides.  This light came directly down smack in the center and seemingly disappeared into the road(over the hill)  The light was consistent-bright but not blinding- it did not get brighter or duller as it came down.  There were 2 cars about 150 ft in front of me that would have witnessed it as well.  It&apos;s hard to say how far away the light source was (possibly a mile).

It was a clear night, and I was looking to the South, when I noticed an unusual amount of what I first thought was aircraft activity over Portland lining up for approach at PDX.  Then I realized that I&apos;ve never quite seen so many aircraft in the air at once, and that if it was part of practice for an airshow or military maneuvers, it was a bit too late at night.  Even if they were conventional aircraft, they were spaced much to closely together to be on any sort of landing approach to Portland International Airport. The lights were amber in color, about twice as bright as the stars, and numbered in 6 or 7 pairs.  From my perspective, they were about 10 degrees off the horizon, and each pair of lights were coupled at a 45 degree angle from each other.  Each pair was separated from the next by about an inch at arm&apos;s length.  The entire assembly of lights seemed to be in formation, keeping the same spacial relationship from the others the entire time.  The group of lights formed a slight arc that was lower in elevation at the east end.  The group of lights moved in unison to the southeast, losing elevation until out of sight below the treeline that makes up the horizon from my vantage point.  At times the lights seemed to shimmer a bit, but that very well have been due atmospheric distortion due to their proximity to the horizon and the (apparent) distance involved. I called for my wife and son to come take a look.  My wife scoffs at any mention of UFOs, so I wouldn&apos;t alert her to it unless it was very clearly odd.  My son (7 years old) made it out first, and viewed the lights with me.  My wife didn&apos;t make it out for several minutes, and by the time she arrived outside the lights had dropped below the trees on the horizon. I often can see lights from aircraft taking off and landing at PDX and Vancouver airstrips - in fact they appear at the very same spot on the horizon where the lights in question were.  Planes always appear as a white and red flashing light, and these were simply glowing amber lights, much different and brighter than the normal aircraft lights.  In fact, at the time of the sighting, a plane with &quot;normal&quot; plane lights passed amidst the lights from my line of sight, and stood out clearly as it moved through the area. I&apos;m just now submitting this because I just visited this site and noticed the request for reports to be submitted on this subject.  I originally dismissed the event because, after looking for it on the news sites the next day, I didn&apos;t see any report of it, and thought perhaps I was overreacting to it. I would be happy to take a picture from my vantage point and edit in the lights with Photoshop to send to you, if you wish.", "We were traveling west on FL State Road 50 at about 60mph through Lake County Florida on Sunday, October 15th 2006.

The shape of the lights was oval. They were moving in a synchronized almost choreographed pattern in the shape of a figure eight that was turned on its side. The lights never appeared to touch or converge into one in the center of the  pattern. When it looked like they would collide they would suddenly veer away from each other and continue the pattern.    I pulled over and exited the vehicle to get a better look.

I could see the electric lights of Grand Cayman in the distance, as we approached the island, and first thought that the blueish lights were a boat of some sort.  I focused my attention on the lights and noticed that they seemed to be moving as a group, but also moving individually within the group.  At first, the group of lights moved with the ship, same direction and speed.  Then the lights sped forward for a second, then again matched our speed.  They seemed to move closer to the ship and I could now clearly see that there were many individual lights, 8 or 10, moving in several different directions or circular patterns within the group. After a few seconds they moved even closer, toward the front of the ship this time.  As the lights approached the front of the ship underwater, they seemed to arrange themselves in single file, before disappearing one by one beneath the hull.

This experience gave me the knowledge and encouragement to become a leader in the aerospace science and international airline spaceline operations. By the grace of God I currently lead the industry as the developer of a spaceship that competed successfully in the 2004 X-Prize race to space for civilian operators. My sisters possessed this same general background in aviation to confirm that what she saw flying object just below the clouds headed directly south as if head toward Colorado Springs Colorado.While looking up into the local airspace of an extremely located south east Denver neighborhood she observed  a new type of flying ship that was shaped like a open &quot;V&quot; apexes first configuration and moving very fast while making no sound emissions at about 5:30 pm. Because of its smaller size, as compared to a major airliner, she believes that the object, which flew directly over her head at about a 90 degrees zenith point could have possible been a large UVA, CUVA or single piloted craft.What captured  her attention was the fact that  the flying machine was following an  unconventional flight route that deviated from the normal east/west ATC regulated  traffic patterns class D airspace  routing support for both DIA and our Buckley AFB  flight patterns. She observed white lights illuminate near the outer section of both delta wing tip leading edges and possessed no power-plant thrust production smoke or vapors trailing it as it few at a low altitude. She does not remember the exact day but it was seen early last week around the 2ed of October.One final note in relation to this strange sighting its interesting to note that the sighting was made just before the North Korea nuclear boom test firing event schedule which place America&rsquo;s spying activities on full alert. My sister know her airplane and I believe what she saw was something new.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

A very bright and very fast moving object in they sky to my forward-left caught my eye and I watched it for maybe one whole second when it exploded.My first thought was that I might have just seen the Shuttle Atlantis burning up and exploding.It was like a ship on fire, burning light of white and a little yellow in a kind of corona around a central mass that was traveling at tremendous speed and then it exploded in the air in a conical fashion. About the time the debris cone got to three times the diameter of the original object the &apos;fire&apos; went out and nothing of it was visible in the dark.I can estimate the speed at around 3600 mph because for the second (if that) that I saw the object it traveled the length of a hill/mountain top that is somewhat like a mesa in shape and is a mile in length. However, the object appeared to be about 5 miles beyond the &apos;mesa&apos; and from my perspective about 5 degrees above the mesa and in slight declination... for reference my distance from the mesa was about a mile.The freeway is pretty much going south-east where I was at, so I guess the object was traveling south, but I can&apos;t be sure becuase the 15 fwy changes direction alot.I&apos;m sure the media would have already have the story out if the shuttle exploded, so it wasn&apos;t that. Other possibilities would include a meteor, but I would guess that a meteor that big would cause some major damage, and not be at such a slight declination at such a low altitude.It left a briefly glowing trail and I heard no sounds.", "2 objects of orange colour,moving with no noisei was standing in my back garden having a cigarette as i dont smoke indoors, so whilst smoking with not much else to look at i gazed up at the sky and as i was looking i saw 2 lights which were close together. side by side.large in size and of orange colour. i thought this odd as they were bigger than a planes lights. they started moving overhead fairly quickly, then slowed down almost in front of me (but from a good distance above) then stopped. the lights then seemed to reduce in size, then started moving slowly again, and 1 shot of and disappeared and the other faded as if moving away from me. there was also no noise from these objects.", "glowing ball just under the surf about 2 1/2 feet off the beach south of san francisco/ocean beach approx 9/94a friend and i were walking her dogs along the bluff overlooking the water just south of ocean beach.  it was getting dark and we noticed a glowing object about the size of a basketball in the surf.  we assumed it was garbage and phosphersence but it was a perefct orb shape.  it then seemed to stop breifly before it began to pace us about 2/12 feet off the beach moving south.  we watched it for several minutes trying to figure out what it was.  when we determined it was now moving south she then became so scared she ran to the car.

I was looking towards the moon, which was mostly covered by clouds at the time, when I saw a bright yellowish light which disappeared almost immediately upon my sighting it, my first instinct was that it was a meteor or very large &quot;falling star&quot; and remember saying WOW and then when it disappeared (into a cloud probably?), was starting to ask &quot;did you see that?&quot; when it reappeared followed by 4 additional, equally spaced, equally sized lights moving extremely fast from the Northwest towards the Southeast.  My friend also saw the lights after they reappeared and we watched until they disappeared over the Rampart Range. We did disagree about 2 things when we compared remembered details.  I thought the lights were in a sort of chevron pattern with 4 lights making up one leg and 1 light down from the point making up the other, he thought it was a straight line.  I remember joking at the time that maybe &quot;our&quot; geese had headlights cause I didn&apos;t know what we really did see.  The other detail we differed on was that I thought the lights were yellowish to white and steady, while he thought they were more yellowish red also steady.  We commented on the total silence during the entire event, and both noticed there were no other planes visable until approximately 10 minutes after the lights were out of our view.  We were in a valley where any type of jet or plane can be heard long before it is visable.  We also agreed that there was no visable craft, we merely saw lights, far below the normal jet space and moving far too rapidly to be small planes or helicopters-that we know of. I&apos;m fairly sure it&apos;s an unrelated coincidence, but approximately 40 seconds after we lost sight of the lights, we heard 2 rather muffled rumbles, maybe 2 seconds apart.  It was probably thunder, but if so it was the only thunder we heard.

From behind, over my right shoulder, I noticed a flying craft.  It was low enough to tell it was nothing but a flying disk. I pointed and said &quot;Look!&quot;.  It went overhead, flying low and not making a sound nor leaving any contrail. We did nothing but stood still and quiet and noticed that it had no rivets or seams in the metal.  The sides didn&apos;t come to a pointed edge but were somewhat rounded.  I could see no windows and regret that I hadn&apos;t seen the front of the craft.  It moved at a steady rate of speed and, withing minutes or less, went over the hills in the distance.  To my knowledge, no one else in the small town saw it and I can understand why as it was completely silent and, if seen from the side, would probably be hard to see.  But this went right overhead.

I noticed what I at first took to be a satellite since it moved in much the way satellites do, just fast enough to be noticed and on a silent, straight course across the sky.  However the reason I noticed it so quickly was that it was quite bright, too bright to be a satellite and yet far too fast to be a planet.

The binoculars resolved the light into 3 lights in tight triangular formation, giving the impression that they were fixed to one craft moving on a southerly course.  The lights were unblinking white and never varied in position, size or intensity.  I was unable to discern what they might be part of, the distance being too great.  I had to return to my equipment for a few minutes and when I once again looked for the object I was unable to find it.

At one point we saw the light come to a complete stop, move up and down then it proceeded on its orignal flight path.  This is the first time I have ever seen anything like this.  I am ex Military and Law Enforcement, I am pretty up on anything that flies.  This was moving like NOTHING I or the others present had ever seen.", "The object captured in a photograh appeared to be a silver disk/saucer above the Chesapeake Bay.I was in Havre De Grace Maryland to see the Concord Point lighthouse. I took several pictures of the Concord Point lighthouse.  Later that day I downloaded the pictures I had taken.  I selected one of the pictures of the Concord Point lighthouse and printed the photograh on a photo quality printer.  I noticed that above the lighthouse, over the Chesapeake Bay was an object in the sky.  It stood out in the brilliant blue sky. It looked like a metallic object.  When I cropped the picture to get a closer look, it looked pictures I&apos;ve seen of objects identified as a flying saucer.  I had taken another picture from the same location approximately 3 seconds later.  The object was no where to be seen.

It was between 8:00PM and 11:00PM my wife and I where taking a drive to catch some fresh air. As we made our way down Batesville Pike road we noticed a strange object approaching us very quickly. There was a car in front of us that must have seen the same strange object as they pulled off to the shoulder about a car length ahead of us. My wife and I where just shocked and could not identify what was before our eyes. This thing (larger than a 747 from wing tip to wing tip) hovered about 20 or 30 feet above the ground right around some tree tops. There where multiple (best guess 20) bright white lights along the front of this thing. The object then moved quickly across the road and hovered over a thick wooded area before the object changed shape and seemed to land or disappear into the woods below. My wife and I drove off trying to digest what we had just seen. We drove about a mile down the road and decided to turn around and go investigate. When we returned to the spot nothing was out of the ordinary. My first instinct was to walk through the woods and see if I could find anything, but after having flash backs of (Fire in the sky) I decided against that. Now with that said I&apos;ll tell you that North Little Rock Airport is less than 5 miles from the spot of the sighting. It&apos;s a small airport with only one runway but what we seen was not using the airport. I also wonder if what we seen was some sort of secret military project based on the fact that there&apos;s a military base less than 3 miles from the spot of the sighting. When the object changed shapes and landed in the woods it landed on military owned property. So it could be one of the two 1) A secret military project or 2) A UFO((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I was sitting in my patrol unit when I observed over the tree lines a very large object the size of a military cargo plane (wing span) moving at a slow rate of speed.  The object was not a thin disc, but appeared to be 2-3 stories in height.  It made no sound and its speed was too slow to be an airplane.  It moved about 5 mph.  From the position I was in it was moving in a North East direction toward the college.  The object had blue, red, and white lights across it flashing and rotating.  I can remember watching them mesmerized at the fact that it was coming towards me.  I never lost eye contact with it, but I did lose time.  While I was watching it move closer, I did not notice that a tow truck driver had pulled up next to my unit.  He banged on his driver side door to get my attention.  He wanted to know a certain apartment complex.  After answering his question, which only took a minute, I looked back at the tree lines and saw that the object had disappeared.     At its speed it should have moved over the college.  I drove around the college and down the bypass looking for the object.  I went in a North and Southern direction.

PD))", "birght satellite -like nocturnal light with a distinctly orange color wher no satellite should have been.I was out walking just a few minutes before midnight, and saw approaching out of the Northeast what looked like an unusually bright and unusually orange satellite. Its motion and appearance were just that, but it was almost midnight, and the light passed nearly overhead and to the southwest until it became invisible behind clouds near the Southwest horizon. Planes nearly always exhibit strobes, are only orange colored when near the horizon, and without exception look a lot different as they change their aspect angle with respect to the observer, and this light didn&apos;t.  I checked the time on my cell phone, and it was 23:58 - nearly midnight. The sun was just about at +7 degrees declination. From that, I calculate that altitude would have to have been about 2500 km to be visible overhead at local midnight from my location (about 39 deg N). A large rocket body in transfer orbit might well be at such an altitude, but I don&apos;t think it could be that bright at that slant range (roughly 3700 km or more at first), or that consistently orangish/yellow. Since it moved from northeast to southwest, if what I saw was a satellite, it would have to be in a retrograde orbit. There have been quite a few of these, but nearly all are low orbiters, well below 1000 km altitude.I tried to find a candidate satellite. It would need an apogee altitude of at least 1000 km (more likely 2000 km), and an inclination greater than 90 degrees. This really cuts the list down to about 20 candidates. There were several potentially visible birds at about that time, but all would have been in the northwest and would not have passed anywhere near overhead while illuminated by the sun.  I used both commercial and software and web-based tools to confirm this.", "Triangle like object appears, lands then dissapears near littleton hospitalMy friends and I were out for a drive in the South Broadway/Hampton area when all of a sudden we saw what appeared to be two planes flying extremley low to the ground. Upon further inspection, we noticed that the &quot;planes&quot; were connected to eachother by a beam of light, and that what we had thought to be the triad pattern of lights often seen on planes at night was acutally a part of this strange object. The best possible description of its appearence is that it was one larger triangular shape lined with red and blue lights connected to a similar but smaller triangular shape. It moved very fast and sparatically making no noise at all. It was able to turn very sharply. The larger and smaller triangular components of the object always moved relative to eachother, maintaining a perfect connection.  After aproximatley two minutes of what appeared to be random motion, the object suddenly flew away into the distance until it was no longer visible. At this point, my friends and I were positive that what we saw was not a plane/helicopter/weather ballon due to the apparent high velocity the object was able to reach in such a short amount of time, and the complexity of its movement. My emotions at this time were shock, excitement, and amazement of what I had just seen. After the object had been gone for about 6 minutes, it suddenly reappeared very close to us, approximatly 50 yards above our car. After flying around the area for for about a minute, the object came to an abrupt stop above a residential area, about four blocks away from our car. At this point, we stopped the car and I was able to get a better look at the object. The &quot;light beam&quot; connection was actually a very well lit solid connection and dark window shapes could be made out on the smaller of the two triangles. I glanced down the street and noticed that several other cars had stopped to observe the object as well. After it hovered for a few seconds, it began to descend and landed on the ground. We immediatley tried to drive to where ! it had l anded, but could not find anything. The object had apparently dissapeared or become invisible upon landing. We searced the area where it appeared to have landed intensly for about a half and hour but could find nothing. Three helicopters arrived and appeared to be activley searching during the this time, and for the remainder of the night we could see/hear helicopters near the area of the sighting. Throughout the entire sighting I never felt afraid, I just felt amazed beyond belief and lucky to have seen this object.", "July 1964, 15:00, Washington, MO, rectangular, 20 min, from north to south, posted 9-28-06.When I was about 13 years, a student of astronomy, interested in aircraft, and the NASA &ldquo;space program&rdquo;, I saw a UFO.  I was at that age a model rocket, math, and science enthusiast.  As an adult I graduated with an engineering degree.  On this special day, it was clear and sunny.  It was in the month of July.  The sky was blue with few clouds and maybe 90 F.  The winds were clam.  I first noticed it coming from the North floating towards the South or South Southeast.  Its speed seemed slow but did travel in a straight line of flight.  The object shape was clearly a rectangle.  Note, it was only a two dimensional object - no thickness.  You could not see through it.  Its color appeared as if it were a solid black - no color changes.  It floated along as if it were a plastic sheet one would hold by hand along the short side in front of a strong fan watching the greater length of plastic flutter very very slowly yet perpendicular to the fan face.  It remained level and with no sound, always keeping the same altitude, same speed, and same direction.  I followed it for nearly 20 minutes and was finally unable to continue.  It just continued southward, in the same direction, same altitude, same speed, unabated.  To ascertain a speed relative to ground, I estimate a segment distance of travel of 500 feet.  During that distance it traveled that distance in about 1 minute.  To estimate the size of the UFO, I would compare it to holding in my out stretched something 1.5&quot;x3.0&quot; in size in my hand.  As far as I know I was the only one to see it. Comment: Over the years I often wondered if it were nothing more than a plastic sheet floating along.  But anyone experienced in kite flying would know that any flat plastic sheet would not stay aloft parallel to the earth indefinitely as this object.  I felt when watching it as if it were a hole in the sky.  Almost as if I and the homes were being observed.  I was never frightened.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  We have assigned an arbitrary date above.

Fastest satellite I&apos;ve ever seen, and as I watched, it kept going faster!  Lost it in 4-6 seconds.  I don&apos;t think it&apos;s acceleration was due to that effect you see as an orbital object approaches the horizon and appears to speed up before winking out. This was quite different.

The large light was to me about the size of a pin head and the smaller light about a third that size.  Obviously they had to be extremely large objects to be seen that far away and their movement was deliberate. I really doubt that anyone else saw these lighted objects because the were so dim, so smal! l and we re only visable for such a short time.  I guess I should have stood up and shouted for others to look but at first I expected to discover some natural cause for the big light and the small one moved quickly and was gone in about 30 seconds. The lights of the object did not shine like an electric light sourse but were rather dull. However they were extremely far away. The larger light was about the color of the yellowish Moon and the small light a little whiter.((NUFORC Note:  Witness corrects date of sighting, which was October 28, 2005.

The actual words were, &quot;Houston this is Discovery, we still have the alien spacecraft on VFR&quot;. As a reversed speech researcher I was curious to see if the technique of slowing and reversing the recorded transmission would reveal whether or not the message was a hoax (as some claimed), a joke (as NASA claimed), or the simple truth.  In fact, the reversals indicate that not only is the message itself genuine, but the event it is describing was in fact taking place at that very moment.

The top of the craft was dark but the lights at the bottom were very bright.

I thought at first it was a spotlight advertisement from town, so didn&apos;t think much of it, until I started walking toward my house, and the lights followed and remained over my house until they dissapeared at approximately 10:00pm. To the best of my knowledge,the whole configuration was about one-half the size of a football field and consisted of four lights rotating in a circle or slightly oval pattern. They were spaced evenly apart and would rotate once and then all go into the center and touch, and very quickly go out again and rotate. This pattern was repeated over and over during the whole veiwing. I would estimate the constant speed of the circles to be about 40mph or faster.Two of my neighbors also witnessed the event.It was very overcast at the time. There was no noise or sound from the lights.I am located about 7 miles from Denver International Airport. I did call them this monring to see if anything showed on radar. They were going to check.I also called the police about 9:50pm last night. The lights suddenly disappeared, and I did not see how the object left the area, as I had gone into the house to get the phone. I stepped back outside and it was gone, approximately at 10:00pm, Sept. 21, 2006.It seemed interested in my movements, as the lights were rotating, but the whole configuration stayed in the same spot while I was working with my horse,for about 30 minutes, near a very well-lit barn.

There was heavy rush hour traffic and it was just beginning to get daylight. Out my drivers side window at approximately 10 o&apos;clock and about 30 degrees up I saw an oddly shaped black craft traveling directly Southeast.  The instant I spotted it, I leaned down and watched as it traveled in a straight line from NW to SE directly over my roof.  It was in my sight for 2, maybe 3 seconds at the most. The reason it caught my eye was due to its low altitude and odd shape.  There was a low ceiling and patchy dense fog in the immediate area.  Judging from the apparent altitude of 100-150 feet, the craft was clearly visable and appeared to have a very flattened fuselage 15-20 feet in length, 6-8 feet across with short canards 2-3 feet long approximately 5 feet from the aft end.  It was traveling in the range of 125 to 150 knots would be my best guess.  I saw no lights on the craft in the brief time it was in my sight.  There were no visible means of propulsion and my first impression was that it resembled a shortened cruise missle.  I tried to see it as it passed farther to the SE but my view was blocked.  I did have the radio on, but didn&apos;t hear any loud noise I would expect from an aircraft at that altitude.  I continued to look in the general SE direction to see if there were any sudden flashes of light but did not observe any.My location was approximately 1/4 mile West of the Olive Branch airport and 8 miles SE from the Memphis International Airport.

My buddy yelled down to them &quot;what are you looking at you perverts&quot;.  They looked up and shouted back &quot;wholly shit....do you see it too?&quot;.   They were both almost hysterical. One of the men had a small eye piece he was looking through.  He tossed it up to us so we could see for ourselves.  There was a boomerang shaped craft way up in the sky.  It remained motionless as white puffy clouds were passing underneath. You could barely see it without the eyepiece. Then one of the guys said &quot;look, there&apos;s more&quot;.  Sure enough we could see 2 then 3....I counted 4 total.  All the same shape hovering close to one another.  They all seemed to have the same segmented color scheme. A dark band followed by a light color band followed by another dark band.  Kind of like a bumble bee.  We all went out onto the street and continued watching the craft. No one had a camera so we began stopping people on the street and pointing out the objects to them. I guess this was an attempt to prove to ourselves we weren&apos;t crazy or seeing things.   After a while of watching &amp; telling people, it was weird, there was nothing else we could do.  Eventually we went back up stairs and I continued looking back up in the sky to see if they were still hovering. I looked up the last time and they were gone.  We never saw them zoom off...they just disappeared. I found this site while surfing the new google video search engine.

Just as I was going to head back inside I decided to look one more time, then I see it. I was standing out on in front of my driveway,looking south. there was no noise but this huge object was flying at the treetop level very slow. I remember standing there waiting for it to get closer, but as soon as it reached the tree line that was about 200 yrds away from where I was standing, the object stopped and hovered over the trees. There were no colored lights flashing, but It was so close that I could see it was in the shape of the chevron sign and what it looked like big windows around the sides of the object that was faceing me. I started to crouch down by my van thinking that the object was not advancing forward due to maybe it knew I was standing there. Then The object started to do something I did not even expect it to do. It started to move and it appeared like it was landing. The object started to hide lower and lower behind the trees. I was so amazed. We know this area and the direct spot it was hovering over and knew there were houses surrounding the feild it was hovering over, so it was impossible to drive around the block and see anything in the feild. By the time my freind arrived, we drove around the area and seen nothing. I told them what I seen, where and what it did. We stayed out side for about another hour just talking and looking up at the sky and still wondering what happend to this object, when one of a sudden we see this object take off from the south sky at a really fast speed.

My mom thought it was a game warden&apos;s helicopter looking for people spotlighting deer.There was no sound, even at 11 yrs old I knew something was weird.  We called the State Police they put us on hold after we told them what we saw.  No one ever came back to the phone.  While we were waiting on the phone, the light landed behind the trees. Just before it landed, it flashed a bright light. It lit up everything around us that we could see for about 5 seconds. The closest way to describe it is a gas stove.  You think is lit but the pilot light is out and the gas is on -- you light it and it flashes a bluish green light.  It goes poof for a split second.  My mom got scared and we went in the house.  After the flash everything seemed normal.  My mom got a little nervous we went inside and watched though the windows.  We watched for about a half hour or so we never saw it take off. My mom never liked to talk much about it I guess because she could not explain to my satisfaction.

The lights were in a horizontal row with the middle light a little lower than the other two. They appeared not to be too high in the sky. The light in the middle went back and fourth between the other two. The two outer lights faded out and then the middle one did. About 15 to 30 minutes later another light showed up just west of where the others had been.

It was about 10:45 pm and I had just passed the Rosedale shopping mall when I glanced out the side window of my car.  I saw a craft emitting pale green light moving very quickly through the low clouds.  It was flying from east to west, toward downtown Minneapolis.  I watched it glide through the sky for a moment, but then I had to look back at the road to make a curve.  When I tried again to look for the light, it was gone. Because of the low clouds, I could not fully make out what the object was.  At first I thought it was a small plane, but it instantly struck me as different because it did not behave like a plane.  Its pale green light was steady, not blinking.  And it was moving at a low altitude so quickly and steadily, in an impossibly-perfect straight line.  I have never seen any plane do like this. And about 30 seconds after I saw this, my 17 year old nephew called me from St Paul MN on my cellular phone to tell me that he had just seen a UFO.  He described exactly what I had just seen--only he had gotten a better look at it. He was sitting outside on his front step in St Paul, and the craft crossed the sky at low altitude, from east to west.  He saw the same pale green light passing in and out of the low clouds.  But he got a good look at the craft -- it was triangular shaped, like an arrowhead.  And the pale green light was coming from lights along the edges that were long, more like fluorescent light tubes than like bulbs that you would see on a plane.  And the craft was perfectly silent. I believe my nephew and I saw the same craft, from vantage points about 10 miles apart, as it crossed the Twin Cities from St Paul to Minneapolis at low altitude.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

At that time, only the moon and a few of the brightest stars were visible (the moon was in the western sky opposite from this anomalous light). What caught my eye at first was the unusual orange tint, and as I trained my eyes on it, I saw it was moving slowly westward in my general direction. I wondered whether it could be a plane on a landing approach, but there was no noise and instead of having blinking navigational lights, the light intensity fluctuated (growing gradually brighter and then gradually dimmer every second or two). I continued to watch this pulsating orange light for about a minute, then it suddenly dimmed and disappeared completely. That struck me as very odd, since the sky was without a cloud that evening. I searched that area of the sky for another couple of minutes but the object didn&apos;t re-appear. Several other people were nearby, but apparently I was the only one there who noticed this anomolous light. As the light periodically brightened, it would become several times brighter than any star or planet in the sky at that time, including Sirius and Venus, which were also visible during this sighting.

Saturday evening September 2nd I saw what appeared to be a bright twinkling star to the northeast of my location.  As a former BioMedical Photographer I wished I had my camera and telescope to attempt to take some pictures. As I observed it more I thought it to be unusual due to the fact that the star didn&apos;t so much twinkle as it blinked in color between white, red and green.  I didn&apos;t give it much thought other than wishing I could take some pictures thinking it was Mars being so close to the earth this past August.  Sunday evening the 3rd of September a group of 6 were sitting on the porch at our cabin when a member pointed to the northeast sky and asked &quot;What in the world is that?&quot;  He was stunned at the appearance of what seemed to be a star blinking between the colors of white, red and green.  I mentioned to him and the rest of the group that I had seen the same thing the night before which was on going until I went to bed around 10 p.m.  The six of us sat that evening for hours debating what it could possibly be.  I am convinced it was just a star or planet but I am not convinced it was Mars.  Should Mars have not been more to the east or east-southeast of where we were?  What strikes me is upon observing it at 20:35 on Sunday evening until we all went to bed at 23:00 the position of the &quot;star&quot; had not changed.  The rotation of the earth in a 2.5 hour period should have put the position further west as the evening went on.  I do believe in UFO&apos;s due to the fact that me and my best friend saw one up close in the early 1980&apos;s.  I am not convinced this was a UFO but I am not convinced it is a star or a planet.

When they took off, they traveled from east to west, at  approximately  a 45 deg. angle from the horizon, gaining altitude at an amazing rate of speed.  From our view point, they appeared to be 30&apos; to 40&apos; feet in diameter and when they took off, they diminished to a speck in a forth of a second or less.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

The object seemed to be diamond shaped.  It was viewed through fairly high powered binoculars. The object remained stationary fairly high up in the sky for about 30 minutes after initial spotting.

I knew that it was too late (11:15pm MDT) for Venus to be above the horizon.  I started watching the white light because it got larger and brighter; it seemed to be traveling from SW to NE across the sky.  I could not judge the speed because I could not judge the height from the ground but it was not close to the ground.  As it got closer the bright, round light in the center appeared much larger than any planet but smaller than the moon.  At that point it had a halo or aura around it, the width of one side of the halo approximately the width of the bright light at the center.  I also noticed at this point what looked like white &quot;fireworks&quot; shooting up (?) from the circular object.  Then as the object got closer it appeared to evolve into 5 or 6 bright lights, more or less in a straight line, which continued on the SW to NE path through the sky.  I was still driving and lost sight of the lights as they appeared to go overhead.  The entire sighting lasted about two minutes.  I should also note that, just to be sure that I was not seeing some strange reflection in my side car window, I rolled the window completely down as I was driving, and still saw the lights. -------------  NOTES RECORDED LATER FROM MEMORY, ON OCTOBER 16, 2006:  When I drove that stretch of Hwy 50 again on Oct 14th, I decided that the timeframe was more likely one and one-quarter minutes to one and one-half minutes, not two minutes. Also, the physical description of the phenomenon is best related as five distinct appearances during the one and one-half minutes I saw it:  (1) Bright light on the horizon, just above the foothills to the southwest, when I first saw it; larger and brighter than a planet;  (2) Bright light with aura or halo around it;  (3) Bright light with aura, plus white streaks appearing to shoot out the top of it;  (4) As object continued to get closer, the white streaks (trails of light) in the sky then appeared in SW to NE lines rather than appearing to &ldquo;shoot out the top of it;&rdquo;  (5)  When the phenomenon was nearly overhead, it appeared as 4, 5 or 6 distinct, bright white lights, continuing on the SW to NE pathway.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and we consider her to be an excellent witness.

The person reporting this event was seated in the back seat of the vehicle.  The vehicle was driving on interstate 65, moving toward Chicago. The event began when the driver of the car sighted what looked like a large fireball was  falling from the sky.  The driver referred to the object as an extremely large meteorite, because the movement of the object and what appeared to be fire surrounding it resembed a meteor entering into the atmosphere.  After the object had fallen for about 1 minute, it came to a complete stop in the sky.  It was a pause of about 10 seconds, and then the single object broke into 5 separate large balls of light and moved into the shape of a pentagon.  The 5 lights moved as one for about another minute, and then they began to fly their separate ways across the sky.  The flight did not seem to have a distinct pattern at this time.  After watching the lights dance across the sky for the next few minutes, trees blocked the line of site of the passengers.  Once the vehicle was beyond the trees, the lights had vanished. A few minutes down the road, right around reaching Gary, the passengers all noticed a bright light, which put off much more light than an airplane or any other craft the passengers had seen, shoot from the left side of the sky to the right and paused.  This took less than 1 second to occur.  After the light had paused, it lowered altitude, paused for another second, shot straight up into the sky, and was gone.

It was either light in color or appeared so against the dark sky.

It was odd, though, because it didn&apos;t seem to be moving in any sort of wind as you would expect a balloon to do.

We would be very interested in knowing if there were other reports in the area.", "2 Fireballs of light - large and close followed by 2 red lights further in the distanceMy husband and I live in the hills of Los Angeles in a scetion called Glassel Park.  We were sitting watching television and all of a sudden outside our living room window we saw two fireball shaped lights just beyond the roof of the house next door.  What I saw was the balls of light zig zag down into view and then zip out of sight heading northwest. The objects were big and close and the movement would have made me think it was a bird or something, if it wasn&apos;t so clearly a ball of light about the size of a streetlamp maybe or a large softball. My husband saw the lights as bluish green and from his position in the room and he only saw them pass by the window.  We both jumped up but whe we got to the window there was nothing there. About 30 minutes later my husband saw 2 separate red lights, further in the distance, arc across the sky in the shape of a question mark (from top to bottom) and then disappear. The red lights appeared about a minute apart and also had the smooth fluid movement of the fireballs.", "well i was just really amazed.well me and my friend were camping in the moreno valley hills on saturday night.when we were just up in the middle of the night talking.all of a sudden we saww a big  object flying right over our heads. we asumed it was a plane cause we didnt look up at the moment so we just thought it was a airplane that was flying low.so then we kept talking but then like two minutes went by and we noticed that it was still right over our heads as we look up we saw a big round object I didn&apos;t know what to think.so my friend reached for his camera.when the camera just didn&apos;t wanna turn on.we got up and just stared my friend tried to throw a rock and the rock just came back down with out hitting the object.our observation of the object lasted for about ten minutes more the it just flew away but as it was flying away it just started to flash out of on little lamp on the side like it was taking pictures.", "I saw a real something in the sky. Clear as a bell and very interestingThe object was round. It looked as if it was spinning. Silver with flashes of light. Like a ball of spinning mercury. It was hovering over the house on the next rural block. Silent! It was a clear wonderfull morning. The background was the mountains so it shown very clear. This area is well known for activity. It is not the first time I have witnessed activity, but, the most disturbing. This sounds strange, but it noticed me. I noticed it. I felt a bit of mental presure. Sounds crazy I know. I was not scared, just concerned. The object was there for at least 5 min. I had time to call my partner and tell him. At one point it looked as if it was heading my way. This is when I felt the mental presure. My partner yelled at me to get the camera. My dogs had been unusually quiet untill now. All 10 started to howl (I have an informal dog rescue and no we are not trashy people). This is the point it started to head west into the mountains slowly. I went to get the camera and by the time I got it running, the object was gone. This is stranger. I started to get confused soon after this. I had to stop and center myself. I felt strange. I am a person who is never a victim of life, but I started to get confused and a bit forgetfull, like I wanted to, a bit of mental time slipage? I called my best friend. We talked. I felt fine. I then laid down for a nap with my dogs. I am o.k. I did not lose any time, but I did feel affected. I refuse to let them take me from the light. In retrospect. I think it was doing something over there. Something happened or an exchange took place, something not very nice. My gut is never wrong. I went over to talk to the neighbors. They refused to talk to me. This is rural desert, so that behavior is not unexpected. This is an area next to Goat Mountain and Giant Rock. The Integratron is not far away and 29 Palms Base is right to the east. The unusual weather, paranormal, and sightings are not uncommon during the year I have been here. I have personally talked to people who have been &quot;abducted&quot; in this area. We also see a lot of orbs as of late. I have been told we will have a quake soon by oldtimers. But, that is an other story. While I have the stage. I believe something big is going on. That is for sure. To all my friends out there. Hold yourself in the light (I am a Quaker). Center your self. I know people who have been very affected by events such as this and worse. This is our life, our world. Some call it prayer. Whatever, just empower your self. Do not be scared. Bad things are happening, also good too. You are not crazy. Do not be a victim. Best of luck. Please forgive any grammer and spelling mistakes. Thank you, DM", "The objects were doing some fancy manuvering as if to show off.  This included very quick 90 Deg. turns.The objects were out in space and I could not focus on them with the cheap field glasses I have.  All I could see is that the sun was reflecting off of them.I live out in the country where the houses are very far apart and we have many farms.  The area I live in is a route for commercial aircraft crossing Michigan to places such as Milwaukee, Chicago, Mineapolis, etc....It is very common to see as many as eight aircraft crossing at any one time.I have been a sky watcher since I was a young kid and have seen many odd things but I have never whitnessed any of the objects do what I saw them do last night.Four of them moved out into a larger perimeter, not symmetrical or anything, but seemed to move out to give the fifth some room.  The fifth UFO really started to cut it up. It moved in a straight line very quickly and them stopped.  Then it moved back to where it started very quickly and stopped.  Then it moved in a downward direction, stopped, then moved in an upward direction and stopped.  It then did a few sharp 90 degree movements as if it were testing the craft to see if it were at peak performance or showing off.  It did some really wide circular and egg shaped manuvers that seemed to be a few miles in diameter.  This looked like only a few inches to me but as far away as they were, I&apos;m sure it was at least a few miles for them.  It then started to do a random mixture of manuvers, accelerating very quickly and just having a ball, playing around.This went on for a good hour with a few rests in between.I am obviously not the only one to observe this behavior because all of the commercial air traffic stopped crossing the normal route.  I walked down off of my back porch into the middle of my back yard and could see a few of the aircraft doing a wide circle back in the direction of the Metro Airport and did not see any aircraft in the area of where the UFO was cutting up.  This is very unusual and it is rare not to see at least three aircraft at any one time crossing to the West or coming from the east.  This tells me that the air traffic was well aware of this UFO behavior going on.I watched until I could barely see the UFO&apos;s anymore as they moved off to the West.", "3 UFOs seen in one weekendI was standing outside at about 7:00 pm or so talking to a buddy when I saw something behind him. It was a light in the sky. It moved and changed directions extremely fast and then disappeared. I only saw it for a couple of seconds. The next morning I went outside to go get breakfast and looked in the sky to see a shiny object that appeared to be wobbling. It was hard to make out the shape but everytime it wobbled the sun would reflect off of it differently. It quickly disappeared while I was looking at it for about 1 minute. Later that day (the 1st of oct.) I was staring in the sky outside of my window when I saw airplane fly by. In the opposite direction of the plane was a ball moving through the sky. It was clearly a ball and I thought it was going to hit the plane but it didn&apos;t. It then disappeared out my vision from the window. When I went out side to take a look it was gone. I look out in the sky almost daily for UFO activity and know that Albuquerque doesn&apos;t have many spottings. I don&apos;t think it is a coincidence that I saw three here in that one weekend as well as many other people. I tried to get pictures but they didn&apos;t come out well.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))", "I was awakened from a deep sleep at about 3 AM to a very loud humming sound from above the house and outside my bedroom window.  I wondered what a plane would be doing hovering above my house, then realized that a plane wouldn&apos;t hover above my house.  I tried to get out of bed but was unable to move.  I wondered if my husband heard it, but I was unable to ask him.  The dog was also asleep on the bed and was completely undisturbed.  I kept trying to get up but it was as though a force was keeping me from moving.  I was never frightened, just curious as heck.  I heard a voice say, &quot;it&apos;s the train.&quot;  The train runs about a mile from my house and you can hear it in the distance, but it has never sounded like that and it does not run at night.  I am certain I was not dreaming this. I tried to believe it was the train and saw a picture of the train in my mind. I felt I was being pushed back into sleep by a strong energy.  I struggled to stay awake, but fell into a very deep sleep.  I awoke in the morning and remembered everything about the incident.  My husband heard nothing and said he had slept very deeply all night.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

It was much brighter than the other overhead passing aircraft and radio towers that could be seen at the same time. The large light was approx. a half mile up and blinking in a steady on-off pattern (just like turning a light bulb on and off). As we kept traveling North we could see that we were starting to see the other &quot;side&quot; of it since the light light was facing the road but were were passing it on the with it to our left. As we passed we could see a very large couple of red lights on lower and right of the other. The lower right one was also blinking. As we moved along we could see the light(s) were still just hovering and could make out all of them together. It seemed like it was a shape (possibly triangular) but the lights were too bright to say we saw what they were attached to. We lost sight of it due to trees and distance as we traveled. It looked as though other cars were watching it and slowing down since there was heavy traffic volume that evening heading North on 95.

We live in Fall City, a small rural community about 25 miles east of Seattle in the Cascade foothills.  We set up a tent, got our sleeping bags, pads, snacks, etc., and waited for dark - we had planned this for the previous week or so.  The moon is dark and sky was beautifully clear.  We were having a great time - saw 2 satellites and at least two shooting stars.  At about 9:40 p.m., my 7 year old declared that he was tired and went into the house.  About 5 minutes later, my 5 year old yelled look at that light (not star.)  The neighbor boy and I looked to the Northeast and saw a large, intense, white light moving from NW to SE.  The light was far brighter than any stars in the sky and was moving at a very deliberate pace - it took the light about 10-15 seconds to cross about 2/3&apos;s of our field of vision i.e. from the time we saw it until it went behind some adjacent trees.  I could not tell how high it was, but it appeared to be quite high up. There was no sound whatever and we live in a very quiet area.  At first I thought &quot;airplane.&quot;  But as I observed it, I came to the conclusion that it was not an airplane, certainly not any airplane I had ever seen before.  The light looked round and about the size of a BB if you hold it at arm&apos;s length.  It was a very clear, very steady white/blue color.  It did not blink, flicker, or attenuate in any way.  I was very impressed with the &quot;steadiness&quot; of the light.  It moved, as I noted above, very deliberately. That is the only way I can think to describe it.  The speed didn&apos;t appear to vary and it didn&apos;t appear to turn or change course in any way.  I know this must sound like a terrestrial aircraft of some sort, but I don&apos;t believe it was.  It was like a very large star moving through the sky, very bright, very intense, very very impressive.  It was not a meteor, at least not like one I&apos;ve ever seen before.   I am a geologi! st and have spent a great deal of time in remote areas and have observed the night sky constantly.  I have never seen anything like this before.  I do not drink or take drugs, ever.  My son and his buddy saw the same thing and we compared notes afterward.  I looked at my watch just as it went out of sight so that I would have a time reference.  I am really interested to see if anyone else saw this object.  This was a cool experience.((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of ISS.

Suddenly,a formation of 7 or 8 boomerang or arrowhead shaped objects appeared,flying north to south,from over our garage roof. The appearance was so striking and strange that each of us instinctively jumped out of our chair and actually stumbled over one another to get a longer look before they disappeared over our house and into the distance. They disappeared incredibly fast despite their altitude,we just looked at each other and said &quot;did you see that&quot;? They were brighty lit in a way I would describe as similar to a child&apos;s glowstick (white),appeared to be flying in synch with one another,in a V or L shaped formation,and appeared to be part of or lights on a larger transparent object.

The child said I just saw a UFO and he jumped out and ran inside scared to death. A few minutes later as the adults talked about how scared he looked, the child slowly comes back out and as we say, &quot; Come back in it was probably just a shooting star&quot;, he points back up and says &quot;There it is!&quot; and we all looked and saw a huge V shaped triangle made up of redish, dull, illuminated sections flying north. It was flying low and silent and fast about 1000 feet up. We were all in shock and after a few minutes of staring at the sky. We all went inside in amazment.

I love to look at the night sky, and this morning the sky was unusually clear and crisp. The *dark* side of the moon reflecting the &quot;bounce light&quot; of the earth was plainly evident - an astronomical phenomenon that until recent years was fairly rare, even here in the relatively unsullied skies of North Dakota - but now for some reason it is a very common sight. (Something very odd going on in that department!) Anyway, almost as soon as I looked up and almost directly overhead, I saw what I at first thought was a very bright planet - until, that is, I realized it was moving quite slowly on a roughly north to south trajectory. And very quickly after that realization the object swiftly flared brighter and brighter until I became rather alarmed - I would estimate its lumens quadrupled - and then suddenly its intensity dropped off as though somebody had thrown a switch, but it was actually still faintly visible via peripheral vision.  In other words to still see it after it flared out, I had to look slightly to the side of its trajectory. I&apos;m thinking it was a satellite of some sort reflecting the predawn sun as it rolled in orbit - it seemed to be at satellite height - but at the same time it seemed to move too slowly to fall into that category.  The brightness of the object when it flared was astonishing. This is the second time I&apos;ve seen this object (or something similar) flaring overhead. About two weeks ago, I witnessed pretty much the same event, only I believe it was a couple hours earlier in the am, and both times the event occured almost as soon as I&apos;d looked up into the sky!

I got out my 600,000 candle power spot light and would flash my light at it and the one on the left seem to shine its light back at me a hold it there as long as I did. This went on for 35 minutes. I have no idea what these things were but I&apos;m 54 years old and have been around planes and coppers and I know it was neither.At one time when I saw lights I called the Cody airport and ask if a plane just took off and they told me no, the tower is close after dark and it&apos;s land at your own risk. I have talked with others that have seen the same lights here for years no one knows what they are. When ever I see these lights they seem to hover in one place for about 15 minutes or so then move very slowly to the left or right then disappear in a blink of an eye.I wish there was some way or someone to call to report this as it happens so we could find out what they are.

I kept my eye on it as I tried to come up with a rational explanation for what it could be, but the longer I watched it, the more erratic it&apos;s movements became.  It would stop, change directions, hover, and it did appear to move at different speeds.  At one point, it disappeared behind a cloud, but it reappeared momentarily.  It was either too small or too far away for me to actually be able to tell what it was, like I said, I thought it was just a star until it started moving.

The time was 5:40 a.m. I looked out my bedroom window, that looks out to the East, and saw a huge bright yellow light, that was hanging in the sky. The light wasen&apos;t moving,so I grabbed my digital camera, that also takes videos. My bedroom, is on the second floor, so I could see this bright yellow light very well.  The distance was very hard to determine,I put it just in front of the mountains.  I don&apos;t have a tripod,so as you know, it&apos;s very hard to capture something in the night sky.  The craft started moving, and I said to myself &quot;come this way.&quot;  I was surprised, it did come my way, straight towards me,  that&apos;s when I started to video this bright light. The digital camera I have, doesn&apos;t give me the greatest quality, but, as  you can see, there is something there in this video. As I videoed this craft flying towards me, I took the camera away from my eye, to see just how far away this craft was,I was shocked to see it was almost to my house. This story sounds hard to believe, but, it&apos;s definitely is the truth. I&apos;m sorry I had the screen on the bathroom window, because, when I took the pictures of this craft, flying over my head, the flash on the camera was set on automatic, so it went off, and it left me with a picture of the screen,and the reflection of the flash.  But, I did manage to get a good picture of it, from my bedroom window, which also shows smaller white objects attached to it.  The video is also empressing. This craft was silent, except for a very low rumbling, or roaring sound., and the size had to be at least 100 feet in lenght,and at least 150 to 200 feet wide across the back.  It was pitch black,so it does make the size hard to determine.  If anything, it might have been larger.  When this &quot;FANTASTIC&quot; craft, flew over my house and yard, I saw that the tip of this craft, came to a sharp point, and, was not rounded. There were large circular lights on the bottom, that started from just behind the nose, then ran horizontally, across the bottom.  There were 3 or 4 rows of these circular lights. The colour of the lights were of a dim off white, with a tinge of yellow.  There was also, a tiny green light,thatI noticed just off to the right side of the craft,but it didn&apos;t look like it was attached to it. There appeared to be a black void between the craft, and this small green light. The lights didn&apos;t reflect off the bottom,they looked like they might have been recessed,and I could see what appeared to be something, that looked like grill work, or something, that looked like that over the lights. This huge craft crossed the street, and headed West,and as slow as it was traveling, which I failed to mention,was about 25 to 30 miles per hr. &quot;IMAGINE THAT?&quot; What was also incredible, was how it banked to the left to go South, without slowing down, or speeding up.  It was as if it pivoted on the left tip, and came round,so that the front of the craft moved to the South. It continued to fly South, over the top of the high hill, across the street from me. I lost sight of it, as it past behind a tall tree that is in my yard, but I could still see the lights that showen through that tree, as it continued traveling South, until it was completley out of my sight.

The night was very clear -- having very few light clouds in the sky.  I can&apos;t remember the moon, so it must not have been very visible at that time.  I was sitting in the house, watching a television program while perusing through old newspapers.Now, Mom is quite a skeptic in UFOs, so it was rather surprising for her to come inside and ask me if I could identify what planet was shining up in the northwest.  I wasn&apos;t up-to-date on what celestial events were happening that night, so I just went to look and see what she was questioning.  When I went onto the back porch, I could immmediately see a very bright white light in the northwest corner of the sky -- about 40-45 degree angle from the horizon.  Mom told me she had been watching this light for quite a few minutes before coming to get me, so her interest was sparked.  As I watched the light I noticed it was slowly moving toward us.  Mom was hesitant about my saying it was moving, since she had watched it for so long.  However she did notice the movement after a few seconds.  The light headed straight in our direction (southeast from it&apos;s original point) at a rather steady pace -- somewhat the same as a plane coming into landing.  (We live just a few miles from Baton Rouge Metropolitan Airport, so we do know what planes look like and recognize landing lights or directional/warning lights.)  There were no blinking lights alongside the one bright light, so we were baffled.  As the light came nearer to the house -- still traveling in a southeast direction -- we noticed the strangest thing of all -- there was no sound coming from the object.  NO SOUND!  And the object was coming just over the house.As it passed directly over our house, I noticed something rather startling -- two smaller lights suddenly appeared behind the bright light.  This aspect gave the shape of the object a triangular appearance.  I was stunned!  Mom was rather excited, since she had never witnessed anything like this before -- especially taken by the fact of no sound coming from the object.  The object passed over the edge of the house&apos;s roofing, so I ran through the house to the front door -- about five seconds timing.  When I got out the front door to look where the object was going, it had disappeared.  The view from the front road to the night sky is rather wide, so I was surprised not to be able to see the object anymore.A couple of days later, we were mentioning this to my younger sister, who had worked at the Port of Greater Baton Rouge at that time.  She was excited, because a co-worker (both security guards) had told her of a very strange light which had played around the port for a few minutes.  The original witness had thought it was a helicopter -- except for the fact there was no sound coming from the object.I had asked for my sister to have this witness write her story down, but the witness was too frightened to do so.  This is why I am reporting this sighting now -- on August 21, 2006.", "UFO unvisible to naked you caught on high exposure photo.Beautiful night.

As I slowed to stop before turning onto the road, I looked in my rearview mirror and saw something flying very quickly in the distance--it would have been like I was looking over my right shoulder.  At first, the sun glinting on the object made it catch my eye.  At first I thought it was a ballon and was catching the sun funny, but then it began to get closer, and I could see it was too large and moving too fast.  However, it was too small to be a plane, and too low and too fast.  The object flew over and above the trees and to the right.  By this time, I had turned onto the road, but I had slowed down to look, and two other cars had slowed also--so it wasn&apos;t just me.  I tried to make myself think it was a sophisticated R/C toy of some kind, but it was too big for that.  It was very, VERY quickly gone.  This whole incident was 1-2 minutes in length. The object (I got a brief good look when it was overhead) was chevron/triangular shaped, with steady lights at each corner and (I think) some moving lights between the corners.  It was silent and, as I&apos;ve said, small and fast.  I did tell some others, and we thought it might be an experimental military device.  I think it was too small for anyone/thing to be in it.

Harmon, a 48-year-old grain elevator operator at Providence Farm Supply, believes he had a close encounter with a UFO on Monday night outside his home in the 600 block of Wayland. &ldquo;Never in my life have I seen anything like this,&rdquo; Harmon said. &ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t know what I saw.&rdquo;  Harmon was in the middle of watching Monday Night Football when he stepped outside. &ldquo;I stepped out in the backyard to smoke a cigarette and happened to be looking up because it was such a pretty night,&rdquo; Harmon recalled. From out of nowhere, Harmon encountered lights like he had never seen before. &ldquo;From the edge of the house, something came over. It was in a perfect V-shape. There were seven distinctive yellowish-white lights,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen UFO programs where people have drawn this exact same picture.&rdquo;  Harmon said the lights weren&rsquo;t flashing or changing colors, and &ldquo;weren&rsquo;t moving real fast. &ldquo;Unless it was a mile wide, this thing was pretty close to the ground, maybe 1,000-2,000 feet.&rdquo;  Harmon said he saw the object, which was moving east, for about 4-5 seconds before it disappeared behind a tree. He hurried around the tree but never saw the lights again. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if you had to be right under it&rdquo; to see the lights or what, he said. Harmon found it especially interesting that whatever the object was did not make any noise. &ldquo;The thing that got me the most was it was dead silent,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I was dumbfounded.&rdquo;  Harmon immediately called TV stations in Lubbock to see if they had heard of any strange object in the skies over Plainview. None had. &ldquo;I was truly curious if anybody else in the area saw anything.&rdquo;  Harmon was supposed to call the person at KLBK back after the 10 o&rsquo;clock newscast, but after telling his two teenage sons and brother-in-law about his encounter, &ldquo;we got to talking about it and I never called them back.&rdquo;  And what did his family think about his story?  &ldquo;My 16-year-old (Dustin) said he had never seen me act this way about anything before,&rdquo; Harmon said. &ldquo;My 18-year-old (John) was kind of looking at me like these farmers have been.&rdquo;  Those farmers were customers at Providence Grain Supply on Tuesday morning when Harmon was telling his story to anyone who would listen. &ldquo;I feel like the person on the (TV) program&rdquo; trying to convince people they saw something. &ldquo;These farmers are getting a kick out of it, but I know I saw something.&rdquo;  Harmon did a good enough job convincing his boss, Glen Graves, that he saw something. Graves did some research on the Internet and found a picture taken Oct. 16 in Croatia that Harmon said &ldquo;was the same-looking deal, just a little fuzzier than what I saw.&rdquo;  Harmon, who moved here about a year ago from Dallas, was married to the late Lisa Daffron, a Plainview native who died July 26, 2005. &ldquo;My wife used to be an (astronomy) buff. We had a couple of telescopes.&rdquo;  Harmon is hoping somebody else in town saw what he witnessed Monday night, if for no other reason to confirm to disbelieving friends that he, in fact, saw something up there. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m starting to doubt myself a little, but I know I saw something.&rdquo;", "Two &quot;Dancing&quot; lights rising from the east traveling upwards over Lihue, Kauai just after 1:00 am 30 Sept.Two pale blue-green lights were spotted appraching from the east (from direction of Lihue airport).

I pointed it out to my friend just as one of the lights seemed to pendulum-swing from the light above it and shadow it in a dog-fight like formation.  The lights seemed to almost be connected and seemed to bounce off each other and overlap or collide like two balloons dancing.  The lights went westward over the sky as they appeared to gain altitude until they disappeared straight over ahead within a minute of their first appearance.", "What I thought was a helicopter made no noise as it flew over my car.It was late at night and I was driving alone across Kansas on my way to California.

I thought it was a medivac unit going to evacuate accident victims. As the low flying craft approached and went over and past my car, it made no noise. I remember looking into my rear view mirror and saying out loud, &quot;why didn&apos;t that thing make any noise, what the heck is that thing.&quot;  Interestingly, I forgot about the incident until at least 6 years later. Somehow the memory came back to me during a discussion about ufo&apos;s with my son. It&apos;s sort of like remembering a dream and not remembering something that actually took place.", "Dayton,Oh. Very bright round objects in a group of 10, then 2 very different shapes,and 1 stationary object,Seen in the skies of Centerville, Ohio on Oct. 6, 2006.  It was around 6pm, the weather was beautiful, completely blue, clear skies.  My 2 sons, ages 10 and almost 12 came running inside to tell me (their mom) to come outside and see these strange objects in the sky. The objects made no sound. My sons told me they saw a group of 10 very bright circular shapes, then 5 of them darted off. My 10 yr old was visibly shaking and very scared.  When I came outside I kept saying, &quot;where boys&quot;?  I looked up above my apt. and I saw 2 very different BRIGHT objects!  These 2 objects were very CLOSE!  It was not like a jet in the sky, this was CLOSE. On the left was a bright pulsating round object, on the right was a completely different shape.  The second had a circle shape on top, in the middle was oval shaped and the bottom was triangular. Both shapes were pulsating a VERY bright light. It lasted maybe 10 seconds.  Then they vanished.  I was so astonished and amazed, that I called the non-emergency number at our local police station.  They took my information and had an officer come out.  The officer came and briefly talked to me about what me and my kids saw.  She said there were no other reports.  Then, maybe a few minutes later, my friend came over.  She is around 40 yrs of age, like me.  I told her what happened and maybe 10 to 15 minutes later, there was ANOTHER strange, very bright shape off in the distance,in the sky.  Now, this object was stationary, not moving.  But, we noticed there were 5 aircraft circling the skies, obviously checking this object out!  This was NOT normal to have planes just circling around a object.  WE then walked over to 3 other neighbors who also witnessed this!  They made jokes, but could not explain what it was.  Then, my friend, her son, and my 2 sons (we ALL saw this), got into her car and drove at least 1 to 2 miles down the road.  This object was heading west.  The entire time she was driving, I could see this stationary object, while airplanes were obviously ! circling around.  At one time, I believe it looked like a straight line,and also like a crescent shape.  As it got darker, the object seemed to be getting lower and lower and we could no longer see it.  Also, the stationary object had a red tint to it, but we think it was because of the sunset. Before it was just like a star, but obviously NOT a star. When I returned home, I even called the TV station.  But, they too said no calls were made about any such sightings. My kids are very honest people, as I am.  We saw something that was not ordinary or easily explained.  I have no idea what it was, but the 3 objects I personally saw have me astonished.  The 2 objects that I initially saw (above my apt.) were the most amazing to me. Especially because of the pulsating light and shape of the 2nd object.  My kids were the only ones to see the group of 10 bright objects, and I saw the 2 different shaped objects vanish before my eyes. I can not explain what it could be, but I have been feeling very frustrated because I want to know the explanation. I want to know why there were at least 5 US aircraft circling the skies around this stationary object!! I will probably never find out why. This experience has me totally in awe of our universe, even more so now. One last bit of information.  My youngest son told me that when he got off the school bus, he saw 1 bright circular object, but it vanished.  He said he didn&apos;t say anything at the time, because he thought his mind was playing tricks on him.  This happened 3 hours before we began seeing these objects.  Very strange indeed.

I was using a Sony Handicam on a tripod, taking a shot of a large metal sculpture, zooming out.  A blob of light is seen coming from the top-center of the frame, gets slightly brighter, then fades out quickly.  This first ufo is visible for perhaps a few seconds.  Then, a few seconds later, in the same shot, another blip of white light seems to appear from somewhere behind the sculpture, and streaks toward the left and up slightly, very quickly, lasting maybe less than a second. A jet plane (can&apos;t tell if it&apos;s commercial or military) is also in the shot, its vapor trail clearly visible.  It seems to be climbing at a rather steep angle of ascent, but I&apos;m not sure. I have the original digital tape and an uncompressed .AVI file of the relevant footage that&apos;s about 40 megs.

I looked out my window because it&apos;s a cloudy day with the rain we had during the night and early morning. I saw a solid white unknown air craft flying at a high rate of speed at a very high altitude. It did not have any reflection like a commercial airliner does, and neither the shape. It was like a circle shape but had more of an edge toward the front. This object did put out a stream behind it but the stream went away just as fast as it came out. And the object appeared to be climbing higher in altitude.I watched it fly through the clouds until I could see it no more.", "I witnessed a disk-shaped craft, with colored lights, move very slowly towards the northwest, in Clark County, Kentucky.This event transpired about 30 years ago and I am unsure of the exact date.  It was probably early spring or late autumn of 1976, but I could be off by a year either way.  The temperature was in the low 50&apos;s and the leaves were off the trees, which is why I believe the season was early spring or late fall. My sister had been out at a bowling alley with a friend of hers, and her friend&apos;s mother.  In the early evening, but well after sunset, she returned home, and burst in through the front door in a state of excitement.  She announced that they had been followed by a UFO while driving to our home (which at that time was a couple of miles out in the country).  I said, &quot;gee, I wish I&apos;d seen it&quot;, to which she replied, &quot;well, you probably still can.  Go look out my window!&quot;  I ran to her bedroom, and looked out the window, which faced the northwest...and I could clearly see the disk.  It was about 65 to 70 feet in diameter, and perhaps 5 to 6 feet thick.  It hovered about 150 feet up.  It was moving very slowly, perhaps only 4 mph, roughly toward the northwest.  The disk had lights on its edge; I saw red, green, blue, and white.  They lit up in sequence, moving from right to left along the edge of the craft.  Because of the timing of the lights, I gained the impression that the lights would have been present all around the disk, but I only saw the edge that was facing me.  Each light would blink on for about a 1/2 second, then off, and its neighbor to the left would blink on, etc.  The night was clear and my view of the craft was quite sharp, but I did not perceive any other features of the craft besides the lights. At no time did I hear any sound from the craft. The disk continued to recede away from me, toward the northwest.  I watched it for perhaps 5 minutes, and then I left the room. I have had an acute interest in military aircraft since early childhood, and I know enough about aircraft to realize that this was not an airplane or a jet, and it certainly wasn&apos;t a weather balloon.  It was travelling at a rate far below the stall speed of any normal aircraft, hardly greater than the normal walking pace of a human.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It seemed to circle around the objects which where flying in a &quot;V&quot; pattern.

South of Richmond, but north of Berea.  All four of us saw an object overhead, directly in front of us, with an apparant altitude of a few hundred feet.  The size cannot be estimated because the actual altitude could not be determined, as there were no clouds or hills, mountains, etc., behind the object..  The object was round, and glowing with a white color, giving an appearance similar to that of a floresent light, but round, i.e. a circle shape.  At that time, so far as I was aware, flouresent lights were only tube shaped, whether straight, or sometimes bent into a circle.  I am referring only to the type of light produced by the object.  The object had an apparant size larger than a full moon, and the brightness was similar to that of a full moon on a clear night.  It was definitely NOT, however, the moon.  The object was hovering, moving very slowly from east to west.  As we watched, the object suddenly accelerated to a speed far faster than it would seem would be possible within the laws of physics, and moved beyond the western horizon so quickly that it was virtually instantaneous.  At the point of the sighting, we were going down a long slope on the interstate, and the terrain was such that there was a very wide, unobstructed view toward the western horizon, of several miles. &quot;Accelerted&quot; is actually not the correct word, because &quot;acceleration&quot; implies that the speed increased from a slow speed to a faster speed through a process of going faster and faster.  To the contrary, the object appeared to have NO TRANSITION from the slow east to west hover to a speed which covered miles from our location to the western horizon in, perhaps, a hundreth of a second. The four of us agreed that we would not report the incident because of the ridicule that we would probably suffer. About six years after the sighting, I saw a newspaper story in the Louisville Courier-Journal newspaper about a professor at Eastern Kentucky University, which is located in Richmond, who was gathering information about a large number of unexplained UFO sightings in the Richmond area over the previous several years.  The article pointed out that the US Army Bluegrass Depot, a storage area for nerve and other weapons grade gases, and perhaps other weapons, is located just south of Richmond.  I wrote to the professor, telling him about  the sighting in 1969, and offering to meet with him if he wished  He returned my correspondence, saying to contact him if I was in Richmond in the future, but did not seem anxious to hear the details of the sighting.  I never met with him.

But I want to make my report in case others in the area saw something, the same thing or more and can confirm it wasn&apos;t a fancy mylar baloon. Would also like to add my husband and I were the witnesses and we both wrote our descriptions of what we saw and little diagrams within 5 minutes after the incident so the details would be fresh.We were driving down Vista way, past the theater area and saw a black object in the sky. It was about 6:30 pm so the sky was still well lit with the sun just only starting to set. I did see a small plane in the area, like one of those itty bitty 2 seater ones.The object was black, didn&apos;ty seem shiny in any way, seemed rather small and high up. It looked like it was in my opinion either changing shape or rotatinging and the effect was it looked like it was changing shape. (If this was a mylar baloon maybe it was spinning producung the same effect??) Both of our first impressions was that it seemed like roundish and then more ovalish, flatter, like it was wobbling or changing shape. If it was changing shape or spinning it wasn&apos;t doing it at a high speed but was slow.We pulled over into a parking lot and got out of the car and looked up at the object. It was then we noticed an orangish spot, or light on one side of the object. I couldnt tell if it was a light or not.My husband&apos;s opinion of the orange light was that maybe it was a reflection off the top of the object from the sun that was low in the sky, but he wonders why the bottom of the object wasn&apos;t orange too if this was the case , and maybe the darkness of the bottom of the object was the actual colour of the object.We were both frustrated about not being able to see more details clearly when I remembered we keep a small pair of binnoculars in the glove box, they&apos;re a cheapo pair and don&apos;t magnify very much but would be better then nothing, we were leaning against the car while watching the object so it only took a few seconds to grab the binnoculars, my husband looked away from the sky for even less time then I did and when looked back the object was gone. Just gone, weird timing on the binocular thing but maybe it was a coincidence. If it was a balloon we saw then maybe it popped? We spent another few minutes looking around  to see if maybe we just lost sight of it but never saw it again. The object was sharply defined against the pale sky so it wouldnt have been hard to see if we had just lost track of where it was. Also the object to our eyes seemed to be in a fixed position the whole time we saw it (which made us doubt the balloon theory a bit) It didn&apos;t seem to be climbing in altitude either.", "Don&apos;t believe in ufo&apos;s ,But here is what I saw.

Times and altitude are to the best of my recollection. I didn&apos;t make note of the possible significance of this incident until later in that day. We were flying in an Airbue A319 at 36,000 ft. about 2 hours before (east of) Sacramento, Calfornia. United has Air Traffic Control (ATC) piped over audio channel 9 so you can listen with head phones. ATC called out to another passenge plane who was flying at 33,000 feet that there was &quot;traffic&quot; at his 10:00 o&apos;clock position and about 1000 feet above him at 5(?) miles. The pilot responded that he was looking.  ATC called again and said the &quot;traffic&quot; was about 2 miles and now almost at his altitude.That he should descend 200 or 300 feet, and to report the traffic when in sight.The pilot said he was looking and then exclaimed that he saw him and that he just passes to the left of him very close and that he really saw &quot;him&quot; and stumbled and hisitated like he wanted to say more but held his tongue. Shortly after that, ATC calls out to &quot;ALL aircraft flying between 30,000 and 40,000 feet to report in, state their altitude and ID themselves, I assume that ment to set a specific IFF code on their transponders. About 10 aircraft called in  and then there was silence for a short while before the normal ATC chatter started back up.. Local Sacramento time was about 09:00. After thinking about this I thought this may have been the case of an unknown flying object, with no flight plan or nor IFF. Initial thought that a hijacked plane at 33,000 feet rather that a UFO.

We arrived just as the sun began to sink below the horizon, and decided to sit and watch the stars come out.  I attempted to take some photos with my digital camera of the sun setting; only to find that when the flash would go off we noticed several small particals, for lack of a better term, all around us.  When the flash would go off we could clearly see these particals, they appeared white.  Upon viewing the pictures taken the particals appeared as multi-colored specks of light. We thought nothing more of it dismissing it as some freak occurance. After the first hour or so it became quite dark and I noticed a bright solid white light moving across the sky, I watched it intently knowing full well it was NOT an airplane (no flashing lights of any kind) and thought it was simply an orbital satalite.  The object flew across the sky in a West to East trajectory and as it crossed over where we sat the light grew in brightness and then quickly vanished. I figured it was just another random sighting, and hadn&apos;t had time to ask my boyfriend if he&apos;d seen it as well, so I though nothing more of it. I&apos;d say about twenty minutes later I noticed another solid light, not as bright moving from the North to the South. It flew over head at a high altitude and as it did so my boyfriend pointed to it and asked if it was in fact moving.  As I was about to reply in the affirmative, the light stopped.  It hovered for several minutes and then moved quite rapidly back from the South to North. This light continued to move from N to S and then back again.  It would stop and hover above us for several minutes and then continue on it&apos;s path. Over the next several hours we counted at least sixteen more lights in the sky.  All moving in random patterns at different altitudes.  The objects would move, stop, hover, zig-zag, and change direction mid-flight.  They would form triangle shapes with stars and then increase and decrease the sizes of these triangles at will.  At 11:00 p.m. there was a bright light that came over the horizon and proceeded to follow in the same manner, the only differences were this one was closer and much brighter, and along with the solid white light there were mulitcolored lights that flashed in random patterns.  We watched this light for quite some time marveled in the way it danced and at it&apos;s brightness.  It was then that we noticed two pairs of faint lights moving in perfect unison.  One pair was located to the South and the second was to the NorthEast. They seemed to dance across the night&apos;s sky in a most beautiful and random fashion.  None of the lights would stray too far from where they were first seen.  They would move a certain distance and then return to their original location. We spent a great deal of time trying to determine if it was simply ours eyes that were playing tricks on us, watching stars to see if they moved; and found nothing.  We spotted planes of vairous sizes and knew that this was not the explaination either.  I have over the years seen many strange lights in the night sky, but this was the first time I had ever seen so many lights at the same time in the same area.  This was also the first time I have ever had a witness with me to collaborate my sighting.", "Fast moving ball of light speeds across the sky.I was standing in my front yard finishing my smoke when I looked up at the aky as I usually do, its gorgeous!  Anyways, I saw a bright light moving East.  I&apos;ve seen these lights before sitting with ,y parents in the back yard and we were all amazed at its speed but this one was different because it stayed in straight.  The others we saw would sort of wander around in the sky.  As soon as it seemed pretty much directly overhead, it got really bright. At least 3 or 4 times its original brightness, then it dulled back out and continued its path. It never stopped or slowed down. It just faded off into thew distance, I figured after seeing so many I should try to figure out what they are.  The whole thing took about one to one and a half minutes.  Not long. And it was only slightly bigger than a start so it was moving very fast to cover that much distance in that amount of time. Probably not a plane cuz it didn&apos;t flah, but Vance Air Force Base is right across the highway so i cant be sure.  I dont know what they have in the airways. It just didnt seem like a plane could be that high or get that bright.  Also, I heard what sounded like a jet very far off in the distance as it passed and for a short time after, but like i said, we got Vance right here, could have been night training.", "Bright light moved across the sky for 5 minutes, seen from Paradise Valley campground in Forest, Ontario, Canada.Started at one end of the sky (NW), moved across to the other side (SE) in approximately 5 minutes.

When it reached the other end of the sky, it disappeared.", "saw between pine trees while driving, flew from left 2 right, centered then flew straight and disappearedwhile driving up Mt.Holomontas , which i think is the tallest in the Halkidiki region of Greece i was recording on video on my cell phone the pine trees.

NE to SW, lasting approx. 30 to 45 seconds.On September 24, 2006, My wife and I were outside in our backyard taking advantage of a cool, clear night to look at the stars...as we gazed up we suddenly observed a V-shaped craft cross directly overhead...It appeared to be moving in excess of Mach 1 and was totally silent. I asked my wife if she could see what I was seeing and she confirmed and added that it apeared to have a vague, almost translucent disc shape around the craft itself. It moved in a straight line from approx. NE to SW. We estimate that it was anywhere from 1000 feet to 5000 feet, maybe lower and appeared to be the same size a DC-3 or Lear jet would be at the same altitude. Since we were directly under it, all we observed was the bottom of the craft which appeared milky, almost cloud-like in color. There were no lights on the craft at all, either running  lights or spotlights. It blocked out the stars as it passed overhead and there were no clouds to be observed...it was a &quot;severe clear&quot; night. The sighting lasted approx. 30 to 45 seconds until it disappeared into the light pollution to the south of us. Again, we observed no sound from the craft and we live in a very quiet part of town so there was nothing to interfere with our hearing anything unusual. There were no other witnesses.", "luminous oval spotted, low in skyWhile travelling state route 159 south, about an hour after dusk, my wife and I both saw a football shaped object with approximately the same luminosity of a full moon. It was not brightly lit, but more luminous; a yellow/brown hue. We both spotted this object for a few seconds before it dimmed and then disappeared as quickly as it appeared. As I was driving, my wife was better able to focus on the object. She reports that she could see the outline of the object briefly after the light dimmed. The object was oval, almost football shaped. I could not really judge the height, but it seemed much lower than any commercial aircraft in the area, maybe a couple thousand feet. It was static in the sky. No movement was detected, and no sound was heard. This did not appear to be aircraft, and definitely did not appear to be a gas filled balloon. The shape, position and luminesence remained static until it quickly faded before disappearing.", "6 orbs moving in formation high above the atmosphereI was looking up at the sky, I noticed a new set of stars, I thought it was because the new solstice was comming or something and the constalations were changing. As i looked at these &quot;stars&quot; they began to move irraticaly, the main formation was one sphere in the center surrounded by 5 other Spheres evenly but they were all pretty much moving in sync. Judging by the speed of the objects and the distance they traveld (which wasnt a long distance) i would say these objects were atleast 3 miles above the atmosphere.

He has a UFO story that I think needs to be told just in case someone else out there might have been a witness can come forward with more info. He tells this story over and over without any discrepancies in his story. At times he gets excided when he tells it because he relives the experience. He has forgotten the exact time the encounter happened and to the best of his knowledge he thinks it was about Nov. 1978 but is possible could be a few years off. He happened to be working in a cotton gin in a town called Arvana, Texas just NE of Lamesa, Texas.  He remembers being out one evening in the field driving a truck when off to the horizon coming to him drifting over the trees was a spinning disk object with lights around. He got really spooked and took off fast across the field bouncing around until he got to the cotton gin. He jump out of the truck with the truck still rolling and went in and told his boss and others and they all came out and saw the spinning craft drift to the side of the gin across Hwy 87. People where really spooked at this site and some went back inside. Also some people in their cars on the hwy stopped and people got out of their cars and where looking at this low spinning disk. It was about 500 Ft high with spinning lights all around...yellow, red, and blue. Then it slowly began to pull up and then a bright beam of light shot down from the center as it moved up. My step father then said the cotton gin&apos;s power and the machinery inside then just died off and shut down. Then the craft pulled up higher and the white beam of light turned off and then it shot upward like a bullet till it was out of sight. The power at the cotton gin then came back on. He tells me of another story that happened around Odessa and Andrews, Texas. He had heard of a farmer who would see this craft on a regular bases follow the power lines toward the mountains from west Texas toward the New Mexico but his memory of the story and the details are almost gone. He had heard one farmer saw this craft and reported it and the police came out. They did not believe this farmer. He said even some military folks where there but they really doubted the farmers story. Just then a rancher driving to his ranch stopped by to see what all the commotion was about. After they told him he said oh yea...he would the the craft ride above the power lines toward the mountains all the time. I talked to some other people and they also claim to have seen a spinning craft follow low and close behind them one evening as they where between Sweetwater and Abilene, Texas on Interstate 20 back in the 80&apos;s so maybe there is or was a craft  that hung around west Texas in the 70&apos;s and 80&apos;s((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

As it was going up, another light seemed to come out of nowhere and &quot;chase&quot; the first light. There were then three of these lights, circling and moving. I ran to the house and got my wife. She immediately saw the same thing and saw 3 or 4 more lights moving in the sky. I thought the initial light was a sattelite, but then it was joined by the second light that was moving in different directions. I thought that it may have been jet fighters training, but there was no visible contrail or any sound and they all seemed to vanish at the same time.((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witness might have observed the flare of an Iridium satellite, followed by another satellite in the same area of the sky.

I noticed a  white movement out the window. I jumped out of bed saying &quot;What it that?&quot; &quot;What isss that?&quot; My husband stirred. It looked like 4-5 very large thin oval shapes, directly in a line, low in the sky heading east, I was looking south. The movement was just slightly south/east. There were long thing clouds in the sky, it was clear. It seemed bright- mostly from the not full moon but also from the light. There was no sound.

I couldn&apos;t believe it. I descibed this to my husband. The next few days I could not let it go. I went to a UFO sightings website (something I had never done before)and looked for sightings. Several people descibed seeing something similar at about the same time and day. I did not report my sighting. But then, Saturday, I read the Friday Colorady Daily newspaper, where there was an article about a man who is a meteor hunter. It stated he searched for marble-size rocks in a 50-mile strip of Colorado.There was a picture of him holding a piece of the meteorite that occured on Oct. 1, 2006. One of the brightest meteors reported in recent years slow-danced across Arizona, New Mexico, and Colorado. Apparantly landing south of Colorado Springs.

I was driving at the speed of 45 mph the weather was clear and sunny with one or two very small low clouds in the sky; temperature was approx. 70 degrees. As I was heading east towards the Garden State Parkway what caught my attention was a very bright shimmering light it was far away in the sky and I would say it would be approx. 10:00 angle. I did not hear any sound, I can describe it as a long cigar shaped elongated and it appeared to be hovering. The object was definitely a solid I didn&rsquo;t see anything else on the object except for it was a bright shimmering light. I stared at it for approx. 7 seconds then I blinked my eye and it was gone, I have no idea what direction it took or if it had a direction, there was no trail. I surveyed the sky for the object and it was not seen again. &ldquo;It was a very clear day&rdquo; On Lacey Rd the road is a two lane road East to West with low trees very much of an open area.

This shimmered while I was driving then disappeared. I would like to add that I could not explain the sighting I&rsquo;m just saying it was definitely strange nothing like I saw before. Where we live we have airlines flying over us to Newark Liberty which I would say the flight pattern and I see airlines all day and yes they reflect the sunlight but not for 7 sec&rsquo;s while I was driving and the plane would fly at the least 200 mph or more I would like to know if any one saw something strange also in this area.", "I noticed a very white tail behind an object traveling north in the southern sky. It appeared to be very high and far away. The object I could not make out, but the white tail showed up clearly against the blue sky and was perhaps 5 times as long as it was wide. The most notable feature was that the white tail did not trail out into a vapor cloud like a contrail behind a plane. It ended sharply, without a residual mark in the sky. After watching it for a couple of minutes, the white tail disappeared. For a few more seconds, I could see a tiny bright dot with the same path that looked like sunlight reflecting off of metal, then I could not see anything there at all.

The objects looked like they fell into the lake and one of the objects was spiriling as it appeared to fall.

I walked to my back door to look outside to see if this object was around again because I have seen this numerous times, and guess what? It was and it was in almost the same spot as it has been every time. **************************************** I was facing to the West and this object was about at a 45 degree angle. ( It is always to my Westerly direction), anyway it just hung there for a good solid 30 minutes with its colored lights flashing but on this night I noticed that to the North of my house there was also another star like object that had colored flashing lights too just like the other one. There was also lots of plane and jet activity in the area and these lights were NOT one of those.******************************************* So this West light after hanging there slowing moved away toward the West North direction. As it moved away it still appeared the same. It had the same lights flashing. Either it was rotating or it was backing up. And as I have said before. This can NOT be a helicopter because it does not make any noise and it has been about a 1000 feet away from the house. Now the other light to the North of the house just dissapeared. You can hear a helicopter coming a mile away especially where I live. I live in a farm area with few houses around. So this is why I know that these lights are NOT helicopters.********************************************* Then on Monday around 01:00 I saw this yellow light coming at an extremly fast pace from the West and it just stopped like on a dime at the same location at the end of the field as it has been doing. This time it was tree level and it briefly hung there and did that power up thing like it did before because the light goes brighter for a moment, maybe it was taking a scan or something, and then it took off to the North so fast that you would have thought that it was being chased by something. Then it was behind the trees so I couldn&apos;t see it anymore.*********************************************** Also on one of my previous sightings, I didn&apos;t mention that I also had seen a strange star constellation.........or so I thought. Now that I have thought it over,and I have tried to find that same star constellation, I think that it might have been something else.*********************************************** It sort of looked like a paddle of very large bright stars then it had a huge mass of other stars around it and there were small shooting stars that kept going through this mass of stars. It was HUGE. Maybe it was just that, a constellation but I just thought that I would mention it in case someone else has seen some strange star thing too.****************************************** Well that is about it for now.

I began to turn around in a vacant golf course.  When I turned North into the lot, there was a bright series of lights directly in front of us and just over our heads.  The sky was light blue with thin whisps of clouds.  Our windows were down and I was talking on the phone to a friend.  My daughter and I were amazed at what was in front of us and I expressed this to my caller and daughter by saying , oh my god, what is in front of us.  I said are those planes, they can&apos;t be planes, what is in front of us.  I leaned my head towards the open window for any sound.  My daughter was already amazed by what she saw.  We both were excited and stunned by what we thought was a UFO.  My daughter actually yelled it&apos;s a UFO.  I think it&apos;s going to land.  My other daughter in the back seat said she couldn&apos;t see anything and was frightened telling us she wanted to get out of here quick.  I told my caller that she needed to step outside and look north, there are some kind of lights in the sky, but it was already fading away while I was speaking to her.  What my daughter and I viewed was a multiple light formation containing six individual lights that were very bright in the center and grayish on the outside.  My daughter (age 15) said that she could see a thin gray outline like it was a craft.  I did not view that myself, but I was also looking over at her and glancing back to my other daughter while talking on the phone.  It happened very quickly.  Five of these lights were in the formation of a rooftop with one light at the peak and two lights on each side.  The sixth light was centered a short distance below the peak.  They all stayed in this formation and seemed to float moving only slightly up and down as if they were suspended in air.  We had the impression that whatever we were seeing was attempting to land in the field or empty parking lot.  We thought it was a formation of jets but they were way too close to each other.  With the windows down, there was no sound of planes either.  And there was a plane flying below them iin a slanted east to west direction which my daughter pointed out when I asked if they were planes.  No, she said, that&apos;s a plane below them, this is a UFO!  It was obvious these sets of lights were significantly different than a plane light. Then all of the lights seemed to close at once as if they each had a sliding door that closed from our right to our left.  Each light left a very small sliver of light like a piece of moon.  The formation then seemed to move slightly up and west.  It had no shape of an object, like the side of a plane would have or anything of that nature as it turned.  It was just those slivers of light that moved as one.  They didn&apos;t move out of our sight, they disappeared out of our sight.  It was as if they were the same backgound of the sky but with slivers of light.  I guess you would say whatever it was now seemed to be transparent.  My daughter was asking me if I could see the thin gray outline of it too because she could and she knew it was an UFO!  I had glanced away and found it difficult to see it again, but she watched for a second or two more but she said it was gone...and just disappeared.  VERY VERY WEIRD and VERY VERY COOL.Now, let me tell you.  There is an air show scheduled this weekend in Chicago. My family did view a jet flying over.  My husband could hear the jet when it went over. I was in the car alone earlier and saw a jet overhead too.  I recognized it as a jet because jets are obvious with there beak style nose and slim body.  I thought that maybe there was an air show somewhere this weekend and that was why a jet was in our area.  And that is also why my first thoughts at seeing this formation was that it has to be jets in formation.  However, when we were viewing this ten seconds of lights there were no sounds of planes/jets, no visuals of a plane/jet either while it was facing us or when it turned/moved or whatever it did to leave.  And I don&apos;t think jets just disappear.  This was truly the coolest thing we have ever seen and I was glad that I saw it with someone else. Excitedly I called a family member and my other daughter called a friend.  I thought about calling someone somewhere and reporting it, but who?  You don&apos;t want people to think you are some kind of kook or something.  I also hoped that maybe someone else had seen it and it would be on the news or in the paper.  I don&apos;t know if this is an official site to report UFO&apos;s or if it does any good to report it at all.  But it was definitely awesome to see something that unknown and interesting!", "huge, diamond shape object flying low  in southern MaineThis happened approximately 28 years ago.

We saw an enormous craft, perhaps 3 football fields long come out of the east at a low altitude and pass over our heads. This immense craft then disappeared to the west.  It was diamond shape, and I could see details on the underside as it passed overhead.  Over the years sightings expanded from the saucer or ball shapes to include triangle UFO&apos;s, but the UFO I sighted did something that as far as I know has never been reported.  It flew with the base of the triangle forward, not point forward.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))", "This all started earier in the day, as I fired some small arms, I noticed a sound of thunder then a sonic boom then the sounds of a jet flying. However you could never find the jet when you looked up. This continued all day. Then later, I was walking my dog on our 44 acres before dinner and then heard the Jet sound following a thunder sound. So, I looked up awaiting the jet or jets to fly by. Then all of the sudden, I saw what looked to be a 8-10&quot; black bird chasing another just like it. However they were flying very fast like just under the sound barrier! The first one looked as though it was being pursued by the second. They moved around each other in a dog fight,like dog fighting jet planes! Then I noticed the second one had what looked like a &quot;blue like&quot; triangle over it, and when it seemed to accelerate up to catch the first one, seemed to let outr a little puff of steam or smoke! Then as they streaked out of sight making a LOUD JET NOISE OF A FIGHTER JET, I looked to see a triangle flock of these &quot;JET BIRDS&quot;! They flew in a triangle formation after the first 2 and went off up lone mountain towards the coast.This is real and scary! It frightened my dog and wife so much!  I had to report this! PS- They seemed to look like &quot;dead birds&quot; shot out of a gun or? i.e. the birds never moved their wings!  PSS- We were affraid to report this!

As I live in the mountains, away from city lights, I am able to see meteorites very regularly. This object was considerably larger, and slower, than any meteorite that I have seen. It appeared to be burning,as something would entering the atmosphere,with a whitish, and briefly green &quot;light&quot; as it progressed through its trajectory. Roughly 5 to 10 seconds after it appeared, it seemed to be break up and shed burning pieces of itself,&quot;dropping&quot; them along its flight path. I was able to observe this object&apos;s trajectory until it disappeared from view behind the upper story of my house. I ran to the other end of the deck, but it was no longer visible. At no time did I hear any sound. The object seemed to be at a relatively low altitude ( though it is difficult for me to guess it&apos;s altitude with any real accuracy, I would guess it was less than 20,000 feet, and perhaps much lower ) had a very flat trajectory, and did not appear to be descending . My object size estimate relative to the moon, given each objects respective distance to me, would be that the object was 1/15th to 1/20th of the moon size.", "fast moving Triangle with no sound and orange lights, stops hovers and speeds off.While taking out the trash on cold winter in 1988 or 1989 I was watching and hearing the planes fly towards from the west towards ohare. With it being crisp you can hear every sound. I saw a large triangle with orange lights approaching fast from the south, but it made no sound. It was much higher than the planes but not by much or it was just so big it appeared closer. I stared at it as it stopped suddenly overhead. It just stopped and was still. The orange lights were lit around the perimeter of the triangle. I was gripped with fear waiting for a beam to come down. But then it moved slowly south across my neigborhood but was still silent. I ran after it as my sight was getting hampered by trees. Then it sped off towards the south east at a high rate of speed and was out of sight. It never made a sound. As soon as it was gone I could hear another incoming plane. The sound of the plane comes much before I can actually see it. I waqs standing there staring at the sky mesmorized by what I just saw. I have not told this story to many people and never reported it, until now due that I saw the same traingle in a UFO story on tv and it sent chills up my spine.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))", "Bright, hazy clyindrical object appearing and disappearing in Boston areaI was sitting outside shortly after midnight, August 19 (the night of the 18th), 2006, when a light in the sky caught my attention. The object was large; it was probably almost about a half an inch long from my perspective, which would seemingly be a huge &quot;craft&quot; or object considering it appeared very high up in our atmosphere. The object radiated as a blue-white light, and although it appeared as somewhat of a haze (I couldn&apos;t make out any specific edges or details of the object), it took the shape of a cylinder, with its height being about one-third its length. When I first saw the object it was moving slowly; however, at the altitude it appeared to be flying at its rate would be quite fast. The object then sped up as it made its way across the sky, at a rate that was much faster than any airplane I&apos;ve seen at a comparable altitude. After about five seconds or so, the object made one last acceleration that had to have at least tripled its speed, and disappeared as it moved upward and seemed to leave the atmosphere. The last acceleration of speed before its disappearance is what has stuck with me&mdash;it seemed straight out of a science fiction movie. Nothing that I&rsquo;m aware of could move that fast. I&rsquo;m a sane person, with no prior UFO sightings or unexplainable phenomena in my past. I spent most of my time in the 24 hours after the incident trying to convince myself of some rational explanation, and I&rsquo;ve realized that no known human craft or atmospheric event could have accounted for what I saw. I want to know what it was, and if anyone else saw it! Some other details concerning the event: 1) It was a clear night; more stars than are generally visible in my area were visible on this night. I took this into consideration while trying to determine the object&rsquo;s altitude. The fact that it was an illuminated object with no real shape other than a hazy cylinder caused me to believe that it was very high up in our atmosphere. 2) The object made no sound. 3) Regretfully, I was alone at the time. I was outside for no more than two minutes when I saw the object; my girlfriend and three of my friends were inside the house at the time. My only regret in this experience is that no one was there with me to experience and validate what I saw.", "Ufo on 09/29/06 in Houston TX, Oval Shadow-like oblject.I was getting off of work on 09/29/06, and my wife and I run our own business. We run a ((deleted)) Agency off of Interstate 10 or the katy freeway in houston, Texas...and as we were walking to the car i spotted in the corner of my my eye that there was an object passing right over our head. My dad is an aircraft engineer for united so growing up around him, so i know what a plane looks like. it wasn&apos;t a plane... had no audible noise. and flew toward a littlte cloud and it stopped dead in its track and went toward a bigger cloud. After about a minute of hopelessly trying to point it out in the sky so my wife could see it too, she never had a chance to witness it like i did. She does wear glasses and i have 20/20 vision. So i guess she couldn&apos;t focus on it.  Two things that seemed odd about this UFO was that no noise, it looked almost like a see through shadow.. Oval-shaped and at the least, i could tell its shaped was horizontally stretched more that its vertical stretch. I was standing there in amazement for about 20 minutes after that just peering in the sky, just trying to see if i could get anouther look.. the circumstances did allow because as soo as it flew from the smaller could to the bigger one, it gott abit hazey as its shape ever so slightly kept almost poking in and out of the cloud. I Will never foget this experience in my life. Im utter;y ;eft in amazement and wonder about just what it was that i saw. if only i had a camera.

I was the passengers seat and felt the need to scan the mountain tops with my eyes. All of a sudden i saw a bright light and told the driver to look at it. H elooked and said, &quot;yeah its bright, its probably the top of a tower.&quot; As we kept driving towards the mountains I kept watching it and it was getting closer and brighter. As it got closer I could see two balls of light side by side. Then it began coming closer till it was right above us. I opened the sun roof and we pulled the car over to the side of the freeway so we could stop and watch it. It was directly over head and it was in a triangle shape. There were two white balls of light in front, and behind those two but alittle closer together were two slightly smaller balls of light. It was still quite light outside, and despite the size of these balls of light, i could see no craft that would be connecting the lights. And in the middle of all thses lights was a signel blinking light.We watched in awe as it moved out of sight. I live in LA near two major airports and this is nothign like i have ever seen. The only colors were white, no red blinking lights like what are normally on aircrafts.This aircraft moved very quick, but it seemed to slow down above our car like it knew we were watching.", "bright object seen racing sporadically in the southwest over the ottawa valley, seen from barrhaven, OntarioThis object appeared from the clouds in the direction of the southwest. I was drive west down old strandherd road when I saw the triangle shaped light appear from the clouds. It stood still then it race south across the sky before disappearing. After about 10 seconds it reappeared where it orignally emerged but then it went north. It stopped and then kept racing back and forth. I stopped thinking it was simply just a powerful light being emitted from the ground after it had been racing back and forth across 120 degree span from where I was watching it. The intensity of the light hadn&apos;t changed as it was moving either, so it couldnt have been an image being emitted from the ground because such an image would lose intensity as the light beam stretched further away from the origin. This racing back and across lasted about 10-15 seconds. I almost got in an accident watching it as i slowed down and the guy behind me nearly hit me.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

While at Sunoco, I saw repeated flashing in the sky.  At first I thought it was lightning until I saw it repeatedly flashing in the exact same areas.  Over and again, tremendous lights reflecting amber and blue  circled in the sky.  The size and power of these lights had to be enormous and great respectively.  Why do I say that?  I will exlpain in a moment. I watched from Sunoco&apos;s lot for almost twenty minutes, wondering if someone would noticed a muscle bound Black man hanging halfway out of an SUV staring in to the sky at almost ten thorty at night.To avoid potential harassment fron the police, I pulled into the next parking lot-Bank One next door-parked, and watched for almost another fifteen minutes. Thinking the phenomenon would go away any time, I ventured home and told my wife.  From our backyard we could see the lights in the distance flashing again and again.  The boys were sleep so I told my wife no to trouble them and that I was going to drive towards the lights. I drove slowly down mainstreets, backroads, and even dirt roads as it took me towards Ypsilanti.  Along the way, the flashes became bigger and the size of them more awe inspiring.  Thinking that since I went to Uof M in Ann Arbor even though I was lost on the dark backwood roads, eventually I would find my way. As I saw the lights better throught he clouds, I noticed the were reflecting upwards off something.  The reflections, I estimate, were fifty to eighty feet and reflected almopst violently over and again like they were atop something spinning.  It was somewhere close to Ypsilanti that I realized that the sky was discolored.  Having gone camping numerous times, I know that the lights ina great number makethe sky reflect a deep violet and makes the stars hazy to see.  In the country setting, the sky had a slight violet tint to it because it was not so far removed from townships, cities, and the like to have the untainted skyline.  As I watche dthe lights become larger and more brilliant, I noticed that the violet-black was off-colored for at least five square miles.  The color was deep, dark grey instead of violet-black.  Whatever was in the sky also was displacing the clouds-the clouds being pushed is something I think added to the dark greyish hue. I felt-I distinguish between feel and think because there was nothing logical about assuming anything-that there was some physical activity beyond that of immense, rotating lights. I drove after it for long minutes until, even in Ann Arbor, I became lost. The lights seemd to become fewer in flashes and more dim.  I rounded a bend to enter a freeway-a freeway that showed me that whatever it was had been moving because I was very, very far from where i thought I was heading.  Then I say trees and long grass sweep forward and globular lights reflecting a flash of red and blue shoot inot the sky from  what I could tell was an empty field.  Immediately it began raining on par with the power of a tropical storm.  I actually had to pull over and wait for the rains to calm which is no small thing for a seasoned Michigan driver.  Within a few minutes, the rains stopped as if they had never started. I saw something in the sky that night, a year ago, that has stayed with me and changed my view of the world permenantly.  Worldly things beyond keeping my family fed are so insignificant compared to the mystery of what I saw.  I have no explaination of what it was but there was something there. I have told a few people about what I saw but in the age of liars and attention seekers, people who own up to seeing UFO&apos;s-yes UFO&apos;s not alien starships but an UNIDENTIFIED flying object as in something I could not recognize/identify-typically ar elabelled crazy, mocked, or ruined by negative attention.

To the West (compass used) at about a 45 degree angle of vision, a bright blue circular object suddenly came into view with an explosion that light up the entire sky with whitish blue light. It flew at no more than a 10 - 15 degree angle relative to a VERTICAL line (down from left to right). It was almost flying straight down. It was only in view for about one full second before dissapearing again with no sound at all. The explosion of light only lasted a fraction of a second, but the movement and visual of the object itself carried on for a full second as it shot across the sky. Behind the object was a bright bue and white tail that spanned across its entire path of flight and was as thick as the object was wide. I would describe the size of the object as being that of a full moon or even a little bigger.", "Huge aircraft with diagnally aligned white lights moving slowly and loudly through the night.We could hear the aircraft moving very close and slowly above our home, even rattling the windows.  After debating what the noise could be for a few minutes we went outside to see what it was. We saw about four white lights, equally spaced, rapidly flashing in sequence moving slowly in a diagnal fashion due west.  It was probably about 7-10 miles away but if you put a ruler up to the sky and measure the aircraft would be about 3.5 inches wide.  We called the airport and they said there was a balloon festival in Albequerque, NM and it was probably a balloon.  We know that the lights were all white and flying diagnally and was much larger than a balloon.", "Reaccuring semi-stationary, color alternation spheresThis is the second time I&apos;ve seen these craft. They seem to be stationed all around and so easily visible. They around. I would imagine a gunmetal color with lights of some kind all around their middles...like a belt. The lights alternate colors, not quite blinking but moving in a rythm the way the signs at movie theaters and similar places do. They alternate colors, similar to the way a projector does, like at the movie theater. They are somewhat stationary, moving usually only in one direction (up) and very slowly. They are visible on clear nights. I have watched many airplanes fly around in the sky and also have watched many many stars. They are not either and that is what I am positive about. The difference between these and a twinkling star is drastic. I have not seen any other accounts of these things, so I&apos;m guessing they are fairly new. They&apos;re so obvious that there should be others. I know that I am not the only one that has seen them. My significant other has seen them before too. Both times i have seen them there&apos;s one that is low and then two more adjacent to it higher up. The last time I watched them I could see more than three. They are odd and intriguing.

As I watched it I thought that someone had a kite with a flashlight hooked onto it or something because that is what it resembled but then I could also see a few blinking lights onto the side or back of it.

There was no clouds in the sky, no moon was visible (it&apos;s always in the opposite direction anyway), and no wind. It was about 85 degrees (F). Suddenly &amp; seemingly from out of no where, a goldish circular light appeared in the sky. It was about 1/3 the size of a full moon when it&apos;s highest in the sky. It was an intense (but easy to look at) soft gold color, that seemed to be pulsing on the outer circumfrence of the object, which had no visible defined edge. No other shape within or without the object was visible. There was total silence as is moved laterally &amp; slowly in a westerly direction. The object appeared to above Mt. Burdell. No commercial jets or other aircraft were in the area at the time. Totally suprised by what I was seeing I quickly thought about fireworks or flares, both ideas which I discarded quickly. I called for my son to come here as I continued to watch this amazing &amp; mysterious celestial display. Then just as my son was about to step outside, there was a quiet, low frequency popping noise, &amp; the object seemed to dissapear, or rather transform.

Neither because helicopters cannot fly at that altitude.  The only thing that it might be are satellites but, satellites dont just stop in mid air, or they dont zig-zag during travel.  Another thing, they seem to be moving very fast at times and other times, very slow.  They look exactly how the stars in the background look, same color and size, so sometimes it is hard to spot them, and I&apos;m pretty sure they pass by unnoticed.  It is weird because when you tell someone that hasn&apos;t seen them, and you&apos;re out there trying to spot one, when you do, and are about to tell them to look up, they just disappear, as if they know your showing them to someone else.

She called me to quickly come out on the deck to see them. I did so. (Our home sits on a hill facing to the southeast, overlooking the South Park region of the central Colorado Rockies.)  There were six yellowish orange (light orange) lights visible at roughly equal intervals, positioned fairly closely together in a &apos;follow-the-leader&apos; fashion, moving from South to North, at an estimated distance of roughly one mile away from our observation point, low in the sky- (likely less than half a mile above the ground) They were moving at a constant speed and altitude, and no sound was able to be heard. The single light on each object appeared to be emitted form the front of each, relative to the direction of their travel; as they passed and were moving away, the lights began to be blocked progressively by the bulk of each object, so that they were obstructed progeessively until they were no longer visible when they were past us by 45 to 50 degrees. The lights were visible for less than 30 seconds. The following morning, my brother-in-law, who was visiting &amp; staying in their RV on our property, reported that he was also outside at the same time, and also saw these lights pass by from south to north. M&apos;s added report: When I saw the lights I knew instantly they were like nothing I had ever seen before.They had a strange color- sort of an orange glow where a cockpit would be, however, the glow did not come out in a beam.Though we could hear other night sounds and traffic noises three miles away, the lights were utterly silent.I had an impression that the craft( If that is what they were) had an elongated shape, but I cannot be sure.The moon was in the south and they were flying away from it so we were not catching reflections from it.They had no wing or tail lights of any kind and were only visable for about 30 seconds. There were 6 of them in a straight line maybe a half mile away.They did not appear to be abnormaly large (but bgigger than the stars).

As I was sitting in my hot tub last night the sky was extremely clear.  I looked up at Pleiades and then straight down to the Belt of Orion.  What I saw right between the two was a giant triangle consisting of what looked like 5 stars.  The thing was about 2/3 the size of the dipper [not counting the handle].  In all the years I have been looking at the stars I do not remember ever seeing a triangle in this area of the sky.  I have even taken college level astronomy and no mention was ever made about this.  I can running back in the house and looked up the sky charts in the Night Watch book by Terence Dickinson.  No triangle is suppossed to be there.  There are 3 star triangles in other areas of the sky but no 5 star triangle under the Pleiades.  What made it even stranger is that as the earth rotated, the triangle did not match the speed and location of the other stars.  Sometimes it looked to be out in front of the Pleiades, and sometimes in line with it.  Then again sometimes it appeared to be moving straight and other times tilted upwards.

Twenty minutes later, they appeared again, this time in two clusters.  I called my parents for them to witness it.  Mom walked out her front door to see them glowing due east.

About 10 seconds after they were gone, I had not taken my eyes off of the sky, an airkplane came into view and flew behind the same cloud and then came out and left view.

The sky was crystal clear and full of stars. The temperature was in the mid seventies and the wind was calm. I live beyond the distraction of city lights and sounds and in the midst of near dead silence and a glorious view overhead,I swear I was a witness to the following;  It was around 10:45 PM when I began preparing to retire for the evening. My wife and Miniature Dachshund had gone to bed about an hour before. My routine includes checking door locks,night lights,oven settings,candles,etc.This also includes a walk through our covered patio area out back where we often spend quiet time outdoors most summer evenings,weather and mosquitos permitting.We have a TV,a fan,candles and other items we enjoy out there just like any other room of our home.As usual,I went out to secure the patio.I stepped out onto our uncovered,attached patio where I began to take a big stretch and yawn before heading back in to the bedroom.My stretching motion shifted my head backwards and up toward the sky and.....there it was! In the sky directly above me,was a perfectly round,silent and still object slightly smaller than the full moons we have here,and not quite as bright,but similar in color.I knew from it&apos;s position in the sky however that it definately WAS NOT the moon!Our moon starts out in the eastern sky and moves east to west across the sky on the southern side of our house,regardless of the time of year,and is viewable ONLY from an area some fifty feet north of where I was standing! My eyes remained fixed on the object for about 10 seconds or less,at which time it very slowly moved off to the west/northwest,and faded away into the clear night sky.It&apos;s distance away from me when I first saw it was impossible to judge.I can only base it&apos;s size on the only object similar to it,the moon.When it began to slowly move away,it moved a distance of about one and a half to two times it&apos;s own size before fading out of sight,never making a sound of any kind.And as usual,you could have heard the hum of a mosquito&apos;s wings that night.I have waited this long to report my experience because I felt then,and still believe this was a sign from God,to let me know he has heard my prayers.

Unique Characteristic of Sighting: The traffic lights were normally extremely bright on my drive home from work. This particular evening, I noticed the traffic lights were extremely dim.  Description of the sighting: It was a clear night on my way home from work. I had driven this route every night for the last several months. The traffic lights always illuminated up the area and you could see it for a couple miles. I noticed in the distance the traffic lights at the intersection where I turned left were extremely dim on this night. At first I assumed there must be something wrong with the lights. I figured maybe some sort of construction was going on. Anyway, as I approached the intersection I saw this bowl like object hanging from a 3 inch diameter cable looking connection device shining a 3 inch diameter lasar on the ground. I came to a complete stop just under the lasar so as to put the lasar right outside my driver window. I looked on the ground to see there was a rubber looking 1 inch diameter 3 feet long snake looking thing in the lasar beam. I looked back up and saw the under side of the bowl. It was solid black with the exception for the 3 inch diameter beam shining down. I started to put my hand out to see if I could determine its temperature and immediatley got nervous and turned left and stopped to car. I got out of the car to examine the device more closely from outside my car and it was suddely gone. I didn&apos;t hear any sound. I didn&apos;t see it fly away. Of course, after I drove underneath and turned left I was in the car and it was to my back for about 20 seconds. I figured it took off while my back was turned. I didn&apos;t experience any loss of time. I didn&apos;t experience any abduction. It was simply hanging there and appeared to cause the traffic lights to go dim. It was only 12 to 15 inches in diameter. It was hanging from the power lines shining a 3 inch diameter beam onto the approximatlely 3 foot snake like object. And when it disappeared, the traffic lights were back to full illumination. The long rubber like object or snake like object was gone too.

It seemed small, maybe the size of a small airplane and it seemed low maybe 200 or 300 feet above the homes.  My first impression was it was a hang glider.  The wing had no lights and made no sound.

While locking our westward facing sliding door I noticed a stationary and flashing light that seemed to be bigger and brighter than the surrounding stars.  The size and brightness appeared to be at least twice the size of stars near the position of the light. It appeared similar to a street light from two miles away.  The somewhat large size and the quickly changing colors are what cought my eye.  The light appeared motionless long enough to be video taped for several minutes.  The sky was partly cloudy with a half moon near the eastern horizon.  With the video camera zoomed in on the light it appeared diffused with a very bright center region with multiple flashes of red, green, purple, and white lights around the edge.  When I first saw the light I assumed that it was Venus but it appeared brighter and bigger with multiple flashing colors.  I will attempt to download the digital video in the near future.  The light was positioned west by north west from my position at approximately 25 degrees from the western horizon.  At approximately 12:20am on 8/17/06 I stopped recording and went in the house to go to bed with the light still in the same position.  I have assumed that the light was Venus but crop circles have been reported 60 miles west by north west of my position and thought that I should at least report my experience.  Total vewing time would be about 20 minutes.  At one point a commercial flight passed within the &quot;vicintiy&quot; of the light without making any noticable flight path changes.  Venus?  Or Intergalatic Crop Dusters????", "Bright light, changing colors, sitting still in the sky for 3-4 minutes and then moving slowly and disapperaing in front of our plane.This observation was made sitting in a Boeing 757 (Continental Airlines), flying from Newark, NJ, to Stockholm, Sweden. Our altitude was 35,000 ft. Around 3:30 (UTC) I observed a bright light at 10 o&apos;clock. The light was at a somewhat higher altitude and was seemingly sitting still in the sky. First I thought it was another airplane heading toward us with its lights on. I then noticed that the brightness of the light was slowly fluctuating and also changing colors from white (clear)-red-blue-green-white. No flashing lights (like on an airplane) were observed and no shape of the object. I took a digital picture of the light. Since it was dark outside the exposure time was long, so the camera moved while I was taking the picture. This caused the light to &quot;draw&quot; an irregular line on the picture, which makes it possible to see on the picture that the brightness and colors of the object were shifting continuosly. Less than one minute after I took the picture our plane started to climb up to 39,000 ft and changing the course more to the right (away from the object). This made the object &quot;move&quot; to a position at 9 o&apos;clock, where it stayed for a minute or two. Then it started to move slowly to the right until it disappeared in front of our plane. Still at i higher altitude. It was impossible to see how far away from the plane this object was, but I am sure it was a few miles. This happened almost exactly two hours before landing at Stockholm Airport (7:30 local time) and the position was due west of the Far&oslash;e Islands, which I saw from the airplane approx. 30 minutes after the observation. I have been working on the railroad for many years as Locomotive Engineer and Road Foreman. The last number of years I have been working in a Quality Department, inspecting and examening different components and assemblies.", "White oval shapped object no other lights, seeming to constantly rotate in a circle.This was actually my second sighting, but have just recently decided to post it after reading another accounter that sounded a lot a like. There was a difference in color but the observer is from Midland, which is fairly close to my location. My first sighting was driving home from a friends&apos; house around 1am and had pulled off a dirt road onto a paved road. Right away I noticed something in the upper left corner of my front window. I assumed it was a bat or hawk due to it&apos;s rotating motions. A minute or so down the road I was wondering why it would stay with me and at the same spot. I then noticed when the trees along side of the road came it would disapear from view and then come back into view when trees weren&apos;t there. I dimmed my lights thinking I had something lose or broken in them, it was still there. I was now almost half a mile from my house and had slowed down to 20mph watching the object. At this point I was scared, I almost missed turning into my drive way and when I did I pulled right next to the front door to my house. I gathered my house keys and opened my car door quickly. When I closed my car door I looked behind me (Dirrect East) and saw it was a white, oval shape and always moved in a large circle. The color was about the same as the stars, maybe a bit brighter, only white that I could see. This was the first time I could clearly see it and not doubt myself on what it was. I ran to my door, put in my key, went into my bed room and sat on the bed. I had never experienced anything like it before, so I was very scared. I kept thinking I am your friend I won&apos;t hurt you, I wanted them to know I would befriend them or something. I did feel a numbish comforting feeling, though I layed awake for 2 hours before falling to sleep. My second sighting I was driving home from my girlfriends house, at least a week or more had went by. I had been looking for it every night, but had no luck. This night I thought was the same, I pulled in my usual parking spot further from my front door. When I got out of my car I looked up and there it was! I ran to the house door, but curiousity compeled me to watch it. I stayed there, watching it for about an hour before I was shivering. I then hurried in my house, grabbed a coat and came back out, it was still in the same place. It would always move in circles, maybe this was how it stayed in flight. I would say every 2 or 3 seconds it would revovle. I gained courage to walk out back to my car, then to the back door to my house. It moved a bit as if following me. I then walked to garage, barn, camper, and start of field which it always would follow me. I looked back towards my house and saw a light, so someone else was up. I walked back up to the house thinking now that it would not go away if I went back inside. My grand father was awake and I had him come out in his underware just to see it. He was in the seventh army anti-aircraft and had a better perception of it&apos;s distance then I. He said it appeared to very high up, which I had thought it was lower and very small. Being high up made more logic and I realized that it was probably a more reasonable explaination. He went inside after about 20 minutes and I followed. I told him I wanted to walk out into the field and see how far it would follow me. He told me to be safe and take his truck, so I did. I drove around our hay fields for a few laps at low speed watching it follow me. It always stayed on the east side of me. I felt like I should go to our back field down a two trail through the woods, but I think I was too scared. I ended up comming back to the house and parking the truck. I then watched it until 5:30am or so when I felt the need to sleep. I went to my door and waved good bye, hoping I would see it again another night. While I got ready ! to go to bed, I looked out the window several times until about 6am and it was still outside. I hope to see the object again, which I believe is a UFO. To add, both nights were very clear skys though I cannot recall seeing the moon. From my house door the object looked to be telephone pole hight, maybe a bit higher, but was very small about size of hand. I would guess it was very high, but I don&apos;t know if you could calculate angles some how to find out. If you need more inforation please let me know. The sighting has really made me rethink life and realize that the unbelievable could really be true. I hope that people can take the time to read my incounter and believe in it. I now have a video camera ready and waiting so if I am lucky and this &quot;UFO&quot; allows me to I will hopefully be able to record it. Unforunitly I can&apos;t afford to stay awake every night to look for it, but I try to look out the window whenever I can or look in the sky when I drive home.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

It made no sound, which I thought was odd, since I live out in the country and you can always hear planes flying overhead, and it left no trail.  I&apos;d say it was probably a metallic-silver in color, and may have had a haze around it, but it was hard to tell if it was emitting its own light or if it was reflecting the light from the sun. I watched it travel all the way across the sky that was visible to me, until it went behind a cloud and the trees were in the way to see it any longer. Immediately after I lost sight if the object, a large jet flying at a very low altitude went past, traveling almost the same course, only going south/south-east. The oddest thing about the whole experience it that when I was 10, I saw an almost identical object in Wisconsin Dells, only about 8 miles away from this sighting.  That objest was much lower in the sky, but it was the same sphereical shape, and that one was definately a dark silver color, and it was hovering in one spot before completely disappearing. When I told my parents about that I was told it was probably a weather balloon or just my imagination...but now I can positively say that is NOT what I saw...", "Mysterious oval in sky above all of the treesMe and my brother were watching the Steelers game that night and my frind was on his way over to our house to pick up his cell phone when on the way he saw a bright red oval just sitting over the trees it almost looked like it had flames or something coming coming off it. About a minute later he ran over to our house and told me and my brother to hurry up and come out here.  When we went out the mysterious light was gone. So me my brother and my friend were standing outside in the street talking about it. About 2 minutes later this HUGE radar plane was hovering around the area. The radar plane was so low we could make out all the details on it.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  Possible hoax??

I&apos;m somewhat of a stargazer, I&apos;ve seen odd things in the sky before but nothing worth reporting.  I satellite watch as a hobby, so I know what is an unusual object in the sky.  It was a beautiful night, with no clouds.  Suddenly to the W-NW I saw a brilliant flash of light.  It was way too cold to be lightning.  My dog immediatly reacted, and bolted back to the house.  I could tell she was frightened.  It only lit up the western sky, not the whole sky like how lighting does.

Just as we past the gas station out in the pasture[on the north side of 12]  my cousin said &quot;there it is again&quot;! Not knowing what he was talking about, I  looked over. Hovering off the ground, about 20 ft., was a red transparent ball. it seemed like time stood still as we past the object. Both of us turned our heads  as we went past. I was&apos;nt driving so I looked out the back window until I lost sight  of it. I was stunned! We said nothing for the next couple minutes. When we approached  Santa Rosa [about 5 miles down hwy 12] at the intersection of hwy 12 and Stony point  rd. there was the object in front of us. I&apos;m still not sure if it was the same one  or a second one. The only thing said was by my cousin. He said &quot;I saw one yesterday&quot;. This was during rush hour Iknow others saw the samething. I&apos;ve tried to forget about  it over the years but I can&apos;t. Since then my cousin has become a religious man. Me I think it was something else.", "Moving Star-Type lights In the SkyMy children and I just witnessed something strange. We were just getting to sleep when I noticed a light that was blinking through the 3 broken slats in one of our vertical blinds. I asked my son and daughter (ages 7 and 5 respectively) if they could see anything and they said yes they could see some &quot;blinking lights&quot;. At first I thought &quot;oh how nice, clear night - stars twinkling&quot;..then something really odd happened.  Nothing an airplane would do. One of the &quot;blinking stars&quot; started ascending in a sort of zig-zag pattern then went to the left (Note: we were looking over the range Mount Charleston is on, perhaps North East, more to the East then North). Then two more did the SAME thing. I had to open the blind more and my kids saw the other lights do this sort of &quot;zig-zag&quot; movement and they gasped. I told them I was going outside to look (they did not want me doing that!) and so I did, just to prove to myself I wasn&apos;t looking at some lasers or whatever on my window. Sure enough, there they were, the blinking lights, now a couple of them moving here and there. They are STILL outside the window. My kids are not happy about this for some reason. I&apos;ve never known them to feel scared about stars or lights before. I think it was HOW they were moving, these &quot;dancing light-stars&quot; or whatever the heck they were. I don&apos;t know of any airshows in the area and it was like, they were moving about sort of like how you move a push pin around a map, that&apos;s how I can somehow explain it. Odd, isn&apos;t it? This is not a joke. And my kids do NOT want to snuggle with Mommy in her room at this point. I wish I had a camera but I don&apos;t know what I could point out other then &quot;moving stars&quot; on a video. I wonder if anyone else in the are saw them too.

All of a sudden it exploded, like the challenger shuttle did some years ago. It left a large trail of smoke high in the sky for hours afterwards. Afterwards we saw jets flying in this same direction. If it was a comet, it sure was close to earth&apos;s atmosphere and exploded coming through the atmosphere.It was the biggest comet-like thing we have ever seen. It was breath-taking. We think it possibly was a jet airliner that was on fire and then exploded all of a sudden. We heard no sound with this. Are there any other reports of this sighting?", "Amber lights in southern night sky near Gila Bend, AZWhile drviving eastbound on Interstate 8 between Dateland and Gila Bend, I noticed a cluster of amber lights directly south of the highway. At first I thought nothing of it thinking they were lights on top of a tower or something. After approximately 15 seconds of driving at approximately 85 miles per hour I noticed that we were not gaining on nor passing the lights. That&apos;s when I brought them to my wife&apos;s attention. For almost 3 minutes at 85mph the lights never changed position in my view out the passenger side window. I pulled to the side of the highway to look at them and they appeared to be motionless. The only thing I noticed is that there may have been a small smoke trail rising up from the center of them. Then abruptly, they all went out.After a short conversation about how freaked out we were with what we had just seen, the lights reappeared again. Only this time there were 2 pairs of lights with one pair slightly rearward from when I had seen them and the other pair were in my view between my inside rearview mirror and the side pillar just under the passenger visor. Without knowing how far away and high up they were, it is difficult to say how far apart they were. But as before, my view of them never changed position no matter how fast I drove. Then 1 pair went away then about 30 seconds later the other pair left. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible military flares at Gila Bend firing range??

Craft was moving very fast, when it first caught my eye, I thought it was 3 fighter jets in formation, because of the speed. On closer look, it definately was one large craft and very unlike fighter jets.  It was silent, almost appearing to be gliding, but gliding very, very fast.  much faster then a jet, and flying very low.  Only saw the back - had distict dark 3 cylindar shapes. Two cylindar shapes appeared parallel,with distinct round ends and one smaller cylindar shape below.

It was 11 o&apos;clock at night, and there were plenty of clouds in the sky that evening.  For almost no reason at all I looked up into the sky, and immidiately saw a long, straight, and almost entirely flat silver line with a small teardrop on the end of it.  The &quot;tail&quot; appeared to break off and was seperate from the small silver tear, and then both vanished into the clouds.  I&apos;m not entirely sure it even flew very far, or at all, because the clouds were too thick.  I didn&apos;t hear any noise either, but I am certain it wasn&apos;t a plane or a shooting star.  It was too cloudy to be a star, and far too abnormal to be a plane.  It was the color of mercury, and very bright.

What I saw was a rectangle in the sky sitting over Seattle Wa. It looked so obvious that I thought there might be something on the news or people talking about it. But there wasn&apos;t. I told a few people, but you can image the response someone gets for seeing a rectangle in the sky. This was not a UFO. I only had a very short view of this due to traffic and trees. The shape of this was like a rectangle drawn on a piece of paper. It was just hanging there. I could not say the size of it but there was definitely enough size to it to make it easy to see looking across Lake Washington over to perhaps the north Seattle area.(appox. 4 to 5 miles...maybe less).  I was thinking that it might be a gate to another dimension. I am 58 years old and have never reported a strange sighting before. It was a bright and clear, blue sky, summer afternoon.

I had viewed it through the telescope also which made it that much more clear, only to reveal a spherical shape just completely covered in this constant changing, almost electrical light. It was blue,purple,red,yellow, green, and it just kept cycling through these colors over and over again. To be more precise on the shape, it looked exactly like the big Epcot center ball(with the same outer texture or paneling,whatever) in Disney World, just bigger and luminescent.

I was outside at my fire on the shoreline after the whole family went to bed after midnight. There were 2 parties going on in the bay where my cottage is and a few camp fires spotted on the shore. I was gazing at the lake when I thought I saw someone in the lake standing on a shallow rock ledge about 250 yards from shore. There was no moon out and the sky was partially cloudy. The silouette appeared to be glowing a white-green colur at the surface of the water. I watched it thinking must be a reflection, then after about 5 minutes there appeared to be a single white spot light directly above it about 20 feet off the water, again I thought must be someones cottage light reflecting to the water. After about 5 minues there was some blinking between the 2 lights as if going from the waters surface to the light 20 feet above. I again thought maybe kids with flashlights in the woods along shore on the other side of the bay about 400 yards away. After watching awhile longer I looked to the left end of the bay and saw 2 more objects again one larger light orange colour on the water surface with a spot light again 20 feet overhead, I watched all three objects appear to blink in blue and red colours horizontally outwards and back to the centre. The objects appeared to look like a cigar shape almost translucent like you could see an outline however it was see thru. There was all types of different lights flashing in no apparent sequence just mainly blue and green yellow and red lights. I was starting to get a shiver up my spine because numerous times I heard noises around my brother in laws trailer next to the cottage. He was sleeping in the trailer so I thought he was making the noise that night. I was watching the water and noticed the first object I spotted was gone however the other 2 to my left were still there but no more blinking only 2 orange lights again. Straight thru the bay I could see another similar object which appeared to throw a green glowing haze along the water surface and change positions left and right. The flashing lights seemed to get more active when the object approached the cottage having a party. After about another half hour of watching all the strange lights all of a sudden there crept in what seemed like a large fog type mist over the whole bay and I lost sight of all 4 objects. My brother in law told me next morning that he thought something was scratching the trailer walls and he kept his golf club by his side all night he said did not sound like racoon and he thought he could hear movement around the trailer.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I was facing North looking at the North star and the Constellation Draco which with the included Strar chart I am sending you shows the exact location of the 2 lights.The color of the objects were that of the stars, when one brightened to a bright white light.", "My wife and myself were shopping online, the computer desk happens to be next to a window.  As we were looking at different WebPages something caught our attention.

On August 21st 2004 and I thought I should add to that story what was witnessed by me and my family. It was a beautiful evening. I was in my back yard in Oak Forest, IL.  With my wife, my two older brothers and my step son.  We were just hanging out enjoying the night when my oldest brother said &quot;check out those three red stars,&quot; and he pointed into the southern sky. We all looked and noticed the three red lights that was probably described by a thousand people. We saw them kind of hanging there, then moving in and out until, one by one they just kind of faded out. Not a sudden disappearance like turning off a light switch but rather a fade. They would just fade slowly out. Shortly after that I noticed something strange in the northern sky. There was this air ship (for a lack of a better term) that was moving from the north to the south. This ship seemed to be moving slow but steady and as it got closer we got a real good look at it. It was black and shining and triangular. I could see the light from the surrounding townships reflecting off it or so it seemed. It seemed to be flying low also. Maybe two thousand feet off the deck, however I can&rsquo;t say for sure. And it was silent. It didn&rsquo;t make a sound, nothing at all and it was a real smooth flight path. It didn&rsquo;t deviate at all. It didn&rsquo;t shake or anything. Just moving straight as an arrow. Once it passed over our house (it was flying almost directly over our house) and headed out south it turned into one of those red lights for maybe three or four minutes and then faded like the other lights. It was very strange to say the least.", "I was sitting in my hot tub looking at the sky when I noticed this triangular shaped object in the sky. It was so weird. I watched it come over the hill behind my house and I followed it over my house and it was gone. I kept asking myself if it could have been a stealth bomber, but I never heard any delayed jet noise that I hear when I see a jet. This was without a doubt a government spy plane or a UFO.  My reason for writing this is to find out if I was the only one in this area to see this thing. Thanks ((name deleted))P.S. I notified my brother ( a cop) of this so if we heard anything on the news he wouldn&apos;t think I was full of it. Thanks", "Strange triangular structure floating across the sky.It was a cloudy, over cast day with clouds or fog very low in the sky. It had been raining on and off all day and the rain had stop at this point in the day, but the air was thick and heavy. I was on my way home from work driving south on Somonauk Rd. just a mile south of Hinckley, IL.  An object in the sky just above my truck caught my eye. It was moving across the road from the west side of the road to the east and was almost directly above me. I slowed the truck down and rolled down the window to get a better look at it since I was passing directly below it. It was not very high in the sky, maybe 10 feet higher than the telephone poles and was a triangular shape.  It was moving relatively slow maybe 20 mph. At first glance it looked kind of like the top of a cell phone tower.  It had a very simple structural look to it.  It kind of looked like a silver and bronze metal &ldquo;I&rdquo; beam structure in the shape of a triangle.  There was a lot of structural frame work holding the center which was more solid and circular shaped. Each corner of the triangle had a smaller metal looking beam that came down a few feet but angled in towards the center of the object. I didn&apos;t notice any sounds or lights or smoke or anything.  It just was floating across the sky heading east above the corn fields.  I have no idea what it was; I have never seen anything like it.  I stayed and watched it move further away from me until I couldn&apos;t see it anymore.  As I started to drive on down the road I was kind of freaked out and I had this strange feeling that is hard to describe.  I guess I would describe it as a depression or a sadness that only lasted a few minutes.  It was very strange.  I have gone home from work  the same way the last few days and I have made a point at looking to see if I was just seeing some kind of optical allusion or something, but I can&apos;t find anything in that area that resembles what I saw that afternoon.  I just know that I saw something strange in the sky that I have never seen in my life before.", "2 bright lights hovering over Interstate 35.I&apos;m a truck driver and noticed in the distance approx 10 miles down Interstate 35N bound, notice one bright white light in the sky. A couple of min. went by and the steady light seperated into two bright steady lights. As I got closer I could notice the lights were hovering over Interstate 35 as if just observing the traffic lights. As I got closer I also notice 3 very small blue steady lights approx. 50 ft away from the 2 main white lights. As I got eventually directly under the lights I rolled down the window and looked out for a better view and one light turned off (not faded slowly). Seconds later the 2nd light turned off.  There was not sound. And I know that other vehicles had seen the lights. Every vehicle had slowed down from 65 mph to about 45mph to catch a glimpse. The lights did appear to be very close to ground.", "Large craft with two red lights hovering in sky tracked by a police helicopter for several minutes.At approximately 10:45 p.m., a few friends and I were on our third story deck when we witnessed a strange object with two red lights hovering in the sky. Even more peculiar is that this object was being tracked by a police helicopter, which kept circling the object and shining a high intensity beam of light on it. The object did not move like any sort of aircraft we have even seen, and appeared almost stationery for five minutes before it gradually started moving downward until it eventually disappeared from view below the horizon. The helicopter began to fly at rapid speed in what appeared to be an attempt to track the object as it continued to move just below the tree lines for several more minutes. We were able to view the object while it was still high over our house with a pair of very good binoculars. Upon closer examination, one could clearly make out two very bright red lights that were close together. Its overall size appeared to be almost the same as the police helicopter&apos;s. Anything more than that would be pure speculation. However, as a person who frequently watches planes and similar craft flying over my house, I can positively state that these lights were not coming from any type of airplane advertisement, helicopter, remote controlled toy craft, or weather balloon, due to the extremely peculiar way it was able to just hover without really moving for several minutes and then take off very quickly. Also, if it made any noise from an engine, we couldn&apos;t hear it, but that may have been due to the loudness of the helicopter nearby. I don&apos;t expect the police to actually own up to chasing this thing, which is why I am reporting it here. However, I will attempt to follow up on this tomorrow by checking the local news reports and the Huntington Beach police blotter. I will submit another entry if I find anything else out.", "Triangle Object over Pismo Beach, CaliforniaMe and my boyfriend at the time, now he is my fiance, decided to go hang out at Pismo Beach with our good friend.

We all sat in a cirlce indian style and talked about life, existence, God ect...We then brought up UFO&apos;s and aliens and were talking about them as I often did with my fiance.  Then my fiance lifted his head up and looked in the sky and said aloud, &quot;That would be awsome if we saw a UFO RIGHT NOW,  Oh my God you guys look!&quot;  Then I looked up and saw one cloud of marine layer over my right sholder and out of the midst came a traingular object with a bright white light on the front corner. The object appeared right over head, about the height of a two story house roof top, the object then lowered itself like a triangle shelf coming out of the sky, heading north, and was completeley visible overhead.  The object was a triangle shape with white type lights on the corner edges of the triangle and some kind of movement or activity in the middle but I can not remember what exactly?  None of us could remember in detail, to this very date, what was in the very middle of the object...but we(me, my fiance, and our friend) have agreed that there was some sort of activity going on in the middle, and I can not elaborate futher upon that.  I felt an awsome aura come over ME in an instant and stood up with my arms in the air and I felt: That it was beutifull and &quot;From The Almighty!&quot; which came out of my mouth aloud.  There was absolutely no sounds except for the surf of the beach.  The object then lifted up just the same way it lowered itself pointing North, heading North.  The were no other clouds or obstructions in the clear sky and the triangle still seemed to enfold in some kind of unseen slot in the open sky.  We all saw the UFO and were so accepting it was like we had been expe! cting it The homeless man was surprised that my fiance &quot;knew&quot; it was comeing and was confused as to why we were so happy.  I told the homeless man that I knew it was Gods Millennial Cherubim from my childhood knowledge and we are suppose to be accepting.  We must recognize Him in all shapes and forms.  This experience had given ME knowledge of some sort.  I would not know how to describe to someone that was not there what happened for me mentally.

I could see now that the lights were rectangle and flashing one at a time from left to right. One was white, the middle was red, the other ode was blue.

In about 5 seconds they shut off and one very bright spot light shined down on the ground in front of me and was comming my way. That was it...I ran into a trailer park I was in front of and hid. I sat there shaking for about 20 minutes then snuck back out and had a look. It was gone. If it was a police helecopter it would have followed me and sent a car out to see why I ran, but i don&apos;t think the police had copters back then, and besides I would have heard the blades and as close as it was it should have been pretty windy. I ran home and never seen it again. I didn&apos;t go out at night for a few weeks either. All these years I have been waiting for someone to report the same thing. I never have.

Two of us took a quick hike to the nearby ridge to get a better look.  I thought at first that it was a campfire (it looked like a flame), but when we got a better look it was clear that the object was floating in the sky just above the trees; and it was lighting up the ground below it.  It seemed to change shape (sort of like how a flame moves and changes); and its colors were a bright redish-orange. The object moved very slow, but it did hover around methodically; yet not really precise either.  There was absolutely no sounds from the object.  The phenomenon lasted for about 10 minutes; and then the object literally shot into the sky at speeds that I didn&apos;t think were possible.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

The object was approximately three times the diameter of the brighest star in the sky.  I did not hear any sounds.  The sky was clear with many stars visible in spite of a bright moon.Object may have been a shooting star but it was very different from others I have seen over the years due to the absence of a tail and the manner in which it appeared to move.

I just happened to look almost straight up, just a little to the west I think, and a very small satellite caught my eye.  This object was traveling at approximately the same speed as one would expect from a satellite.  After traveling approximately 4-6 arc degrees in a straight line, the object turned 180 degrees in about a 3-4 arc distance.  It did not appear to slow down.  Shortly there after I lost sight of it because it was so dim. I am basing the size of the moon as 1 arc.

That night more like that whole month nothing but hot breezeless conditions so if it was @ the normal alt, sound would have eventually caught up.

Then the two lights faded into a purple-pinkish color and started moving and crossing paths again in a way that defined the laws of gravity. They would squiggle for a second, then they casually coasted through the clouds and started whisking away parallel with my window (still far away)..and as they flew away they would travel while continuously fly over eachother and then cross paths like they were joy-riding or something. it sounds weird, but it was quite beautiful, it was almost like they were dancing at one point, i was so excited and amazed by it. I followed them with my eyes as they zipped very quickly away into the clouds. There is no way this could have been any commercial or military aircraft because of its color, comlexity, speed, and it&apos;s very odd way of manuevering..

I was looking out over the ocean and enjoying the stars. It was a very clear night. I saw what I thought was a shooting star.  It was red and moving very rapidly. The only thing that was odd was that it was red (every shooting star I have seen was green or white). As it neared the horizon, the trajectory changed to a horizontal movement from the right to the left. After a second or less it suddenly doubled back at aproxamitly 15 degrees and went back out into space at a speed 10x what it was going when it came in to view.  We both had goosebumps for hours!

As I drove closer, I began to realize that it wasn&apos;t a helicopter or plane, or anything I&apos;d seen before.  I kept driving in the direction of the light, and I noticed it descending and approaching the ground.  I turned off the main road and headed East, but that&apos;s when I noticed the light was following me and getting closer.  As it grew closer, I was able to see it more closely.  &quot;It&quot; was four diffused lights, swirling around as if chasing one another in circles.  They did not have definite shapes, like lightbulbs would, but the lights seemed to swirl and liquify and move in inconsistant, constantly changing blob-patterns.  I rolled down my window and waved, and the lights caught up to my car and &quot;we&quot; were traveling side-by-side (though the lights were in the sky, and I was on the road).   I took several more turns, now onto a backroad, but the lights followed.Somewhere along the way, one of the lights must have taken off, because when I looked back, there were only three lights following me.  I finally made it to my house and ran inside to get my roommates (to make sure I wasn&apos;t seeing things).The four of us (roommates) went outside.  Everyone claimed to see it at the time, though now one of my roommates denies that she saw it.One by one, my roommates went back inside the house while I stayed outside and watched it for probably 15 more minutes.  I noticed it getting further away now, heading West and rising higher in the sky.  As it got further, the lights stretched and combined, forming a thin, bright, horizontal light.

I saw that someone else had reported this for the same time period, I believe the date that person gave was accurate or it was very close to that date. Regardless of the date though I know the time being around 9-9:30pm is accurate.  I know exactly where the Car Wash is that was referred to. As I write this I have goosebumps just reliving that night. I want to confirm that I had also witnessed the same thing from a different vantage point. In 1978 I was a Sophomore going to Natick High School, I was 16 years old.  I lived in East Natick, MA. and I would occasionally go in to Natick Town Forest at night and sit on the ridge that overlooked the big field and compose my thoughts and just sort of wonder about life in general. It was usually quiet, peaceful and it was right down the street from my house. I remember the night that this huge object came flying over head. The object appeared to come from the North East at about the one o&apos;clock position which now makes sense if this person saw it up near the Car Wash (Scrub a Dub) I think was the name. I was sitting on the ridge above and in the middle of the the field facing due West. If you look at this map on google:  http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=Macarthur+Rd.+Natick,+MA+01760&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=16&amp;ll=42.296151,-71.331589&amp;spn=0.01111,0.027122&amp;t=h&amp;om=1  you will see a large almost rectangular space, that was the field, the round tower was/is a water tower. The Car Wash was at the corner of Oak St. and Worcester Rd. Whatever this was it hovered above the field for what felt like approximately five minutes, during that time I felt like I was being communicated to but I had no idea how, why or just what exactly was going on.  I did not feel scared and actually quite the opposite I remember feeling a sense of amazement at whatever this was. After five minutes (it really seemed and felt much, much longer)whatever this was took off straight up. I remember hearing two sonic booms and it was gone. It was a crystal clear night when this happened and although it felt warm at times there were still some very cool breezes and I was wearing a jacket and hat. I also remember there were no clouds in the sky that night I remember that I could see the stars very clear. Like the person that wrote and posted the other initial observance I also have not been able to erase the memory from my mind and I still continually think about it. It is actually one of the reasons for me finding that persons post in the first place, I googled &quot;Natick UFO&quot; because I hoped that by now some other people might have put something out on the web about seeing something so I could confirm that I wasn&apos;t just freaking out that night. I agree, it was spherical (round) in shape and it was as big as a LARGE HOUSE! It had a lot of different colors but I didn&apos;t really think of them as &quot;lights&quot; the way we think about light bulbs, the colors were more flashing in a circular pattern just underneath the bottom of it. I also agree that it made absolutely NO NOISE except for the two sonic booms that I heard when it finally took off. I also confirm all of the dogs barking in the neighborhood. I also agree with how the previous poster &quot;sensed&quot; rather than really saw that it was solid, you could just feel the presence of something solid there and what I was looking at was also very, very smooth, everything got very quiet and then all of a sudden when it was over the field it seemed like every sound &quot;underneath&quot; it was being amplified. There was a very strong &quot;electrical&quot; almost it seemed vibrational presence (that is really the only way I know how to describe it).  I remember looking at the trees around the field when the object did take off and they had a very eerie almost phosphorescent glow to them. I guess the thing that really bothered me back then was when I wanted to talk about it then no one else seemed to want to talk about it. I would mention it and get a look like &quot;yes, i know, but I am not able to say anything about it&quot; almost like they were scared to talk about or just plain unable to talk about it for some unknown reason. When the previous person mentioned the woman&apos;s reaction of &quot;hmmmm...oh yes&quot; that is almost exactly how it was, people acknowledged this thing to some degree but were unable to or just did not want to verbalize or be excited about it for any reason, just like being in a trance. Like the previous poster for the past 25 years I have often wondered just what the heck happened to that night and WHY!  I would also love to be able to talk about this with the person that posted the original just to compare notes, we might be able to answer some questions but more than likely I have this strange feeling that we would be looking for answers that just are not going to be made apparent to us. I also swear that everything that I have typed is true. I have no reason to hype this. All I know was that I was very glad to see that someone else saw the same thing I did that night in the early spring of &quot;78&quot; and I am gratefully to that person for posting their experience. -M((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Looking up and focusing closely, I realized it was actually three steady non-strobing white lights in a narrow triangular arrangement and seemed to be a single object seen from an angle. The sky was clear and cloudless with a multitude of visible stars. Two airplanes with normal blinking lights could be seen traveling south at different normal altitudes in the distant south-west sky. The unusual white light was moving three to four times faster than a conventional aircraft and it was its unusual speed which first caught my attention. The light then suddenly accelerated moving twice as fast in an upward arc in an &quot;S&quot; shaped manoeuvre as it shifted direction towards the east and south, nearly directly above my head and it headed over the ocean, then it looped again, reversed direction and accelerated towards the south-west, climbing in the sky until it vanished from sight. The entire sighting probably lasted less than two minutes as it traveled from north to south, then east, then towards the south-west, although the extraordinary nature of the event made it seem much longer in duration. It was not a conventional aircraft or a meteor or bolide. It was unlike anything I have ever seen before and I pay attention to the sky. The velocity of its acceleration, its silence, and the graceful ease with which it moved combined with its bizarre trajectory across the sky brought me to immediate full attention and I felt utterly amazed. After it vanished I spent several minutes studying the visible sky above the barrier island where I live, then I went in my house and, very excited, I phoned a friend advising him to go outside and look around. I then grabbed binoculars, went back outdoors and spent several minutes scanning ! the warm , clear, windless sky. The unusual light had vanished and there were no airplanes to be seen either. My friend called back and reported that he had seen nothing unusual from his wooded area 20 miles north of me.

I was sitting outside of my house in Midvale (Salt Lake City) Utah having a cigarette.  After casually gazing at the southern sky for a few minutes I started noticing objects appearing from the east.  My first impression was that it was a flock of white birds, illuminated by the city lights, flying to the west.  But then they formed into a perfect triangle, changed course slightly, and traveled west then disappeared into the sky.  Frankly, I thought I was just seeing things or they were in fact a flock of birds.  Another wave of these white objects then appeared, formed into 3 triangles, then headed to the west.  At this point, I was convinced I was seeing UFOs.  I am 30 years old and have never dreamed that I would witness something so strange in the night sky.  Then I started seeing other types of objects.  They were very big objects that looked liked grey clouds, but they all had sharp edges and were with the same exact shape, these flew side by side and headed of towards the western sky.  They started coming wave after wave, mostly the white objects that were sometimes accompanied by the much larger grey objects.  At this point I was getting quite scared and simply could not believe what I was seeing.  Then I saw a group of red orbs that formed into a cluster ball, this was surrounded by some kind of light that resembled a corona or aura.  This headed in a slightly different direction but still slowly to the west.  When it traveled, it passed behind my neighbors house, then reappeared on the other side then faded after it traveled for a bit.  I was already stunned by witnessing the previous objects, but this one just blew me away.  After that happened there was nothing in the sky for a few minutes, then the waves of the white and grey objects passed close overhead.  This went stop and go and the entire experience lasted around 40 minutes.  During the time I was on the phone with my girlfriend and brother describing what I was seeing and was astounded to say the least.  I have always been a skeptic.  I don&apos;t believe in ghosts, voodoo, psychics and such things.  I have always had doubts about UFOs, but I always believed they could be possible.  I never thought that in my life I would see something like this and hopefully I will always remember.  This could not have been anything man made.  The way the objects were moving in the sky almost looked like they were alive.  They were completely silent as they grouped up in formation and flew towards the west.  It is hard to say how far the objects were considering that I have no idea what they were.  All of the objects were kind of faint, but you could still make them out because of their movement.  One of the white object clusters blinked several times then disappeared.  I sincerely hope somebody confirms this event, it was awesome and I would like to compare sightings.

I obviously could not take my eyes off it as my brain went into explanation overload but no answer was in the data base, and my own sense of reasoning told me this is not happening. But as time went on, just a minute or two, my brain and reasoning started to calm down and I regained control.Let me just say that at no time did I ever feel frightened or threatened, in fact just the opposite. Standing at the bottom of my bed was a creature not of this world. He or she did not move, but just gazed right at me. The eyes did move though, very slightly when the creature appeared to blink very slowly. I was overwhelmed with a feeling of calm and peace which the creature seemed to be transmitting like some sort of telepathy. I then felt it was ok to lift myself up further with my elbows to be more comfortable. Then just as I had done so, my sense of reasoning kicked in. First of all I have got to be sure without any doubt what so ever, that what I am seeing and experiencing is absolutly true, and not a figment of my imagination. Not a dream. Not some trick of light. Not some querk of physics or anything else. These thoughts were very strong because you can not explain what is happening, what you are seeing, but you need too, and quickly. So first thing I had to do is convince myself I was not asleep and dreaming. Well it is the middle of the night and I was in bed! I already knew the answer but I had to check and double check. Yes I pinched myself numerous times, but you do know when you are awake. The creature was still there.Happy with the &apos;I am awake checks&apos;, onto the next thing. Maybe, just maybe its a trick of some light somwhere, I have to remove that doubt as well. So first to the window and, nothing, pitch black as usual. Not even a hint of moonlight which you can get on a clear night with a near full moon. Right, window checked, I need to check the rest of the room now as well. The creature was still there. Gazing, and appearing to smile. The light just eminated from the face. I didn&apos;t want to take my eyes of him or her for a second but I had to, to check the rest of the room. I started to the left of me at floor level, and slowly scanned every inch of the floor and lower wall untill I had been round the whole room. I then moved up a couple of feet and repeated the process. I then covered the upper wall, the ceiling, the whole lot. Nothing. I then repeated the process again because my brain was not accepting it somehow. Well I had done everything I could do, to try to explain this thing, now I had to just accept that what I was seeing was very very real, and an alien to this world.The best way I can descibe the creature is from the film &apos;&apos;Close encounter&apos;s of the Third kind&apos;&apos;The alien that comes out of the space craft towards the end of the film.Similar to what is described today as the classic grey. The one at the end of my bed was just over four feet tall. The head appeared slightly more round than the classic grey. The eyes were large and slanted up, but not black. They were very open as I have already said. The pupils were large and what we describe as the white of the eyes, this was a faint very pale yellow. I could not notice any nose or ears. The lower body and arms were not lit by the light so a desciption was difficult. After I had accepted the truth of what I was experiencing, my main thought now was, nobody will ever believe it. You must have been dreaming. How many had you had last night? I glanced down at my wife to the right of me, sound asleep. She is my only possible witness. I then tried to wake her with gentle movements of my hand against her leg under the covers. My wife eventually started to make noises, turned over, and obviously didn&apos;t want to be disturbed. But I persisted. She started to talk without opening her eyes. &apos;&apos;What? What? What is it? I&apos;m tired.&apos;&apos; &apos;&apos;Jo. Jo. Wake up I said&apos;&apos; I gave her leg a good shove and looked down at her, and just as she was about to wake up and open her eyes, the bedroom went dark. I quickly looked round and the creature was gone. How? I don&apos;t know. Was he or she beamed down like something out of Star Trek? Maybe. Did I imagine or dream the whole thing? Absolutly One Million Percent No. The whole experience lasted fifteen to twenty minutes approx. Thats the way it happened. And it is firmly etched on my mind and will be untill I die. I sometimes still stare into the dark when I am in bed and expect the creature to return. And when I look up at the night sky I hope he or she will return and tell me of their life in the other world I Know exists, somewhere.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Cars traveling North and south were slowing down to view object.", "Black, flashing oval flying and then vanishing over Los Angeles.I was outside taking a break from my work place and standing by the parking lot facing south / south-west. From this vantage, I regularly see distant aircraft on their approach or take off from LAX. This time I saw an elliptical object about 40 to 45 degrees above horizon level. What got my attention was that this object was black, or at least some really dark color that looked black.The day was pretty clear, as in very little haze or smog as well as very little wind. The black object was moving in a steady line from left to right. It was difficult to tell the speed, since it was difficult to tell the distance. However, I do believe it was at least a mile away if not farther. There is another building several yards across the parking lot, so I could not get any distant reference. It did seem like it&rsquo;s size would be of a large helicopter (maybe a little smaller than a Chinook, but bigger than a corporate Bell) and it&rsquo;s speed would&rsquo;ve been comparable at that distance. At first glance this is what I thought it might be since I couldn&rsquo;t think of any other type of aircraft which would be so black and not looking like a plane.What changed my mind was it&rsquo;s sudden flash of white light.  At first I thought it was a reflection of it&rsquo;s surface from the sun &ndash; something I see often from other planes out of LAX. The light was very brilliant white like a large star in the bright, clear blue sky. After about 6-8 seconds, it flashed again. This I thought was very odd, since the reflection off the sun should only happen once unless the object reversed which of course which it did not. After another 6-8 seconds it flashed again. The &ldquo;shape&rdquo; of the flash outside of the flare and halo, seemed to be square-ish, as in having right angles. Like that of a light reflecting off a flat mirror or glass. The light was also large and seemed to cover at least half of the object -- the right half from my POV. The reason I&rsquo;m able to tell you the details of the light is only because it continued to flash in what seemed regular intervals. This was the second most outstanding thing, because at that point, I walked to the middle of the parking lot trying to figure out how the flashes were possible. The light was brilliant and large &ndash; nothing like I&rsquo;ve seen from any aircraft. If it was the sun&rsquo;s reflection, then the only thing I could think of that would cause regular-interval flashes would be if the black object was rotating in some fashion catching the sun&rsquo;s rays in each rotation.If it had continued on it&rsquo;s way and I lost sight of it, I probably would not have sent this report in, since I have never seen what I would consider a UFO before even though I had been interested in the phenomena.The reason I am reporting this is because of the most outstanding point of the event: with the last flash, maybe the 6th or 8th, the black object disappeared. Simply vanished. I actually laughed at this because it went against normal reality. When I was watching the object, I was trying to make sense of it: a mylar balloon, or something highly reflective. I&apos;ve never seen or heard of a highly reflective balloon that was that large and black and traveling in a nearly horizontal fashion at that relatively low altitude. But not even a balloon simply vanishes from one second to the next. I scanned the nearby sky around it and stood there for another five minutes, but never saw it again. I could not make out any trail or debris, or anyting. The black flashing oval was unique enough, but to have it disappear completely is truly something I can&rsquo;t explain.There was only one person I saw walking down the parking lot at that time and he obviously was unaware of anything. By the way, my background is in photography as well as film (cinema.) I also took a flying course in Colorado when I was younger. I believe I am highly aware of what many types of aircraft, from large and small planes to helicopters and blimps look like. Especially living in Los Angeles, we have all of that traffic in the sky. I am also quite familiar to atmospheric distortion and light conditions, so I don&rsquo;t think I was seeing something that could easily be explained away.Thank you for this opportunity for me to report.", "I was driving up a long hill to the top in my car .

Phoenix and Scottsdale police and Rural/Metro Fire Department dispatchers received calls from residents reporting a plane going down in &quot;a ball of fire.&quot; Another caller reported seeing a meteor. &quot;It was a large ball of flame,&quot; Rural/Metro Fire Department spokeswoman Alison Cooper said. &quot;It was very large. It was seen as far as Washington state.&quot; advertisement  Kip and Valerie Wachter saw the fireball pass over their heads about 10:15 Sunday evening as they walked north of Pinetop. &quot;The colors were a bright green, red, white. The size was about three times wider than its length. It seemed to emanate a low, soft swishing sound as it passed overhead,&quot; the Wachters wrote in an e-mail to The Republic. Steve Kates, a Chandler resident and science journalist known as &quot;Dr. Sky,&quot; said that description, particularly the noise, was consistent with meteoric activity. Most meteors visible on earth occur high in the atmosphere and these &quot;shooting stars&quot; are about the size of a grain of dust, said Jeffrey Hall, associate director at the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff. &quot;The great majority are these tiny particles moving through the atmosphere at a high rate of speed,&quot; Hall said. &quot;Larger ones tend to be moving more slowly and produce a much larger trail through the sky.&quot;  Between 10 and 50 meteor events occur over the Earth each day, according to the American Meteor Society, with the vast majority happening over oceans and out of eyesight. Meteors lose mass and decelerate as they enter the atmosphere, with only the largest slamming into the Earth and forming a crater. Scientists think the Barringer Crater, near Winslow, was formed by an iron meteor about 50,000 years ago. Kates said a meteorite the size of a human fist could have created the light show West Coast residents witnessed Sunday night. Rural/Metro responded to the north side of Saguaro Lake but found no sign of damage or destruction from a plane crash, Cooper said. Witnesses reported seeing the meteor travel from southwest to northeast. Hall said the meteor likely never made it to the ground. &quot;This is not like a mountain coming into the atmosphere. It&apos;s more like the size of a softball,&quot; Hall said. &quot;Even something this bright probably burned up completely in the atmosphere.&quot;  If you saw the meteor or have photos of it, call reporter JJ Hensley at (602) 444-7964 or e-mail him at jj.hensley@arizonarepublic.com", "The light could move slowly or inordinately fast any direction in complete silence.My husband and I were night fishing on Douglas lake near Newport,Tennessee.We were both teachers and it was summer.We do not drink etc.I told my husband to look at the satellite moving over English Mountain.

I have a long background in technical design and analysis for defence projects. Among other things I am a licenced Amateur Radio Operator, I am also an amateur photographer, although I was in the air force, I was not a flier. I am not ever given to going off half cocked and I do look quite carefully and often quadruple check unusual events for logical explanations and often find them. My first witness (looked like a paw) is a level headed surveyor accustomed to using his vision professionally and noting with care. My second witness (harbinger of hail) is more of a passing nature, an out of town visitor whom I asked what he thought of that cloud. Being that I am involved within and without the military troubleshooting complicated electronic equipment and systems, I have developed a keen habit of noting almost everything visual. I use corrective lenses and I was using them at the time. I am diet controlled Diabetic Type II and so was quite in charge of my senses. I know that the ground winds were from the West as the forest was shielding us from the wind in our tents.  There can be no doubt as to the date of this event for a)I have found the debit card record for a purchase of wild rice and b) that the wind and the rain woke me up several times during the night before this sighting.

I cancelled the call and scrolled the sky until I was at about an 80 degree angle just north of the moon.  A brighter than usual star (maybe -1 mag.) caught my attention.  It was moving east to west at a fairly high rate of speed.  It was circular in shape and white in color.  There was no trail what so ever.  I assumed it was a satellite and decided to watch it until it disappeared from the horizon.  After several seconds I was astonished.  The object slowed and than at that instant, it made a 90 degree direction change and accelerated to an astonishing speed.  It was out of sight in a second or fraction of.

It was still light out, and i was looking at the sky as i often do, and saw what appeared to be a sphere-shaped silver metal object flying to the north, at an altitude of what couldnt have been more than 200 ft., maybe a quarter mile if that from where i was sitting.  It was traveling fairly slow, at a steady speed, and then I tried to take a picture of it with my camera phone but the lighting and distance made it impossible to get a good shot.  It then passed behind a tree branch, and i waited to see it in between the trees, but it just disappeared.  Now i know that it is not a plane.  It was too close and the shape was clearly not of any human flying machines.  I believe it cut a quick 90 degree turn east when it disappeared because i went downstairs to get a better look, and was looking at where it should have been at that point if it was still traveling the same speed and there was nothing.  I told my roommate about it when he came down, i expected him to laugh at me and not take me seriously, but this is something that i would never joke about (no matter how much i wish they would come and take me away.) I later told my boyfriend about it and my uncle, who is a retired scientist.  Everyone i told took me seriously, and i am constantly looking out for my little friend everyday, hoping to get a picture to prove i wasnt just seeing what i wanted to see.  when i first saw it i had to stare for a bit to make sure i wasnt seeing things, but i was staring for at least 30 seconds before i got my camera phone out of my pocket, so im positive of what i saw.

I never reported this as I thought no one would believe me. Recently, I was watching a special UFO show on the Discovery channel and just about fell off my bed when a photo showed a UFO that was EXACTLY like the one my Mother and I saw way back when. Perhaps I will now come forward and hope my experience will help you and those researching UFO&apos;s.When my sighting took place, I had been in bed with an illness. I was laying on what my parents called our &quot;sun porch&quot; it was a room filled with windows and hanging plants. It was around 11:30 PM as my Father and Mother were watching a Football game on the TV. I&apos;m not sure if this was in October or November but it was definately one of those months. In any event I had been laying in bed and noticed it was getting very light outside. I thought that odd, so I looked out the window to investigate. I was shocked to find hovering over our barn a very large circular object that looked like a full moon. It definately was NOT the moon as the moon was in a different area of the sky. It made NO noise at all, NOTHING! I screamed for my parents to come and look but my Father just laughed and continued watching the game. My Mother on the other hand, did come out to investigate with me. We opened the door and went out side to get a better view. The object was approximately 20-30 feet above our barn and was very bright. The craft had a metalic type appearence in the shape of a full moon and the same brightness. I ventured out to the lawn while my mother stood on the porch watching. I can still remember looking up at this object while standing on the cold,grass. I waved at it and yelled up but it just continued to hover over our barn. I then noticed lights which looked like chaser lights in a strobe like fashion going all around the bottom outside of the craft. It continued strobing for about 5 minutes then suddenly a bright light focused directly onto me. My Mother began yelling for me to get back into the house immediately. I will NEVER forget that night as long as I live! My hair stood up similar to when your wearing stocking feet on a carpet. The light was fixed directly onto me and what ever was operating the craft definately saw me and focused a spot light of some kind directly onto me for about 10 minutes. I felt as if I could not even move it was very weird sensation which is very difficult to even describe. I could hear my Mother yelling for me to get back into the house and suddenly I was able to move again and ran as fast as I could back into the house. The spot light continued to stay in place even after I was back on the porch. With in a few minutes the spot light disappeared and the craft continued to hover above our barn with out making a single sound. Then it suddenly disappeard. It just vanished and was gone.My Mother and I went inside to tell my Father what had happened. He told us we were crazy and wanted to know what we had been drinking. My Mother was a Nurse and worked for a local town Physician. Townsend was a small town and my Mother and I decided not to mention our experience to anyone as we felt no one would believe us, or they would definately make fun of it. Even so, I had a difficult time trying to explain to friends and neighbors why I had a sun burn in the middle of fall when I had not even been outside due to my illness. My Mother and I came to the conclusion that the spot light from the floating object caused the sunburn. We had no other explanation for the redness of my skin. I had gone to bed pale and woke up with a sunburn! Why? I have no clue! Since that time I never forgot that and probably never will. I was NOT taken into the craft or saw aliens or anything like that. I have no idea what my Mother and I saw that night but it definately was NOT military.  When I graduated High school, I went onto spend 2 years in College then dropped out of College and went into the United States Navy. My military training consisted of working in a PatWing where I saw lots of planes. I spoke with several fighter pilots and worked as a radio operator with a TS clearance. Several pilots spoke to me about things they had seen but were unable to discuss.Regardless of that, I&apos;ve always wanted to know if anyone else had ever seen what my Mother and I saw back in Townsend Mass on that chilly night. I&apos;ve rarely spoken to anyone about that particular night but feel that someone should know. Hopefully people like you who research this for a living might help to shed some light on the sightings that I and so many others in this World have seen.This took place many years ago. Like my Mother, I also went to Nursing School after I was discharged from the Navy. I only tell you this so you will know I am a reliable witness to what I saw. Perhaps one day we will all have an answer to what is happening in the skies of our World. I know for a fact that our Government and the Government of other Countries keep things from the public which I&apos;ve never understood why.Thank you for your research and I wish you luck.Sincerely ((initials deleted))((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date in November 1975 is approximate.

On Sunday, August 13, 2006, we were playing our last round at the Witch course on Highway 544, northwest of Socastee, S.C.  Just before teeing off on one of the holes, me and two other people playing in our group spotted a shiny spherical object between us and the clouds.  Upon observing the object, we saw that it would reflect light, then it would not...seemingly in a pattern. The object was on a steady, but not noticeab;e fast track across the sky.  We did not hear a noise emmiting from the object.  We were kind of in a hurry because there were people playing behind us, so we did not keep looking at it for a long period, but we did get a picture.  I downloaded the picture from the camera and found the object in the picture.  It was not reflecting light when the picture was snapped, but it is visible in the picture.  I brought the photo into photoshop, and increased the color saturation, and the object really stands out!! I am attaching the photos. If you look at the photo, you can see a faint &quot;aura&quot; around it like in some other UFO photos I&apos;ve seen...it also appears to be perfectly spherical.", "My friend and I were relaxing in a park during the summer of 1986 not far from a friends house where we had left about a half hour earlier. We weren&apos;t quite ready to go home yet or call it day. I was reclined under a nearby tree in the park while my friend sat leaning against the same tree. The park was about 2 miles north/northwest of Kirtland Air Force Base not far from a local trailer park. I looked up through the sparse tree limbs and leaves at the stars in the sky above and it was a fairly clear night with a few sparse and thin clouds above but probably 90-95% clear skies. Suddenly, I began to hear a faint hum off in the distance and the sound seemed to be coming from in front of us but it was hard to determine exactly where it was coming from. The sound became a bit louder probably no more than 40 or 50 decibels. Finally as the sound seemed to be right over us it rose in level to about 60 to 70 decibels. At that time I noticed that the stars directly above me seemed to disappear one by one. My friend and I became aware that a large dark object was now passing overhead. The object was jet black, and appeared smooth and was shaped rather like chevron but more rounded at the edges rather than square. In appearance it was almost like balsa wood sanded smooth with a coat of jet black paint applied to it. It was approximately 100 meters (possibly more) in length from wingtip to wingtip. The width was difficult to determine but I would say about 100 ft at its widest point. The height I could not determine. It had a row of lights along the leading edge, dim and white and a similar row of lights along the back edge. On each wing tip it had one large bright white light which seemed to be almost yellow at times. Near its front, it emitted a floodlight like light which shone down in front of it onto the ground covering an area probably as large as two football fields or perhaps more. Except for the constant hum it made no other sound as it glided overhead about 1200 ft. off the ground. It seemed to climb higher and higher as it travelled on a northwesterly course finally changing its direction to northeast and rising higher and higher as it went. The front floodlight seemed to turn off but the other lights were still visible and it finally disappeared over the Manzano mountain range after about 5 minutes. I would estimate the speed as very slow probably 80-100 mph maybe less as it passed overhead. It seemed to move almost like a blimp but more silently and it was certainly nothing like an airplane or a hot air balloon.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

At about 4:30 in the afternoon on or about March 25 or 2005, my freind and I were out in my backyeard. I was sitting at my gold panning tub while he was looking into my side yard. My freind told me &quot;You need to check this out.&quot; I thought he was looking at some flaw on my roof or a cooler leak etc...I just made some joke about not wanting to see whatever it was. Then he repeated in a rather puzzled but stern voice...&quot;No, I mean it, come here and check this out!&quot;  I got up reluctantly and asked what he was looking at. He said &quot;I&apos;m not sure what the heck it is. I thought it was a parachutis in trouble but it just doesn&apos;t look right for that.&quot; He pointed in the general direction where he was looking. At first I didn&apos;t see anything, but then out from behind a tele pole I got my first glimpse of it. I tried to focus on ths object to tell what it was. Because of it&apos;s motion in the first few seconds of my seeing the object, I thought it was a kite. There appeared to be a tringular shaped object on top, with a smaller one below it. The lower craft appeared to be &quot;tethered to the upper, as it was moving back and forth in a pendulus swinging motion.&quot; Initially it looked like a kite. However after watching it a few more seconds it became apparent that whatever this was was moving across the sky far too fast for a kite busted off it&apos;s string. Also, the pendulus motion in a constant back and forth arc below the upper object was very precise and rythmic in pattern. The movement is really what made the sighting &quot;eerie/odd/unexplainable&quot; as with each cycle of back and forth motion (8 o&apos;clock to 4 o&apos;clock), the object(s) paused, then elevated and began another swinging cycle. At the end of each back/forth cycle, it paused, and elevated. I observed this happen aout 4 or 5 times and then the oddest thing happened...the little object on the bottom went in a full circle all the way around the top object in a matter of a second. It started in it&apos;s normal 8 o&apos;clock position, but then did a complete loop around the upper diamond object and stopped on a dime in the 4:00 position, and then began another back/forth swing. I ran through the house as the trees in my neighbors yard were now in the path of the object. I jumped on top of my freind&apos;s truck to see if I could find the object again from my front yard but it was no where to be seen. There was no sound, no lights. The onjects were perhaps shimmering a bit, but the odd thing is I&apos;m not sure if that was from it&apos;s reflective qualities or a &quot;blur&quot; as the objects were never crisply defined in my sight. I recall really trying to focus on them because of this aspect of their appearance, but to no avail. I could tell they were diamon in shape, with the shorter axis of the diamonds at 12 and 6 o&apos;clock. The objects seemed to be tan to dark grey and varied in hue over time. My freind and I remain pretty convinced this was something that defies any objects we could think of that might exhibit this sort of free flight. Again, it was the precise period of the swing, the repetitive precision of the starting and stopping points of the swing, the vertical elevation in between each cycle, and the swiftness of the loop around the upper object with it&apos;s rapid halt that made this sighting truly bizzarre to us. It&apos;s the only thing I&apos;ve ever seen in my 48 years that still has me scratching my head. I&apos;m a bit mad that I didn&apos;t write everything down that day, as I struggle to recall if I actually saw a tehter, or if it was just the precision of the movement of the lower object that implied such a tether (sorry)((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))", "3 silent objects flying at extreme speed, first resembled tiny stars but loomed larger as out-of-focus, orange &quot;oval&quot; lightsLet me preface this by saying that I&apos;ve never ever seen anything in my 30+ years that could not be satisfied with some kind of reasonable explanation.  I&apos;ve never before seen or experienced anything that I felt was convincingly supernatural, extraterrestrial, etc.  I am open-minded but skeptical; I am willing to accept the possibility of just about anything being true, but I need to see some hard, scientific evidence.  I majored in biology in college, I work in a medical laboratory, and I am certainly not a flighty person.  Two days ago I would have laughed at the thought of posting a UFO report on the web, and yet here I am. This all took place last night, Saturday, 8/19/06, at about 9:30 pm in Tacoma, WA.  It had been sunny and clear all day, and the night sky was clear too.  It was warm in the house, so I went out onto my deck in the backyard for some cool air. I reclined in the lounge chair on my deck, facing southeast.  I looked up at the stars, as I like to do, and noted that I could see more stars than usual. Suddenly, I noticed out of the corner of my eye some movement in the sky directly above my head.  I focused my eyes on the object(s) and at first interpreted what I saw to be a shooting star (by the way, my vision is 20/20).  But then I noticed that there were 3 of them, traveling together (2 were close together, side by side, and the third was slightly ahead (i.e., south) and east of them).  I thought, &quot;Wow, 3 shooting stars?&quot;  They were at this point so far away that they appeared exactly as tiny stars lightyears away, and they were moving as fast as shooting stars.  Not slowly like satellites - they were moving at great speed.  I watched these &quot;shooting stars&quot; for a second or two, waiting for them to burn out.  But they didn&apos;t. They did not burn out.  In fact, they grew larger in appearance as they traveled and presumably grew closer to the Earth.  What started out looking like tiny white stars shooting across the heavens quickly increased in size until they were maybe 100 times larger than they first appeared.  As they loomed larger their appearance also was transformed, from tiny white specks to, eventually, much larger &quot;ovals&quot; that were light orange in color.  What&apos;s interesting is that as they enlarged they became more out of focus.  It was difficult to distinguish the exact shape or form of these objects, because they appeared as light only (not terribly bright, and not glowing or radiant light -- it was more self-contained), and were so out of focus.  Not blurry or hazy or furry, but out of focus, as though they were traveling so fast that their light was reaching my eyes at a slower rate than at which they were moving.  That&apos;s the only way I can describe it.  I know that nothing travels faster than light, but I imagine that, if something were able to move faster than light, this might be what it would look like.  My brain struggled to assign a shape to their form:  &quot;oval&quot; is what came to mind but this is not entirely accurate.  They were somewhere in between oval, disc-shaped, and boomerang-shaped.  There was no flashing light, no trail behind them, no beams, and absolutely no sound. I watched these 3 objects travel across the sky heading south, weaving back and forth slightly (side to side) as they moved.  Then they seemed to swoop down and then continue on in a southwest direction.  Even though they wove from side to side slightly, they maintained their basic formation (basically lined up along an east-west axis, but with 2 close together and one slightly ahead).  At one point, as they flew off into the southwest direction, the 2 that had been closer together moved apart and then returned back together.  They moved extremely quickly and effortlessly across the sky, with great ease and fluidity; they appeared to be extremely agile, smooth, powerful, and with a definite sense of direction or destination (they were not traveling along a rigid trajectory, or meandering or switching directions or moving randomly).  Their flight path was fluid; they appeared to swoop down across the sky, from outer space towards our atmosphere, and then they continued on heading south west.  I watched them until my view was obscured by the roofline of my house.  I jumped up and ran to the edge of my deck to see if I could catch another glimpse of them, but they were gone.  All of this took place in the span of about 5 to 7 seconds. As I watched this all unfold, I felt scared, sick to my stomach, awe-struck.  I was overcome with an awareness that I was witnessing something not of this world.  I&apos;ve been racking my brains for some earthly explanation for these objects, that can travel and change altitudes and weave back and forth at tremendous speed, with such agility, all in complete silence.  I&apos;ve never seen a quality of light like that emitted from those objects as they drew closer.  My heart was pounding.  I called people excitedly on my phone, to tell them what I had seen.  I sat out on my deck for some time afterward, searching the sky.  I was scared but felt almost ecstatic to have witnessed something so incredible.  I imagine that others must have seen it too, and I hope that they&apos;ll report it.  And if there is some reasonable, earthly explanation for what I saw, I&apos;d like to know what it is.", "lights and creatureI was driving the school bus from Greenville to New Aiyansh. We departed Greenville @ 7:20a.m., about twenty minutes out of Greenville I came upon two very bright lights right in the middle of the highway. I noticed that I was 3 Hydro poles away from the lights(thinking that it was a broken down logging truck, due to the round bright lights), when I approached closer(about 1 1/2 poles away) I saw a very strange creature pacing back and forth. The creature stopped after pacing between the lights twice, looked in our direction and disappeared, and I mean it really vanished as if it went invisible. 2 other students, plus a teacher on-board my bus also saw the creature. Large egg-shaped head and a long skinny body, with arms that reached the knees.", "White light flies over OmahaMonday (9/04/06) evening I had stepped into my brothers backyard with his 18 month old daughter in my arms.  It was dark and the moon was high and to the left as I faced south.  As soon as I stepped out of the house, the first thing I saw was not the moon, but a very bright, fast moving, white light in the sky.  It was as bright as the moon and at first I thought it was the police helicopter with it&apos;s searchlight on.  It took only seconds for me to realize that was not what I was seeing.  My niece, whom I do not count as a witness due to her age, could not stop pointing at it.  Once I realized this was no ordinary craft, I yelled in the house for my brother to come out and see it.  In doing so, I alerted the entire house.  In all, 4 adults, an eleven year old, and my 18 month old niece all saw the phenomena.  The light moved across the sky from west to east.  It moved in a fairly quick, yet consistent speed.  It only varied course slightly when it appeared to be manuevering to it&apos;s left and right.  In all, the light was visible for about 1 minute.  At it&apos;s end, it disolved into the distance.  We then stayed outside for about half an hour to &quot;star gaze&quot;.  In that half an hour we saw several commercial flights at various elevations, a satellite in orbit, and the police helicopter did fly over (without searchlight)and was obvious to us that if the helicopter did fly over we would have definately heard it.  Ruling those things out, we came to two possibile conclussions; 1 )it was an outer worldly craft, 2) being that we live in Omaha, we are accustomed to seeing craft from the S.A.C. airforce base (B-2 Steaths, fighter jets, etc...).  However, this craft made no banking turn to where the base would be located and seemed to dissapear once it passed the moon.  We are fairly certain that this was no government aircraft and are just curious to see if you have heard of any similar reportings in this area.  This was my second personal encounter, the first took place in 1990 and was no where near as i! mpressive.  Thank you for your time.", "15-20 round balls of light moving in formationWe first thought it was a long string of balloons that had taken flight. We stopped the car and the 4 of us got out of the car and watched in the darkness. We took about 20 pictures but none came out. The objects at first seemed to be attached to each other round and bright white.They began floating along like balloons in the wind. Then they started moving against the wind toward the Sierra Nevada changing their formation ,elevation and gaining speed. They formed a line and then a square then a line again. It took off behind some clouds then came back out. We watched for about 10 minutes and none of us could really come up with an explanation of what it was.", "Large green ball of light dropping from sky over North Hollywood/Burbank California.I was driving home from Burbank to North Hollywood when I noticed a large green ball of light drop from the sky overlooking Burbank airport.  I thought about what I had just seen and decided to call North Hollywood Police Department to make a report.  They recommended I reach Burbank Airport/Bob Hope Airport Police department.  They, in turn, gave me your contact info.  I already left a msg with the voicemail, but, a move was mentioned so I decided to try the website as well. Thank you for being around in this random event.", "there isint allways a ship.this isint the 1st time i have seen them and im not the only 1 this is not a ufo report i am seeing them last night i waz in my room and i thought i herd something out my window so ofcourse i looked out ithought some one might b fooling with my car when i looked downbcuse my room is on the second floor i saw it agian it looked right at my and just stared for 30 sec. or so then it tool off it waz the fast&apos;s thing i have ever seen there was one time where me and a friend tryed to chase it but there too quick and if it means anything i live on a military base(ft.hood)maybe thats why they come here((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))", "Massive, low flying, slowly moving craft that emitted no sound.While travelling a back road through a wooded residential area, I observed a very large object in the sky that appeared to be just above the tree tops.  I slowed my car to a near stop.  My impression was that it was massive; football field in size.  I could almost sense its mass before seeing it. It moved extemely slow, there was no sound.  There were lights,but I can no longer remember if colored or white nor the configuration. The lights were not exrememly bright.  Its color was dark and shape unknown because of tree cover. I could not clearly see its details, only a partial outline and impression of tremendous mass.  I was perplexed and frightened. I was following a friends car. When we reached our destination, her first words to me, unprovoked,were &quot;Did you see that?&quot;  We were stunned. I remain stunned to this day.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))", "Craft with lights hovering over houses at nightI was on Bridge St. in Brighton (medium sized town north of denver) when I saw an aircraft moving through the sky. It was about 10:30 at night.  I thought it was a plane, but then realized it was much too low, and also moving too slow.  It was only 10-20 feet above some houses.  It had green blinking lights on it, but I couldn&apos;t identify the shape.  There were maybe a dozen small lights, and also one larger white/yellow light. As I drove past, it lowered behind the trees and possibly landed.  It was in sight for about 15 seconds.  I wish I had gone to look closer at it but frankly I was little freaked out.This was a UFO, in that I couldn&apos;t identify what it was.  My first impression was that it was one of those flight for life helicopters.  I&apos;m not positive that isn&apos;t what it was.  But it just seemed too big and didn&apos;t look right.  I&apos;m sure the people in that area had to have seen it.  I am about 50% sure it was a flight-for-life, because that&apos;s my only explanation, but it just didn&apos;t seem like it.", "stationary -bright- sparkling/twinkling object in mid northwestern sky. 9:05 - 9:25pm estFlashing/sparkling/twinkling light in shades of reds, whites and blues. A little larger than what Venus used to look like with the naked eye. In the middle of the northwestern sky. It looked like what a close airplane might look like if it were hovering and flashing the lights rapidly. It wasn&apos;t necessarily low or close...but very noticeable in the middle of a clear sky.  It flashed/twinkled/sparkled for about 10 mins before I got my daughter. She saw the same thing. We watched it for another 10-15 minutes before some low clouds of a nearing front covered up the view. I spend a lot of time outside at this time of the evening, am very knowledgable about astronomy and weather and I&apos;ve never seen anything like this before. I don&apos;t really believe in UFOs persay...but this was weird....weird enough for me to document it, and research it for a logical answer.", "Bright yellow object flying from the east towards me.  appeared triangular in it&apos;s shapeOn the morning of 8/23/06 at 5:45 a.m. I looked out my bedroom window and observed a very bright yellow light to the East.  I have seen this craft 2 weeks earlier, and took a few photos and video of it.  I tried to take the best photos possible, but trying to keep the camera still without having a tripod is difficult.  In the picture you can make out what appears to be a triangular shaped craft.  At the nose of the craft, you can see a light, and at the tip of the wings there are also lights. The shape is very much there.  The light tracers are very hard to stop because i have no tripod. The camera i&apos;m using is only a dig camera, and not an expensive one.  I also took videos.  I will send you these photos also.", "craft flew up, to the right, then behind treesWe were driving around on the golf cart in the neighborhood when I looked up and saw the craft in the sky and I asked my friend if he saw it.  He said yes and told me that he was watching it for about 10 seconds.  The craft then shot up and over to the right then dropped behind some trees.  We were thinking it was a plane but about a minute later an airplane flew by and we could tell perfectly that it wasn&apos;t plane.  The plane was a passenger plane it wasn&apos;t any type of jet.", "Witnessed two points of light come together above, fly in fast circular revolution then separateI saw the circle of two lights in the sky last night.  It was over De Soto Missouri on 7/13/2005 around 9:55 PM.  Two pinpoints of lights beneath a mostly cloudy night sky.  Several stars were visible.  The lights seemed to be below or just beneath the clouds, yet they appeared to be somewhat the same size pinpoints of light as the other stars visible in the sky.  I would guess around 20,000 feet.  When I first noticed the lights, they were engaging in a high speed circular chase.  The circle was proportional to a small diameter circle about the size of a quarter held at arms length.  They were moving at about 180 revolutions per minute for approximately 1 or 2 seconds before they split and went in the exact opposite directions.  I believe, near South and near North.  The Southerly light appeared to move away from the circle slower than the Northerly light.  Both lights never did disappear from my view for at least 5 minutes.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))", "Activity hot spotAgain I witnessed &quot;something&quot; but with a twist this time. It was around 9:45 pm. and I got up to look out of my back door and I saw almost in the same location as my other sightings, a light. This time it was farther away and a lot higher in the sky. To the naked eye it looked like a star. But with the binoccoulars you could clearly see that there were numerous flashing lights on it. I could not see the shape of this craft because the lights were facing in my direction. The lights were flashing red, green, and a white/yellow color. There was no paticular pattern to the lights and the lights were very brightly colored. The craft stayed in the same spot for almost 20 minutes. Then I turned on my flood lights to see if there were any deer in the field and there was. Not that that has anything to do with the sighting other than deer have been in the field each time I have spotted activity . Then to my disbelief.....I looked to my right and going just tree top level there was this craft as plain as day that was .........hmmmm.......lets say a Stella Dora anise biscut shape (lol) no really...take one of those biscuts and look at the side shape of it and that is what this craft looked like and it was totally outlined in very bright lights that were round and flashed on and off. It moved quickly and quietly and I got to see three sequences of flashing lights and then it was gone. Then the other craft that I had been watching slowing moved to the right and away and then up a little and then it was just gone. Like the lights went out or it just dissapeared. I can&apos;t believe that I have seen so much activity or that no one else has seen anything. Oh yeah..one more thing. I do not know if this is related or not but on 9-11 around 2 pm I heard some jets that sounded military so I looked out my back door and there were two jets flying wing to wing , tree top level, and they were sky blue cloud color almost hardly visable. Then about 5 minutes later a big jet flew over in the exact spot that these two j! ets were , now this wouldn&apos;t pique my interest so much but they flew over in the exact spot that I have been seeing these crafts. Now I thought that it might be the Presidents plane because he was in Pa. that morning but if it was his plane entourage why was his group flying so low. Unless that is what they do. Anyway, that is all I have for now. I can&apos;t wait for this sight to get updated. And I hope that all of my entries have been going through........ blu :)((NUFORC Note:  One of many reports from same source.  Witness sounds sincere, but we question whether all of her reports are related to sightings of genuine UFO&apos;s.  PD))"]
