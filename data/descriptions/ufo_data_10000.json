["I was retiring for the nite and got into bed in my darkened bedroom and as I turned my head toward the two windows to my left that I could almost touch with my outstretched hand, I noticed on the wall above the window and just below the ceiling was a round red circle with a pulsating center in dark red.  I just stared at this circle and then all of a sudden it disappeared and then reappeared on the lower left corner of the shade of the window below.  The red circle then disappeared and I got up and looked behind the shade of this window and looked starting from the right to the left.  I saw nothing until I looked all the way to the left and what I saw was a circular object pulsating a white light and then a dimmer white light on the complete lower botton part of the object. It was traveling upward on an angle in a slow, loopy motion towards the north.  I couldn&apos;t at first see the top of this object because it was cold outside and the sky contained white, filmy, low clouds.  It rose above the clouds very slowly in the same loopy, circular motion on an angle and it was then that the top of the object appeared which was oval and silver in color and it contined to pulsate white and then a dimmer shade of white across the complete bottom of the object.  It was passing in the vicinity of Ogden Avenue which is well lighted and so it was easy to see the object.  My bedroom was on the second floor and it gave me a clear view.  I kept staring and then got so scared I couldn&apos;t look any longer and ran downstairs to tell me husband, who had headphones on and was reading.  By the time I told him, the object could not been seen from the first floor or the second floor of our home.  I know it was not aircraft from this planet because of the extreme slow, circular, at an extreme angle ascent it made, not to mention the saucer shape and that pulsating light.  I cannot explain the two red laser like lights on my bedroom wall and window shade which did come through the wall and window..it was no reflection of any kind and! definit ely pulsating in the center.  That is my report.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "ORANGE OVAL LIGHT WITH RED LIGHT ORBITING ORANGE LIGHT. . .IT WAS A CLOUDY NIGHT, MY MOM HAD JUST RETURNED FROM WORK.

Suddenly, it took a sharp, straight left turn and disappeared from view.", "i was amazed and i stared and fixed on the image. just like other members in the hallbright light that moved in opposite directions extremely fast. it land out side ((name of school deleted)) and was seen by members of the community in the dinner hall", "We saw a light in the night sky which appeared to be a satellite, but was moving much too fast.First of all let me say this.  I love to watch those UFO shown on Discovery and TLC.  But I do so for entertainment purposes.  I think, or thought, the whole UFO thing was a bunch of bunk. But last night I saw something that was truly unknown to me.  I was standing outside a ham radio friend&apos;s house and we were talking about amateur satellites.  There were four of us in this group. A kid in the group started pointing out constelations.  When I started looking at what he was pointing out, I noticed what I thought was a satellite.  It appeared to be a star which was moving from south to north, and it tracked almost straight overhead. It looked just like a low orbit satellite (I&apos;ve seen many of those before) but it was moving much too fast.  A low orbit satellite would take about 10 minutes to track across the night sky.  This object took under a minute. There were no flashing lights or sounds associated with this object.  In fact, I told the others it was probably a satellite, but I later decided that it couldn&apos;t have been.  Then I thought it could have been a piece of space junk entering the earth&apos;s atmosphere, but this object left no trail or flaming debris. I have ruled out in my mind all the possibilities.  As much as I hate to admit it, I have seen an Unidentified Flying Object. If you guys know what this light could have been, I would love to hear back from you.  I&apos;m all out of explanations.((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witness was observing either &quot;Mir&quot; or the International Space Station passing overhead.  PD))", "((NUFORC Note:  An observation of this duration, in the absence of other reports from the same area, make us wonder whether the witnesses were observing a heavenly body, perhaps Venus in the western sky, or Betelgeuse in the southeastern sky.  We will try to get more information.  PD))Bright light follows me.On January 8, 2001 at 6:30. I was heading into town to go weightlifting. I observed what appeared to be very bright star. I traveled along with me as I headed toward Antelope valley. I had seen this thing the previous night. I talked to my friend who said he saw it last night. So I drove to his house in Antelope Valley. It followed me all the way there . When I stopped at my friends house. It stopped too. I ran to my friends door. To show him. He went outside and observed the bright light. We were pretty freaked out. After that I began to drive aroud in Antelope Valley. Every direction I went the light followed. At first I believed it was a planet. And my eyes were playing tricks on me. I stopped at the Antelope Valley Kwik Shop. It followed. From there I went to the Antelope Valley Park. The light followed. It began to dim then get real bright. I ran to the top of a hill located in the park were I observed the light for 5 minutes. Were it remained motionless. As I headed back down to my car the light started to come closer. I started running towards my car. I was scared. I drove to the Antelope Valley Kwik Shop to use a payphone . As I pulled up My friend _____ pulled up I hopped in his car and pointed toward the light following me. I questioned my sanity here. Was I just seeing it. No. I showed my friend _____the light. I told him it was following me. He did not believe me tell we proceded into Gillette to a friends house. It followed at high speeds.  We stopped at Eagles Nest Apartments at a friends house. ____ and I ran inside to show our fiends the light. It was hovering motionless about 3 miles above Flying J a gas station. We left the apartment to go visit friends that live about two miles out of town on echeta road. The light followed. On the way out we saw a fire department blazer parked on the side of the road observing the light. We proceded on echeta to a friends house. It still followed. Now we were really freaking out. We pulled up to our friends house. It followed tell we stopped our car. It then stopped and remained about 20 miles away from us just hovering in the sky. We ran into our friends hot tub room. I told them what we saw. They didn&apos;t believe me. So we took them outside. My two friends both saw it. We observed the light with binoculars. It was the strangest thing It was  and had bright white lights aroud the border of the craft. All of us observed the lights. I decided we should all drive in my friends car to see if the thing would follow us again. My other friends were skeptical. We left and proceded farther down echeta road. It followed once again. We drove about 10 miles down the road. It kept right up with us. We stopped the car. It stopped. My friend that was driving got scared and turned around. It followed. As we headed toward the direction of our friends house with the hot tub room. We observed another light that looked exactly like the one we had jus seen. That was behind us still following us. In a sec the new light appeared to have dissappeared. About  a minute later all four of us observed a red light with blinking strobes lighting up aroud the red light in a circular motion. We stopped the car and went outside of the vehicle It flew right over our heads. The other light we had been chasing was still behind us following we went back tho the house with the hot tub. As we pulled up two other friends were leaving the house we were going to. We told them a u.f.o was following us. They didn&apos;t believ us. We told them too follow us to the house. Went went up the driveway to the house. We showed them the light with binoculars.  i observed the light once again with binoculars It appeared to be changing shapes and colors. It had a current of electricity running   between two lights. The current had a rainbow aura. Two other friend showed up. They saw it too. IT was getting kind of boring observing it for so long . It was just hovering there. We went to the shop and started talking I kept leaving to check if it was still there. It was. I checked every 10 to 15 minutes. It pretty much stayed the same until . I went for another check It was now a reddish hue and really close to the ground. I above the craft about 2 miles was two blinking strobe looking lights . They were alot smaller in comparison to the red light. I looked  at these lights with binoculars. It was a giant triangular shape. It was huge compared to the other light. I showed everyone there. After about ten minutes I went to call kaml radio station. I went to check if it was still out there it was gone this was at 10:30 at ninght. That is what happenend. I have many witnesses to testify and pictures. I am are devoleping them today. It was the strangest thing that I have ever seen. I will e-mail photos as soon as possible", "Two lights, just above the trees, moving in a circular motion for several minutes and then becoming erratic in their movemnets.My son and I were driving on a back road when I saw 2 lights moving quickly through the sky. The lights moved at an incredible speed, circling counterclockwise in a perfect formation for some time and then became erratic in their movements. They appeared to be within two hundred feet of the tree tops. We pulled over and watched them for several minutes. It was like watching two lazer lights dance in the sky.((NUFORC Note:  We wonder if the witness is, in fact, describing two laser lights.  They often are used for advertising purposes.  PD))", "Erratic, changing forms light of blue, green and yellow that flew patterns of ovals, a U and bobbing up and down.((NUFORC Note:  We believe the report may describe a &quot;twinkling&quot; star, or planet.  They frequently are reported to appear to move in a nighttime sky.  PD))Our families were all driving back to our cottages from a night of pizza in town.  My cousin notice a low star that was changing colors dramatically.  He drove home and called some of us out to the frozen shore to see the display.  Here is waht we saw. A low star...lowest in the sky.  Sitting NW of our city of Iron River.  It was blue, green and red.  With the human eye, the object shifted erratically to the left and to the right.  Than making loops and oval circles in the sky.  We were horrified.  My cousine got his video camera and while holding it so very steady, this object was dancing across the sky, left right, in out and the most bizzarre was that it would change shapes from a cigar to wheel to diamond to circular...and we have it on tape.  The object in focus, whether through binoculars or video camera was almost like looking at special effects.  Glowing, than blurring, than into a sphere that shot rays of green, blue and yellow light.  Jupiter....?  I think not.  This object was being manuvered and here is the kicker...it dissappeared out of the sky after five hours.  How can a planet do that?  How can a planet do &quot;U&quot; shaped flying in the sky?  None of the other stars where doing that,", "Triangular Craft hovering above the trees at the roadside 5 miles from Queens summer residence, Balmoral Castle, Royal Deeside ScotlandI was driving from Braemar, heading for Aberdeen last night with my boyfriend ((name deleted)). There is a bypass just before Ballater which lets you miss going all the way through the village. At about 7.15pm, 400 yards or so from the bypass turn off, both Peter and I looked up to our left and saw an object in the sky. It was triangular, looked to be grey in colour and its predominant feature was that it had 3 large blue lights at each point (but not on the very tips). These lights were not flickering or flashing and did not appear to emit any beams as such. It also looked as if there were white/grey laser beams coming out from the opposite side of the object (to the blue lights) however, it may have been the &apos;top&apos; of the object lit up by more lights. The object looked to be about the size of a house. I have been calling it an object but it definately was some kind of aircraft as it was hovering maybe 200 yards above the trees to the side of the road. I could hear what seemed to be a helicopter, however, if the helicopter had been overhead, it would have been much noisier and what I heard was a muted rotor sound. There was no sign of any other aircraft such as a helicopter nearby. When I heard this noise I assumed that it must be a helicopter because of the relative proximity that this craft would have been to Balmoral Castle (7 miles approx). I believe that the airspace around the castle is restricted and that it is monitored so if there are any unauthorised aircraft in or nearby this area, the airforce scramble jets etc to investigate. There were no jets which I found strange but perhaps it was outside the restriction zone. We pulled in to the side of the road just after the bypass and ((name deleted)) got out walking back to see if he could still see the craft. I also got out of the car but by the time I did the craft was gone. ((name deleted)) said that it was still there for a moment when he got out of the car but started to move slowly then &apos;just disappeared&apos;, no speed trails or anything like that. When I&apos;d got out of the car and looked in the direction towards the bypass where we has seen the object, I noticed that another vehicle had stopped in the entrance to the bypass going the opposite way. The vehicle started to move off and stopped beside ((name deleted)). It then drove off. There was also another vehicle behind this one which had stopped and drove off the other way. When the vehicle passed me, it was the police and the other vehicle was also the police. The van which had stopped to talk to ((name deleted)) had two policemen in it, and they asked if ((name deleted)) was okay. ((name deleted)) asked the driver, &apos;did you see that?&apos; to which the passenger replied after looking sideways at the driver, &apos;yes he did&apos;. They rolled up their window and drove away. ((name deleted)) and I then turned the car around and headed back the way we had come to see if we could see the craft again, but it was gone. We checked our watches and we had not lost any time, the whole encounter lasted probably 3 minutes. We both feel so lucky to have witnessed what we did. The craft was either one of two things, a secret military aircraft whcih has big blue lights on the bottom, hovers and sound a bit like a helicopter or it was a spacecraft. All in all there were ((name deleted)), myself, the two policemen and also 1 or 2 policemn in the other van that saw this. The place which this happened is right next to a hotel complex called the Craigendarroch and just outside the village of Ballater. There may have been many more people who saw it.", "Triangle shaped object seen in No. CalifA Triangle shaped object was hovering over a house (approx 100 ft above). It had one light at each point of triangle. I saw it clearly ( though still dark) And what I saw I have never seen before or since", "A steady white light approaches from the north, dances erratically overhead then fades and disappearsA small bright object similar to a passing satellite appeared in the distance, approximately half way between the horizon and ourselves,the direction of the object was travelling to the south.It was a steady white light that moved towards us and finally directly above us where it appeared to stop and move very erratically from side to side within a small diameter. The object was easily seen through the naked eye on approach and was very high in the sky. As the light stopped directly overhead and danced for around3-4 minutes, it then began to fade as it appeared to gain altitude until it finally disappeared.The object did not make any sound or if it did, it was too high in the sky to hear anything and the night was silent! The event occured above the Paraparaumu small domestic airport. You can find that easily on a map of NewZealand. Other eye witnesses, include my sister and her husband who live in Tauranga and my brother Michael who works for yhe NZ fire service. I spent nearly 4 years in the Royal NZ Navy and I am quite capable of determining the difference between an aircraft, a satellite and an unusual sighting.", "Flashing light moving erratically for sustained period of time.For the last two evenings and this morning, observed a point-source of light, strobing red/green/white rapidly.

It seemed to have lights at each tip indicating a possible triangular shape-- however, we weren&apos;t underneath it so it was hard to tell. What caught our attention though was how it moved: It seemed to be moving faster than a normal airplane. It made large circles in the sky for some odd reason, then it headed northwards and crossed Bellingham Bay, rather fast I might mention, and then we noticed that there was another light up there with it-- by this time though they were pretty far away. That&apos;s it. Also, when it was closest to us it appeared to by quite long, and dark black too, it seemed to be larger than a plane should be from that distance.", "A silent solid red oval shaped craft with no blinking lights is sighted in Toomsuba, MS.Saturday morning approximately 4 a.m. on 12-23-00, I was outside on a clear and cold night watching for shooting stars and anything else that might cross the sky. As I said, the sky was clear and the moon was in or very near its new moon phase. So it was an absolutely perfect observational setting- though it was just below freezing, but I like it cold. The area is rural.  My family&apos;s home sits with neighbors to the left and right or east and west.  In front and across the road of their home (South) is a pasture. Behind (North) it there is woods.  The pasture across the street was logged about two years ago, so there is a stretch of land that is relatively clear of obsticles. Where the property line ends at the pasture, roughly southwest, the tree line picks back up and covers a large portion of the skyline from Southwest all the way back North- there is a small opening westward where the road goes.  Much of the woods behind the house were recently logged as well, but the larger pine trees nearest our property line still stand and take up much of the immediate Northern skyline. Now to the good part.  I had been outside about half an hour and was looking westward after just having seen a dim shooting star in that direction.  I then saw this solid red oval shaped craft, flying very low, come out of, well actually over, the trees to the North. It seemed to be moving from north to south. I studied it intensely to see if there were any flashing lights- there were none.  The object seemed very low, and very close.  I began walking toward it- west along the street. It was moving very slow and made absolutely no sound.  As I walked toward it, its speed noticably increased and very quickly. There were no human defying zig-zags, but it went from a rather large clear red oval shaped craft in front of me to being a rather small vaguely red oval shaped craft much faster than I would have liked or expected.  It seemed to fly directly away from me, and grew perceptively smaller as it went. Also, as I studied it, I think I saw at least two, possibly three different angles of the craft, and it was solid red all around.  Nothing but red light. Well, as I realized that it was moving away from me I ran about 80 yards trying to keep it in sight, but lost it to the treeline as it appeared to be moving first due west away from me, then more of a south westernly direction. I could be off a little or alot on Its last direction due to the treeline, but it was without doubt somewhere between due south and west, but closer to south. After I lost it to the trees (it was also very vague in the distance by this point)  I reluctantly walked back to my parents house and silently mused to myself about the fact that I had just seen a UFO. I do not know of any known man-made objects that move with the its velocity, have no blinking lights at all, and is one solid defining color. Speaking personally for a moment, I must say that the adrenaline rush was amazing. As I ran toward the object, as it made its escape, I was silently calling to it, &quot;come back, please, come back.&quot;  Mercy, I like the awe inspiring feeling of seeing something that perhaps, just perhaps was created on some other planet in some other galaxy far far away- deep within our vast and complex universe.  I find that the nightlife in this small rural town isn&apos;t quite as dull as most here like to believe. :) I don&apos;t know if this goes here, but I have video footage of something that flew through the background of a newscast report.  I was working at a local t.v. station in Meridian, MS at the time.  I was the only one to notice it because it was very light in color and the sky was in that overcast, really hazy and bright way. However, as the report was shown on air, I happened to be watching a small black and white monitor, which effectively took away the excess hazy light, and I could see the object clearly. This thing &quot;did&quot; do human defying manuevers as it zig zagged up through then out of the frame.  I&apos;ve sent a copy of it to Peter Gersten, and I&apos;d be happy to send a copy to the NURC if you want one.  Its brief and not particularly spectacular, but it is definately &quot;something&quot; and its movements defy everything that we&apos;re supposed to be able to do.", "4 adults and 2 children witness spherical object with apparent flame coming from rear, flying across sky in front of them silently.4 Adults and 2 children, childrens&apos;ages approximately 6 to 8 observed at the same time a spherical object with orange red cylinder at the rear with grooves in the cylinder and what appeared to be red flame coming out of the rear of the craft from this cylinder.

We figured it was a planet so they left. An hour later, it was still there in the same position in the sky when I noticed that it had a circular shape with white lights around the edges of it. Inside the center was a Y and a semi circular shape underneath the Y. I looked at it until it got dark outside and then left. At 5 a m I looked outside and saw that it was still  there in the same spot, so I hurriedly dressed and when I went outside, it was gone.", "Three bright, distinct objects, each &quot;bouncing around&quot;.  Near object had fainter white and red pulses around it.  Observed 25 minutes.I had left the blinds open to let in the moonlight as I went to sleep.  Just before five in the morning I awoke (as I often do several times a night to roll-over) when I noticed a bright light bouncing around outside the window.  I looked at it for a while without my glasses, concluded it deserved a better look because of the brightness and the motion (which I couldn&apos;t dismiss as a tree branch waiving in front of a star or an airplane), put my glasses on and went to the window.  There was an object of moderately bright light (as bright as the moon had been hours earlier) with occasional fainter white and red pulses associated with it in the sky to the WSW, just more than halfway up (50-55 degrees?) from the horizon.  The object did not appear to be very close, but it kept skipping around that sector of the sky.  There were also two eratically moving objects farther to the West, perhaps 20 degrees above the horizon, which appeared as a single bright light.  I couldn&apos;t tell much about the two distant objects--only that they were &quot;bouncing around&quot; and moving in the sky.  The nearer object zigzagged about, sometimes nearer, sometimes farther (although always fairly distant).  I observed for almost half an hour.  I looked at the objects both straight-on and with my perhipheral vision and they appeared the same. I noted the position of several stars and, since I watched for a fair bit of time, noted how the stars moved.  These objects (even the far ones) did not move with the celestial bodies.  That is, I could tell that the sector of sky they were bouncing-around in was moving relative to the stars. Ocassionally, fainter objects appeared in the sky, but I think those were stars...they didn&apos;t bounce around.  An airplane at altitude flew over, but did not appear at all like the objects and did not interact with the objects.  As time wore on the near object gradually was working its way to the SW and wasn&apos;t getting any closer.  I decided I&apos;d seen the best I was going to see and it was time to get back to sleep.  The time was just past 5:20 AM. The weather was very cold (maybe about 10F), winds were present but low, the ground was snow-covered (2&quot; snowpack) and the sky was cloudless. What a wierd thing to see!", "A flash of bright light on a dark night.It was midnight and we were driving along highway 18.  It was just a bright flash of light all around us.  We saw nothing coming and saw nothing leave.", "Object was motionless and did not emit sound while motionless in the western sky.I was on my way to the corner of 6th and W. Burnside Street to meet with someone when I seen a bright light out of the corner of my eye.  Upon looking directly at the object I could see that it was twice as bright as the moon and about the same size as the currently half-moon that is in the south eastern sky.  The object was in the north western sky and too bright to see any details.  It was circular in shape.  I stood there looking at it and noticed that it never moved and made no sound.  It also never changed color.  There was no flickering of light, fading or otherwise.  I then thought to go back to the apartment and grab my camera.  When I returned, the object was gone.  On the corner looking one block up at a three story building, the object appeared about 2 to 3 inches above the building.  The streets were very busy with vehicular and pedestrian traffic but no one took notice of the object.  I originally seen it looking between two buildings and then went around the corner to the next street up to get a better view.  It was then that I thought to grab my camera.  While looking at it there was nothing attached to the object or coming from it.  There was construction in the area and the lights from the cranes were smaller and not as bright.", "Bright red lights, almost like a flareIt was Saturday night, BBQ Night. I was on a bike on a main highway connecting the main city of Colombo to Negombo. Suddenly i saw 2 bright red lights. It was almost as if one light was going to colide with the other one. As i proceeded, there were actually 3 more lights I had not seen since there were some coconut trees. I was so excited i sped up and went to my friend place and we ( 4 of us including some village folk) saw it. 3 of the bright objects formed a triangle and the other 2 formed a squair with the base of the triangle. they were moving upweards with a great speed and went upweards, and appeared to be going away from earth.

Once i looked at it, it blinked out like a light.I was walking home through a local park after school one day wen i saw something strange. First of all the whole area i was in went dark as if something huge was over the top of me. Then i saw a huge black object hover over the top of me. At first i couldnt really see it but the the clouds become clear and i could see it in detail. It was very big and it was a kinda triangle shape. It was also black in colour. I saw the underneatth of it very well and it was very smooth with no kind of indication as to how it was held together. I could see wot looked like some kind or entrance which was also triangle but a lot smaller. It hovered above me for about 5 mins and i just stood and looked at it. I could also see some kind of distortion around the object too. It looked like it was folding the air around it because it was distorted. It was quite low down and must have been about 10 metres above me but i couldnt feel no wind or hear any noise from it. As fast as it appeared, it dissapeared. One minute it was there and the next it blinked out like a light as if it had some kind of advanced acceleration.", "saw light/western sky/thought it was planet/mars?(red hue on white)/no movement/observed for  four five seconds/looked away/back-goneearlier in the evening i pointed out to my son the moon in the south sky, and a light just west of the moon, which i told him was a planet, probably jupiter. We were driving home. this was in the 6pm hour. just before 7:30, i went to the back door of my house to quiet my dog who was barking a t pedestrians or another dog. When i opened the door, i noticed a round steady light in the west sky. I was surprised at how far the planet (jupiter?) had moved away from the moon, which i could see to the south. I looked at the &apos;planet&apos; for a few seconds, and picked up a red hue in it. i thought that it might be mars. i looked away to yell at the dog. when i looked back up, the light was gone. I never heard a noise, or saw any movement. It&apos;s a very clear, cold night here. I could see planes clearly. I have peered around the garage to see if it had set, i saw nothing. it was there, i looked away for a few seconds, looked back, and it was gone.", "GLOWING LIGHT OVER PIZMO BEACH PIER ON NEW YEAR&apos;S EVE.MY FAMILY AND I WERE VISITING PISMO BEACH ON NEW YEAR&apos;S EVE.

IT KEPT THE SAME ALTITUDE AND POSITION BUT DISAPPEARED.  THE HALF LIT MOON GAVE OFF ENOUGH LIGHT TO SEE THE SURF AND SEA BELOW THE OBJECT, BUT WE DID NOT SEE ANYTHING SPLASH DOWN OR LAND ON THE OCEAN.  MY TWO DAUGHTERS AND NIECE WERE ALSO THERE.  MY DAUGHTER AND NIECE AGREE THEY SAW TWO SETS OF THREE LIGHTS ON THE SIDE OF THE OBJECT, AND THAT&apos;S WHERE THE GLOW WAS COMING FROM.  I&apos;M NOT SURE WHAT WE SAW, BUT I CAN SAY FOR SURE IT WAS NOT A PLANE, HELICOPTER OR METEOR.((NUFORC Note:  Witness submitted second, revised statement, which follows.

I was in the house cooking the kids were in the backyard jumping on the trampoline while I fixed them some thing to eat in the kitchen, I could see them through the window because my backdoor light was on.  I saw them stop jumping and were staring up at the sky.  I was about to walk out and see what they were looking at because I live in a area that is surrounded by chemeical plants and casino lights so the sky is usually pretty lit up and I owe a telesscope and me and a good friend of mine had recently been seeing strange lights int the sky; but before I could walk outside the kids all came running in scared by strange lights they were seeing moving in the sky.  I quickly went out= side to see what they saw and sure enough above the treeline I saw a white glowing sphere of light that pulsed blue and amber lights.  It was dancing erradically in the sky.  You could clearly see it moving up and down, side- ways and it was as bright as a star in fact when it was still you could almost believe it was a star.  As we are out there looking at this my son(11)hollers;&quot;Look there are more of them  only smaller they are moving too!&quot;  I thought he might be caught up in the moment and was imaging it, but when I looked he was right.  The other objects looked like dimmly lit stars but were pulsing the same blue and amber lights, they were also moving erradically but almost like in accordance with the larger brightly lit object.  My husband and friend showed up and found me sin the backyard watching these crafts.  My husband who is a very skeptical was stunned by what we were seeing.  He could find a resaonalbe answer for the objects. The craft made no sounds at all and the larger one began to shot out sparks of light like a beam down towards the ground in the woods behind my house. At that moment we heard an aircraft approaching it was a big passenger plane coming from the airport from the front of my house it  passed extremly close to the brightly lit craft and the craft still continued its erradic dance in the sky.  We see aircraft alot around here and everyone who saw it knows it was a conventional craft.  The sightings of these objects is becoming more frequently in my area.  I decided to report this event only because of that fact.  I don&apos;t want to be ridiculed by people but since it is happening so frequently I felt compled to report it to someone who might be able to investigate.  If I had a camcorder I would be sending you footage.((NUFORC Note:  Report is not inconsistent with the many report NUFORC receives of &quot;twinkling&quot; stars or planets.  They are virtually always reported to have multiple colors, and to jump around in the night sky.

I went on a tv service call.  When I got to the residence, the gentlemen who had asked to have his television serviced had left with his family for some other place,which is what he told me the next day.   When I started to leaved his place I noticed this bright light up the road from me. The more I stared at it the more came brighter. I stopped my 1976 Blazer in the road, and stopped the engine, got out and this thing was stationary with no noise whatsoever.  I stayed and watched it for a good 2 to 3 minutes.  I started my vehicle and started to move slowly while keeping my eyes on it, I was getting closer, I was not more than a quarter mile away, with this thing about 4 to 500 ft above ground.  Then I switched my truck headlights on still having my eyes on it. And then all of a sudden this thing just completely vanished.  I started looking for it and started to go down on the mountain road towards St. Agatha and looking to my right across a field, just about a couple miles from the first sighting I saw it again, and again being stationary, I turned my vehicle towards the field and once again without a trace that thing just vanished. That was the last I saw of it.  Returning to work the next day, I told a female person working with us &quot;if I told you what I saw last night you would tell me that I am crazy&quot;.  And, she replied,  I saw something strange also over the lake in St. Agatha last night.  I do not know what to tell you, except that this was not a plane, for it to be in a fixed position for so long, and a helicopter would have made quite a bit of noise.  This was very strange.

Yelled for my wife to come see. Stepped out the door &amp; watched as it turned to the South and was obscured by the trees. This light was moving right along but I wouldn&apos;t say it was going faster than a conventional craft. A few weeks before this a navy jet, think they call them A6&apos;s flew over the valley only showing ulta bright strobs on the wing tips. This jet was so low you could not discern it from the trees untill it zoomed dirctly overhead. I thought at the time somebody must have thought it to be a ufo. It sure lit up the sky in an eerie way.

The sky was absolutely clear and not a cloud to be seen. I noticed a flash approximately 150 to 200 feet in altitude. My first thought was that this was simply a plane and I glanced up. I saw two saucer shaped objects. They were about 50 feet apart from each other. The objects were silver colored on the top half and black on the bottom. The saucers had no lights, no windows, emmited no sounds, and were seamless. As I watched for a few minutes, the objects were hovering and moving in unison. It was as if they were acting as one, maneuvering in exactly the same way. I estimate the diameter of each object to be perhaps 50 feet or so. As I watched I was under the impression that I was also being observed. It was lunch time and this being a high traffic area, I was amazed that no vehicles were seeing this event, so I tried to stop traffic as I pointed up to the two saucers. during this time the objects were ascending and descending slowly as they moved from side to side, circling. They had a slight wobble and were not spinning. I decided to try desparate measures to get someone else to see this, so I was about to step out into the oncoming traffic, and at that moment I watched the objects take to space at a tremendous speed.

As i got closer i slowed down to approx 5 mph and looked directly up to my left to see a triangluar shaped object which looked similar to the Stealth fighter plane and was a dark grey colour and was about 36 foot long.I wound my window down to see if i could hear any rotary blades but there was no sound at all.I know that the Stealth fighter plane can&apos;t hover, and this object was hovering about 600 metres above the top of the cut. I couldn&apos;t stop the car because this was on a dual carriageway so i carried on down the cut and took the Houghton le Spring turning off the A690 and turned left into the housing estate where my girlfriend lives.I looked back and it was still there. I told my girlfriend to get into the car and we went back up to the top of Houghton cut to find that it had gone. We returned back to my girlfriends house and i telephoned Newcastle Airport security and someone took my details and the description of what had happened.He said that someone would telephone me but still no one has. The next day i went back along the route that i took and timed myself from the moment that i first saw the object until the time when i looked back and it was approx 5 minutes.Can anyone please explain this, or did anyone else witness this sighting apart from me.", "the light looked bright white round golf ball size when above me, but became a flattened horizontal band of five lights as it moved rapidly away from me; it moved due s.e. and could have been 100&apos; to 200&apos; feet above me, winking out above a 30&apos; high house,total time 4 seconds.Text of Follow-Up Written Report:  &quot;UFO 1:03 a.m. Thursday morning November 23, 2000 Seattle, WA  Maple Leaf Hill Elev. 400&apos; N.

I also noted a plane or helicopter with flashing lights to the north approximatly 1-2 miles, and since it was cold and damp and I was not wearing a jacket, I returned to the warmth of my home.

But it was a sunday and there was strictly no flying of these aircraft on sunday. we then viewed it for a while heading south. Until a tree blocked our view. But when we were meant to see it again it could not be found. There were 5 of us that we know of who saw the craft......

This report is of a craft I have not heard described very much. My son was losing a baseball game very badly, so I walked away from the field and was looking at the top of the trees. The craft came from my left, roughly south and headed north.  The best way I can describe it was a &quot;sky train&quot;.  This craft was perhaps 200 yards long but only, perhaps 30 feet wide.  It was at an elevation of perhaps 200 feet and was rather noisy.  The noise was a rhythmic humming.  There were multiple sections (very like a train) and they were all illuninated, greenish and yellow lights.

A very bright light, too bright to be a star, that hovers for just about in the same place for several hours, but during that time it will move sideways, stop hover, then move in half circles,then stop and hover again. At one point it started moving very fast toward us (my husband &amp; myself) then it stopped again and hovered. An airplane doesnt hover for several hours in the same place. It has been very cold so we have watched it then gone inside to get warm, then it will at some point be gone when we return outside to look at it. Our dog warned us about it the first time I saw it, he was barking and going nuts. As soon as we spotted it, the dog settled down. Thats the way he reports things to us. He did the same thing when there was an automobile accident on our road. We love about 15 miles from Spokane out in the country. On one occasion we called our neighbor across the road, and he said he has been watching this strange light for several months now. Hasn&apos;t said anything to anybody because he didnt want anyone to think he was crazy.

Then I realized that it seemed to be slower and closer to the tree tops than I would expect from an airplane. There were no other cars coming so I stopped the car on the road and watched as the object seemed to stay in one place. There were  lights on it. I believe they were red and blue.

It was in the area where my best friend lives so I pulled of to the side of the road and called him on my cell phone.  I asked him did he see the lights and maybe did he hear a loud noise.  I thought maybe a transformer blew or a small plane had crashed.  It was really bright since we had an ice storm here and everything is really bright when lights hit it.  About the time they (my friend and his family) were going outside, the light headed south at a really high rate of speed and stopped about 10 to 15 miles south and was around 2 or 3 thousand feet in the air.  I had heard that it had been reported about the same time the night before.  It was a disc shaped object that had green, blue, red, and white lights that rotated around it each time in a different color.  I found out that night why people are such criticts about this subject because when you see something like this you say to yourself this is really amazing and who is going to take me seriously!!!

We were camping on the Steens Mountains for sight seeing and picture taking.  We drove to the top of the fault block mountain at approximately 9500&apos; and sat on rocks to take a video and picture of the rising full moon. We were sitting on rocks on the edge of a virtual cliff with the Alvord Desert and remote roadless desert 3000&apos; below looking east. Video and pictures of the large rising moon were taken.  My wife noticed lights on or near the ground while I was doing this. They were approxiamately 10 miles east of us and a little north of the moon rise.  At first glance they looked like headlights from a cars on a highway.  We had been at this vantage point several times before in years past and there were never any lights.  Also, the area in that direction is only accessable by 4 wheel drive and very rugged with isolated cliffs, valley&apos;s and sagebrush. We began to focus the camera, video camera and binoculars on these lights.  My wife watched mostly through the binoculars while I took about a 10 minute video.  Also, a 10 minute exposure by camera with a 200mm telephoto lense. The observations lasted about 2 hours until we became cold and went back to camp a few miles away. The cluster of lights to the right had a red strobe light in the center.  They were the size of peas held at arms length and amber. My wife referred to them as a &quot;string of lights&quot; as there were about 10+ lights on either side of the red light, moving slowly from left to right. Somtimes they appeared to not move at all. The lights, except the red one, would disappear at once, then reappear seconds to minutes later. As they moved very slowly left to right more would suddenly appear just to the left of the red light and the process repeated. Just a little north of this activity (several hundred yards? a mile?) were more lights, 1-8 at a time moving around doing various manovers. They were on or slightly above ground, never going obove the horizon. Sometimes they created triangles with just 3 lights other times triangles with 2 lights in each corner. One time, with about 10 lights visible, all went dark for about a minute, then suddenly three brighter lights were seen one on top of the other with a definate space in between each light.  This lasted several minutes before they disappeared and other lights reappeared. Wish I had more video but ran out of film after 10 minutes.  Amber, red and green lights show on the photo.  We never saw green lights when we were there. The lights are in streaks because of the 10 minute photo duration. There was just so much activity in &quot;a middle of no where&quot; place.", "Multi-color fireball, Destin, FL.On Nov. 20, 2000 at 22:30 hours, my wife and I were walking west along the beach heading back to our hotel at Destin Florida. I stopped, turned around, and started looking southeast over the Gulf of Mexico. My wife turned around as well and looked in the same direction as I was looking. About 15 seconds later, we both saw a football shaped fireball that suddenly appeared about 10 degrees above the horizion heading straight downward. This firball was moving very slow, and we watched it for a good 6 seconds. Durning this time the fireball changed from a brilliant white color to a dual combination of burnt orange and green. The fireball was about dime size at arms length, and vanished an instant before making contact with the water. I estimate the range from us on the beach at no more than 3 miles. While walking the beach we noticed several meteors crossing the clear, nighttime sky, and this fireball resembled none of them.

It was stationary for five minutes, then slowly rose up, then to the left. It did it again, this time a bit faster, and twice more. It was very smooth in motion.

Getting out of the car, my son and I watched a perfectly round, light yellow ball glow eerily for at least ten minutes.  The ball was about 1.5 to 2 degrees in diameter.  In binoculars, it was an unevenly lit ball that would occasionally flare up brightly or dim down to nothing.  Although it did not change position in the sky while we watched it, we did notice a wobble that on close inspection appeared to be the motion of this ball around a central axis.   My son says that when I entered our home to retrieve the camera, he observed the ball fall and rise 3-5 degrees with a falling-leaf type motion.  Although an entire disc could be seen, under magnification, the glow of the disc was not even.  It was more brightly lit at the 7 o&apos;clock position, and faded to near darkness at the 2 o&apos;clock position.  Though this seems more consistent with external lighting, none was observed, and both of us feel that the object was emitting visible light.  No other lights were associated with this object. Although estimating distance of this object would be very hard, my guess would be at least five miles, maybe as far as twenty five.  The ball remained fixed in the southeastern sky, 10 to 15 degrees above the horizon.  The lighting of the object appeared to be internal.  I thought maybe it was a balloon or blimp lit internally for some reason, but it did not seem to move or behave the way I&apos;d expect.  Except for the axial motion, the object I observed was rock-steady in the sky.  We first saw it about 18:00, and about fifteen minutes later, it just winked out. The lights of several aircraft were observed in the same binocular field during the sighting.  The object did not appear to react to the aircraft, or vice versa.

It then reappeared in the same shape, but was moving straight upwards.  It then disappeared again.  It reappeared one more time, but in a different shape.  It had six white lights in a hexagon shape(like a stop sign with 6 lights instead of 8).  It also had a red flashing light in the middle.  It was closer this time and was moving in the opposite direction that it was when I first saw it.  I could tell that it was below the clouds and it was making no noise at all.  The only thing i could see was the lights, no outline of a craft or anything.  It was moving away from us and I eventually lost it on the way back to my fiends house.

It was approaching at a fairly rapid speed. I can&apos;t estimate the elevation but it didn&apos;t appear to me to that high. It appeared as large as the moon in the sky. It was quite bright but not painful to look at. The light appeared to look like some kind of plasma or liquid light. Trailing behind were three rings which decreased in size the farther they where from the ufo. The rings were barely perceptible and shimmered. The rings always maintained their their absolute distance from the ball and from one another. I want to stress that these rings were very faint. I barely noticed them. The object itself had a very sharp outline despite being extremely bright. It cat a glow on the water as it passed over the cove. I called to the woman I was staying with (she was in the bathroom) The object was on a trajectory directly over the house and I ran out the front door in time to see it go directly overhead and disappear from view due to the pine trees.

I looked through the sheer drapes that were closed at the time, and noticed quite a few lights directly east moving northbound. When I parted the drapes I had expected either helicopters or planes, but was stunned by the enormity of the &quot;one&quot; triangular object that I saw. The object itself was bigger than a football field, had one red light in the bottom middle with smaller white lights in each of the corners, was charcoal grey to black colored, and surrounded by a dull orangy faint glow of some sort. It moved what I consider to be slower than stall speed for an aircraft in a slightly northeastern direction. The height at which it was flying was in my opinion just high enough to clear a radio tower, of which there are several in the direction it was headed. The hum sound it emitted was neither a prop, or jet engine as I am familiar with both of these. I am a 38 year old music teacher, and have programmed sounds on synthesizers regularly, and relate it to a low modulating frequency with a slow sweeping resonance effect. I used up a little time trying to look for a camera, and decided to give up the search for one, and step outside to get a better look.  By the time I was outdoors it took about 20 seconds to disappear over the northeastern neighborhood rooftops.

It is very bright in the southeastern sky, and it &quot;twinkles&quot; vividly.  PD))On the night of Jan.,15,2001 I was driving to a friends house when I first noticed the object in the sky. Since I was almost to his home I didn&apos;t give it much thought although I did think that it looked out of place or strange since it seemed brighter than any of the stars around it or even other aircraft lights that I could identify. I spent about 45min. at his home and then left. on the way out his driveway I saw that the object was still in the sky but seemed to have move to the south of it&apos;s original position where I had seen it earlier. this peaked my interest enough to stop my vehicle and watch it from a stationary position. I thought to myself that a aircraft would have been long gone by now unless it was a rotorcraft that was hovering. After watching this object for mayby two to three minutes I was convinced that it was not behaving in a  familiar way. It would move periodicaly in a direction (up,down,left,right) and than stop. The movement was rapid and the distance traveled was not great, but it was difficult to tell just how far it was moving. After it would move I could see a small cloud of something appear where it had been then this cloud would disappear in just a moment,it looked like a small patch of fog. With the naked eye the object looked like a ball of light very bright in intensity and periodicaly I would notice red and green colors also. I returned to my friends house hoping that he might have a pair of binoculars that I could use to help identify this object. My friend had both a pair of binoculars (10X) and a spotting scope (20X to 60X). Both myself and my friend along with his wife and daughter went back outside to observe this object with the above mentioned items. Once in a position where we cold see the object it was clear to my friend and his wife that this object was nothing that they have ever seen before. We all agreed that we could not positively identify it with the naked eye. The binoculars were too unstable to get a good solid look at the object. My friend drove his truck up to where we were to use as a rest for the spotting scope. When the scope was on target it was even stranger looking at 60X magnification. To me the object looked like a single cell organism as seen with high power microscope. The color was easier to see with the spotting scope, it appeared to be changing slightly in intensity between white,green,red,and yellow but none of the colors ever completely went away. even with the help of optical magnification none of us could identify this object. My friend and I continued to watch this object and at about 8:50pm it faded than disappeared behind some hills.    During the time that the object was observed it traveled in what I would say was a southwest direction. I have been a professional firefighter for 15 years.

My 17 year old cousin, my best friend and I were driving through this area called &apos;Satpur&apos;. The road we were on was really narrow, and on both sides, were fields, surrounded by mountains. Suddenly, we saw two green lights, about 200 metres, away from us, about 10 feet from the ground, travelling alongside us, at the same speed as us. At first, we though it was the reflection of another car&apos;s lights, but we looked behind and we were the only car on the road, so all three of us put down our windows. It was still there. We pulled off the road and stopped, suddenly, those lights, turned into one, larger green light, and stopped, and started hovering around. Suddenly, without a warning, it turned red and zipped up the mountain, in a straight line, right to the tip. It stayed there for a few minutes, and then, in a ball-like manner, sort of bounced down to the foot of the mountain, and came closer to us. We stayed put till it suddenly becam on huge green ball again, and started hovering around. We got frightened, and started driving real fast, at the speed of about 180 kmph. It kept up with us for a while, before it suddenly dissappeared in the trees. We went ahead for a while, to see if it emerged again, but it didn&apos;t. We took a u-turn, to head back homeward, when it popped up again, it was small and green, it arose skyward, slowly and it turned into two green lights, as it became faster, it became one red light. It just dissappeared into the sky, or out of it. My friend did take pictures of it, but we haven&apos;t yet developed them. Obviously, nobody who we told about this believed us. Oh, and it did make a very sofe whirring sound, which we only heard as it took to the sky for the last time.", "Two flashes of light cover ENTIRE sky - bright white followed by dark green, seen 5x in 1.5 hrs...more to story -gov&apos;t coverup? READ!!!((NUFORC Note:  We presume this report comes from a serious-minded witness, but we have no other reports of the event.  PD))Friday night was cool, rainy, and a little hazy, so myself and three other people were hanging out at one of the their  house in rural Georgia.  Around 12 midnight, the power went out, so we just lit some candles and chilled out.  Around 2:30 am two of the people went out on to the front porch to smoke, while myself and the other person stayed inside.  About 3 am, the power came on then flickered and went out again.  Immediately following this we heard the two on the porch scream:  &quot;Oh my God!  Ya&apos;ll get out here!&quot;  Myself and my companion just ignored them and then a few seconds later we heard:  &quot;Oh my God! Get out here now!  You have got to see this!!&quot;  So myself and my companion ran out on to the front porch and our friends told us that they had just witnessed to flashes of light that covered the ENTIRE sky.  Myself and my companion didn&apos;t know what to make of what our two friends had told us. My companion went into the house while I stayed out on the front porch with the two others.  About 20 minutes later, the electricity came back on, flickered, and went out, then i saw the most amazing and unexplainable thing i have ever seen.  The ENTIRE sky, from as far as we could see to the left to as far as we could see to the right, from the horizon to as far as we could see up, was lit up in the brightest white-ish yellow flash i have ever seen.   I jumped out of my seat and began to scream for my companion in the house.  About this time a second brilliant flash occurred, this one too, encompassing the ENTIRE sky.  However, this flash was a brilliant flourescent dark green and, too, covered everything.  But this flash had a darker, almost black, center in the middle of the sky that didn&apos;t have any distinguishing boundaries but just flowed and blended with the dark green glow that was everywhere, but no sound whatsoever followed the flashes.  Now, we were just stunned and screaming for our companion.  She finally came out and we tried to explain what had happened.  So we all waited on the front porch again and about 20 minutes later the same sequence of events happened again.  The power came on, then flickered, went off, then the bright flash followed by the dark green flash.  Now we had all seen it and were stunned and going hysterical.  The bright light was like the kind you see when a nuclear bomb goes off, and the green glow was something never before seen by any of us.  So we all ran out to the highway that is maybe 30 yards in front of the house so we could get a better view. Across the road are hills with a some trees on the tops and backsides of the hills, while fields make up the front sides of the hills that were visible to us.  There is probably 100 to 150 yards worth of visibility to the top of the hills, then it goes to the backside.  When we reached the road we were just waiting to see it again when we noticed something over the hills.  We could see about 4 or 5 beams of light moving around like people walking with flashlights or spotlights on the backside of the hills moing towards the top of the hills.  We knew noone should be over there with lights, especially at 3:45 in the morning.  Then, all of a sudden, we saw a beam of light come out of nowhere from the middle of the field about 50 to 75 yards away, like someone had all of a sudden flipped on a flashlight.  When we saw this, we quickly ran back to the porch.  When we got back to the porch 15 seconds later, we could not see one light anywhere from the fields or anywhere over the hills.  About this time, the power flipped on again, flickered, went out, and then the two flashes came again.  So we ran back out to the road to get a better look and waited.  About 15 minutes later we looked right up the road about 50 yards and noticed a car that was just sitting on the side of the road next to a vacant lot.  Then the pattern repeated itself:  power on, flickering, going out, then the first flash.  When the first flash went off, the car all of a sudden flipped its lights on and began speeding towards us.  We began to get into the road and wave him down.  Initially it appeared he wouldn&apos;t stop, but he slammed on his breaks and stopped just as the second dark green flash was going off.   When he stopped, everything was green from the glow, even the inside of this car. We ran up and asked:  &quot;Are you seeing these lights???!!!   What do think is going on???&quot; The guy initially looked at us like he didn&apos;t know what we were talking about, despite the fact everything was green, but then he answered in an extremely weird, non-chalant kind of way:  &quot;Oh, that&apos;s just the beacon.  Its there so planes won&apos;t crash.  Its usually white lights but sometimes it can change to different colors.&quot;  Then he said:  &quot;The regular paper guy won a contest.  I&apos;m the district manager just filling in for him.  Do you get a paper?&quot;  then he handed us a paper and drove off. We watched him go on, and instead of delivering more papers down the road where there are many more houses, he turned into the next driveway turned around and sped off in the direction which he had just come, without delievering any more papers!  Granted, the flashes alone freaked us out, but the paper guy and the beams of light just added to our confusion.  First of all, there are absolutely NO BEACONS anywhere in that area of rural Carrollton, i am positive of that.  Right as the guy sped off, our power came on and stayed on the rest of the night, with us seeing no more flashes, leaving us with having seen 5 two flash sets in total in 1.5 hours. We spent the rest of the night trying to figure out what happened.  We definitely ruled out swamp gas, beacons, and power transformers blowing.  The only explanations we were left with were other worldly or, more possibly, some type of government test and coverup.  The guys with the beams of light and the convenient paper guy with a cover-up story just as the event ended just added to our belief in gov&apos;t involvement.  The next day i was relaying the events to my mother, and she was having a hard time fully believing me.  Then a few minutes later she came in and showed my something she just read in the Saturday paper.  It was an aritcle in the Atlanta Journal and Constitution that read:  &quot;Solar Storms could disrupt power in U.S. :   Earth is likely to be bombarded with an unusual rapid-fire blast from five solar storms that could disrupt power grids, communications and airplane navigation in the northern United States today and Sunday, space weather forecasters warned Friday.  But they said the same machine-gunlike geomagnetic blasts also could pull spectacular Northern Lights sky show farther south, where more people will be able to see the colored lights dance in the northern sky.  There&apos;s an 80 percent chance that the storms will cause minor to severe disruptions to satellite communications, radio and television transmissions, and electric power grids, warned the Space Environment Center in  Washington, a division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  The &quot;storms&quot; are stron surges of solar winds - electrically charged subatomic particles from the sun - that make changes in the Earth&apos;s magnetic field, much like charging a small magnet with an electrical current.  There&apos;s a 40 percent chance the storms will cause major or severe disruptions and a 40 percent chance their efforts will be minor.&quot; I have to say that those that winessed this are not crazy Georgia rednecks, we are all college graduates with well respected jobs who did not make up the event that we can&apos;t explain.  However, we do know this article is b.s.  For one, why did this article appear the day AFTER it happened.  If they knew friday it was going to happen, why didn&apos;t they tell us on friday so we could be prepared instead of telling us on Saturday.  Secondly,  this article provides an excuse for almost every aspect of our experience.  However, these excuses also seem to be b.s. and a little to convenient.   I&apos;ve seen the Northern Lights and what we saw definitely in no way shape or form resembled the Norther Lights.  These were blasts of light.  One bright white, one a dark green glow.  We are all still voting for a Gov&apos;t coverup...the people in the fields, the guy in the car, and the article from Washington...it just all points to the government covering something up, but what they are covering up is the question. Any, and i mean any, insight into this situation would be greatly appreciated, as no one we have talked with can offer a feasible solution.  I must reiterate that this is IN NO WAY A FALSE REPORT.  This truely and definitely happened on the moring of Saturday November 25, 2000 from 3:00 am till about 4:30 am.  Someone please respond.  I do not want to initially release too much info about myself as i am in a sensitive line of work.", "A yellow white light flying back and forth at high speeds over a field.I was on a bus when I looked out the window and saw a bright flashig circle in the sky.

We were looking down the street and we saw in the sky, a star - or so we thought.  It appeared to be a shooting star heading SW, but it stopped dead in the sky and then just started falling straight down.  The reason why this was so strange to us was because it stopped and went in an exact straight line down into the horizan till we couldn&apos;t see it cause of trees - it wasn&apos;t a fast fall either.  We stood there for what seems like 30 secs watching this thing fall. I&apos;m surprised not more people noticed it was so weird to see something falling straight down.

We used the superbowl as an excuse to go and after the game, we again drove to Mercury to see if the stars were still &quot;dancing&quot; in the skies over Grooms Lake. We witnessed these bright lights that looked almost exactly like stars except they were brighter and seemed to change colors, from a blue, to red and to silver. They &quot;wobbled&quot; or &quot;Jerked&quot; across the sky in Zig Zag patterns and looked just like a &quot;heany&quot; beam (a &quot;focusing&quot; beam found on most ophthalmic lasers) I questioned my husband on the possibility that these lights were nothing more than military experiments and that maybe they were laser lights.....like pointers being shone into the sky.  We brought the binoculars and these &quot;stars&quot; seemed to look like they were &quot;scattered&quot; JUST like a laser pointer being shown in air...we watched these &quot;stars&quot; for about an hour and then headed out to &quot;Area 51&quot; where we saw lights that seemed to be lower to the ground, more smoother in thier movements and VERY close.

I saw a very, very, bright light, so bright the only thing I could imagine was a chrome jet or airplane , reflecting the sun in a very freak fashion.  Definitely bigger than a landing light apporoximately at 45degrees from the Southern horizon.  I thought it was a plane, but it was strange enought to pull off the road.  I watched as traffic sped by , everyone in a scurry going to work or holiday shopping.  The craft turned, the light was gone, but it just didn&apos;t look like an airplane, jet, but yet flew as if it could be.  The light was sooo big for the plane or craft to be so far off, that I wouldn&apos;t even ID it within a minute.  I watched it travel off on a Northwesterly direction, but still couldn&apos;t discern a clear image of a conventional aircraft.  I then was told by a friend that all planes are painted.  Whatever it was cause a very bright white ball, and if it was a glint from the sun, it was a very freakish event.  I am saying it was a UFO in nature to me.  Wish I had the camcorder.

We were southbound on an interstate highway entering the outskirts of Tulsa.  I do not recall the exact date or time, but I know it was mid summer of the year I turned 15 (in april).  There was some kind of municipal airport we were approaching through the valley (into it?).  That day there were an unusually high number of private aircraft flying that day (most of them were &quot;unpowered&quot; &quot;light&quot; and &quot;ultralight&quot;private aircraft).  I remember watching the gliders soar in thermal updrafts for a long time as we got closer(20 min. at least).  There was one &quot;glider&quot; in particular caught my eye.  Not because it was vissually extra ordinary, but because it appeared to have no angualr momentum.  I observed the craft for about 4 min. marveling at the skill of that pilot to keep riding the same current for such a long time.  &quot;Those arent glider wings!&quot;  Suddenly the craft I had just been watching for a realllllllly long time looked like a silver disk.  It was late afternoon, because the sunlight reflected brightly in a radial patern from each side of the center of the disk.  From a great distance these reflections looked like a long wingspan &quot;white&quot; glider (the kind that get towed up by powered aircraft).  The moment I realized what i saw, I told my Dad to try to pull over.  we could not because by this time the landscape had become decidedly urban (I had not been watching the road for quite a long trip).  I watched it for as long as I could wishing the video camera was &quot;assembled&quot; (2 piece camera/vcr system) so that i cluld be taping this un-beleivable event.  My view was obstructed finally by an overpassing highway onramp.  When the obstruction cleared, the craft was gone.  I remember there being a refinery or some other heavy industry site that appeared to be the same distance from me as the craft, but on a Southerly vector. The craft: Silver disk with a bulge in the middle. it was about a hands width at arms length North of the refinery. The altitude is hard to guess, but it was about as high as 2.5 the height of the refinery. It was tilted on axis both toward me and 45 degrees to the side.

No sound apperent (caravans windows do not roll down in the back though),((NUFORC Note:  We feel compelled to comment that it is not unusual for a glider to remain virtually motionless in the sky, particularly if it is flying in ridge lift or an atmospheric wave.

I lived in the suburbs northwest of the city of Houston, TX, which are near FM 1960 (not sure if the road is still called that).  Ambient light in the area was tolerable for skygazing, and there were no military bases in the area. One evening around 9pm CST, I had just come home from eating dinner at a restaurant with my mother.  She had observed an object in the sky after I had already gone inside the house.  She came in and said I should go look outside, that she had just saw something very strange.  At the time I was extremely skeptical of UFOs, but she is a very logically-minded person, and so I indulged her. By that time the object was already gone, but I decided to wait outside for a bit.  Around thirty or forty minutes later, as I was about decided to give up and go inside, I saw a triangle-shaped object rather high in the sky.  The object was comprised of about twenty greenish, hazy lights.  The whole surface of the object was rather nebulous in this fashion;  there were distinct lights, but their coronas blended together to form a unified triangular object.  It was difficult to judge its distance or altitude from me, as the night was clear and there were no reference objects to compare against.  It had to be at least 5,000 feet in the air;  it definitely had the appearance of having a high altitude.  It was probably a mile or two away from me on the x-axis.  Its size between my fingers while at arm&apos;s length (i was around 6&apos;0&quot; at the time) was about 1 inch long and about 3/4ths of an inch wide.  Since I was viewing it from an angle of probably 30 degrees from its side, and it had the shape of a slightly-distorted isosceles (two sides longer than the base) triangle, it was either flying at an angle, or its side was actually triangular. The object moved silently and smoothly across the horizon in a matter of five seconds, and because it appeared to be so high, I found it to be impossible to be a commercial plane or satellite.  And since in the over ten years I had lived in Houston up to that time I had never once seen a military jet fly over, I felt I could safely rule that out, especially given the lack of contrail and running lights.  I have seen military jets in flight though, and this seemed to travel at a speed far in excess of any military craft.  It also could not have been a spotlight since there was no cloud cover to reflect off of, and the pattern was not predictable as a spotlight would be. The object moved back and forth across the horizon about three times before disappearing. The shape of the object reversed when it came back into view travelling the opposite direction (i.e. the triangle was pointing the other direction). I had the distinct feeling that I was being watched or observed.  Given the highly skeptical nature of my mindset at the time about UFOs, I cannot readily attribute this to a sense of UFO &quot;expectation.&quot;  It was a very primal sensation that registered almost unconsciously.  I went in to discuss the sighting with my mother, and then she and I came out together to look for it, and we saw it once again briefly as it once again glided across the horizon.  Though I waited outside for some time, I did not see it again. As a sidenote, several months later the show &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot; ran a special on UFO sightings which my mother and I both happened to be watching on separate TVs.

At approximately 21:50 hours, about 15 to 20 degrees above the horizon to the north, looking through my windshield, I saw bright green light appear, and it made a straight line to the horizon leaving a trail. It startled me and I thought someone had set a single &apos;roman candle&apos; off and it was falling back to earth.  It was so bright and so distinct, it looked as if it were right beside the road near me, and I looked for cars or people as I went by.  I did not see anyone in the area.  And I did not suspect this being a &apos;atmospheric&apos; event. There were several aircraft visible in the night sky before and after the event; even though there was a full moon it was very, very distinct. I would suspect someone on those airplanes also saw the event. A few minutes later, while listening to the Russ Johnson show on KOA in Denver, I realized this event was visible in many other states, and described as traveling &apos;north to southeast.&apos;  From my point of view, it was coming directly down in a straight line, so it must have been moving North to South.

I was coming home from my math class that was held every Tuesday nighs from 6:00pm to 8:50pm at the Clovis Community College Center.  This one specific evening, I was taking an important Math exam and I didn&apos;t finish my last problem until 7:53pm.  By the time I got into my car, the time was exactly 7:56pm.

Pulsing, single craft at EXTREME SPEEDS.On a Fall night in 1997 I witnessed a pulsating object in the western sky. It was an extremely calm night. No wind. The object started out as a red light hovering very high in the sky. It stayed in that position for sometime. At this point it did not look suspicious. As we topped a hill, I called this object to the attention of all the members in our car. We stopped at the top and all 7 of us noticed a pulsing red light. It would also show some white pulsing. After about 10 minutes the object jumped across the sky due north. It appeared to travel at an extreme rate of speed. It burned a red light then shot across the sky. It also traveled up, way up to what seemed 40,000 feet or higher, higher than any aircraft we have spotted. It shot back at the same extreme rate of speed. The children were extremely frightened. This action did not seem reasonable for an airplane or any other known aircraft. We watched as it shot straight up and due north, then disappeared. I went outside later that night, the air was crisp and I noticed the lack of wind. I have spotted similar objects in the night sky, without the movement, always on calm nights without clouds or wind.

The first light rose very fast at about a 50 degree angle going South off the Desert floor...it grew very faint then my attention gravitated to the second, then third light coming from the same area.  After the second and third bluish light, then the usual amber lights came on and went out above the same area where the blue lights appeared.  The amber lights always appear most of the time in the N.E. above the &quot;Butler Valley&quot; area and directly East at about 30 degrees above the horizon. When the amber lights came on, they did so from Right to Left and you could see a thin a horizontal gold thread connecting the lights.  The thread would disappear and the lights would go out. The duration of the amber lights was about 5 seconds per grouping. I watched the blue lights rise from the desert floor and move Southward, all were at different altitudes going South.  I noticed  all the blue lights were flashing like aircraft lights but the blue lights were two colors.  A bright medium blue and a light flashing blue---I have never seen blue lights appear from out of no where off the desert floor as it seemed that they just came out of the ground.

And to be honest, it&apos;s the first time that I&apos;ve actually come to &quot;grips&quot; with what I&apos;ve seen and decided to try to get to the bottom of it. My sightings have been numerous the past six years but this is the first time I have seen them early enough in the evening to get my husband and my son to look also. You may think I&apos;m nuts (I know I did until I had witnesses to it) and I hope that you don&apos;t have a text limit to this report because I have quite a lot to tell. Although I&apos;m reporting a sighting of four craft tonight, January 1, 2001, I&apos;d like to begin by telling you about the first time I saw this craft and the events thereafter. It was about 6 years ago and I woke at about 3:15 AM. From where I was sleeping, I could see out the window that faces to the east. I saw what first appeared to be a twinkling star in the distance over the treetops but I noticed that it had colored lights and it was moving incredibly fast. So I closed my eyes and opened them again and tried to focus on it, thinking I was seeing things. It went zipping around the sky, up and down, left and right, like nothing I&apos;d ever seen. So I got out of bed and went to the window and watched it. I kept blinking my eyes, thinking I can&apos;t be really seeing this...but I was. And then it zipped off out of sight. A few months later, I was cleaning out a mobile home on our property that had belonged to the original owners (an elderly couple) of our house and they used it for a summer home for years while they lived in California. I found a box of photos and in it was a VERY CLEAR picture from 1967 of a &quot;flying saucer&quot; over the same treetops that I had seen this flying object, only it was taken in broad daylight. I showed it to my husband and said it sure looked like a UFO and that I had seen one in the night some months ago. Anyways, I mailed that packet of photos to the owners in California and they have since passed away. I am going to contac! t her so n to see if I can retrieve that one photo. Since that time, I have seen these same lights in the sky on many occasions and always in the same place. I live in Maine and about 30 miles from Brunswick NAS so I&apos;ve always kind of hoped what I&apos;m seeing is just some kind of military secret and not something extra-terrestrial. Here&apos;s the real kicker though. This past summer, I was sitting at the picnic table in the backyard talking with my husband. The day was overcast with cumulus type clouds...not really low in the sky but not terribly high either. I remember they were gray looking and seemed to promise a storm. While we were talking I saw a triangular craft with four very large &quot;balls&quot; of light on it appear briefly just below a cloud and then disappear back into it. I said to my husband, &quot;What the hell was that?&quot; He didn&apos;t see it as he was facing me but recalls me mentioning it to him. That&apos;s always bothered me what it was. And while looking around the internet tonight for what the heck it is I&apos;ve been seeing out there to the east, I happened to come onto a picture of what I saw in the western sky. It was the same triangular craft with the four lights that I&apos;ve found on a number of sites like the sighting in Belgium in the late 1980s. Well, that&apos;s pretty scary! I freaked out and made my husband come look at the photo. I wanted to pass that one up as some kind of military craft too but it was just so huge and now I&apos;ve seen a photo of it seen by someone else on the other side of the world! Sheesh! But again, I live close to a Naval Air Station and was raised a &quot;Navy Brat&quot; and I just suspected it was classified military stuff even though it sure seemed strange at the time. Been around airplanes all my life. Sorry for rambling here but there is just so much to tell that I have kept locked up for the past 6 years. Anyways....I have seen the &quot;craft&quot; I saw tonight on many occasions and more in the last year than in the prior 6 years. It stays pretty much stationery and always appears in the same place in the sky no! matter what time of year. Call me silly but I&apos;ve always thought that if I watched it too closely, it might start watching me. That&apos;s kind of the way that it acted the first time I saw it 6 years ago. So, when I&apos;ve seen it, I just kind of tried to put it out of my mind and pretend it wasn&apos;t there. Okay, here comes the part when you will think that I am totally crazy but I need to tell you this so you will understand why I made a real effort to try to see more of this sighting tonight. Last Summer, it was about midnight, and I was up late reading in the livingroom. My husband was in bed and I heard a car drive up, slow down and pull into my driveway. My first thought was &quot;Who the heck is coming here this time of night?&quot; We live in the country, we never go anywhere and we rarely have visitors at night, especially late. So...I got up and went to the front door and looked out and it was MY car that had pulled into the driveway and it was still running! Okay, okay, I know you think I&apos;m either nuts or making this up but my husband will tell you that it happened. He woke when he heard the car pull in and thought the same thing I did...who could be coming here? And I called my parents in Florida a few days later and told them of this. They can tell you it happened. This could be related or not related but I have to add it into this report since it is a real mystery that we can&apos;t solve. Anyways, right after that, I started seeing this craft in the sky more frequently and tonight it started with the usual one in the usual place. I decided to become brave and try to take a closer look at it. It was quite a ways off..as the crow flies the coast is probably 15 miles from us to the east...and it seems to sit near there...quite a ways in the distance. I first spotted it at 7:00 PM tonight when I took the dog out. It always seems like a twinkling star but I see the colored lights on it. I went in and asked my husband where his binoculars were. He said, &quot;Why do you want them?&quot; I said I&apos;m going to look at a UFO that has been bugg! ing me f or years. I wish I had a telescope because that thing sat there for 3 1/2 hours without moving much. It moved three times...all three times that it did move was when an airplane entered the airway between where I am and it was. Each time, the craft blinked red and green lights more frequently (more like a plane&apos;s lights will) as the airplane would near the area of space it was in, and it would move horizontally and a bit vertically. When the airplane passed, it stopped and remained stationery until the next plane came along. About 75 minutes after I spotted this first craft, a second one appeared. I watched it approach from the north and take up a position above and to the left of where the original craft sat. About that time, I told my husband there were two of them out there now. He started to take me serious and went out with the binoculars to look and agrees that he&apos;s never seen anything like it. About an hour later, two more showed up, each taking a position to the left and north of the previous. But I just checked outside and can only see the original, still there but has moved a bit north. The others are no longer visible. So there you have it. I&apos;m glad I have finally told someone about this...it&apos;s been bugging me for years. I would love to receive a rational explanation for all this. I don&apos;t know if you respond to these reports, but I would appreciate hearing from you and if you have had similar reports and if you know what this is.", "Very high daylight disc moving south to north, with no deviation of course or altitude or speed.Visiting potential inlaws (year before marriage)in rural area a very few miles south of Merkel, near Abilene, TX.  After lunch, while family members visited in ranch house, I went checking promising areas along small stream for archeological remains.  Found site with surface artifacts a few hundred yards north and a bit west of house, which itself had surficial artifacts due north.  Site was across road from area north of house, perhaps 300 yards.  After about 30 minutes of exploring, I looked up and saw disc-shaped object almost directly overhead, a little north and east of me.  Note here that surveying surface sites requires intense scrutiny of the ground, and therefore occasional reorientation of the head and neck in order to avoid muscle pain.  I had looked up several times while changing orientation, but sometimes looked east, or west, or NE, etc.  This time it was due north.  Object was moving due north, not especially fast but easily at same speed as a commercial jet.  Shape was perfectly circular, with no visible evidence of thickness --looked to me as if it were an extremely thin disc.  It moved due north at regular speed with no variation at all.  Neve rmoved from course.  Color silver-gray, as if brushed aluminum.  Not shiny or reflective -- gray on bottom, which was obviously in shadow.  No glow, no lights, no features of any kind.  As object continued north, it grew more &quot;oblong,&quot; that is, its N-S dimension shrank in relation to its E-W dimension, which did change.  It looked like a dime held at arm&apos;s length, but somewhat smaller.  As it went north, it got smaller in both directions, but it never gave any indication of thickness and did, indeed, seem rather thin in relation to its width.  Also did not change color or shade, but did seem to get somewhat darker as it went north.  Object disappeared into some high, fine clouds at a point very far north of me.  Estiamte of speed -- 600 to 1000 mph.  Sound -- none.  Lights -- none.  Colors other than gray -- none.  Movement to sides -- none.  C! hange in altitude -- none.  Change in direction -- none.  Decorations or discernible features: none.  Protuberances -- none.  Shape -- perfectly circular but thin, not spherical.  Upper superstructure -- possible, just not visible.  Lower shape -- unknown; looked flat but could have been either concave or convex; if so, not by much.  Duration of sighting -- about 3 minutes maximum, probably a minute less.  I recall removing my eyes long enough to light a cigarette, look around to see if anyone else was in sight, and returnig my gaze until it disappeared.   No one else around.  Sky -- clear except for very high, very thin, very fine, long feather-shaped clouds in parallel orderly arrangements that some people now seem to think represent &quot;chemtrails&quot; or other manipulation of the weather.  Back then, we recognized these cloud features as being normal for summer or late spring.  Object was above these clouds, which according to qualified resources not given to paranoia usually appear in the 30,000 - 36,000 feet elevations.  That means object was higher than 36000 feet and therefore was pretty damned big.  Speed may well have been in excess of 1500 mph.  No other objects in sky.  Nearby to NE was an AFB with a SAC detachment.  No planes scrambled.  Note that the object was perfectly clearly limned or delineated -- edges crisply defined.  No wings, no fuselage, no engines, no cockpit, no rudder, no tail, and no question about any of it.

Then, the circles got closer and closer to us, getting bigger and bigger, up to a point where we could see that ezch craft had about five lights total and was revolving aroud, like a frisbee when it flies in the air. then , they started spinning faster and faster the lights got blurry and made it seem like they had only one bright red light each, around the entire ship. then, all of a sudden, they just blasted away and we never saw them again.((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the effect could have been caused by an advertising light, either laser-based, or a typical revolving spotlight.

My wife and I were traveling West on route 44 in Oklahoma.We had just passed a Military air station minutes before when I noticied a vapor trail coming from the south. It appeared to be traveling at a very high rate of speed. I mentioned to my wife to look and see if she could see the jet plane thinking it was from the base. As the object crossed in front of our windshield I detected that it was not a plane but it was producing a flame with a large vapor trail. As it crossed to the right side of the winshield we could make out with the naked eye that there were approx 2 or 3 smaller objects directly behind it. All were producing flames. As it moved off to our right somewhat we could detect what appeared to be a large rock, you could see the surface of the rock looking object and it was about the size of a large beach ball. The smaller objects were about 8 to 10 inches wide, we could not see any form only the flames and smoke trail from the smaller object. The object continued traversing the sky from south to north till we lost it in the distance.All objects had colors of green and orange and white in the fire ball. While returning from Arizona we stopped at the Alien Museum in Roswell NM. I pointed out to my wife a picture they have on the wall of an asteroid streaking in. It was identicle to what we saw.

I wanted to relay a story that happened to me in early 1999, February 4th, on or around. A girlfriend and I took a trip to the coast from where we live in Santa Rosa, CA. We headed out to the Goat Rock / Shell Beach area. The coast is only 30 minutes from where we live, and it was around 6 or 7pm because the sun was still in the sky. We had gone out to catch a sunset. It was around 9pm or so that the coast was a little too cold and windy to be at, so we headed up the cliff to the car, to get warm and watch the sky for awhile, because you can see lots of stars at night on the coast here. Anyway, she pointed out that Venus was over my shoulder which would have been south. We were facing the ocean, and I was in the driver seat. I looked north to over her shoulder, and pointed out that Mars was out too and we looked at the big bright reddish light that we thought was Mars. Then Mars kinda.. started to move towards us. We watched in astonishment as it really began to move towards us, neither of us knowing what to do right away. It got to about 400 feet above our heads, and began to circle us. We could see the craft much more clearly now. The craft seemed circular if viewing it from underneath, with 4 yellowish white lights in the center like thrusters? And red and blue lights; two blues on the north and south points and two reds on the east / west points. I could faintly see some light coming from what would be the top too, but it was non-descript. Either way, not FAA standard. We watched in terror as the sky dark and somewhat cloudy now came alive with lights that were moving in unusual patterns across the sky in front of us and all around us. We could see the stars through the patches of clouds, but we could also see many white lights moving around and chameleoning themselves among the clouds and the blackness of the sky and the stars beyond. It was so odd to us that any aircraft would be out at the beach at all in the first place, much less flying in awkward patterns at night at the beach. These lights were flying over the water too. All of the lights except two showed themselves to us and the ones that did were the &quot;Mars&quot; craft - picture rendition enclosed - and one that flew from south to north from a LONG LONG way away very slowly making no noise coming all the while towards us. When it got close I could see it was a dark triangular craft. It horrified me to see this, because I had listened to Art Bell&apos;s experience seeing it, and others on the radio. This thing moved like a helicopter would. Like ONLY a helicopter COULD in my experience of seeing them move. Only it was fast. And agile. It - picture rendition enclosed - flew around our car the only one out there in the parking lot of the beach for about 20 minutes with the other craft, the circular one. I could hardly see the actual triangle craft&apos;s main hull or whatever it was really stealthy and dark amongst the dark sky, but I could almost always see the thrusters behind it. They reminded me of a Star Wars ship, the Empire&apos;s Star Destroyers. You know how they have three big thrusters in a triangular formation on the rear? Like that. One odd side note, we did appear to have lost about 3 to 4 hours of time as I know it was only about 9:30pm when this started and when all the lights in the sky ceased moving about in the sky  and it appeared to us to be only about 1hour in total that they did  it was almost 2:45 in the morning. Take it as you will, I have no explanation. Any earthly craft that could move like that would have to have made a lot noise, even over the pounding surf. No to mention the weirdness of them all flying around at the beach at night.

By blinking I mean, I saw a white light flash at different times.  It definitely didn&apos;t look like an actual light blinking.  It looked more like the objects were spinning and a piece of the object was shiny or a metal of somthing that reflects light.  It looked as if that piece of the object was reflecting a light source from which I could not tell.  The moon wasn&apos;t out at the time so I figured it wasnt that.

The left light was a yellow-white color which, equalled the brilliance of an approaching aircraft headlight but, slightly larger and less &quot;amber&quot; in color. The light just to its right was of equal size but very red. It resembled a red traffic light more than, an aircraft&apos;s smaller red running lights. These lights were moving slowly and in an area where I don&apos;t usually see planes flying that low. After catching glimpses of them, behind trees, I drove onto Maplewood Drive and stopped my car, for a better look. The craft was, now, almost overhead and it seemed, unusually large (about two or three fingers wide, at arms length). It&apos;s altitude seemed low, too and, if it were flying at an airliner&apos;s altitude than, it would have been huge. Except for the five lights, on its underside the craft was very dark and, barely moving. On its underside were three dim, non-blinking, rounded, yellow-white lights, one at each corner. At the center of its underside were two smaller, alternately pulsing lights, one red with a smaller, white light, beside it. These alternately, pulsing lights, created a confusing mix of red, pink and white flashing light with a very faint, pinkish haze flickering beneath it. But none of these lights were as large nor as bright, as, those seen during the craft&apos;s approach and departure. While overhead, the object seemed to be barely moving, yet, rotating slightly, to its right (about 20 degrees in 5 seconds). After this turn, it then, began to move, noticeably, forward and gradually, it picking up speed. Only then, did I notice that this triangle was flying backwards, with two corners towards its front and one towards its rear. As it flew towards the southern horizon or towards Vanport, I saw three large, bright, non-blinking, hazy, yellow-white lights, evenly spaced (horizontally) in a row, across its rear side. This craft seemed to be flying into a hazy, gray luminous fog as it departed. This haze might have been only the effects from lights from town but, then, I&apos;ve never noticed large, bright, hazy, yellow-white lights, like these, on any aircraft, at night. I didn&apos;t notice any sound. My car&apos;s engine might have masked them, though. This sighting&apos;s duration was about 60 to 90 seconds. I&apos;ve now, had three triangular sightings, all within a mile of each other. The first was during the summer of 1999 and the seconds was in February of 2000.

The day was very clear, the sun was still up, altho setting - I am an astronomy buff - so I know where all the planets are and anyway it was too light for any stars or planets to appear yet and Venus is in west/setting now and Jupiter and Saturn in east/rising - so was not a planet.

While there on a cloudless night a triangular shaped object sped across the sky from horizon to horizon at incredible speed.  There was no sonic boom, no vapor trail we could see; no noise at all.  We couldn&apos;t see the object itself, only three bright lights of different colors, maybe green and blue, which defined the shape as a very large triangle.  There had been reports of an expected meteor shower that night, and at first we wondered if that is what we were seeing.  But it flew to low to be meteors and there was no streaking affect like you usually see with those. Also, the color of the lights didn&apos;t change.  We were speechless for we knew we had witnessed something highly unusual.  For many years we talked about it.  My father died in 1995.  He had been in the military and was quite knowledgeable about planes.  He was absolutely sure it was no terrestial aircraft, partly because of the color pattern he was. I am not quite sure of the year.  It might have been a year or two sooner.  I know I wasn&apos;t in high school yet.  But I wanted to leave a record of this on file so at least someone would know it happened.  The most important aspect of the sighting was the speed and size of the object.  As far as I know, nothing can fly this fast through the atmospere without burning up.  That&apos;s what I remember the most.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

What first drew my attention to the sky was this orange smoke in the northeast...and then moving on into a trail as what a jet speeding across the sky would leave. To the east I saw a little gray oval-shaped disk moving in the sky. It seemed to be coming from the south toward the north. As I followed it - it turned back around and started going south again. I thought of the possibility of it being a UFO but was skeptical of such a thing. I looked farther into the south and saw 2 or 3 more coming...again, gray oval-shaped disks. I looked back at the first one I had seen and followed it with my eyes. A orangish light on the side of the UFO blinked 2 times and then stopped. In the northeast, a plane was going in the southwest direction. The UFO looked as though it would collide with the plane once they got close enough to do so. When it looked as if they were about to collide, the UFO ended up just passing underneath the plane. In the south, the other 2-3 UFOs were getting nearer. One thing to point out is they were not close together at all. They were all spread out individually in the sky. The train then arrived, and I boarded. The reason I chose to report this is because I read in the newspaper about light sightings over Rockford Thursday night. My sighting occured Friday morning and may have some connection to the Rockford sightings.NUFORC Note:  We suspect the alleged incident occurred in 2001, not in 2000, as indicated.

The size at first was approximately 3 to 4 times the size of Venus, which was visible in the west at that time. We turned off the radio to hear it, but there was no sound. As we watched, it gradually travelled south over the house, and we were still thinking it was a helicopter, but that is was on fire inside. As it travelled south, it gradually slowed down. A bit past our chimney, the object stopped, and just hovered in place for about 2 minutes, while we watched it flicker. There was no pulse or regularity to the flickering. The object began to move again, this time towards the northeast, and faster. Then it appeared to turn away from us.

The time was just after 8:30 AM (the half hour news was playing on the radio). The sky was clear with very light and very high cirrus cloud cover in the southeast direction. I looked out my window and noticed a very distinct, silvery object that I initially thought was an airplane. It had a cylindrical or cigar shaped body. Although the object was distinct, I couldn&apos;t detect any wing or tail features in the brief glances I made while trying to keep my eyes on the road and traffic. The object looked like it was at least 1000 feet or so above Boundary Bay (SSW of my position at about 40 degrees above the horizon. It was much larger/closer than my August 3rd sighting (about half the diameter of a dime held at arms length). It was aligned in approximately a north/south alignment and seemed to be hovering or moving very slowly. There was absolutely no vapor trail. I kept glancing back at it trying to get a better view. On my third or fourth glance, it suddenly disappeared completely. One moment it was there, the next it had vanished completely. I tried scanning the sky repeatedly and could see nothing but blue sky. Then just as suddenly, it was there again, in about the same part of the sky I had seen it, less than a minute before. Again I got two or three glances at it and just as suddenly as before, it completely vanished. At this point I pulled my vehicle to the shoulder and stopped my truck. I scanned the whole sky and could find no aircraft.

I remember being frightened, (terror) and looking down and seeing my body in bed.  In my mind, I kept screaming &quot;Jesus, Jesus.&quot; I had expected when I yelled that name I would have returned back down, but I didn&apos;t return immediately as I had expected, finally I slowed and then returned to my bed.

I had gone into their house to visit and the wife seemed &quot;frightened&quot; of me, at least it seemed that way.  He brought the subject up and asked her to tell me.  Turns out, that same night she had seen a UFO over the lake, directly behind my home. This was brought to a head in October of 1987. (Prior to the out of the body experience).  I was on a flight  to Florida and had been upgraded to First Class.  I sat next to a man in uniform, but had not paid much attention to him at first. I was looking out the window and saw something.   I jumped and quickly turned my head to see if I could see it out the other window on the other side of the plane.He asked me what I saw and I noticed his uniform again.  I had wanted to prove my thought wrong about all this, so I told him what I thought I had just seen.  He asked me if I had ever seen anything like that before and I told him yes.  Thinking he would straighten me out.  I told him the whole story.  He suggested that I write it down or report it.  I asked him if he had ever seen one.  He said that he had and had chased one over the skies of New England for about an hour until he was running low on fuel. That really made me think.

The sky was absolutely clear with no clouds. I saw a small propeller powered plane, heading west. It was probably getting ready to land or had just taken off from the airport. I suddenly noticed an object in the same part of the sky (from my viewing perspective), as the airplane. At first I thought it was a passenger jet flying at a considerable altitude higher (and further away), than the propeller plane. The more I looked at it, the more I thought that it did not look like a jet, and it appeared to be hanging motionless in the sky (although I was of course, moving west at about 80 km per hour). It was quite light colored (whitish), but I also thought it had a bit of a silvery look to it. I did not see any winglike features, but the object did not look round or ellipsoid. Plus it did not really seem to have any distinct shadowed area in its underside. I very much wanted to stop to get a better look, but I didn&apos;t want to pull over on the narrow highway shoulder, so I drove on to the Delta Community Hall intersection (keeping an eye on the object as best as I safely could while operating my vehicle) and drove north a short distance, where I found a spot to pull over and stop. I got out of my vehicle for a better look, but I could no longer find the object in the sky. I thought it quite odd that it had disappeared so fast, when it had not appeared to be moving when I had observed it just a minute before. My best estimate of the object position would be that it was probably at least 2000 foot elevation, (and quite possibly a mile or two elevation) and appeared to be situated directly above Boundary Bay, between White Rock and Point Roberts. I would estimate that the object was probably at least five meters across. It was situated in a SSW direction from my viewing position, about 25 to 30 degrees above the horizon. My estimate on the objects height is partly based on the fact that it had a far away and indistinct look (contour and edges obscured by distance, no sharp outline, color contrasts or shadow).  I probably observed it over a distance of about one half a mile, without it changing significantly in direction, indicating the object was potentially moving in a westerly direction and close by (less than a mile away), or more likely, not moving much in east/west direction and further away (which matches perceived distance perception). A high flying jet, moving directly away from my observing position and increasing in elevation would explain the lack of movement. But this would not account for its fairly sudden disappearance (although the object seemed far away, it did not appear to be moving away at a fast rate). The perceived shape of the object did not match an end view of a jet, although unfortunately, I never had a chance to get a really good look at it.((NUFORC Note:  Date was corrected by investigator to 03AU00.

I looked around to see if anybody else was witnessing what I was seeing but there was nobody around me except for the people in their cars on the street. The triangle formation was too tight to be a formation of planes, at no point did the lights move from oneanother or separate from their formation. I saw a smaller cluster of lights on the bottom of the craft and in the middle of the triangle. The cluster of lights began to flash and spin around in circles. At that time I saw a brighter light shining out from the smaller cluster of lights that were flashing. A beam of light very similar in size to a spot light began to shin down towards the ground. It was very unusual but the beam of light did not touch the ground, it stopped about 20 or 30 feet above the ground.

It would then hold its position for 10 or 15 seconds before moving in a straight line upward, where it would hold again, 10 or 15 seconds. Then in would move downward in a arc .  It would continue these movements,  left or right, up or down, in curving arcs, with pauses in betweeen movements. Some up or down movements also traveled at around a 45 degree angle. WE observed this pinpoint of white light 3 nights in a row, well after darkness had set in.  Each night it would be off to the west in the same vicinity but a slightly different spot. It always appeared to be the same size as the stars were.   Two of us are retired , the third is a copy machine repairman. With binoculars a faint reddish glow would appear on the edge", "During a latenight party a group of twenty witnessed a peculiar gathering of a fleet of pyramid shaped craft at midnight.Last month I was staying up late with some friends.  I was having a latenight party at my house.  We were in the middle of watching a movie, and we had the speakers cranked up high, when I began to hear a loud whumping noise, like the noise of a helicoptor.  Startled, I jumped up and asked my brother to turn off the television.  Startled himself at my anxious expression, he did.  I heard clearly then, as well as the nineteen others piled in my living room, the noise outside.  We scrambled out as fast as we could to see a small triangular craft above my house (small in comparison to large ones I&apos;ve read about).  The craft was about the size of my house and in the shape of a triangular pyramid, but at that moment I could only see the bottom of it.  I yelled at my brother to go get a camera (I had to yell because the noise soon became very loud) when the noise of the craft was accompanied by many more.  We saw out of the sky a whole fleet of these craft come down by my house.  There were probably twenty to twenty five ships in all.  They stayed for a moment, got into some formation, and began to retreat back to the stars.  I remember the noise that they made was deafening.  There were no lights on the crafts until they got in formation.  Then  thin beams, like lasers, connected all the ships.  They traveled off smoothly.  We were so stunned we didn&apos;t tell anybody for weeks (who would believe us anyway?).  I live in a rural area and what few neighbors I did have were either out of town and didn&apos;t see the ships or they were at my party.  My parents were on a week-long getaway and they couldn&apos;t testify either.  Much of the group that were there won&apos;t talk about it now or just plain deny that it happened. But I know it happened, and I&apos;m afraid.((NUFORC Note:  We do not know whether the witness means the morning, or midnight, of 23OC00.  We will attempt to clarify this point.

They told me it had five orange colored lights. And each light took turns turning on and off i think she said. She said it was about 2000 ft high and about a half mile wide. She said it took off really fast in a blink of an eye.", "Swooshing sound, bright white/red lights,light up whole area obove and surrounding house in IdahoI had just gone to bed and turned out the lights.  My son was watching TV in the living room.  I heard a sound like a strong wind blowing and the large windows in my bedroom (4X6) &amp; (3X8) started lighting up as if there was lightning outside.  I waited for a few minutes and it continued so I decided to unplug the computer and TV&apos;s.  I went in the living room where we have a 6 X 12 ft window and four other windows down the side of the LR, DR area.  The flashes continued, like lightning although there was no storm, thunder, or black clouds. My son opened the front door to go out but being new to the area I thought if it was lightning, it was dangerous (I lived previously in Arizona). Suddenly the whole field, about six acres and the mountain on the other side of the field and all the property we could see down the side of the house lit up in a very bright light like a giant spot light for about three or four seconds. It really startled us.  Then a red light flashed in the same manner for about one to two seconds.  There were a couple of smaller flashes and then everything just stopped suddenly.  There was the sound of wind and then everything was quiet.  I was new to Idaho and told my sister about it and she said they do not have sheet lightning in the winter.  There was nothing in the local paper re this incident.  I was not going to report it but it has been on my mind and I cannot reach a satisfactory explaination for what we saw.  I wonder if there has been any other reports of bright lights on this date?  I am sure now it was not lightning and I wish we had gone outside to look up in the sky because the light seemed to come down from directly over the house.", "Mother and children see a UFO at close range as Army helicopters  appear to  be pursuing it.Me and my three children were outside in the front of our home when I observed a white/grayish, large disc shaped spaceship hovering silently in the sky. It had a few lights beneath it around the outer rim area that didn&apos;t seem to be on the whole time we were watching it, suspended in the sky just behind our home.  I pointed to it and the children and I continued to observe it for another minute or so. Suddenly we heard the noise of helicopters coming from behinds us; two (possibly three) appeared on the scene and seemed to be after the UFO (chasing, investigating it or supervising it) when it began a rapid zigzag movement away from us and the helicopters (at many times the speed of any jet)and before the UFO was out of site, it just dissappeared. This was not a sighting of something that looked like a strange object, from where we stood, it was in plain sight and in broad day light. Our house bordered near two highways and I was sure many would have seen it too but when I called the police department and asked if they had received any calls of any strange sightings, they said no and I didn&apos;t report it.  The children never spoke of it again and I too forgot about it. Maybe the word isn&apos;t &quot;forgot&quot; but &quot;brainwashed&quot; because when it came to mind, I couldn&apos;t believe why I had not shared it with my husband or closest friends emediately. When I approached the kids to talk about it after months had gone by, they didn&apos;t feel comfortable talking about it.  Today, after about 10 years, they still remember it clearly but didn&apos;t want to be reminded...&quot;so strange&quot;.  I almost feel there was a &quot;force&quot; silencing us... or maybe it&apos;s just a &quot;normal&quot; fear that overtakes us because of such an extraordinary/paranormal event.((NUFORC Note:  Date appears to be approximate, perhaps sometime during the late 1980&apos;s.

I was staying on Panama City Beach (Baltimore Beach facing west) very near to St.Andrews (Shell Island) Park enterence. Being a former member of my local MUFON I was keeping a eye open during my stay in PCB, but didn&apos;t see anything of interest except for some very strange Military activity. The Beach was buzzed by F-18s each day during my stay at odd hours. This day though while on the beach with two other friends, I was watch- ing strange boat activity on the horizen. Just as one F-18 buzzed the beach with a over head flight, I was observing one of the military craft on the horizen (to the South-West). I wittnessed something launch ed from the boat that skimmed the water heading directly south from the craft with a flight duration of 45 seconds to one minute before splash down and then the F-18 left the beach as if its engine was used to mask the sound of the launch. I was using 10 by 25 fully coated opitics to watch the sight. At first I dismissed the sighting as military training being that there are several bases in the area, and you have to train somewhere after all. But with the f-18s buzzing the beach every day and the recent mass beaching of deep sea sharks on the eastern shore of Shell Island (Oct 18-22,2000).

As I looked,I saw light moving maybe 20-30 degrees to the left of this star. I observed 3 lights in a triangle configuration moving from south to north. This configuration of lights moved south to north at a speed I judge to be supersonic. As I watched it,the spacing between the lights,and the intensity of the lights remained constant. Also there was absolutely no sound. After it was gone,I waited for about 30 seconds before I came in the house, to tell my wife and report this.During this 30 seconds,I heard no sound at all.

I am only reporting it in case there were other sightings. I was getting into my car and glanced north towards Mount Wilson observatory, which overlooks Pasadena.   I briefly saw a bright florescent green light/ fireball arcing across the sky heading east to west. It was extremely bright and extremely green.  I have a very vivid image of how unusual it looked.   Holding my arm at arm&apos;s length it would have only been the size of my smallest fingernail.  But judging by the arc it did not look too high in the atmosphere. It was very much like a falling star/ meteor - but much bigger, closer, right over the city - and extraordinarily vivid green in color. My sighting was a brief glimpse only - it was obscured by a building.  I tried to drive towards the sighting a few minutes later and found nothing.", "Maine012001I have no idea if what I saw was a plane or UFO.  I awoke at 6 am and looked out the window to see a large amount of bright light coming from object in the sky.  I stared at the object as it came across the treeline.  The light would dart in the sky from side to side.  Then for no reason went up faster than any other plane I have ever seen in this area.  The light began to grow a slight bit dimmer as it rose and went away from me the opposite dirrection that it was moving.  It seemed to have a bright light coming from the bottom.  I could also see 2 beems of light coming off from it for a few minutes.  This could have been do to fog or something and strobes bouncing off from it.  The object then moved closer and went to the other side of the house.  It was gone in no time at all.", "An orange/gold ball of light hovered for a second then shot off at incredible speed directly over I-285 from west to east.A gold-yellow/orange sphere of light hovered for a second and then flew off at an enormous speed directly over I-285 from i believe due west to due east, because it moved so fast it gave the illusion of a blurred contrail behind it as it moved. This object was very large and very bright. I would have dissmissed it as a shooting star however it stood still for a second, and not to mention its huge size.

We did not have an air conditioner at the time, so we had all the windows and doors open trying to stay as cool as possible. When it happened it did so very quickly. As I said we were watching TV, with the TV on the north side of the room, the doorway to the kitchen on the west and the exit to the bedroom and the front door on the south. As we were watching TV (except my mother who was looking into the kitchen) a 6inch sphere of pale orange light entered through the kitchen window, and traveling very quickly came into the living room, left through the north doorway and went out the front door. It happened so quickly that I turned to my mother and asked her if she saw that, which she did. Apparently my father and brother who sitting closer to the TV, and who were directly under its flightpath (6ft off the floor) didn&apos;t notice anything.

A white, non-blinking light was first sighted low on the visible horizon, S.E., about 1-and-1/2 to 2 miles distant and moving slowly from east to west. The light traveled to a position due south of us (still 1-and-1/2 to 2 miles distant) and stopped. Then light then grew larger and brighter, and we had the impression it was moving north toward us. Suddenly, it vanished. At the same instant, another light (or the same light - changed in appearance) appeared just above the tree line, about 200 feet S.S.W. of us. This was a steadily-glowing orange light, that revolved slowly around its vertical axis, revealing a consistent &quot;gourd&quot; shape - about 60 to 80 feet in length. It continued hovering and slowly rotating for about 2 minutes, and then slowly descended behind the tree line. The light was not visible after its descent. We then heard something run along (inside?) the tree line, from the position where the light descended to a position due south of us. We immediately left the area. At no time did the orange light emit any sound, heat, or other sensation.

There seems to be increased activity around the harwich area essex england. Here is the email we recieved. So these are the details.  We were lucky as Sharon keeps a diary so we looked it up to get the date right. Was 13th December about 8pm ish  looked up to see a streak of what looked like greeny-blue fire going horizontal across the sky.  Looked very close and very fast.  Lasted longer and much bigger than your average shooting star.  It was one of the really windy nights and first considered a flare from lifeboat or ship being blown off course, but was going way too fast and too horizontal for that no matter how strong the wind was.  At the time I thought it was maybe a meteorite pretty close.  Was quite something though, never seen the like of it.  Only other thing i just thought was - when did the fire on the Mia Space Station start????  Could it have been that ?  I think considering the height above the earth of Mia, was too fast.  I did see the Mia docked with the shuttle a few years ago and that looked much slower.", "Three round orange objects traveliing in a row from north to southThree fireballs or bright balls in a row seperated by about 1 minute flying north to south.

No strobe nor colored flashing lights.I was on my way to work at 3:46am, when I stopped at a stop sign in new housing development area in Sherwood on the outskirts of Portland. When I looked out my windshield I noticed a low flying formation of big bright white lights moving together as one low slow moving object. There were 5 lights shaped in a V. One on the tip of the object and two on either side of the craft and two more on the end of the V shaped craft. All were evenly spaced.  At first sight...I thought oh my! That&apos;s one low flying craft...but why aren&apos;t there any colored or blinking strobe lights flashing? 2 years ago before moving to Oregon, I lived for 6 years behind an Airport in Juneau Alaska...the runway was behind a stand of trees behind my home. So I have seen and heard many types of aircraft including the largest military cargo plane made (it flew in and stopped at the Army Air National Guard Station next to the Heliport and Airport. It&apos;s wing structure wouldn&apos;t allow for a V configuration of lights like I saw, and neither would anything but a triangular shaped craft or a chevron shape).  And, I also saw a Harrier Jet rising up from the runway, flying stationary and then zooming up and away during a &quot;Snowbird&quot; airshow directly behind my home (watched it through my livingroom bay windows). It was soooooo LOUD!!! And all the planes I have ever seen have some sort of colored flashing beacon lights of some sort. So, what struck me as verrrrrry unusual was the absence of these kinds of lights, and I couldn&apos;t hear any sound. I then thought that what ever this is it has to be very high up to be so quite and moving slowly and if so...then this thing is SOOOO HUGE, and the 5 white lights very big and bright to shine so much. Or it&apos;s a low flying craft which is very strange....that it&apos;s so quiet. Very quiet. (no engine sounds) But what ever it was...it was still a large flying object. I watched it for a few minutes as it slowly passed almost over head and then I made my right hand turn and pulled over to the right hand side of ther road and turned my head around and looked at it through the drivers side window when I noticed it start to bank left (the V formation of 5 lights turned into 3, because it was turning) and fly off towards a more unpopulated area. I then took off because I didn&apos;t want to be late for work. I thought it might be a stealth wing, but when I saw the photos of the lights on them, I saw that they had a red light under the belly of the plane and small green lights (landing gear lights?) and more white lights than what I saw and the pattern of white lights were not evenly spaced along the V shape on the Stealth craft. Now I&apos;m even more puzzled because what I saw didn&apos;t have a red light underneath nor could I see an afterburner in the back like the stealth aircraft. Unless it&apos;s the space shuttle? But I don&apos;t think so...even that has an afterburner!

We both seen it and agreed it was a ufo and when we looked back at it, it was gone.((NUFORC Note:  Report seems not inconsistent with airliner landing light at a distance.

I was standing outside and noticed something flying slowly and completely silentl from the Northwest to the Southeast and it looked like it was on fire. It was moving a little slower than the speed of an airplane kind of like that of a helicopter. It didn&apos;t look like a meteor, there was no tail behind it. My wife and two children came outside and witnessed it too.   Approximately one to two minutes later we saw another going in the same direction.

I&apos;m not saying what but  they were highly irregular anomalous lights. I live about 1/4 mile north of LAX and have been there over 10 years. I know what types of aircraft are in the sky but more important how they approach and leave the airport and at what time of day. So at 5:45 am this morning I left my apartment for work. I walked out back to the alley which runs parallel to Manchester Bl to get to my car in the carport. Looking due west down the alley, about this time, I noticed a pair of lights, white and blue-green, about 45 deg. above the horizon traveling southwest. It was just before dawn. The air traffic at this time makes its approach from out of the West to land at LAX. So it is very quiet since all the jet noise is over the water. I thought the lights were a helicopter but it turned sharply due South then stopped moving. Helicopters do this but usually at lower altitudes. I would estimate the altitude around 10,000 feet at 2 miles. These lights which seemed to be hovering  had my attention and still I didn&apos;t hear any noise. This time of morning you can hear a pin drop and you would never know you where next door to an international airport. No traffic on Manchester either. Silence. Then I noticed the white light grow very bright and begin moving east toward me.  As it moved east, the space around the light began to glow and spread out in a wider diameter from the source in a  truncated cone shape. The light seemed to be moving through some high altitude clouds but there did not appear to be any outside of its beam. In other words, this area of the light seemed to be filled with swirls of vapor. I followed this light until I was looking nearly straight up with my head bent back. Then the light stopped moving. I thought maybe  the light source was slipping behind a fog bank. But that was not the situation. There were no low clouds or fog. The point source of the light  finally just seemed to disappear in the middle of this bright glow which  was left behind to fade in the clear dark sky and spread out in a sharp afterimage looking like high altitude vapor which was being illuminated by the sun still below the horizon. This entire sighting lasted 45-60 seconds.", "Viewed large dark silent triangular object with dim steady red lights at triangle verticesViewed large dark triangular object with dim steady red lights at triangle vertices moving silently overhead at relatively low altittude.

We are almost directly beneath a southeastern approach corridor to Vancouver International Airport. I looked up to watch the passing commercial passenger jet, which was heading northwest about a thousand feet or so above. I suddenly noticed a strange &quot;light&quot;, which seemed to suddenly zip in front of the jet, before coming to a sudden stop. As it moved through the air, it left  what looked like a vapor trail that almost instantly disappeared. I thought that the movement seemed very strange, and continued to watch the light, but it did not seem to move, or only moved slightly, as the jet passed by. I believe that the jet was beneath the light when it passed it. My estimate is that if the object at the same or higher elevation than the jet, then it was probably traveling at a velocity of about one thousand miles per hour when I first noticed it, before coming to an instantaneous stop. I rushed inside to get my binoculars, and when I returned, the object was still there. I focused on it and discovered the object was actually shaped like an orb, although I seem to recall that it looked slightly flattened in the vertical dimension. It had a pronounced  metallic or pearly luster. The outer edges had a reddish color. The brighter, more reflective center seemed more like a silvery gold color. It was hard for me to guess at the height of the object, as I had no real reference point - other than the passing jet. I reasoned to myself that maybe it was a type of balloon, even if its initial movement did not seem to indicate this. The object did not seem to rise, as you would expect from a balloon. It did start to move, in a sort of random manner until it was finally hidden behind a nearby tree and I lost sight of it. I probably observed it for a period of about five minutes.", "A bright shooting light.We were driving in the car when we saw a very bright light that flew across the sky very fast.  It made the whole sky light up.", "About noon, large disk traveled high speed and hovered Impossible maneuvers (to our level of tech). Chased pointlessly by naval jet airI am only writing in the hopes that you will pass this along to the person riding a jet from Vanouver to LA and had basically passed over my residence when he-she saw a strange craft and has always wondered if it was a &apos;sun dog&apos;. Please relate this factual series of events. I lived on an island in the Washinton  (US) Sa Juan Islands. My folks had gone to the mainland shopping for school clothes and I stayed home. Late in the morning, almost noon I was going to go check on our cattle and then take the dog down to the beach and throw sticks for him (he loved to swim after stcks). As I rounded the back of the house for some reason I looked up and rather than the usual eagle or hawk that triggers the peripheral vision response, I saw something a bit out of the ordinary no jet although they were always to be seen flying far overhead, rather I saw a huge disk shaped object (relatively slowly meandering across the sky. Of course I was fascinated and started to run through my mental inventory of what kind of aircraft it could be when it suddenly traveled south at such a speed as to boggle ones senses (I knew about G forces and such and I couldn&apos;t equate that anything could move so fast from a near motionless state (no flames of rocket or contrail or such). Well it disappeared over the horizonto the south and I just stood there staring, my dog bumped my leg and he was staring too. (He liked to chase anything in the air, a would run around undernearh birds, stare at planes and such...a Spaniel with a natural affinity for airborne creatures. So just as we started down the drive the &apos;thing&apos; reappeared moving fairly rapidly back toward us (northerly direction) when it was about halfway toward us a flight of jets came over the horizon in pursuit. I surmised they were from the Whidbey Island naval Air Station. This slightly dull silverish/gray disk got almost directly overhead at a fair height I guestimate 20,000 to 25,000 ft when the jets almost  (within a mile or two) reached the object. It then went straight up an! d dwindled to the size of a pin just before it vanished in the stratosphere. The jets had hit their afterburners and were climbing in chase on long tails of flame. It was really quite spectacular. Then when the thing disappeared and the jets reached their ceiling, they banked off to the south presumably to return to Whidby Island. I&apos;ve only mentioned it to a few people over the years more as an anecdote than to any purpose, because I don&apos;t personally care what people believe as long as they don&apos;t try to shove theirs down my mental craw. So please...I&apos;ve always believed in them because of this event...but tell the person who is living in doubt, tweren&apos;t no sun dog or St Elmo&apos;s fire or a curious behaving weather balloon, Alice. It was a large disk shaped object that performed aerial maneuvers that even today would be impossible for humans to match. (We&apos;d have been splattered all around the inside of the thing). And since there was no evident mode of propulsion one would have to presume that the drive was gravitational  They&apos;d have to have control over gravity to negate the g forces. So such is life, sorry no abduction or strange probings, no photos and my dog, Thumper, the only other witness is long since in that happy field and stream in the sky. So now you have it and my conscience is clear and free.  Oh, I forgot to mention it was completely noisless although many seconds later the sound of the jets reached us. The object traveled very quietly, wouldn&apos;t that make airports nicer to live near?((NUFORC Note:  The date indicated for the event may be exact, but we are not sure.  Hence, we have indicated that the date may be approximate.

I took two pictures and then walked towards the end of the driveway to get another shot.  I caught movement out of the corner of my eye, looked up, and there was a bright light.  It was mostly gold with some red lights underneath.  The lights were steady and not blinking.  I couldn&apos;t see a shape in the light but there was something hanging down below the lights.  There was no sound coming from the object and it was close enough that I would have heard any noise it made. It was traveling at a steady height and speed.  Since I had my camera I took a couple pictures and then went in the house to get my husband so he could see it.  By then it was beside the house moving towards the back, so we went to the back patio.  As we got to the end of the patio where we could see the object there was a bright white flash and the colors changed going from gold to red and back to the original gold with the red lights on the bottom.  It looked like a second white light/object split from the first and went shooting off in a different direction.  Then the object was moving away from us and my husband clearly saw the red lights underneath.  There was still no sound.  The thing seemed to be floating.  The camera I used was digital and I downloaded the pictures right away.  They look black until they are enhanced.  The enhancements bring out some very strange details that don&apos;t seem to fit planes, helos or balloons.", "((NUFORC Note:  We received a telephoned report of from Australia of a similar event from about the same time.  It will be posted when we receive the follow-up written report.  PD))I was alone camping in the mountains and was awakened by strange noises and an intense bright light that seemed unearthly.I am an experienced hiker/backpacker having spent more than 250 days out in the last ten years. On 6/26/93 I was back packing alone in Holy Cross Wilderness area. I had set up camp just at tree line in some scrub brush near a rocky clearing approximately 2 miles due north of Mt Holy Cross.  After securing food and smellables I retired to my tent.  I was awakened to the sound of &quot;animals?&quot; scratching the gravel and sand around the tent.  I was not concerned as it sounded like muscrats.. and I quickly fell back asleep. Sometime later I woke abruptly in a cold sweat unable to move or to hear anything (as though underwater).  I was able to open my eyes.  As I did this the sound began to come back but as though through a wall or from far away.  I was scared but thought it a bad dream.  As I lay not knowing what was happening the wind began to pick up and the tent seemed to billow and fall, as though breathing.  The sounds that had been outside previously, had returned and began to intensify.  Instead of one or two small animals though it was as if there were a dozen angrily digging/scratching at the ground all around the tent.  Still unable to move to look from side to side (I was lying on my back) I heard the scratching move from the ground to the tent walls on all sides.  As this happened the wind became more intense causing the tent to sway.  I suppose all of this could be explained by my having a bad dream and a wind storm coming up suddenly.  However, the next part I can not explain.  This whole wind/scratching/tent moving lasted for about 15 to 20 minutes.  Then as though someone had blown out a candle everything stopped and there was complete stillness.  Then the whole tent and surroundings became brighter than daylight.  A complete and encompasing white light entered the tent.  I was absolutely blinding.  I was still unable to move.  I light moved around in some ways but was always intense.  Then as quickly as it became bright it was again dark and as still as any quiet night in the woods.  There wa! s no mor e wind and no more scratching.  As soon as the light was gone I was able to move again.  Needless to say I was upset.  Checking my watch it was almost 03:30:00.  I got up and packed up my things and began my assent of Holy Cross Mtn two hours early.   I did not pass by my campsite on my way out of the preserve.  Rather I took an extended loop and spent the next three nights wondering if it would happen again.  It did not.  I did not see any other hikers during my 5 day outing.  After I left the wilderness area I drove to the nearest town to get some supplies and see if any one had reported any strange sightings.  No one else had seen or reported anything.  I do not do drugs and was not influenced by alcohol during this trip.  I did not see a craft or see any &quot;little green men&quot;  but I can not explain what happened to me that night.  All I know is that it scared the crap out of me and I am not one to get scared in the woods.", "A small red light what seemed to be a radio tower light grew larger and moved above the tree line and finally disappeared.I noticed a red light above the tree line across Gull Lake to the west of where I was standing.  I was curious because I didn&apos;t think there was a radio tower or anything over there.  I asked my cousin Greg what it was and he said he didn&apos;t know.  We didn&apos;t think much of it until it seemed to get bigger (from the haze) and it had moved north.  It hovered above the tree line very slowly.  Finally it went down behind the trees and it was gone.

Tom, and we both saw a large craft to the left of the highway over the valley where there are no houses or buildings. It was not moving and very close to the earth. That is was caught our attention. It was very large and dark with lights. I was driving so I couldn&apos;t stare too long at it. The passenger in my car was able to get a good look at it and described it as being diamond shaped, like a kite, with white lights on the points. It did not make any noise. It was completely silent. It then moved across the valley going east, flying low, and so smoothly, not real fast, but it was out of sight in a matter of seconds. It was probably going fast, but gave us an illusion of going slower, because it was like gliding over the valley away from us and it didn&apos;t make any noise. It really freaked us out. We definitely saw something that night like we&apos;d never seen before. Perhaps our government has some secret aircraft we don&apos;t know about or perhaps we witnessed a UFO.

I hardly expected to receive a &quot;personal&quot; reply,particularly so quickly.Well, anyway.  To address your questions.ALTITUDEThe altitude was guestimated based on a hypthetical or presumed size of thetargets.  In other words a 4&apos; or 3&apos; lighted object at approximately 1500&apos;might appear not as a pinpoint but a larger light point, yet not as largeenough to be definable as a vehicle or airship.  I realize size and distanceare difficult to estimate, particularly at night when there is nothing tocalibrate with.  But if you visualized a very tiny aircraft at a very highpattern altitude that would be consistent with the sighting.OTHER OBSERVERSI was with a group of 20 to 30 people.  Apparently the sighting had beengoing on for several minutes.  I was called outside to join the group forthe last 5 to 8 minutes of the sighting.  At that time all of the points oflight became extinguished.  There was much discussion and there has beenmuch subsequent discussion.  The 3 local TV stations are collecting manyobservations and theories.  The sighting included perhaps 1000 or morepeople in the area.  There are reports of sightings from outside the localarea but it is difficult for me to believe that we are all talking about thesame sighting.  Numerous amateur videos exist of this particular sighting socomparison can no doubt be performed.  You may receive other reports; yourweb site was mentioned by one of the TV stations which is why I decided tofile this report.WINDSSurface winds were calm.  I&apos;m not sure how to obtain past observations forwinds aloft.  You may be able to do that for the date/time that I specifiedfor RFD.  I would expect winds aloft at 3,000 to somewhat correlate withwhat we appeared to observe, e.g. a movement from SW to NE over a period ofseveral minutes.  Interestingly the RFD airport is located approximately 6miles SW of the position where this observation occurred.  Direction ofmovement would have placed the path prior to our sighting somewhere in thevicinity of the airport.  If my theory is correct a possible point of originwould be from rural areas south of the city.BINOCULARSNo binoculars or other viewing aids were available.  Sightings wereunsupplemented naked eyes.FUEL SOURCEFuel source is a hypothesis based on color and apparent behavior, e.g.yellow color, reasonably constant intensity with occasional minorflickering.  An observation that may have some significance is that thelight or flame of each target appeared to diminish before it died out, oneby one much as if whatever might be burning was ultimately consumed.  Duringthe time that I observed, all targets eventually disappeared at an averageof 1 minute intervals.I hope this is helpful.  It will be interesting to triangulate variousreports.

There were other airplains in the sky which were leaving contrails but this object was moving much faster then the other airplanes and it was leaving no contrails. It seemed to be about the same altitude as all other airplains. I told my wife to keep an eye on the object while I ran inside to get my binoculars and by the time I grabbed them and came outside(5 seconds)it vanished. She told me that it just dissappeared.

He turned to me and said &quot;there is that light again&quot;. Meaning the one that had shown up three times during the course of the week. The light was intensely bright, and far off. The light would turn off, then on...zip to the right and back to its original place...then go left. IT seemed to be &quot;communicating&quot; with two other like objects. The communication was the bright one flashing its light as the other two. Then the two speed off from visibility. About 10 minutes into this two helicopters flew over the object, it turned sidways and we saw what looked like a bar of blue light on its sight and without warning the object burnt out. No trace of it... and the fact that there is not a tower, antenna or light source which could produce this light. It has only shown up over this week and does not move like a traditional aircraft would have to to not crash. This object and its two companions hover, sitting silently and still in the sky. The Bell County area is full of activity...a personal belief is that it has something to do with the fact that Fort Hood is located here. Near my grandmothers house, which is close to hwy 190, my family and strangers have observed MANY &quot;floating balls of light&quot; which seem to gather around a large microwave tower, maybe they are refueling?", "On my way to work i was looking at the sky like i do every day when i noticed some blue , red &amp; yellow lights, I thought it was just an air plane when i rembered that my wife had seen a U-F-O around this time about 5 or 6 years ago so i looked again &amp; saw 2 flying obj. with red,yellow,&amp; blue flashing lights.

One day in the summer of either &apos;94 or &apos;95 I saw a craft from my window(as I was on the phone with a fiend) on the North side of the house.  Basically, this craft appeared during the daytime and was travelling N-NE at a high altitude.  It was definitely travelling above the normal flight path of the incoming planes which usually come in the E-W directions at a few thousand feet.  This craft flew over at a constant speed and looked spherical in shape, I say this because the reason it caught my eye when I was talking to my friend on the phone was that it was glaring like a silver object reflecting the sun.  I have seen planes glare the sun before, but this was not a plane because it was pulsing this glare.  In other words, it travelled across my window and pulsed a silver glare as it flew straight across the sky.  I kept asking my friend who lived about 2 miles away if he could see it relative to my point of view but he didn&apos;t see it... it was very high up(maybe ~20 thousand feet) or it was just closer and small, but it was only in my view for about one minute.

This range is about 10-12 miles from us and is between us and Quartzsite, AZ/Blythe, CA.   We had been notified earlier by a friend who saw similar lights earlier that night over Parker AZ (33 miles West of us bordering the Colorado River).  My husband saw more bright lights over the Butler Valley in the NE that were just a bright.  But I did not see these. I went out with my 7x50 binoculars and 20x50 binoculars to watch the triangular formation of extremely bright amber lights.  They just hovered there keeping a constant triangle formation and at one point, turned slightly.  Then they slowly disappeared over the Plomosa mountain range.  But I could see the glow from them rising above the mountain tops and waited just encase they reappeared.  They did in the same formation and just as bright.  Then after a few minutes, turned and slowly faded away.  I kept a watch with my 20x50 binoculars and you could see these did pulsate a very bright amber light...much brighter than anything I have seen before in this area.  There were no other colored lights on these things that I could see as you would see on an airplane while veiwing them through the binoculars.  They did not &quot;wink&quot; out but faded out and kept station in relation to each other all the while.  My husband also saw the glow when these lights first went down over the Plomosa range and saw the glow as well.  Then witnessed the reappearance. In all, the event lasted about 15 to 20 or so.((NUFORC Note:  These witnesses are well known to us, and they have reported several such incidents in their area.

It was very near the brightest star in the sky and almost as big.  Two similar looking airplanes in close proximity flew together and circled the area once.  Then the planes flew off in different directions.  Immediately following this, the light began to wane and flicker slightly and move up (which is the only way we can describe it) in a seemly westward direction, but definitely up.  It was also moving side to side in quick movements as it went away from us.  The light got smaller and smaller until it disappeared into the clear night sky.

Than formed the ball again, than broke off into 3 circles, began to move rapidly within the orb, with very bright red and green lights surrounding them, this   continued for about 3-5 minutes, than merged again to the large orb.  At times with the eye this appeared to be like a giant ferris wheel moving around with all the colors.  This orb could change shapes, and appeared almost translucent, yet when I viewed through it, I saw bright glowing lights.  It moved out of view for a few seconds, and when it reappeared, it was not as bright, the light was clear, of halogen quality.  after 30 minutes it finally went behind the hill.

The night went as follows:  My 2 friends and I were driving NNW on Highway 161 near Puyallup, WA when we saw an bronze-colored object fly overhead at an elevation of approx. 5500&apos; above sea level. The object was traveling at a very high rate of speed, around 700-750 mph, but showed no signs of it&apos;s propulsion system(i.e. afterburner flames,exhaust,etc.)  I could detect no noise being emitted from the object either.(Aircraft that fly that fast are most often VERY loud at low elevations.)  We followed it until it disappeared from sight approx.60-70 miles away.  It followed a straight path and did not change altitude or speed.  The object &quot;blinked-out&quot; at about 70 miles away.  One interesting piece of information is that it flew directly through the upwind leg of the landing pattern of Seatac Airport at a very dangerous altitude, violating FAA regulations.  Also, judging by its flight path, it most likely violated the airspace of McChord AFB also.  The AM radio in my car had slightly more static during the time when the object was overhead. I am more than willing to talk about it further.  Please call with any other questions.

It was in the general area of where the jet had been training but it did not move for several minutes.  I had to take my eyes away for a few moments to attend to something.

It did look bigger and was in a more overhead location.  I positioned myself just under some telephone wires so I could better gauge any movement of the light.  It either remained very stationary, or would drift in irregular movements from time to time.  I watched it come into what appeared to be a nearer location- more overhead.  Its appearance of some kind of hard object grew more apparent.  I could almost determine the object to have a slight cylindrical, or oblong shape.  The jets that had been present earlier faded with their sound into the distance.  Just as the object was nearing a directly overhead position, I went to see if I could find my friend M who was outside somewhere nearby.  I did find him and we proceeded to both observe the object hold still, then drift, now apparently away from us.  Soon, I left M to watch and I went to find a pair of binoculars.  My son helped me look but we were unsuccessful.  Then my son and I joined M in observing the object for several more minutes as it alternated between moments of stillness and movement.  As it continued in a southerly direction, it appeared to either glow brighter with its own light or reflect more off of the sun.  This continued until it faded in the southern distance.  This daytime sighting comes after 2 nightime sightings of similar events at night 3 and 2 nights before- which were not reported here.((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witness might have been looking at a helium balloon.  Large balloons are released in New Mexico, from time to time, and they are frequently reported to us.  Just a guess.  PD))", "Dark, directly overhead triangle shaped, three points, off in the distance rwo moreIn the sky were three glowing traingles.  One flew directly overhead and I could see the underside, which was dark and made of metal.

Above the square of Hagerstown was a craft that seemed to be about a football field long, and was hovering silently. My wife and I just kept looking at it without even saying anything for awhile. It had different colored lights slowly revolving around it&apos;s perimeter. We couldn&apos;t believe the size of it, plus the fact of no noise. Then we began to talk about it, watching it slowly begin to move to the west.All at once it sped up to an incredible speed and vanished. I went to the apt. and called Hagerstown Airport and asked if they picked up anything on radar,and they said no. We have kept quiet about this forever. Now we aren&apos;t exactly positive of the exact date that summer, since it has been such a long time, but we will remember this the rest of our lives. The reason I am doing this now is, we are wondering if anyone other than us had seen it.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "It was about 1:46 A.M. March 19 2001 when I saw it. I was listening to Power 106, and was just about to fall asleep when I heard this weird airplane noise. Now I usually hear lots of airplanes and helicopters fly over the neighborhood as I did with the weird noise. It sounded a lot like an airplane except it also had whooshing noise, which sounded like this: woo,woo,woo, wuooo. Then I heard it stop maybe 450 feet directly in front of my window (I was in my room at the time, which is in the back of my house on the second floor). And then my curiosity got the better of me, and I got up and looked out my window. What I saw made me paralyzed - mouth open. When I finally got up my courage (it took 3 seconds) I said &quot;Holy S@*t!!!&quot; It appeared to look somewhat like the little dude&apos;s space ship from Space Jam. It was as big as two compact cars, one in front of the other, and one on top of the other two like a pyramid (although it wasn&apos;t in the same shape). And then it landed. This part is kind of hard to explain, so I&apos;ll do it as best I can. It flew for about 700 feet, then laned in a most peculier way. It landed kind of like the way that you see flying cars land, like the flying Delorian from Back to the Future part II.", "A kite-shaped object with white lights in each corner was seen flying over central Boise and toward Meridian.Feb. 5 2001. Boise Idaho. When driving southeast on Chinden Blvd at approximately 6:40 PM I noticed a set of two very bright lights about  10-20 degrees above the horizon that at first appeared to be stationary. My first impression was that this was a conventional aircraft with its landing lights on. After a minute or so I noticed the aircraft was not following the normal airport approach. (I live near the airport and have a good feel for the normal arrival and departure patterns as well as the appearance of various aircraft at night.) The aircraft proceeded in what appeared to be a straight line over Garden City directly toward west Boise. (Plotting the flight path on a map indicates that the object passed virtually directly over the state capitol building downtown.) As the object approached, a white strobe light between the two &quot;landing&quot; lights became visible. For a moment I got the impression that an aircraft was in trouble and considering Chinden as a possible landing strip. Then I got the impression that the object could possibly be a slow moving blimp or perhaps I was approaching a balloon over the fairgrounds. (I was searching for rational explanations that I dismissed one by one.) I was stopped at the intersection of Chinden and Kent Ln. (next to the fairgrounds) when the object passed overhead and to my left. I was able to roll down my car window and look up at the object. It consisted of four white lights (two bright ones on the &quot;wingtips&quot;, one strobe on the &quot;nose&quot; and a dim one on the &quot;tail&quot;). There were no conventional (red/green) aviation lights. There was no additional &quot;low flying jet&quot; noise above the normal traffic noise.  I caught a glimpse of the vehicle body as it passed in front of an upper level haze lit by moonlight and it appeared to be black and diamond shaped with four white lights at the tips. It was about 1 thumb width (at an arms length) from wingtip to wingtip. It also appeared to be leaving behind a vapor trial that was about the same width. It was difficult to estimate the altitude, and whether it wa! s ascend ing or descending.  Unfortunately, I could not observe the shape at length because the traffic light changed. At this point, the object clearly seemed peculiar, so I made a U-turn when I could and attempted to pursue it in the direction of its travel. The rear light was dim and the object was much more difficult to make out from the rear. I noted once again that the normal red and green navigation lights that would otherwise clearly mark a conventional aircraft from the rear were absent. The object seemed to move away and disappear much more rapidly than it approached (Probably because the brighter &quot;forward facing&quot; lights made it visible from farther away.) It disappeared over the rim of a ridge above Chinden. My total observation time was approximately 5-10 minutes. Two acquaintences of mine mentioned the next day that they also noticed some strange lights. One was traveling west on I-84 approximately 7-10 miles SW of my location. She reported that she saw strange lights moving west and south of the freeway, about 20 degrees above the horizon. The direction and time are consistent with my observations. I also monitored the sky at the same time on subsequent evenings to verify that this was not part of a routine daily jet flight.

The object had apparently zoomed off into the distance before I got into the room.  My mom and I then sat at the front window looking for this thing, when I saw a small red dot rise above the trees, move a small bit to the left, and then zoom upwards on an angle at incredible speed.  I went outside to check to see if I could still see it, but by that time it was gone.  I came back upstairs and looked out the window again, where I could see a small pin prick of red light floating in the distance.  I am positive it wasn&apos;t a star becase it was moving side to side in an ovular motion. I then went back outside, but still couldn&apos;t see anything.  That was the last time I saw it.

It had, I believe, 4 legs that were quite long (2 or 3 metres) with a sphere on top.  It was grey/metallic in colour.  The door/hatch was in the shape of (what looked like to me) a lions head. I saw the hatch start to open and the family start to get out.  The next thing I knew we were driving down the highway, singing to the radio as if nothing had happened.

March 24, 2001 when I was attending the Aztec UFO Symposium in Aztec NM, and a person got up and told of his sighting on the same night and same time.  I was encouraged to report my sighting by one of the presenters at the symposium. My sighting was on a very clear night and with no city lights nearby to dilute the image. I don&apos;t recall the moon location or if it was visible. I have seen many meteors in my life as I have always regularly wathched the Persiods showers and other events, but have never seen a flash, colors and trajectory as I did that night in August 1999.

We spotted a plane to the south of it and noticed that it was going to be above this light, as soon as the plane was over it, it disappeared completely. We then noticed it but it was now in the south sky, how it got from being east at one moment and then to completely disappear and then show up without us seeing it move. We then watched it head towards the west a little more then it headed sort of northwest, it had several lights on it, a strobe, and a green light and a red, but it made no sound, and there were several plaanes in the area that did not match this thing at all.

At 2:00 am we were both awakened by a loud &quot;humming&quot; noise accompanied by a pulsating light that filled the entire night sky (not a beam) but seemed to emanate from a circular/semi-circular object as far away as any other star in the sky. The humming/light would get louder/brighter and then dim.  This happened three times in a period of 10-15 seconds.

It was still dark, and there was a very bright full moon.  As I was about a tenth of a mile from my apartment building on Bushman Street, Oakton, Virginia I looked at the moon which was bright and low on the horizon.  To the left and below of the moon I saw an amber colored light moving slowly from right to left, approximately over the A T &amp; T regional headquarters building compound.  At first I thought that it was an airplane taking off from Dulles Airport which is about twenty miles away in that direction but I realized that it was far too low on the horizon for it to be an airplane and it seemed to me that it was almost at tree top level.  I realized that it was quite near. I made a right turn on to Borge street and noticed that the object had turned towards my vehicle.  It blinked or pulsated once, and then held a steady amber color. It seemed to stop and hover over the edge of a small childrens playground.  At that time I had turned left onto Jermantown road and had to concentrate on my driving,though I was still looking towards my left where it was hovering about 200 feet away, at the height of a street lamp or so. I had to get gasoline and after that, about ten minutes later I again passed the spot where I had seen this object, and it was no longer there.  At first I thought that maybe I had seen a street lamp or something as it was earlier for me than usual but the object was no longer there on my second pass by the area, so that was not it. Nor could it have been the full moon as I had seen both at the same time. The object seemed to be a small glowing sphere or so, maybe the size of a basket ball though this is very difficult to ascertain.", "For about three minutes, we watched a formation of orangish lights all taking turns twinkling, then fading out.Four of us were getting ready to leave the house tonight, when suddenly my boyfriend, looking far out Northwest, began shouting &quot;Look! Look! There&apos;s those lights!&quot; (There have been previous sightings in town, supposedly). Everyone was freaking out- calling out their parents and neighbors. All in formation, I know there were at least six dim orange lights, but amidst the hustle-&amp;-bustle it was hard to tell... especially since the lights appeared to be taking &quot;turns&quot; blinking EXTREMELY bright like flares (one-at-a-time). Each burst of light lasted, I&apos;d say, about ten seconds or so. None of the lights moved-- they appeared to remain in the same spot the whole time I observed. It seemed during each interval between the twinklings, that each light &quot;faded&quot; into the darkness, and with the final visible light, there were eight witnesses standing in the same lawn-- seeing the same thing.

Instead we saw a large red light moving about in the sky in large circles. The object intentionally stopped near the moon for what seemed like a &quot;look&quot;.  After two minutes, another light paralell to the other appeared. We now think this might have been the back end of the craft.  The lights quickly jolyed back and forth in the sky unlike an airplanes capibilities.  When reaching the moon for the third time the object shot down towards the earth as if landing but was not seen afterwards. We have three photos taken.

There is, however a small town called Moravian Falls, and it is approximately 25 miles north of Hickory, where I live.  I don&apos;t know if anyone with your organization has followed up on the report.  I tend to agree with your comment that if a UFO had crashed there, it is likely that there would have been other reports at that time.  However, since I do live near the area and had occasion to drive out to the site in question last Thursday (3/1/01), I made a point to look around to see if there was anything unusual.  (Granted, this was nearly 3 weeks after the sighting was reported.)  I did not see any signs of a crash at all.  In fact, the construction site mentioned in the report is about ten feet or less from a well-travelled highway, so I believe it would be difficult for something like that to go unnoticed in a town of that size.Regards,((name and e-address deleted))", "I viewed a moving object, traveling southwest and it split-up into two moving objects, exchanging a red light beam.It looked like a moving star, color was red, but very small.

DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE ON 1/26/01. NAME OF CONTACT WITHHELD DUE TO CONFIDENCE. REPORT OF FOREIGN/UNIDENTIFIED AIRCRAFT: UNUSUAL AIRCRAFT OBSERVED OVER CAMP PENDLETON. JANUARY 26, 2001. To: Department of Defense Re: Marine Base Camp Pendleton. United States Marine Corps. Dear Sirs and To Whom It May Concern, Please indulge this report from a former Marine regarding what I believe to be the most astonishing visual sight you can imagine. On Sunday morning, January 20, 2001 at  0130 hours I made the following observation from my own backyard that borders the San Luis Rey Riverbed on the South side. This is directly South of Camp Pendleton. The river-bed is 10 feet from my backyard and goes West to East. I noticed an unusual aircraft coming East from the coastline, directly over the river-bed. At first I could not process what I was looking at. It continued toward me at approximately 25 mph and 300 feet above the ground.  This vehicle was illuminated occasionally by street lights and headlights of cars on the road nearby as it slowly headed past my back fence. Personal Visual Report Following: 1/26/01 by ((personal data deleted)). 24/7 Unknown Air Vehicle Identifiers By Sighting: This aircraft is approximately 50-60 feet in diameter and shaped exactly like a tall slice of pie.  It was of equal dimensions on all three sides and these sides were 15 feet high. There was no lighting, no visible ports or venting. The color was dark (amphibian) green with black splotches. THE FORWARD POINT OF THIS &quot;PIE&quot; WAS ALSO THE FORWARD-DIRECTED SECTION. This color scheme is nearly (if not) identical to a large tropical frog.  The backside was black-framed with black paneling and exuded no light or visible exhaust whatsoever. The underside of this aircraft was flat (as were all the sides) and had two large white pods (looked like tap lights you see on TV) and each was 10-12 feet in diameter. They were located where you might expect landing gear to be placed. This aircraft rumbled as it went by in a very hushed tone. It sounded like a jet engine encased in a steel room with no porting or exhaust sounds. The ground slightly shook. Perhaps it sounded like a reactor core, utterly encased, strong with no venting.  This vehicle floated at 25 mph over my house and was in my plain sight for over 30 seconds. I got a very good look at it. It made no effort to conceal itself except by color and no use of lighting. The 25mph speed was constant and level at 300 feet as this aircraft followed the San Luis Rey River-bed East and beyond my sight. I also want to tell you that I have been observing the skies over Camp Pendleton since last Sunday. There are several  things I have seen that defy explanation and current (public-known) technology.  I have seen white dots evade your helicopters and also follow your helicopters very closely.  These white dots seem to duck-and-cover when an aircraft is coming toward them. They seem quite bold and brazen when the aircraft is heading away and has no visual view behind them. I have seen these white dots follow your helicopters very closely. It appears to be a game of hide and seek. The more helicopters you have in the air at once, like January 24th at 2100 hours, the more visible this activity is. Your flights seem to stir these white dots up and cause them to &quot;blow cover&quot; and start evading. I strongly recommend the following operation to document this nocturnal activity over and near Camp Pendleton. Recommendations for Video-Recording UFO Events: 1)  Have an Audio-Visual platoon set-up an Observation (OP) station on very high ground with a 360 degree view. They must be in a location that is very dark with no street or vehicle lights to diminish human night-vision.. Use telescopic and panoramic lens on digital video recorders using strong and stable tripods. 2) Have these video-crews scan the skies for one week, all night. Have them take visual note of civil aircraft. Have them follow the civil aircraft through the sky with the video lens. Have them watch with their finger on the RECORD button the entire time.  Watch for lights moving ahead of these aircraft or behind them in close proximity. 3) Notice lights in the sky that appear stationary or cosmic. Some of these lights will move away suddenly and very fast if an aircraft comes between them and the ground. These white dots sometimes leave trails of light when they move abruptly.  These white lights tend to flash at times or go entirely blacked-out at other times.  The movement can be from one quadrant of the sky to another in mere seconds. If you can arrange this kind of video-observation operation, or I should say, If you choose to do this, you will eventually get good video tape of UFO aircraft activity right over our heads. What I have seem so far defies explanation. Your own video-tape can then be analyzed by your experts. I am available for polygraph or Sworn Affidavit if so requested.

This was a fire orange colour that seemed constant. I was wondering if maybe it was an aircraft in trouble.No reports yet of any. This object moved form the Western sky to the south.

The lights were off in the house. I have lived in this same house for over 10 years and never saw anything unusual until last night. I suddenly noticed an egg shaped ball of light that looked like it was glowing a solid yellowish color. It was moving very straight accross the sky but only about 40 feet from the ground and at about the speed of a slow hellicopter. It was getting blocked by a tree so I bolted for the door with my binoculars and looked at it from there. I didn&apos;t get a chance to get the binocs out of the case before it continued out of sight behind more trees. There are pretty tall trees here and it looked like it was only about one fifth down from the top of the trees. There are few trees behind the first row so it would have plenty of space to travel, but I know no manmade plane or copter would fly so low day or night. The light of this thing was very bright but seemed self contained and didn&apos;t shine toward the ground. Also, while at the door I heard no sound in the still night air. The size of the thing is hard to say but I was only about 100 yards from it and it looked like it was as big as a small plane.

So i llooked out my window downstairs which faces the mountain and i looked at it.  It was very bright. My mom thought it was a planet but after taking astronomy i am pretty sure with the visible eye a planet is not that bright or close to the earth.  So i took my mothers pretty strong binoculars, and looked through them.  The object was white colored and looked like many dots put together.  It was outlined in thin red.  It wasnt visibly moving yet it did look like it was a little more North then when we first saw it.  It got lower and lower as the half hr or so went on. Again we couldnt see it drop but it got lower. At 8:30 it finally dropped on the other side of the mountain and it was no longer visible to us here.

It was somewhat of a disc shaped a little deformed,, then it looked more like a cigar, then it looked round.

She said the same thing I was thinking,color,shape etc. The shape as we could make it out was long with no wings. It certainly was NOT a weather balloon. It was in our view at least 12 to twenty minutes from the 11 O&apos;clock position that I first observed it until it was about 3 O&apos;clock in the NW sky.

At your request as heard on the ART BELL radio program on 2/5/01, I am sending you MY UFO story...IT IS TRUE... I don&apos;t remember the exact date, but I AM POSITIVE it was in the EARLY 1980&apos;S... My best friend and I, in our early 20&apos;s at the time, decided to go &quot;Back-Roading&quot; on a clear Summer, weekday night around 10:30 PM... We were out driving the country roads surrounding Red Wing, MN., traveling East in the vicinity of Whiterock, MN. when I, (The Passenger) , saw an unusually bright light, approximately 500-1000 Ft. Up &amp; 1-2 Miles North of us, that seemed to be moving South VERY slowly... We pulled off to the side of the road, turned OFF the engine, and got out of the car to get a better look... The &quot;Object &quot; was now almost directly above us and STATIONARY &amp; the bright light was now gone... We listened, but could hear NO SOUND at all coming from it... It appeared to be TRIANGULAR and very dark, If not Black...(Please Read On)... I took some small binoculars out of the glove box and looked at the object closer... I SAW a definite TRIANGULAR shape, but slightly angled inwards at the back, like the back end of an arrowhead... I also saw 5 LIGHTS on the Bottom of the object...Each a DIFFERENT COLOR, arranged in a CIRCLE, with the lights placed at points as the points of a star shape would be within a circle...The lights did NOT blink or fade On &amp; Off... I don&apos;t know what this thing was, but I DO know what it WAS&apos;NT...A Plane OR a Helicopter... It just stayed there in the sky STATIONARY for approximately 5 MINUTES, and then SLOWLY moved Northwest... We got back in the car and followed it at about 10-20 MPH...to 40-50 MPH...Then to 80-90 MPH... It still outpaced us moving off Northwest untill within 30 seconds or so, it could not be seen... We slowed down &amp; went back home feeling Thrilled, Spooked, &amp; Thoroughly Mystified... We told only our close friends &amp; family about the sighting, fearing ridicule, and went on with life having no answers on the subject... Within a week we were busy trying to convince ourselves it HAD to be a plane or a helicopter, and we were starting to believe our excuses... A week after that, on the FRONT PAGE of our local newspaper, the Red Wing REPUBLICAN EAGLE, were sketches of the very object we had seen 2 weeks before... Apparently several eyewitnesses had seen this object floating at tree top level at various spots in an around Red Wing,MN. where we live... Needless to say, that ended our excuses...But, to this day I am sill left without answers... As I said, this sighting happened in the EARLY 1980&apos;s, and with a little help from our local newspaper, mabey you could get the exact date... Or they might still have the newspaper archived... Also, mabey ART BELL would be interested in this TRUE Story...?? Feel free to forward it to him if you like...

This amount of witnesses may seem high, and you may be asking how can you be sure they all saw it.  It was so phenomenal that everyone&apos;s eyes, regardless of their location, went straight to the U.F.O.  It was a big red object, in the shape of a heart, and at first scared all the girls.  We then felt warmth radiate from the big red object, and our smile&apos;s grew.  It was an unstoppable force, from the unknown.  We all started hugging eachother and longing for our boyfriends.  This thing had such power!  As the shape came clearer, it was obvious it was a heart!  It hovered around for about 20 minutes then whizzed out of view.

He was out there for a few minutes, 3-5 minutes before I came out. As I came out I could hear a the sound of humming like a jet engine. I stepped off my porch onto the driveway and heard a loud close, rushing sound speed away. I looked up and saw a shape moving off over the trees. I thought it must have been a fighter jet. When I heard the sound my son said, &quot; Mom did you see that plane?&quot;, I said, &quot;well, I heard it&quot;. He said, &quot;It was weird &apos;cause it was round&quot;. I said oh, did you see it?. Reply &quot; Yeah I was watching it for a while.&quot; I said, &quot;Did it move slowly?&quot; Reply, &quot;No, it was just sitting there looking at me, then it flew away.&quot; Then he said, &quot; It had these two things sticking out the front.&quot; It had a red light on one side and a green one on the other.&quot; Quite non-chalantly he said, &quot;If I see it again, I&apos;ll point to it for you&quot; We had very low cloud cover that morning.

Anyway , aprox 9:45 while fireworks were going my girlfriend and I saw what seemed to be a shooting star going east to west . It burnt out , from our vantage point, right above the fireworks, but up in the sky a bit.(an open hands width @ arms length). Then right at the spot it burnt out this light started blinking . (The light was quite a bit brighter than any of the stars and didnt have a steady blink like a aircraft.) Then the akwardly blinking light moved horizontally tward the north we&apos;d say half the distance between anderson and redding in a couple of seconds.(5 miles distance i think)Then it went south back over the fireworks, stopped, blinked a few times  then the blinking stopped and that was it. It def. was not any aircraft i have ever seen, my pops a pilot and i have grown up around avation, and that was no plane ! We could see the commuter flights going out of redding heading south and they were way slower and lower on the horizon than the blinking light.

I caught part of the program on the radio today on Coast to Coast.  So now I scambled onto my computer after work and searched for the program info.  But I actaully found Arts web page and the entire broadcast from this mornings show.  I am in Toronto Canada. Let me also include that I am an amature astronomer as well, so I can tell the difference from planets, stars, satalites, meteorites and so on. But this was a daytime sighting. Here is my sighting. It was a partly cloudy day, I believe it was August/September (chestnuts were ready to pick) 1974 I believe.  I was 13. My brother and I were out on a chestnut hunt looking for chestnuts.  We were on our way back from gathering chestnuts from a farm just outside the town of Elmira, Ontario, Canada.  It was about 4pm.  After we came out of the farm field we walked down a road (walking northeastwards)  I looked and saw this object above the trees directly ahead of us.  It was about 400 feet or so away from us, it was moving very slowly towards us and up but slightly moving to our right.  It was triangular shaped.  From my position it was about the size of a baseball diamond.  Silvery/ grey in colour, it was raised in the centre, it was very smooth looking.  It made no sound at all.    I don&apos;t recall seeing any kind of windows.   It slowly moved upwards and went through the clouds and that is were I lost sight of it.  I saw it for about 4 or 5 minutes. When we got home I told my mother what we I saw.  My mother put the radio on and there were other reports of this sighting on the radio. Thank you for your time.

And right now it&apos;s a UFO, until I manage to identify it. Saturday March 17th 2001, visible from 1:55pm to 2:03pm. Trying to figure out how to call San Jose airport. Moving due south, spotted in Almaden Valley, from our garden. May have originated from somewhere near the airport, which lies almost due north of here about 5 miles. Height anywhere between 2000 and 10000 feet. No loss in height. No noise. Highly reflective on this sunny day with light clouds. Estimate speed over 100 knots. Visible for 8 minutes from zenith to 30 degrees above southerly horizon, when dwindled to a point. No course deviations observed. Wife saw it at zenith (90) down to about 80 degrees azimuth. Called me, and we both then tracked it until it disappeared into the distance. No time for telescopes or camera; too busy trying to figure it out (hey, I&apos;m a virgin UFO spotter so sue me). Wife asserts (too late for me to tell by the time I got there): * triangular * not a hang-glider (too fast) * not a balloon (wrong shape) * not a parachute (no height loss) * something swinging from the bottom. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2:45pm  3/17/01 I used to fly small planes, so I can say that as an ex-pilot I&apos;m mystified. I called the airport ATC. * Nothing reported from San Jose ATC in the tower, except for a helicopter taking pictures close to the airport. * Wind on ground around 12 knots, little to no gusts. (So unless the wind increased to over 100 knots at a few thousand feet, this wasn&apos;t flying unpowered, therefore.) * Visibility: 10 miles. (So - and this is very rough - 10 miles in 8 minutes = 75 knots roughly. Agrees roughly with my estimates. Also, I reckon the visibility due south was more like 15 miles, which makes my estimate of 100 knots even closer.). A nice sunny day with very light and intermittent clouding. No clouds near the object for the entire time we tracked it. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 6pm 3/17/01 I expected to be excited and/or elated or something, but I guess today being tax return payment day, my reactions are dampened! Also, my wife got the best view, and all I saw was a bright, highly reflective object receding into the distance. We agreed that differentiating between a high large object travelling fast, and a lower, smaller object travelling slower, is damned difficult with no other nearby skycraft as references! There&apos;s some more info left out which my wife and I pulled together: 1. It seemed not to be metallic, but rather the texture of bright white silk. 2. The assemblage hanging down and swaying was entirely white, and the same colour as the triangle. It was about the same length as the traingle&apos;s span. The hanging part appeared to consist of a single U-loop of rope/cable, whereby nothing (e.g. a load, a person) was noticeable at the bottom of the U. 3. The triangle was neither thick nor thin; maybe 10:1 ratio between span and thickness. It appeared to be a rigid body, unlike the hanging assemblage. 4. The prevailing wind, according to reports, was between 5 and 12 knots, at every altitude from zero to 10,000&apos; MSL. It was in direction 310 degrees (out of the NW), which lines up pretty much with the observed course of the object. 5. We also discount a helicopter on two counts a) wrong shape b) no sound whatsoever. 6. The course of the object relative to our south-facing garden (from where we observed it) appeared to be about one half mile due east, so it did not travel directly overhead. 7. At zenith, when only my wife was observing, the angle subtended by the object was approximately that of an object of size 0.7 inches held at arm&apos;s length. When I observed it first, at roughly 80 degrees azimuth, it was about 0.3 inches, and dwindled down to a sparkling point as it receded. 8. At the time of the initial zenith sighting, my wife had been looking up because of the noise of a passenger jet flying by (to or from the nearby airport). If the object were making sound, this could have masked it until it was too distant to hear. Hypothesis: an electric hang glider? Andrew Palfreyman San Jose CA, 3/17/01 I am a professional engineer with over 30 years experience in electronics. I have a degree in physics from Oxford University UK. I am 51 years old. My wife is 30 years old, and has a degree from a Michigan university in theatre. We were both drinking non-alcoholic beverages (and we don&apos;t do drugs!) at the time of the sighting. It was a sunny day in the garden with the children, and we were both relaxed and fully aware. We were both  wearing our glasses during the sighting, so long-distance vision was excellent.", "Weird lights over WinnipegIt was a cold winter morning around 3am. For those of you familiar with Winnipeg it occured in South St.Vital on Warde Ave and St.Annes Rd. I was the passenger in a friends car. As we were driving I looked to my right and noticed some bright lights over top of some houses. I thought about what I had seen and requested that we turn around and investigate. As we approached the object we noticed that it had 3 distinct lights in the form of a triangle. One on top and two to its sides. The lights seemed to have some color to them, at times I remember seeing hints of blue and red, but white was the most frequent. The object just seemes to hang there. It was no further away then 200 yards and was no higher than 50 ft. It hovered motionless for a few minutes. Meanwhile we were fiddling with the radio and flashing our headlights at it. Nothing out of the ordinary occured. Soon thereafter it proceeded top move in a South easterly direction. The lights were always visible. It seemed to move backwards. We proceeded to move east on the road we were on to try and intercept the object. We made it to a road which went North-South and turned south and then just stopped. The object was hovering over the road in front of us. Maybe 20-30 ft above the road and 200-300 yards away. It hovered, slowly moving backwards by some trees lining the road. At that point I rolled my window down and stuck my head out to listen....dead silence. There were no other cars on the road. We must have sat there 5 mins until it started to move in the direction in which it had come from. So we quickly turned around and headed down the same road we were on before only this time we were following a moving target. The lights were still visible at this point. The object seemed to accelerate quickly. We were doing about 80 -90 km/hr when it out accelerated us and vanished. I have never seen anything accelerate like that before. It was fast. I will never forget that night. We were 19 and 20 years old and we were not under the influence of any substanc! es.

PD))", "A silver-metallic hockey puck shaped object just hanging in the daytime sky.This sighting occurred during full-daylight, in a beautiful blue near-cloudless sky. I was traveling north on a popular rural route (Manhattan Road) in western Putnam County, when I noticed an object up in the sky probably many miles ahead of me at an altitude of several thousand feet. My first impression was it must be a balloon, but very quickly knew it was not one as it was completely motionless in the sky. While it was a fairly serene day, obviously anything in the sky such as a balloon at that altitude, would have been moving at least a little bit. Since it was in the sky ahead of me, I was able to try to watch it for several minutes, maybe as much as 10 minutes. But because I had a commitment that I had to be at, I couldn&apos;t stop, and of course I didn&apos;t have a camera to take a picture of it. The entire time I was viewing it, it never seemed to move. Rather it just hung there motionless in the air. I have never to this day have seen anything that could just stay motionless in the air, except this one object I saw in broad daylight. The best way to describe the shape of it is to compare it to a hockey puck. It appeared flat on two sides and perfectly circular in shape. The color was silver-metallic. I couldn&apos;t make out any features such as &quot;windows&quot;, or &quot;engine ports&quot;. The object&apos;s surfaces seemed perfectly smooth. While it looked like a hockey puck, it didn&apos;t lie flat in the sky, but was &quot;tilted&quot; at about 30 degrees. Once again, nothing about the appearance of the object during the time that I observed it changed. It never rotated on its own axis, or moved in the sky. It was clear to me that it was some kind of solid object, and not something &quot;celestial&quot; in the sky I was looking at. It finally was out of my view after driving about 15 miles, but when I was able to take a peak behind me in the sky, it was still there. I am an open-minded person, but always look for a logical solution first.

I thought that the aircraft I had been observing (which was now behind some trees) had turned on final for the AFB. I was thinking how bright the light was and that I had never seen landing lights that bright. I had to take my eyes off of it to make the turn on the road. Then, I looked South again to watch it, but it had moved beyond where I originally saw it.. Looking out the North-West side of my window I observed the fireball travelling North.

I was able to catch her and calm her some and proceeded to sit nearby talking to her to sooth her while watching a round neon light blue ball moving very slowly towards our general direction.  It was impossible to tell the size of the object or the distance from my location as it was a cloudless night in a flat area. I remember not being frightened and having the impression it was quite far away. The  light slowly proceeded in a slight arc from east to west (still appearing to be getting closer but quite distant) for about 30 minutes as I watched.  Finally it disappeared behind a single tree.  I waited for quite some time for it to reappear on the other side, but it did not.

These were arbitrarily &apos;turned off and on&apos; at different points of the sighting.  These spikes appeared to be in somewhat of an X form around the object and defintely moved or spun about the object.  Additionally, a white spike or laser type light  that appeared to acutally be 2 parallel lights projected out from the object in a downward direction.  These extended about 5 times the size of the object but did not go any further and also would be arbitrarily turned off and back on at different points.

PD))", "HUGE blazing falling object (NOT the Mir).OK, this was not so much a &quot;craft&quot;, per se, as something enormous burning and fallng very slowly to Earth. NOTE: This was NOT the MIR, as this event was the Monday before. At sunset this past Monday, several people including myself, all abslutely stone-cold-sober, were at a Texaco gas station located on a high hill, at the intersection of &quot;Exposition&quot; and &quot;Westover&quot; in West Austin. &quot;We&quot; consists of myself, a 50-year-old semi-disabled retiree and college student; my son, ((deleted))l, 28, who works for a prestegious ((deleted)) company, doing precision ((deleted)) work; ((deleted)) friend and co-worker, ((deleted)); two adult male Service Station mechanics. They were fixing a truck my sonhad just bought the day before at an auction, and we all met there to check out the progress. My brother, ((deleted)), a photographer, who didn&apos;t have his camera and I could just kick him, had just been there to check out Joel&apos;s truck and had just driven away. A few minutes after ((deleted)) left, around 6:30pm or so, he called on this cell phone very excitedly and told us to immediately go out and look to the West in the sky. He said there was this amazing streak of fire falling really slowly toward the horizon. By the time we got outside, whatever it was had just broken up into three distinct pieces, all of which continued to fall incredibly slowly to the horizon. I guess they wer e at about 40 degrees or so up from the horizon when we first saw them. ((deleted)) rported it was higher when he saw it, and it was falling very rapidly. apparently when it broke apart, it started falling more slowly? Anyway, we first assumed it was the &quot;Mir&quot; falling (we obviously weren&apos;t real up on the details about when that was supposed to happen last Monday, although we know all about it now), but then we were reminded that &quot;Mir&quot; wasn&apos;t going to fall for a few more days. I was immeditaely concerned that it could be our space shuttle, which was also up there somewhere. But whatever it was really seemed like it must have been bigger thaftn that. We were amazed at how high and HUGE this object must have been, since it was probably 15-20 minutes at least before it finally disappeared into the horizon. We rushed home and swiched on the news, but, amazingly again, ther was NOTHING!! We&apos;ve watched all week, but NOTHING (but the &quot;Mir&quot;, big deal. This object looked to be WAY West of Austin, Texas, as we were looking pretty much due West, I think. It wasn&apos;t dark yet, and we could all clearly see that this was in no way anything but something ON FIRE, not contrails or anything &quot;routine&quot;. We&apos;ve ALL been walking around in question marks all week! Help! Has anyone else reported anything? For the sake of our fragile sanity, we&apos;d sure appreciate a quick response of some kind, if only to tell us you&apos;re checking on it.", "triangular in shape, it had red white and blue lights on the back corners and a sigle yellow light in the front.the night of the incident me and my friend were driving back into town from one of my other friends house. i was in the passenger seat of the vehicle. i was looking in the sky when i saw some strange lights. i told my friend to pull over so we did. we watched it for about 10 minutes. it was very large in size, you couldnt tell the altitude but it was enormous. it was a triangle shape with lights on all the corners and only on the corners. they were red, white and blue lights. the back two corners had the multiple color lights. but the front tip only has one single light which was a yellow color. you couldnt really tell that it was solid because you could not see the mass. but when it flew past the stars you couldnt see them until it passed back over them. so the mass was not transparent. it came from the direction of johnson canyon(east) and flew very slowly over to the area of the &quot;arizona strip&quot;(west). then it sped up rapidly and veared south. almost to where we couldnt see it, then it turned around and was headed in the same direction as kanab(like right at us)(north). so we took off down the road. after going about 300 yards we stoped to watch it again and it had turned back around heading south. that is what we saw. we went to tell friends after that, and watched for it most of the night but it did not return.", "It was a formation of 9 lights that were changing position relative to each other (about the size of the big dipper or bigger)On Saturday February 10th, 2001 Me and my wife were driving Eastbound in Rockford Illinois when at 22:25 a formation of lights in the sky caught my wifes attention and asked me what it was. Of course I had no clue either, but we noticed that we were not the only ones seeing it because most people driving the same way we were were pullng over on the side of the street to take a good look of the lights, which were traveling in a southwest direction. We pulled over in a Restaurant&apos;s parking lot, and we noticed all the patrons at that restaurant were outside watching those lights, despite the cold temperature which mut have been on the teens. he lady standing next to me theorized that they were some kind of memorial lanterns lit up and launched from a nearby hospital and that were being carried by the wind. However it was interesting to see that the lights were shfting positions very slowly and it was interesting to see that at the end of the sighting one of the lights started traveling in the opposite direction as the other lights.", "We saw a lg.bullet shaped object rise,vertically upwards.As I left a small store, in a small shopping plaza,to return to my car, my eight year old son,who was in the car,pointed upwards to me.

We had great difficulty,in not paying attention to it.I did not seek the attention of any other people in the lot,there were very few. We saw it reach a certain altitude,then,saw,it start to fly horizontally,left,to,us.There were no flashing lights or sound to be heard. We,then,got in the car,to follow as best we could,the direction,it was headed.We travelled approximately one tenth of a mile(if that)to see only a grayish line of smoke(gas)in the sky.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and we found her story rather interesting.

We were at a point in the canyon that begins to open up (and eventually turns into flat desert about three or four  miles further ahead of where we say the object.) The night was clear.  There was enough natural light from the stars that you could see the cabins and ranches though not much detail.  The other side of the canyon terrain was visible.  It wasn&apos;t &quot;pitch dark.&quot;  All of a sudden we noticed movement in the canyon just ahead of us.  We could not make out WHAT we saw because the object was dark.  There was an eery silence.  We both saw it and slowed down to view it. It was in the center of the canyon heading in the direction (into the canyon) that we were leaving.  The massive size of the thing was what struck us as odd, not to mention having no idea as to what we were looking at because it was too big to be going into that area.  We slowed the Suburban down to watch it.  It was silent, we could see the outline of it due to the way it blocked out everything.  In other words, we could see where it wasn&apos;t because the background of the canyon was illuminated enough to outline it.  It was as if this thing absorbed light because there was no reflection from it.  We both asked one another &quot;what is that?&quot;  It had lights at the front and back.  Just small lights.  It moved in a graceful manner with simialr motions to that of a helicopter (up, down, sideways, forward backward).  There was no sound.  I remember thinking it reminded me of the Hindenburg photos I have seen though it did not look &quot;balloon-like&quot;.  This thing seemed solid.  Just the shape reminded me of it though this was a bit more oval instead of &quot;cigar-shaped&quot; as I would refer to the Hindenburg.  We watched it for a mile or so and then when we looked back again it was gone. There was no way it could have gone into the canyon any further as the canyon narrows.  It was too large.  We were probably a quarter of a mile from it when we passed it.  Trying to give an idea of its size is difficult.  Maybe the size of a DC-10 jet (if you drew an oval around the jet that is.)  I remember being strangely aware of the eerie feeling though not fearful.  We both just looked at each other and agreed &quot;that was weird.&quot;  I have been told by skeptics that &quot;oh, it was a weather balloon.&quot;  I disagree though I have no other answer than to explain what I saw.", "At 2:10am, March 14, 2001, 2 dimly lit craft observed mirroring one anothers movements 8mi. west of the Washington Monument.At approximately 2:10am, Wednesday, March 14,2001, I observed 2 incredibly fast light sources moving North to South. They were at an altitude of less than 1000ft. and were both dimly lit with at least 15 white lights each. I could not distinguish either objects form due to their incredibly fast speed. Generally they mirrored one anothers movements but clearly the craft on the East side was jumping to the East as much as 100ft. and changing its altitude 100ft. simultaneously without any overt sign of acceleration yet jumped back to mirror the general flight path of the craft to its immediate West.

But the report of the dream from that fellow in Seattle 03/15/01 made the hair on the back of my neck stand up. When I was a child growing up in Trail, BC, I used to have the same recurring dream as that described by your Seattle correspondent. As I got older, the dream would recur less often. Oddly, I had the dream again, after an interval of many years, only a few months ago. In my dream, the early morning clear daytime sky is filled with these objects flying over at relatively low altitude, leaving trails that are not contrails, as I stand in our backyard watching (we lived at this location in Trail from the time I was about two years old, 1958, to 1964). Some of the objects are dark green, but many are shining, golden coloured. I don&apos;t recall seeing markings on the objects, however. I don&apos;t remember when these dreams started, but I do recall that at first I had them almost every night, sometimes more than once in a night (I usually woke up immediately after the dream, and the recollection of the dream is vivid in my mind for days afterward), then less frequently. By the time I started university in 1974, I was having them once or twice a month. By the 1980s, I seldom had the dream. As I got older, I attributed the dream to a child&apos;s interpretation of events related to the Cuban missile crisis, although I don&apos;t recall if they started at the time of this event or not. I never thought that anyone else would dream of exactly these same objects. I don&apos;t really expect (or want) to see this in the database, but I wonder if the person who contacted you from Seattle might want to know that others have had the same dream, from the perspective of where they were living.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

On the evening of March 12, 1997, I went to visit a friend and former neighbor of mine from ODU college. He lived in a one story ranch at the end of Rogers Avenue, in the Glenwood Park section of Norfolk, VA. Glenwood Park is a small rectangular shaped residential neighborhood, approximately 5 blocks by 5 blocks situated inside a residential section of the Norfolk Naval Base. A street level maps shows quite clearly that this neighborhood is surrounded on all sides by what is collectively referred to as the &quot;Norfolk Naval Base&quot; or just NAB by locals. IN clockwise direction, to the South of Glenwood Park is all Navy Housing, to the west is the Norfolk International Terminals, to the North is Norfolk Naval Air Station, one of whose major runs parrallel and just to the north east of Glenwood park about a 2,000 yds away. Also just north east of Glenwood is the home of the US Atlantic Fleet, complete with ballastic and attack submarines, Arleigh Burke class destroyers, and usually a few Aircraft carriers and their support craft. To say that the area I was in was a &quot;military area&quot; is an understatement, for the Hampton Roads Area has over 250,000 active duty personel, which makes this area, in effect, collectively, the largest military base in the country. (USA) At any rate, at approximatley 9pm EST, while flipping through the basletball games of the &quot;March Madeness&quot; basketball season, in which ODU was playing a major game, my friend (Tommy) not his real name, told me his father who lived next door, was having some plumbing problems. I was a plumber at the time for national plumbing company, and told him that I could help his dad out. I didn&apos;t have any buiness cards in my wallet so I walked outside to my service truck which was parked nearby, to get some cards. I dug through my messy paperwork and finally found a few cards and began walking back to my friends house along a 30 foot long path towards a small 3 step concrete porch before entering his door. As I walked along the path, towards my right hand- upper right about 45 degrees from the horizon level, I could see the constellation of Orion with its three stars, AL nitak, Al mintak, and Al- whatever it called, shining very brightly. I could not see the moon, (it was close to a New Moon) the temperature was probably about 40 degrees F and the sky was crystal clear with no clouds visible. Humidity was normal to below normal, and the air was crisp. As I walked The Path, I noticed that &quot;something&quot; was catching my eye and I felt distracted by something. I kept walking, and as I walked I glanced up again at Orion&apos;s Belt. My attention was drawn to the area in between the first star on the left of Orion&apos;s Belt and the star Sirius which is directly to the east of it. I&apos;m not sure why I looked up there...but my my peripheral vision was catching something moving and I strained to see something, but I didn&apos;t know what... So I kept walking up the path and by the time I got to the first step of the porch I looked up again briefly at Orion&apos;s Belt and noticed something odd. As I began to walk up the three steps of the Porch, I kept my eyes fixed on Orion&apos;s Belt. Something had passed in front of the left star of Orion&apos;s Belt blocking out the starlight. &quot;That&apos;s Odd&quot; I said to myslef, because as a Former Civil Air Patrol &quot;spotter&quot;, I have been on many flights in small cessna 152&apos;s and Piper&apos;s and knew from experience that any aircraft in this area of NAB would have to have their FAA approved Anti-Collision Lights on at night. Moreover, I also knew from experience that any craft traveling at night, over a military Terminal Control Area (TCA) wihtout lights on, near the final approach vector of its major East-West...would certainly lose his license to fly...in a heartbeat.. Intrigued, I paused at the top step of the porch to wait and see if this idiot pilot would turn on his running lights. I waited for the white random flash in the middle if the craft with red on left (port side) and green on right side (starboard) indicating its presence in the nights sky. Just as soon as that thought passed in my head, I saw the middle star of Orion&apos;s belt blink out, as if the craft had passed in front of it...passing as it were from the left of Orion&apos;s belt straight across and in front of the middle star of Orion&apos;s Belt and the then on to pass in front of the third star on the right...blinked out...all in succession....like One-Thousand, Two- Thousand, Three- Thousand. &quot;This guy&apos;s screwed&quot; I say to myslef thinking of how much trouble he&apos;s in, (or she, not to offend any woman pilots) when my eyes adjust enough so that I can now see that the dark object is some kind of huge flying wing or boomerang shaped object. &quot;A B-2 Bomber!&quot; I say to myself? Then I say, there aren&apos;t any B-2&apos;s stationed here? Just as my eyes were able to focus on the craft (with no lights on it whatsoever) It initiated some type of maneuver and I lost it for a few seconds. I took this moment to look at my watch...and as far as I can remember it was 9:08:00 pm EST. From that point on my recollection of how time passes is very bad. I lost the craft for anywhere from 3 seconds to maybe as much as 20 seconds....I&apos;m not real sure. When I first saw the craft, as it passed in front of Orions belt stars, it was approxiamtely 3-4 inches, wingtip to wintip as measured from my face to my outstretched index finger. The shape of the craft was a &quot;boomerang configuration&quot;. Some might call this a &quot;chevron&quot; configuration...but I think that describes something more like a carpenters square than what I saw...the bend in the middle, the Dihedral, was only about 5 or ten degrees maximum, meaning that the boomerang shape was only slightly bent in the middle, not 90, or 45 degrees, but much less. Ok, so when I first saw this thing, I had absolutely nothing to gage its height by. I automatically assumed that it was a B-2, not just because its shape resembled a &quot;Flying Wiing&quot; but because I couldn&apos;t hear any engines. So I assumed that it had to be a B-2..... As I was pondering all this in the brief period when I &quot;lost&quot; it against the night sky, I got the overall sensation that it was performing some sort of &quot;maneuver&quot;, another thought popped into my head... I thought to myslef, &quot;Maybe it&apos;s the Navy Seals!&quot;. Yeah that&apos;s it, it&apos;s the Navy seals on a hang glider on a stealth mission...like that scene from &quot;Escape from New York&quot; and I thought to myself &quot;they are training for a mock take-down of NAB! this is cool, I &apos;m gonna watch this! Just as I had convinced myself that this thing was not a B-2 and had to be a hang glider, because there was no sound, I noticed something coming over the treetops to my left hand side. (southwest). My dad was in the Army and I remember him always telling that if you want the best visual acuity at night, you don&apos;t look directly at an object, you constantly move your focus &quot;around&quot; whatever object your trying to look at, this keeps your rods and cones replenished. The reason for this added detail is because, I got the impression that the craft made some type of maneuver to fall from its original position which had to be 6-10 angels high. It moved so fast that I totally lost it from my vision, even though I was looking right at it...I didn&apos;t pick it up again until it was about 20 feet above treetop level and about 100-150 yards away! What I&apos;m trying to say is that I don&apos;t know whether this craft &quot;fell&quot; from its first position or &quot;dematerialized&quot; and then rematerialized over the treetops...because as I was trying to explain before...I changed my viewing from looking directly at it to focusing around it and it just sort of &quot;materialized&quot;...I don&apos;t know if it was because of the way I changed my focus on it (night Vision) or if it really did &quot;Demateraialize&quot; and then &quot;Rematerialize&quot;, but my gut feeling at the time was that it did some type of rapid circling maneuver, like when you took the seed pods of maple trees and threw them in the air, we called them, &quot;helocopters&quot; and played with them, they would fall and spin on a central axis while spinning rapidly...I am aware of the brains ability to &quot;fill-in&quot; areas where it does note have enough data to form an opinion, I call it projection, I&apos;m sure some psychologist out there has a name for it. It may have done both or just did a super tight, super fast, &quot;helicopter&quot; maneveur, I&apos;m just not sure. Having flown right seat in cessnas and pipers and having flown hang gliders at Kitty Hawk quite a few times, this intrigued me, because if it was a hang glider, it would explain why it was so silent, but there is no way a hang glider can drop 6000 feet in just a few seconds, without having a catostrophic failure! Hang gliders can drop very fast and silently, but their center of gravity is such that it always seeks the horizon, I just can&apos;t imagine a hang glider going straight down like that, unless it had a catastrophic failure, but these thoughts were all muted in a few seconds as It grew closer... So after it made this falling maneuver, it was now situated approximately 200-300 yards away to my left, at about 200 ft ASL or just above treetop level. The craft is moving quite slow now and I am just starting to get a glimpse of its shape, which has changed, not because it actually changed shape, but just because I was now looking at would have been it&apos;s right &quot;wing tip&quot; from a position that was in front of and to the right and below the craft. Now the craft, instead of &quot;appearing&quot; like a boomerang, now looks like.... A saucer? I say to myself? No how the hell it went from Boomerang to Saucer shape was beyond me.... AS it grew closer to my position I could see that it had some type of dome shape on the bottom of the side I was looking at. (At the exact time of this angle of view from my perspective I thought it looked like some sort of Dome or oblong shaped Craft...) Ok now I&apos;m standing at the End of Rogers Ave which runs nearly exactly East West and I am at its most Eastern part. The Craft is travelling From due south to North, without any deviation, except for whatever maneveur it made to fall in height. It was just as if I was on a parade stand and this craft falls from the sky and silently floats in front of me going from my left view to my right and out of sight.... But at this time the UFO is now directly in front of me. Rogers Ave is about 5 blocks or approx 2000ft long and lined with yellowish High Pressure Sodium Streetlights. Rogers ave, from my position is exactly perpendicular to me, meaning that it is forming a right angle 90 degrees from my viewpoint. To be more descriptive draw an upside down T and I am at the position of where the Bottom and top of the T intersect, looking down the vertical part of the T. Also important to remember is that this was March and the trees that year hadn&apos;t quite bloomed yet, and there were many trees in the nieghborhood and along Rogers ave, so at times during the sighting, the craft was behind the branches. In my original report to MUFON VA I said I thought it had some type of antenna on top of it, but after going back to the sight a year later at the same date, I quite clearly mistook the branches for an antenna. As it got to a point where it seemed to hover over the streetlights I was looking at the craft directly through it&apos;s right side. From this perspective it actually appeared to be classic Saucer shape with a rectangular body, with smooth corners and dome on the bottom! But just as my brain was trying to tell me it was a Sacucer, I noticed that the craft seemed to slow down and seemed to almost stop, directly above the streetlights. As it did slow down the right tip seemed to dip down a little as the left tip seemed to yaw to the right, like a conventional plane would do in a turn, but the difference is this thing was nearly at a hover, less than a stone&apos;s thro away trtavleing at most 1-5 mph....I knew it wasn&apos;t a hang glider or B-2 or anythign like that at all... Right around this moment I noticed that I could &quot;feel&quot; a very low frequency hum, a frequency that sounds much like an eighteen wheel truck in the distance on a deserted hwy, the way you hear it is like a long drawn out huuuuummmmm.....huuuuuuummmmmt. The biggest difference is that I seemed to &quot;feel&quot; this not necessarily &quot;hear&quot; it. Realizing that this was an extraordinary event, I tried to shout out my friends name who was only 20 feet from me through that door...but only a whisper seemed to come out....thinking I had lost my nerve I took a quick breath and shouted again....but nothing came out.....in a panic, I took a really deep breath and exhaled a shout that my mother could have heard 600 miles away....I felt my lungs contract, my throat muscles contract, my tongue moving and breath exhaling....but not a whisper came out! Truly terrified now, I just stood there transfixed on the craft as it seemed to hover over the streetlights and as it did so its right front and right bottom wingtip had the amber colored lights off the HPS streetlights illuminating it. It was at this point that its shape and form were very clear and defined. From my perspective the craft appeared to be approximately 30 or 40 feet from front to back. About 20-30 feet high and ...well at that time I hadn&apos;t seen it from any perspective that I could gage its length-wing-tip to wing-tip yet. It most definately had a dome about 15-20 feet wide which protruded down from under its right wing-tip about 5 feet at most. I could also see the outline of another dome on the left under belly of the left wingtip. The right front or leading edge of the wingtip was essentially a vertical surface as was the rear leading edge, but I don&apos;t want to confuse the reader into thinking that this craft actually had any laminar flow. The top and bottom edges of the craft were rounded like the Quarter round mold on your floor. In general it was an immense rectangular cross section, boomerang shaped craft with rounded smooth radius edges with no other protrusions or lights or windows or whatever, just perfectly smooth as if it had been injection molded out of a high temperature ceramic composite. The color of the craft resembled what I would best describe as a Black-Bluish. It blended so well with the night sky it was almost impossible to see unless you were looking right at it. You probably could have been sitting right under it, looking stright up at it and the glare of thelights would totall block your view...you wouldn&apos;t even know it was there! I have a some Engineering experience and I would say that it most likely resembled a Metallic flame spread coating, whereby metal powder is heated and melted in situ as it is applied to a substrate. This gave the skin of the craft a texture which made it appear from a distance to almost be pourous, like a lava rock or something of that sort but much smoother. It fit in with the sky so well that I think you could have been driving right under this thing and if you werent looking directly at it, you would go right by.... Of course by this time it was apperent that it was not any type of &quot;Air&quot; craft. The &quot;wings&quot; were 20 feet thick, there was no chance for the wings to produce any laminar flow whatsoever and without laminar flow and the Bernoulli principle, you can&apos;t produce lift, there were no jet engines, no jet exhaust hitting the trees and moving branches, nothing at all just that all invasive humming. After it did its little slow down and tilt, it then seemed to regain its bearing and slowly began to move a little faster and straighten out its flight path continuuing on its northward path and gently, quietly passing over the homes in that area before I lost it over the horizon. But this was probably the most awe inspiring thing of the whole event for me, because now I had a third perspective from which to gage its true wing tip to wing tip size or length....and I was completely dumbfounded by what I saw.... Before my eyes was a craft that had to be no less 800 feet from wingtip to wingtip. To give the reader some perspective of it&apos;s shear size, a 747 looking at it head on is about 187 to 200 feet in length, so if you took 3- 747&apos;s and laid them tip to tip they still wouldn&apos;t be long enough to match the size of this thing. It was so long that I couldn&apos;t focus my eyes on one part of the craft and still be able to see the rest of it....from 2000 yards away! I actually had to move my whole head to scan its size from left tip to the middle and then all the way back over to the right where a tree got in the way! One side of the craft was on the right side of tree and the left part on the left side of tree with 20 feet of branches in between! One more thing, on the back of the craft there was some sort of &quot;line&quot; which ran parallel to the body of the craft. In other words it looked like a rectangle within a rectangle. In retrospect it must have been a protrusion of a few feet out because it was passing over a huge playing field and the lights which illuminated it were now coming from an angle which would could only have made the shadow line I saw if something was protoding as opposed to recess within the crafts structure. Also when viewing craft from the rear, I could see that there were three domes on the bottom of the craft, one on each tip and one in the middle. The next day I searched every paper and news item...but I heard nothing. I thought that I was the only person in the world who saw this thing. Then on July 4, 1997 the SCI FI channel did a special on the 50th anniversary of the Roswell crash...and at the end Jonathan Frakes says, &quot;and in Phoenix Az, on March 13, 1997 Strange lights were seen.&hellip;&quot; You have no idea how nuts I went, my roomate thought I was losing it...Now here I was, with proof that others saw exactly what I saw, but only they were 1000 miles away and it was the next night! This began a 4 year quest to find out the truth, the disinfomation, and meaning behind my event. I reported my sighting to MUFON....but they weren&apos;t much help at all...I am hoping that posting on this agency will encourage others who know the TRUTH about 3/13 to come forward about this and other sightings in the Hampton Roads Area....I have more information about this sighting for those interested contact Peter Davenport.", "Strangely silent object streaks accross sky in desert southwest.At about 3:30am (MST) I let my dog out back, then I went into the house to put a slice of pizza in the microwave. As the pizza was warming I went outside to join my dog, and when I walked outside I noticed something moving accross the sky. At first I was confused by what I was watching, because I couldn&apos;t quite make out it&apos;s shape. At first it appeared to look round, kind of saucer shaped, then as it moved it looked almost cigar shaped. Suddenlly after moving about three quarters of the way accross the sky it&apos;s shape appeared more cheveron like. I should note that the backyard is on the north side of our property, so I was looking at this facing north. There was this strange silence to everything as the object flew accoss the sky, almost as if the object was sucking in the sound like a vacuum as it went by. The object had no lights, or light pattern on it, yet it was somewhat luminous. It seemed to be white, almost siver in color. The object flew from east to the southwest at about a 60 degree angle from the horizon, and that&apos;s the opposite direction of the flight pattern of the commercial air traffic in the area. It should also be noted that I live approximatly two and a half miles from Sky Harbor Intl Airport, so I know the flight patterns of the aircraft in the night sky. This object appeared to be rather large, and to be flying at about 8,000 to 10,000 feet in alltitude. It swept accross the sky at a speed at least 3 to 4 times faster than anything else in the sky. The object disappeared into the night sky to the south, southwest as fast as it had appeared in the east. The whole time of the sighting couldn&apos;t have been more than 30 seconds. After losing sight of the object I could once again hear the sounds of the other objects in the sky.", "40+Lights seen in daylight with spiral formation of 25+ lights over Mira Loma,California(Ontario,CA)I Live in Swan Lake,Mira Loma,A mobile home park.Out walking around i noticed about 10 Points of light in the Clouds about 80 degrees high.  I ran home as quick as i could and grabbed my Digital Camera to get a picture. When i ran back outside, I noticed that about 30 more lights appeared in the sky.Looking at the objects,I was so stunned.In fact i almost forgot to take a picture of the flying objects.Now the werent lights,they were shiny objects in response to the sun.About i would say 25+ of the objects suddenly moved into a formation seen in the picture i took,that you should get along with my report.As you can see,the formation is a spiral of some sort. with very unique dots to the left of it.I think those dots mean something, Maybe mathematical or something else?", "((NUFORC Note:  Anonymous report.  Date is approximate.  PD))Woodland Hills, Los Angeles Shinning craft at midday.I was sun bathing at the pool in L.A fittness.  I decided to look up at the sky and block the sun out of my view to see if the theory of being able to see things in the sky was true, as i had just seen a story on doing that on a T.V show called &quot;Sightings&quot;.  To my absoute surprise i did.  It was a very bright shining and pulsating object that appeared to shimmer.  I was much more silver than the sun itself, which seemed to be yellow in comparison.  This was a strange thing to see since i had a very memorable dream about meeting with aliens only a few days earlier.  In the dream they took me around the USA and showed me where they had bases, the strange thing was though, they all looked the same, and to me in my dream they looked like businessmen in suits.  I was wondering if i could communicate with the people flying it, this just came to me, so i asked them in my mind to fly in such a way that i could prove to myself that they were not an earthly aircraft.  In about 10 seconds it begen to fly in tight circles at an incredible speed, this clearly could not be a plane, helicopter, balloon or satilite.  When it finished, i heard in my head... &quot;there you go&quot;. I was impressed beyond belief! I was in the presence of other people at the tiime and could not understand why they didn&apos;t look up to see what it was i was looking at so intently, it seemed that they didn&apos;t even notice me.  I felt the need to tell someone so i could get a second witness, however when i had that thought...I heard, or felt a thought that i should not do this and that this experience was a GIFT TO ME, so i din&apos;t tell anyone there at the time.  As i indicated this went on for 20 minutes.  The vehicle flew all over the sky at incredible rates of speed, covering an entire two thirds of the horizon in a few seconds, it was uplifting and joyful to watch, i had such a feeling of overwhelming wellbeing within me. At the end, after the spinning circles, they indicated that they needed to leave as they were being tracked, even though i never saw! any pla nes up there, and it took off to the west, out over the Pacific so fast that i don&apos;t know if it disappeared or left my view.  I have seen many lights in the sky and have had numerous strange experiences throughout my childhood in Australia, along with psychic events all my life, but this was the clearest i have ever seen in daylight.", "((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

One day at school during recess our whole school, including my sister and teachers witnessed a flying saucer. This air craft swiftly came from the clouds dropped down to about 40 - 50 feet of the school yard and hovered for about a minute.  We all stood and stared in awe.  It left just as quickly as it came and looked as if it crashed behind a mountain.  One of the teachers called the local sheriff and reported the incident.  He drove the area that this craft could have crashed at and saw nothing unusual. In 1997 my family including my father and sister revisited our old school site.  The school as since burned down.  But my father is a friend of the sheriff that was called that day.  He asked him if he remembered this incident.  He admitted that he didn&amp;#8217;t remember that particular incident, but that was because he had been called out on numerous calls involving unidentified flying objects. Besides my sister, we have not spoken with anyone about this incident since it happened.  I guess it was &quot;swept under the rug.&quot;  Have you heard of any similar instances in that area?

I told them I was checking out this bright light, I put the object in my binculars and saw something I have never seen before in my life it was disk shape with 4 panels of lights two on top and two on the bottom, at that thime I grab my wife out the door and showed her she said  oh my god what is it, at time the object moved to our right and followed the ground on the mountain you could see like a beam or light from the bottom of it you could see this with your eyes you did not need the binculars to see it. the object followed the ground to the top of the ridge it went over the top of the ridge and stop just on the other side of it it stayed there for about 5 min then it was gone. at that time my son yelled look to the right and this object was moving left,right up and down with such speed I never seen anything be able to move like that it was not a helicopter or plane there was no sound what so ever.((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken numerous times with the witnesses to the events they describe, and we find them to be exceptionally credible and serious minded in their report.

PD))White circular light seen in sky, splitting into four distinct white lights, dancing in a circle. and converging with a kiss.Feb. 8th my son and I went outside to walk our dog at 8:15pm.  It was very cloudy and damp.  We both noticed a glowing light over our heads that would split into four distinct balls of light through the clouds, cirle counterclockwise and then converge back to a central ball of light.  This convergence was like a quick kiss and then the four individual balls of light would wisk out to the outer circumference and do a circle dance counterclockwise and repeat the movement to the the center kiss/convergence and out again in seperate forms of light.  Whatever this was-it must have been very high up because it truely seemed to follow us.  We stopped at several houses and collected several neighbors observations, as well. They saw the same thing, as well. I did report this to our Rochester Planetarium and was promised they would get back with some possible explainations. It was very unusual the way it seperated into the four soft wisky while light balls and did this circle dance with a kiss.  It appeared like watching angels or ghosts dancing in the sky.  The circle it made seemed to take up about a baseball fields circumference.", "I witnessed 3 low-flying, triangular-shaped, black crafts traveling to the north, northwest on Saturday 16, 1999.I am a high school English teacher and maintain a part-time job at the local mall.  On Saturday, October 16, 1999, I was scheduled to work late, and I did not get home until around 9:30-9:40 p.m.  As I got out of my car, I looked in the sky over my house (to the north west).  I saw something (I guess I thought it was a plane at first)that looked a little odd.  I walked out the my back yard to get a better view.  I saw 3 craft.  They  were triangular in shape and were traveling fairly close together.  They had very little lighting, but the shapes were quite clear.  They seemed to be flying fairly low, but I couldn&apos;t begin to estimate their distance.  I watched for 2-3 minutes in awe.  They seemed to have some movement, but they didn&apos;t seem to really travel across the sky.  After a couple of minutes, I ran inside to get my husband so he could see, but when I finally got him out there, the crafts were gone.  I happened to mention this to my parents on the following day, even though I knew they would think I was probably crazy.  Instead, they told me that their best friend (now deceased) had witnessed the exact same thing two months prior to my sighting.  He lives about 70 miles north of me, so it not quite in the same vicinity.  Both sightings included the three craft that were dull, black with white lights on each corner of the triangle.  This is fairly vague information, but until I listened to Art Bell tonight, I hadn&apos;t really considered reporting what I had seen.  I have forgotten most of the specifics, but I did want this to be on some type of record.  I had never really doubted the idea of UFOs, but I never thought I would actually see something which couldn&apos;t easlily be explained.", "A Single White &quot;STRING&quot; lightMy Uncle and I were visiting family in Sun City, AZ. We were outside around 8:30P.M. looking at the stars, and saw a very long streak of white light. Sorta like a string. Just one. It looked like it was just floating in the sky. We tried to strain our eyes to try to figure it out. Then it just got too far away and dissapeared. We only saw it for about 20 seconds. A few minutes later, about 5 military jets from Luke Airforce base, flew by above.", "Flare-like object blasts across sky at unthinkable speed over Austin TexasI was driving out by the lake on my way home from my sister&apos;s house in Lakeway, a town right outside of Austin, Texas. It was about 9:00pm and very cold out (on the verge of freezing). I happened to look up and to my surprize a flare-like object shot throught the sky as if it had been fired out of a gun. It was faster than anything I have ever seen before.  My initial thought was that of a bottle Rocket, but no bottle rocket travels at the speed that this thing was moving.  The most interesting part of this is that the object fired off from a central point in the sky. Its as if the object was floating and then just suddenly blasted off. The object immediately formed a vapor trail.  This was the strangest vapor trail I have ever seen in that it had a vibrant white glow and it sort of looked like a dark blueish outline formed around the edges of the trail.  I am possitive that it wasnt a space shuttle landing, because I have seen the trail that forms from a space shuttle and this was far bigger and brighter.  Once again, nothing has ever passed my eyes at the speed that this thing was traveling.  I also noticed that although it seemed like it was only 200 or so feet above me at the start, as I drove into a clearing over Lake Travis (right by Mansfeild Dam) the trail looked like it was 5 miles high.  I have explained my sighting to the best of my memory.  I must say that this has opened my eyes a little to the possibility of extraterrestrial airships.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

There was a full moon rising in front of me and a little to the right, and the sun was getting lower in the sky behind my left shoulder.  I noticed a configuration of ball-park miles ahead of me and to the right of the highway, with lots of trees, etc., in between.  As I was looking towards the ballpark lights, with the full moon upwards of it and to the left, DIRECTLY OVER the ballpark in the sky appeared, from nowhere, A BRIGHT WHITE CIRCLE OF LIGHT that was the same size as the moon.  It was extremely bright, like a huge circular mirror reflecting the sunlight, but it did not hurt my eyes and it did not glare.  It just &quot;tilted&quot; on and then, after a second or two, it &quot;tilted&quot; off.  I compared it to the size of the moon, almost precisely.  It really gave the impression of a big mirror tilting in the sun, or a &quot;portal,&quot; which opened for me to see.  I looked at the passengers in other veh! icles nearby (it is a double highway) but I saw no indication that anyone else saw the UFO.

A friend and I were in a natural area on the property of a local hospital listening for owls. Suddenly a craft flew almost straight over head going towards the hospital. Thirty seconds later an identical craft flew over in the same flight path. The only reason we saw them was because the hospital parking lot lights lit up the under side of the crafts. The parking lot was on the other side of a tree line. We were on the other side of the tree line in an open prairie. The crafts were triangular in shape and were wider than long. I`d estimate they were 15 feet wide by 10 feet long. They were a light grayish brown with a very dark strip that bordered close to the entire back end. They were traveling 10 mph and were around 80 feet off the ground. The crafts flew in a straght line and made no noise. They had no lights that we could see.", "Oblong or ovoid luminous object,It was almost 6 PM (about 5:50, I think). As I sat down at a bus stop I noticed a bright oblong or oval-type shape toward the west. It was perhaps about 1/3 the apparent size of the full moon, and I couldn&apos;t tell how far away it was. It was low on the horizon--that is, just above trees, buildings, etc. It was bright enough and big enough to be very noticable, and yet its luminosity was kind of dullish--that is, it didn&apos;t &quot;shine&quot;--it had a kind of uniform brightness and tone. It had a bluish white color--very much like the moon. Now, it could have been an ordinary object for all I know--but I noticed it immediately, and couldn&apos;t identify it, even though I am (I think) pretty familiar with the sky, astronomical objects, aircraft, etc. I thought it might have been a blimp--maybe it was, but it didn&apos;t really seem like one. It was elongated vertically rather than horizontally, though that might be due to perspective. I watched it move with reference to various objects on the horizon: it hovered, and moved slowly a few angular degrees both horizontally and vertically. After I watched it for a few minutes, the light went out, but I could still see the silhouette of the the object against the twilight sky (the object was darker than the surrounding sky). As I recall, the dark silhouette that remained after the light went out was rectangular, not ovoid. It was in plain view of the city--I am reporting it simply because it was interesting and unfamiliar to me, although it might have just a mundane explanation!", "Spotted an entity moving rapidly.I was parked at a rest area just northeast of town on the Katy Trail watching an airplane touch and go (I think it was a pilot in training with the trainer). I had been sitting there for an hour or so just relaxing and listening to geese, owls, cows and watching the airplane. I had rolled my window down and laid in the car sideways with my head resting partially out the window so I could see the sky. I saw a polar satellite go by at one point. I also saw a meteor which appeared to come from the constellation Cassiopea moving towards the west. I was thinking about leaving when I spotted a dark object moving from the southeast to the northwest rapidly. It didn&apos;t appear to have any lights and made no sound. It was in sight and out in less than 2 seconds. Needless to say I had a hard time getting a fix on it. It was about the width of my pinky finger one inch from my eye. This object appeared to be less than 1000 feet high. Here&apos;s what spooks me... it looked like it was alive. It looked more like an entity than a craft which is why it changed shape. NOTE: My wife and I have seen one of these before a couple years ago flying over Sedalia in the evening. It moved a little slower and was illuminated by the city lights. We were baffled. She thought maybe it was an angel... I&apos;m not so sure. Has anyone seen anything like this? Surely I&apos;m not the only one.", "Possibly observed a &quot;mother ship&quot; with three smaller craft darting about it.At the time I was by myself in the back yard of a friend whose home was at the foot of the Rocky Mountains. Skies were clear with just a few wispy clouds. While admiring the sun setting over the mountains, I noticed four bright spheres of light traveling due west at a high altitude and a fairly high rate of speed. Because the sun was reflecting off of the surface of these crafts, I could not make out any details. However, one craft was much larger than the other three and it traveled in a straight line. What made this sighting unusual was that the other three craft kept darting around the larger craft, which made no sense. Understand that I was in the Air Force at the time, and I worked at NORAD inside of Cheyenne Mountain where my group analyzed secret data about new satellite launces worldwide. At first when I observed these bright craft, I thought that three fighters were trailing behind a tanker plane to refuel. However, I soon realized that none of the craft were lining up behind the tanker. In addition, these craft as a group did not form either a V or diamond or box pattern, which is required by military law. Instead, the three smaller craft seemed as if they were &quot;hotdogging,&quot; and at the rate of speed they were traveling and as close as they seemed grouped, this struck me as very dangerous. I watched these craft, scratching my head all the time, for three to five minutes until they disappeared over the mountain range. I later discussed this event with some of Air Force friends, but none of them did not see the event nor had they witnessed anything like it. This event prompted me to go out and by several books about UFO sightings. While paging through one of the books, I came across a chapter about &quot;mother ships,&quot; and that they had been observed to have smaller craft darting around them. As soon as I read that, I realized that that was what I had witnessed. I will admit that it&apos;s possible that three fighters were hotdogging around a tanker, but I guarantee you if the pilots had been caught, they! would h ave been court-martialed.  By the way, I was in the Air Force for eight years, and though I witnessed hundreds of all types of aircraft in the skies, I never saw an event like I did on that one particular day.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I shut the car door and the the object flared shortly and split into two equal sized objects. The two objects then headed quickly in opposite directions. One headed North the other headed South. The one headed North satyed visible for no more than one or one-and-one-half seconds. The object headed South was visible for as long as three seconds. The whole incedent took no more than 10 seconds.", "Dense , vertical, angular column of white light shines down in to my yard at 3:42 a.m. 3/28/01.I did not see the craft. I had let my beagle out in the back yard to go to the bathroom. It was cold so I closed the sliding glass door and cupped my hands and put my face againest the glass so I could see her in the yard.  It was dark, no moonlight,just a stray of light from the street lights from the front of the house.  I lost site of the dog and was straining to see when a hot white vertical column of light shone down into the yard over our two empty garden spots. The light shone in a very angular way.  First more square and then it elongated as it moved towards me and the house. So now it looks like a wall of white light as it expands towards me, almost like a door sliding open, and then it stops about 15 feet from the house and the back or the light moves forward and it becomes a column of light again, and then it is gone.  This all happened in 1-3 seconds.  My dog did not react to the light-I don&apos;t know if she saw it. The light was intensely white but did not shine outside it&apos;s boundaries and was as tall has I could see. You could not see through it. It moved very quickly and was gone.  Afterwards, as I tried to make it all logical, I thought it must be the coast guard helicopter. But as I slid open the door and stepped out to look up -I realized at the same time that I heard not a sound from anything. Not a copter, not a plane. It immediately frightend me and I stepped back in the house. But I was still trying to work it out.  I knew that a street light on the street behind us shone on and off every half a minute or so. I waited for it to come on and could not get the same effect-- I fogged up the glass door-several times- could not get the same effect when the street light came on. After this I woke my husband up and told him what had happened because it was so surreal. I never did see or try to see a craft after I became frightened.", "enormous silent craftMy brother and I went to a lake for some night fishing. It was the period just before it gets dark and my brother said look at this! I looked up and saw what looked like normal spotlights, there were 5 in a horizontal line. I thought nothing of it. I went back to fishing. He said hey look at this thing! I looked again, and now the lights were changing form- they went from a line to a 7 shape, to an L shape then to a cross type shape. I then began to pay attention to this. We couldnt see anything else at this point. The lights were above the treeline approx. 300 yards away.  It was a clear night, stars out, moon shining. All of a sudden, there was no sky above us. It was black. We could both feel what we can only describe as the field that exists between opposing magnets. It was weird. The craft then turned and some sky became visible again and at that point we could see the shape of this thing. It was like a 55 gallon drum that was cut lenghtwise and laid flat. This thing was huge. Like a city block huge. It made no noise, and aside from the &quot;spotlights&quot; we saw initially, it had no lights. We were scared beyond words. This thing was directly above our heads for what seemed like forever. It eventually just moved up and away at a very slow rate of speed and ascent. We left immediately after that, when we got home we told our family about it and called the Redding police to see if anyone else had seen or reported this. We declined to leave our names because we did not want to be associated with this in any way. Take this for what its worth- both of us saw what we saw, and to this day, I cannot stop looking at the sky. I am compelled to looking upward all the time. That image will stay with me until I pass. It was extremely frightening and definitely not of this world whatever it was.", "the ovel shape went faster then the jets , and could do moor movements of flightWE saw 3 jets in trianglur formation one in front and two on the sides  the oval was in the middle the jets slow down and the ovle shape shape , it turned around very fast . the jets broke formation  thay found it again then moor oval shape came  then thay left", "25 see metalic ball in the yorkshire moors.A large group of us were out camping on the moors. we had set up camp and had a fire and were up talking and drinking.One of the girls had a small fm radio and so a few less that sobre people were having a dance.

As soon as we passed it, it flew across the road in somewhat of an arch and then came up behind us and followed us at about tree-level.  It seemed to fly curved to its side instead of a straight path.  It followed us for about 2 or 3 miles getting closer than slowing down.

Still, to this day I am fully aware of what myself and four friends had seen. It was a warm, clear summer nigh&apos;s sky, no clouds or haze.  My friends and I were sitting in an area of a local cemetery, which borders a one-block area of homes, and then another cemetery.  We were sitting approximately 100 yards behind the cemetery fence at the entrance to a Family Mausoleum when I noticed a slowly moving, (almost hovering) object which appeared at what seemed to be directly over the fence of the other cemetery.  At first I thought the object was a helicopter slowly moving from right to left along the approximate fence area of the adjacent cemetery.  However, I then realized that there were no flashing (strobe) lights, nor was they&apos;re any sound at all.  Although, there was a very bright light (white/purple) at the center of object and one smaller illuminating light on each side of the center light. (At this time, no shape could be determined) We, at this time, moved to the fence area of the cemetery in which we were sitting.  By this time the object had moved slowly to about half way down the adjacent cemetery fence.  We all then realized that this was not a known aircraft of any sort.  The object was no more than 500 feet away from us at an approximate altitude of 75 feet in the air.  This was most apparent from the scaling of the homes that were between the cemetery, which we were in, and the cemetery fence, which the object was apparently following, and the tree line of the adjacent cemetery.  It was at this time I could just make out an outline of the object.  (The lights were so bright, that it was most difficult to see thru them).  I also realized that there was still no sound whatsoever. At this time, we all &quot;jumped&quot; the cemetery fence and ran as fast as possible around the end of the Block, (approximately 10 seconds) so that we could get even closer, if not under the object.  When we arrived, it was gone!  I visually searched the Sky and realized that there was nothing in sight, not even a distant airplane; the entire sky was void of craft.  Yet, it was clear starry night! I have created a digital rendering of what myself and my friends had seen that night which gives a good scale to go by.  A fist would have covered the object and one half at arms length when first viewed.

The two lights were moving from east to west and were moving very slowly.  The lights moved in a very exacting detial as if they were connected to each other, which would make it a extremely big object if we could have seen the super structure.  These object made no sound on its pass.  This was observed at the Deseret Ranch just east of the Orlando International Airport.  There are usually alot of plane traffic in this area.  But these objects did not display the standard navigation lights observed on airplane traffic and were flying to low for normal approach to the airport. 20 mins later observed a small airplane in the same general area but higher in altitude and you could clearly here the engines of this aircraft.

The object itself seemed to ba also made of white light, but the lights at the edges were brighter. The shape was hard to discern, as it seemed very high, about an inch between my fingers, and it glowed with light. The more amazing part to me is that, I had been reading about contact before I left my flat, and I had requested to be able to see &apos;someone&apos;. I first thought it to be a plane, but the lights did not seem correct. After seeing this thing, I watched it on and off overhead as I walked. Then I entered the building I was going to and felt satisfied that I had seen it, and walked in. I realize this may be explainable, and i would welcome opinions. Mir station? There is a US Army helicopter base in town, so I guess anything is possible. Although this thing gave me the impression that it was very far away. Almost as if it was in space.", "This was a round solid object like a chandelier with many tiny white lightsIt was a very cold January morning, approximately 4:30 am.  I was taking my husband to work.  It was on a road with little traffic during the day and none at that time of the morning.  There were areas of dense trees on either side of the roadway and large high tension electrical poles on one side of the road.  There was absolutely no traffic at that time of the morning.  As we rounded the bend to go into the main entrance to his worksite, we spotted an object that resembled a chandelier with many tiny white lights.  The moment I said, &quot;What the hell is that?&quot; the lights instantly turned red.  At that point it moved away from the electrical pole and slowly glided or drifted away.  I wanted to observe it further but my husband was in a rush to get to work on time.  After I dropped him off and went back out I tried to see if it was still there, but it wasn&apos;t.  It was definitely intelligently controlled, but did not feel threatened by it.  I was amazed and exhiliated.  It appeared to be approximately 25-30 feet in total diameter, in an oval or round shape with protrusions with white lights on it.  It was quite dramatic and beautiful.  I believe this object was a &quot;probe&quot; of some type.  As we approached it appeared to be absorbing power from the tension line.

It is thought provoking that it made its appreance in a wild and remote part of British Colombia.  Almost as if it didn&apos;t want to be seen.  Perhaps we will never know just what it was?  And again, maybe we will.  Anyway, it is something we can tell our grand kid&apos;s about.((paragraph deleted))((END CORRESPONDENCE))((NUFORC Note:  Date is corrected by witness.

I just came out of my office and spotted them in the distance...then called my husband to look.  This time they were more in line rather than a triangle at first.  They hovered or moved very slowly...turned slightly and faded out into the distance over the Plomosa Mountain range. I rushed back into the office and got my 7x50s and 20x50s binoculars to watch them with. Again these were extremely bright pulsating amber lights with on other color lights. After they first disappeared, I watched the mountain tops for any &quot;glow&quot; or trace of them if they reappeared.  They did briefly and were abit fainter as if further away...this time as an elongated triangle.  My husband got out his video camera hoping to catch them on film but was not able to.

I think it was heading north-east to east direction. It streaked and then just disappeared into nothing, no trace of anything in the sky.

After inspecting the house we walked the fenceline around the acreage and inspected the fence. After stopping for a short rest we continued on and back towards the house. By that time it was dark and once we returned to the house we signed papers with the landlord and he went on home. Living in the city at this time we decided to stay for abit to look at the stars and the milky way, it was getting cold so we were preparing to leave. I got into the car to warm it up and my wife came around and waited for me to unlock her door. Before she climbed in she looked up towards the sky again to take in the view and she called my name. I told her to hurry up and get in the car I was cold she asked if that was the ISS... I got out and looked for the light crossing the sky and she pointed me towards the southeast horizon. I thought to myself wow, finally I get to see it. I caught the light in my vision and watched it&apos;s ascent overhead. As the point of light ran across the sky we had to turn and look back the other direction, towards the northwest. As it streaked towards the northwest it stopped just above that horizon. Originally we believed we had just lost the object to our vision and we were now staring at a star or something we decided to head back home. My wife climbed back into the car, and I adjusted my Ham radio antenna from 40 to 75 meters. I turned back one more time and looked. To my suprise that &apos;star&apos; was moving back in the other direction. Back towards the South-South East. I yelled at my wife to come take a look. I didn&apos;t think the space station could manuever that way. The light or object stopped at 30 degrees from our position in the sky. We sat and watched it for about 5 more minutes and the light disappeared. We climbed back in the car and talked about it abit. We thought about what it might be, mayebe an airplane or helicopter but it was too far out and moved too fast to be either of those. And I know of no helicopter that can travel at that altitude or speed. The thing that appeared odd to me was the fact that it turned back and came about a third distance back across the sky and stopped. No space station or satellite I know of can do that.

I watched it cross the &quot;valley of the sun&quot; for an hour. At the time I was at work. My desk was next to a window on the second floor of a building that was situated on the side of South Mountain. From my vantage point I could see the entire valley for 20 miles in every direction except south. I could also see dozens of aircraft approach or depart Sky Harbor airport all day long. When I first saw the V-shaped silver craft approach from the west, I at first thought that it was a specially designed aircraft coming into Sky Harbor. I pointed it out to a co-worker and asked him what he thought it was. He didn&apos;t know. Strangely, as the craft neared Sky Harbor, it veered to the north and skirted the airport. Both my co-worker and myself wondered out loud about the craft and where it was going. Fortunately, as the craft continued to fly due east it got closer to us. It completely bypassed the airport and continued east. Though we couldn&apos;t make out details, we noticed that the V-shape of the craft began to change and warp. We then realized that we were probably witnessing a flock of silver-backed ducks. They eventually disappeared out of sight still heading east. I only mention this because it may have a bearing on the V-shaped silver craft that was witnessed at night flying over Phoenix just a week later. I did not see the night sightings because I was in bed, since I had to work an early shift. Though I had seen ducks in flight, I puzzled over why they were heading east. After all, this is a desert, and most migratory birds fly north and south. A week later I found my answer. Thirty miles due east of Phoenix there&apos;s a town called Fountain Hills. In the middle of this desert community there&apos;s a huge man-made lake. In the middle of this lake lies the world&apos;s tallest fountain. I drove out there. Once I got to the lake, there were hundreds of ducks, all species. Brown, black, white -- and sil! ver. I c annot confirm that the V-shaped craft many people witnessed that one night in March, 1997, was a flock of ducks -- but it&apos;s the truth that I saw them migrating during the day just a week prior. My experience might help provide a logical answer to why the V-shaped craft proceeded over Phoenix at such as slow rate of speed. Most people usually report UFO&apos;s flying at a high rate of speed. By the way, the V-shaped craft, if I recall correctly, was also flying east. I know that this explanation might prove disappointing to UFO enthusiasts, but not all UFO&apos;s are alien. Some are of earthly origin provided by mother nature herself.", "The object was not a airplane, or star, if anything it was some NASA satalite or a UFOMy Girl friend and I were laying on a sleeping bag watching the lights of a airplane fly low across the sky.

We had driven about 3/4 of a mile from the valleys edge and pulled off onto an approach into a field and  we all got out to observe the sky. We were all just standing there when all of a sudden , one of my nephews yelled out &quot;What the heck is that?&quot; We looked off into the northwesr sky &amp; at about a 10:00 position were two &quot;Starlike &quot; objects , rotating around each other at a high rate of speed.  They did this for a few rotations and then one object took off in a westerly direction and the second object  sped off at a high rate of speed in an Easterly direction. These objects were a very long way off and seemed to be mixed in with the stars.  The second object was heading east at a high rate of speed and then seemed to slow down and  drop into an arch, or half circle pattern,   until it rseemed to reach it&apos;s original path and then it accelerated rapidly again in an Easterly direction. It proceeded like this for a short distance and then dropped into that pattern again and then back up into it&apos;s original path. It carried on doing this until it eventually went out of sight in the Eastern sky. I had  binoculars with me and even with them it appeared to be nothing more than a star gone crazy.

My sister, myself and my niece were out looking at local christmas decorations.  When we had left the house I noticed a Bright star in the sky, it being Christmas I naturally thought it was the north star, yet it seemed extremely bright.  I have been a star gazer all my life and the night sky was clear and this star was the brightest object in the sky, I couldn&apos;t help but keep watching it.  I had pointed it out to my sister and we kept looking for it has we drove around.  About 30-45 minutes into our trip the object was still in the sky, like a star, it hadn&apos;t appeared to move it was high in the sky like a star and stayed in this one spot the whole time.  Then I noticed what appeared to be a plane coming closer to the object, I made a joke that there was a plane checking out this star. There was just a tiny green light in the sky like the green lights on a plane, it appeared to be approaching the star, then there was a red light that appeared below the green light also like a plane, I commented again that there was a second plane checking it out.  Then the lights both the green and red light got brighter and then it became apparent that they were a part of this star.  They appeared to rotate like the object was turning sideways and we were seeing the bottom of it.  The green light the red light and the bright white light together formed a perfect triangle.  I was amazed and told my sister and niece to look.  It slowly rotated around and then it streaked across the sky, faster than anything I had ever seen.  Then to our surprise it suddenly stopped,  it was on the horizon just above the tree line.  It slowly moved across the night sky, now only the white light was visible.  Then it went dark, then dim, the a bright flash and the 3 lights appeared again,  we were dumfounded. Like it&apos;s going to show us again.  We had continued to drive the whole time, this object had never left our sight we decided to roll down the windows to see if we could hear anything, there was no sound! . At the speed this thing had moved we knew there would be a sonic boom, but there was nothing. Then the 3 lights that made the triangle appeared and it streaked off again, this time going out of sight.  I couldn&apos;t believe what I had just seen.  I felt really strange, knowing if I ever told this story I would be looked upon like I was crazy.  I have always been a believer in UFO&apos;s but to see one was unbelieveable even to myself.  If my sister and her daughter had not also seen it no one would have ever believed us.  Actually I don&apos;t think anyone believes us anyway. I am an avid watcher of UFO television specials, and until last night when I watched &quot;Lights over Illinois&quot; I had never seen anything that compared to what I had seen.  The object that they described in that show was so close to what I had seen I think it even convinced my husband that I had actually seen something.  The description that they gave sounded like me telling my story to my husband almost 5 years ago.  He himself was amazed at how their stories had sounded like mine.  This is the first time I have said anything about this other than to my closest friends and family.

He&apos;s an avid sky watcher now that we&apos;ve moved to Arizona. He had his binoculars and pointed to this red point of light that appeared to be stationary in the northwestern sky. As I looked through the bino&apos;s I could tell that whatever it was was very high in altitude and was moving fast, not slow. It was traveling east. As it got directly above us it made a 90 degree turn north, went on for 3 seconds then dissapeared.

We had an unobstructed view out the front windshield of the car--a wide horizon.  We saw a single blue light travel from the far left to the far right raising in altitude.  The light took about 30 seconds to travel that distance, about 2-3 times faster than a commercial jet would move, and then disappear to the far right.  We estimate that it travelled at approximately 5-10,000 feet, where you usually see private aircraft fly at.

It appears as a regular star from a quick look, but once you take the time to watch closely you can clearly see how intense the light coloration can be.  I recently aquired a long range telescope for Xmas so i decided to put it to good use.  As i adjusted the lense on my telescope i noticed two distinct rings around the object.  The object was luminating so brightly that it formed an outer ring around itself. It was very clear that the object was rotating very fast.  The upper half of the circle rotated to the right, and the lower half of the object rotated to the left.  The rings had a tendency to wave against eachother as if they were on some type of axis.  The object was moving at a fast rate from one side of my lense to the other.  I also had to adjust my lense down because the object was moving farther away.  The lights of the object were in very distinct colors of red, green , blue, white, and a slight orange.  The objects movements were very sporatic in the way it moved from left to right at a high rate of speed. This object has been seen by myself and my mother for quite some time now for at least a year and a half i have made various attempts to contact observatories and other support systems and have received no response or cooperation. I truly hope that this creates some type of interest and investigation.((NUFORC Note:  We suspect this may be a description of the star, &quot;Sirius.&quot;  Just a guess.

My husband was getting ready to go to bed when he yelled at me to look at all of the airplanes flying by.  When I went in to look at the planes, facing the north, I glanced through the window that faces west.  There was an odd shaped bright light.  When it started bobbing around, I got my videw camera and started taking pictures.  It danced around, disappeared, came back, and came so close the first time that I got a stunning look at it.  It was round, except at the very bottom, it looked flat.  It had two lines through the middle, a round circle in the center of the paralell lines, and an emblem in the middle of the circle.  There were designs on the top and bottom parts.  I viewed this for about 5 seconds, then it gradually moved away and across the trees, then into a bright ball again, going further away.  It had a dark side and a bright side.  When it was bright, there would be a jagged streak of light moving upward, dimming the bottom part as it went.  After it dimmed, it would then get smaller.  It bobbed around, disaappeared and did all sorts of things for several minutes.  Then the dark side got very close and was very large.  It had the same markings on that side as the bright side.  There were red, yellow and orange lights that I could not figure out.  It came very close 3 times before it finally disappeared.  I have great movies of this.  What do I do with them.  I would love for someone to see them.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke by telephone with this witness, and found her to be a good witness.

It has been determined (through a comparison test with similar video equipment) that most of the 75 minute video was the planet Venus taken at the  &apos;infinity&apos; setting.

She told me the next morning that she observed a metallic looking object that was oval or egg shaped hovering low over the city.  The object appeared to &quot;sense&quot; that it was being observed, because it suddenly accelerated at fantastic speed in a Southern direction, disappearing from sight within a few short seconds (Much too fast for any normal aircraft).

The color dropped off in a gradient, brightest in the center and progressively dimmer towards the boundary of the diamond shape. The diamond shape was thinner in width than in height. It hovered, and moved non-linearly. The size was approximately the diameter of a cigarette at arms length. While I was watching the object, I had a feeling like I knew where it was going to move, or that it was moving in such a way as to manifest my expectations. At this point I got very agitated, and went into the next room to wake up a friend.

I was twelve or thirteen (26 now) and my sister was eight or nine (22 now). My mother and her live-in boyfriend both worked third shift so they would leave the apartment at about 23:30 or so. They would leave the door locked, the living room light on and the TV going so people wouldn&apos;t try to bother us. I was awoken at probably around 00:00 or so for some reason. I didn&apos;t know why but it felt that I shouldn&apos;t be asleep. I kept having the feeling that something was outside or nearby that shouldn&apos;t be. I still fell asleep though. My sister came into my room at probably 01:00 or maybe later, but it was still nighttime and my mother still wasn&apos;t home.

I mumbled that she could sleep with me. Then, not too long after she woke me up again and she was crying now. She had supposedly seen a blue beam of light CREEP in through the window, touch the wall next to my bed, mere inches from us, then slowly ascend the wall. When it hit the thermostat it darted out of the room and she claimed to smell burning paper or wood. Despite wanting to know what happened and being scared, I fell back asleep. In the morning she told me grammy had come into my room and asked my sister to go with her. My sister asked: &quot;To heaven grammy?&quot; to which the apparition chuckled somewhat darkly and said: &quot;Not exactly.&quot; My sister couldn&apos;t remember anything after that until waking up. As I got older I began to become interested in many things, UFOs and the paranormal among the subjects and as I learned how many different ways aliens and supernatural forces come into contact with us, I couldn&apos;t help but wonder if this wasn&apos;t some kind of alien contact.

They were no more than 500 feet above my house. I immediately got out the binoculars and the &apos;lights&apos; proved to be nothing more that road flares suspended under baloons. The flare was too bright to be seen itself but it clearly showed the five or six baloons above it. Both my kids and the wife were able to see the object for what it was. Due to the height of these objects I would guess that they are being launched within 1/4 mile of the house. They generally drift eastward, but I have seen one headed west. We look forward to these launches because for the 20 minutes or so that the flares burn they will travel two to three miles away and up to a height of over 2000 feet. The only issue I have with these pranks is that the winds usually take these object into the northbound landing flight zones of the Phoenix airport. Dull as it sounds, that&apos;s all there is.

I was amazed to see that the time, date and location of one of the sightings listed on your site is almost the same as my sighting. I am a ((senior aviation specialist)) in Ontario, Canada. I and my friend ((name deleted)) were in the air at the time of the Feb. 26th, 1998 sighting above, that was reported near Ontario, NY. We too had a sighting. We had departed from the Oshawa airport and were flying on an eastward heading of about 080 degrees, eventually passing just north of St. Andrews, which is just west of Cornwall Ontario, Canada. ((name deleted)) tapped me on the shoulder, pointed out the window to my right and said,&quot;what&apos;s that?&quot; I saw an object that looked like the underside of a massive metal bowl with multi-coloured lights on it. This thing was much, much, larger than our airplane (a Piper Cherokee 180) and appeared to be tagging along with us at the same altitude (5500-ft.) about 5 nautical miles off of our port side wing. There were several different coloured lights on the object, some of which are not used in aviation at all. They pulsed from left to right slowly, dimmed out, then pulsed from right to left. The color pattern from left to right was: GOLD-RED-BLUE-GREEN-GOLD, then from right to left: GREEN-GOLD-BLUE-RED-GOLD. When the lights were not on, the thing looked semi-transparent. You could see the outline of it, yet it appeared to me that you could see right through it at the same time. I was very excited to see something like this, but at the same time quite upset and afraid because I was unsure of what is was or might do. ((name deleted)) and I were quiet for what seemed like quite a while, just watching this thing, then I decided to call Dorval Terminal in Montreal, Quebec. I said, &quot;Dorval terminal, this is Cherokee 180&quot;; (I&apos;m holding my callsign until I know what is going to happen with this information). &quot;Cherokee 180 good evening, Dorval Terminal.&quot;. &quot;We are on a VFR cross-country flight plan, passing just north of the town of St. Andrews on an eastbound heading and have traffic to the south of us at the same altitude.

It doesn&apos;t look like an aircraft. It&apos;s got multi-coloured lights on it that go from left to right and back again and it looks bigger than a 747. It&apos;s massive.&quot;  &quot;Cherokee 180, how long have you been in the air?&quot;  &quot;Dorval terminal, we&apos;ve been up here for a few hours.&quot;  Maybe you should land and stretch your legs for awhile, maybe take a break.&quot;  &quot;Negative Dorval, we&apos;d like to keep going if that&apos;s O.K. with you, but you don&apos;t know what that is we&amp;#8217;re seeing?&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;Maybe it&amp;#8217;s a u.f.o. Cherokee 180! Ha! Ha!&amp;#8221; I was upset and annoyed at the attitude of the controller, because Stan and I both were seeing that thing and the tower was denying it being there. I didn&amp;#8217;t think it was a joke. &amp;#8220;O.K. Cherokee 180, call us again in another 10 minutes&amp;#8221;. &amp;#8220;Roger, Dorval. Cherokee 180 checks remarks&amp;#8221;. I said, &amp;#8220;Stan whatever that thing is out there, it doesn&amp;#8217;t matter right now. We&amp;#8217;ve got to pay attention to our aircraft and flight plan right now, so let&amp;#8217;s do that.&amp;#8221; We resumed our time keeping and navigating. The next time we looked out the window, the object was gone. I asked Stan how he felt about seeing something like that and he said he felt sort of scared. I said, &amp;#8220;me too&amp;#8221;. I contacted Dorval terminal and they gave me a VOR radial (a navigational frequency) to track outbound, away from they&amp;#8217;re airspace. I set up the VOR receiver with the proper radial selected and began trying to track it outbound as requested. The needle twitched from left to right and no matter how hard I tried to hold my heading, no matter what I did, I was unable to keep the needle in the center. I tried the second VOR receiver. Same thing. &amp;#8220;They were working when I tested them a few hours ago!&amp;#8221;, I thought to myself. I knew that Stan had no idea what a VOR was and what was happening, so I tried not to draw his attention to the problem. I looked outside for the object we had seen earlier, but there was nothing there. I had a look at my VNC (VFR Navigational Chart) and set myself a new course for our destination in Quebec. The ceiling started coming down and a call to the local FSS (Flight Service Station) revealed that the weather was below VFR minimums where we were headed. Also, I was amazed to see that the fuel gauges read only &frac14; of a tank on either side! I remembered passing a small airport a short while ago and decided to find it on the map, turn back and land there. I asked FSS if there was fuel available there and they said they&amp;#8217;d have someone waiting for us. We found and identified the airport quite easily, made the appropriate radio calls and landed safely. I had the tanks filled to the rim on both sides before we left Oshawa. I had been running the engine at &amp;#8220;best-lean&amp;#8221;, to conserve fuel and get reasonable power, so I was surprised to see how much fuel had been used. I&amp;#8217;d never noticed this plane to have had such high fuel consumption before. It was as if we&amp;#8217;d been in the air a lot longer than we actually had been. We couldn&amp;#8217;t find anyone to buy fuel from when we arrived at there, so we called FSS and asked them if they had any ideas. They said that we&amp;#8217;d have to go to another nearby airport, about 15 miles away. I was told I&amp;#8217;d get fuel there for sure. Neither of us had enough money for a hotel for the night and cab fare to and from it, so we considered our options. At the time, Quebec had recently experienced an ice storm and was recuperating from downed power-lines, blocked roads and even food shortages in some areas. The temperature was probably between &amp;#8211;15 to &amp;#8211;20 degrees Celsius, so waiting in the plane all night was not an option either; we had to fly. Again I planned the route to our new destination and we took off. Enroute to our new destination I was in constant contact with Dorval Terminal and they gave me some vectors (directions/headings) to help out along the way. The fuel was running out fast and I told Dorval that I didn&amp;#8217;t think I was going to make it. Stan heard this in his headset and must have been terrified, but he said nothing. For some strange reason, I wasn&amp;#8217;t worried. All the events leading up until the end were so surreal. Dorval told me that I should see the airport soon and sure enough, there it was. I had to fight a crosswind like I&amp;#8217;d never experienced before. On final approach, I had such a great deal of crab (wind correction) in that it seemed as if we were flying at almost a 70-degree angle to the runway. As we got closer to the runway, the wind strength died off considerably and I was able to use the rudder to get more in line for our landing. There were fire and foam trucks, the local police and the Chief Pilot of one of the FBO&amp;#8217;s at the airport, waiting for us. We landed normally and taxied in. Along the taxiway, the engine started sputtering and when I went to do my shutdown checklist, the engine quit before I had a chance to pull out the mixture control. The firemen walked over to the plane as Stan and I got out. One of them took the fuel cap off and said something in French. Stan told me that he&amp;#8217;d said, &amp;#8220;there&amp;#8217;s nothing in there&amp;#8221;! One of the firemen asked me in english what my name was, and when I told him, everybody including the police and Chief Pilot was roaring with laughter. I imagine the reason for that is that my last name is almost the same to the letter as a pilot who flew across the Atlantic in a single engine plane without knowing if he&amp;#8217;d make it or not. We got our fuel, had a bite to eat, I got the Chief Pilot to stamp my logbook and we set out to return to Oshawa. The trip back was uneventful and we landed with&amp;#8230;..plenty of fuel!??! I&amp;#8217;m not sure what happened that night, or if any of the events were connected, but I know what I saw. I haven&amp;#8217;t stopped thinking about our sighting and certainly have kept it quiet in commercial circles. I&amp;#8217;ve told a few people, but they all think I&amp;#8217;m either making it up, or that I&amp;#8217;ve got something wrong with me. I&amp;#8217;ve given up talking to people who are ignorant. I&amp;#8217;m ready to talk to someone that believes me, but I&amp;#8217;m still afraid of being ridiculed. I&amp;#8217;m not sure what to do, but it seems to be bothering me more than usual lately. Also, for some reason I keep having this vivid picture in my head of turning directly toward this object and flying in that direction. When I get the image of this in my head, I feel sick, distressed and the tears start coming out. I don&amp;#8217;t know why. I&amp;#8217;m starting to get worried about it.((NUFORC Note:  I will remove all the spurious computer glitches at a later time.  I can&apos;t get all of them tonight.  PD))", "((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Location could be &quot;Pineville.&quot;  ??  PD))Fast moving ball of light that can move at right angles.First,  I need to tell you that I really feel funny giving you a report that had happened  to me more than 10 years ago. The only reason I am giving you this &quot;report&quot; now  is that I feel compelled to do so after I had heard a very similar report on an Art Bell program in June of 1999.  This report was given by, I believe, a pilot who had witnessed this at night near or in some wooded area that either he lived in or was camping near.  Sorry, I don&quot;t remember the exact details except for his description of the object that he saw.  I was getting ready to be married in August of 1999 so I just procrastinated on getting this report to you. My story.  In October of 1990 I went hunting with three other hunting partners about 30 miles east of Prineville, Oregon in the Ochoco national forrest..  We made camp in an area that was fairly open and not too close to trees so we could avoid the risk of setting the area on fire from our much needed campfire.  We found an open area that seemed perfect for camping with a nice view of the surrounding  countryside.   The terrain of this area is somewhat mountainous but is a  combination of  tall pine and lots of open areas which is also fine for hunting.  East of the camp is the ridgeline of mountains that make up parts of the Ochoco national forrest and to the North is one of the main highways that run out of Prineville.  This highway runs parallel to a  river (the Crooked River, I believe), which runs east to west  through a canyon. On our second night there we had finished supper and were getting ready to get some sleep.  My other hunting buddies had already gone to  the tent to &quot;turn in&quot;  while I was standing by the campfire finishing up a cup of tea ( I have to add this part about the tea because, to be honest with you, when I hear of UFO reports coming from hunters I really wonder how much they have had to drink when they see these things).  Anyway,  a few minutes passed and I was still standing by the campfire looking east towards the top of the mountain range  when I saw a very bright bluish-white light traveling at a very high rate of speed above the treeline. .  It was travelling downwords,  heading due north at about a 25 to 35 degree angle.   It seemed to be leaving a &quot;trail of light&quot; behind it , but I think that was more of an optical illusion that  it created because of the speed it was travelling and the intensity of the light. When I first saw this object I thought that is was a meteorite.  I couldn&apos;t tell anything about it&apos;s size or how far away it was from me because, at that point,  I didn&apos;t have anything to reference it to.   It was definately between the mountain range and our camp but that only narrowed it down to be no more than four miles away maximum. It wasn&apos;t until it &quot;travelled&quot; down towards the highway that I could make a reference to how far away it was from me (about a half mile, I guess).  When it got down to the highway I thought I would hear an explosion or something, but it just made a right turn and headed east up the highway.   When I say right turn , I mean &quot;right turn&quot;.  There was no slowing down or anything. There was no &quot;easing&quot; into a turn like an aircraft would do but just a right angle turn. Then as the object headed east it &quot;lit&quot; up the whole area.  Before,  when a car or truck would travell on the highway at night we could just barely see the glow of the headlights because of the distance we were from them, but when this object went down to the highway and headed east it just lit up the whole canyon   I mean,  you could see every detail just like it was daylight except it had  more of  bluish hue to the light,  kind of like an arc welder. It was completely silent.  It made no sound at all, not even a sonic boom. Judging from the time it took from  near the mountain top and by the time it had arrived at the highway not more than 4 seconds had gone by.  That means that it had travelled about a mile per second.  When it continued to travel east it took another two or three seconds before it was gone and out of sight. After all this had happened I yelled over to my hunting buddies about the bright light that I had just seen but got a response about it was probably was a meteorite (yeah,  right!).  I stayed up for another few minutes hoping it would come back or another one might show up, but it never did. The campfire had burned down to glowing embers and to be honest I was getting just a little &quot;spooked&quot; standing out there by myself  so I decided to head to the tent to get some sleep. One of my buddies was still awake so I told him what had happened but I didn&apos;t know if he was really believing the story of what I had just witnessed. Anyway,  not much else was said and we decided to get some sleep. I was so &quot;wired&quot; I just couldn&apos;t think about anything except what I had just seen.  Then the really weird part happened.  While laying there sorting out what I had just seen,  a pack of coyotes started &quot;yipping and yelping&quot; and making the typical coyote noise that they usually make. But this was coming from just east of our camp (you know, from the direction of the UFO).    It got so loud that everyone of us was up.  I always carry a side arm and I was &quot;ready&quot;  if  the coyotes were going to go  bezerk or something. I really thought that they might try to get in the tent. They continued making this comotion as they ran just outside our camp and headed west. I don&apos;t know if this coyote incident  was related to  what I had seen,  but in my many years of hunting and camping I have never had something like pack of coyotes come into a camp like that  with a fire still smoldering. It really did seem like something spooked them. I know that they always try to avoid human contact at almost any price. I didn&apos;t bring up the incident again but a couple of weeks later one of my hunting buddies said that he had read an article in the paper ( The Oregonian) about the &quot;light&quot; that was apperently reported by some other witnesses that were in the area.  Well... I did feel a little more credible.    I never did try to look for the article so I can&apos;t say for certain when it was in there, but it would have been in the paper the last half of October, 1990. I used to be an avid hunter, but that was the last ime that I went and I&apos;ve never had the desire to go hunting again. End of my story.....I hope!

LOCATION: Charlotte County (northern southwest Florida, on the Gulf of Mexico). EVENT: I was outside my home, returning from my mailbox and spotted a contrail in progress above my location. There were other contrails in the sky nearer the horizon, some criss-crossing. With the unaided eye, the size of the contrail was about half the width of a pencil at arm&apos;s length, with an elongated object about half the size of a pencil tip traveling in front of it. What was unusual was that the object was displaying a single reddish-orange glow or light along its length. I rushed and got a pair of binoculars and observed that the object appeared to be a conventional looking passenger or cargo jet, except for one big difference: its fuselage, at least the underside portion observable to me on the ground, was glowing or radiating a uniform bright reddish-orange color (not a point of light, but the entire length of the fuselage). The wings were normal in appearance, not glowing or lighted, and appeared, from the great distance, to be white, tan, or gray. Two contrails were forming a short distance behind the aircraft, which then combined into a single contrail (a normal occurrence). The aircraft was traveling southward along the Gulf Coast of Florida, yet slightly inland. The nearest international airport it could have flown out of is in Sarasota, and then north of that, in Tampa, where there is also a major headquarters-status  U.S. Air Force base (the Gulf War was managed from there). Since the sun was still above the treetops and there was no evidence of any sunset activity in the sky (even if there was, the aircraft would have needed a mirrored  fuselage to reflect the level of light seen), I lowered my binoculars and rushed inside the open side door to my garage to get a video camera I keep on a shelf and back outside. I timed it after the event and my eyes were off the aircraft only 8 seconds. When I looked back up in the sky, all I saw was the contrail cut off in its tracks where I had seen it last and no aircraft. I searched with my binoculars and couldn&apos;t locate any evidence of it, which should have still been visible. I wish now I had kept observing the jet with the binoculars for those 8 seconds. Was what I saw an exotic new U.S. stealth aircraft fitted with a skin of light panels that could allow it to blend into the sky upon activation, or is there a conventional explanation?

Most importantly was it&apos;s movement - it would move quickly from right to left or up and down (or vice versa) and then come to a dead stop before immediately dashing off in another direction at a 45 degree angle. This was observed by my college roommate and myself while we attended Grand Valley State College in Allendale, MI (near Grand Rapids).

I thought at first it might be an illusion, because we were driving, but then my roommate (who was the driver) mentioned it to me.

It remained pretty stationary for the few moments we watched, then I decided to get the video camera.

As I was video taping my son noticed a second light identical to the first to the south of the first. Moments later as I turned my attention to the second light, there was a third to appear, right in the center of the first two.  All appeared to be at different altitudes. But all three lights had the same overall appearance from a distance, and all three lights are exactly the same shape on the closeups, and all have the exact same characteristics.

I originally described this object as some sort of fire ball moving across the western sky into the south in a continuous arching fashion.  I previously mentioned that I had fortunately grabbed my digital video camera and tapped this strange event .  I have viewed the tape over and over in slow motion frame by frame.  This object resembles a golden sphere that sometimes can be seen quite clearly. Unfortunately a was excited as hell and could not hold the camera perfectly still.

Highly educated and professional standing people that I presented it to have no clue what it is, however, together they all agree that it is definately eerie.

I spoke to the shift manager and he had said that there were no reports of trouble in the air earlier that morning. I described to him what I had on tape and he came up with expanations such as a meteor or a plane burning surplus fuel.  I see alot of aircraft in this area and they make noise, even high up in the statosphere.  This did not make a sound. I even went sofar as to record aircraft and a star from the same window last night to see how they would compare to my original fireball/sphere recording. NOT EVEN CLOSE!

To my complete shock and bewilderment an object which looked like a star at first on closer observation was moving around rapidly within a small vector of space, not alot but enought that you could see tracers where the object was moving from and going to, like a fly around an invisible light. It looked unbeleiveable. I immediatly expressed my disbelief at what I saw. My pale faced friend then pointed out a second bright star not to far from the first light and this light was a bit different than the fist. This one had blue and red lights on the bottom of the bright light and they were pulsing on and off slowly. My friend then pointed out the third and final anomlous light and this one seemed to have a spot light that was scaning the horizontal airspace around it as it was in the air. As well there seemed to be a haze around and behind the lights kind of like a really really faint aroura borealis around each one. I dont know how long they were there for before 03:00 but i observed them for 1 half of an hour, before i went and did something else. Later in the morning just before the sun was coming up I looked for the anomilous stars or lights and they had moved on or i could not see them because it was getting brighter.", "At about 21:30 this evening, I observed six orange lights in the eastern sky over Rockford, IL.At about 21:30 this evening, I observed six orange lights in the eastern sky.  I was standing in my driveway which is roughly ten miles southwest of Rockford, IL, and saw six lights low on the horizon over Rockford.  They were orange in color, about the size of a bright star and looked to be almost stationary.  They were in what appeared to be two, side by side trianglar formations, with three lights in each formation.  The light to my extreme right started blinking rapidly much in the manner of a stobe light.  After about three to five miniutes, the lights faded to black while moving slightly to my left.  They seemed to be moving away from me to the east or northeast.  Channel 17 News (WTVO) at Ten (22:00)reported that lights were being seen over Rockford, including one report of &quot;a light hovering over North Main street.&quot;((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at some length, and he seemed to be an exceptionally capable observer.

I estimate objects at about 15 miles from williams gateway airport at about 20-30 degrees from where I was standing-except for the one which was close to the ground.  Sighting occurred in the desert.  Pretty flat, and farmers fields all around.(schnepf farms) is pretty close. No mountains around the lights, and no military ranges.

It&apos;s speed was rather slow, like a conventional aircraft, however it moved in the form of an arc across the sky, then proceeded Eastbound.  The intensity of the light was still bright even when it was several miles away.  I could not make out a shape of the object, other than that remembled a round orb.

I used to live in Darby,Montana about 7 years ago. One night while a friend, and myself sat around a camp fire, I saw something different than I have ever seen before. I am not sure exactly what it was. I was looking up at the night sky, and saw what looked like stars moving. These objects seemed to be pretty high up in the sky, so I really could not give details about what shape they were, etc. They just looked like stars moving very fast. They were all moving in pretty much a straight line at first. I watched these things moving, and told my friend to look. We were both kind of wondering what this could be because we had never seen such a thing before. The objects appeared to be fluttering, kind of shaking rapidly as they moved. I grabbed a flashlight, and beamed them, and then one branched off. The others went on in the same straight line. I kept my eyes on the one that branched off, and after a minute or two lost it behind a tree. My friend, who is the toughest guy I know went inside with his eyes wattering! I just wanted to share this with you because it was pretty unusual.I remember at first thinking these might be satellites, but I am not sure that a satellite can flutter, and make a ninety degree turn in the sky! I wonder if anyone else has had similar experiences. What I saw was not to spectacular, but pretty unusual. Not sure of exact date and time.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

But no one else was the least bit surprised by it.  It had an inscription on the side as it hovered by... it took me a very long time to read it but it turned out it was english!  As it hovered just a few hundred feet above our heads I could make out &quot;Good...&quot; then as my eyes focused &quot;..Year&quot;.  It said &quot;GoodYear&quot; on it.  I peered deeper into the craft and could make out a small figure inside running the entire craft.  How it was able to hover just above our head without wings, I do not know.  It was almost like it could fall at anytime.  I ran into a near by bar to tell everyone there, they were all excited and rushed out.  But the second they laid eyes on it they threw their arms down and went back to drinking.  There was a flashing light on the bottom of it.  I knew that had to be the reason for everyones immeadiate dismissal of the craft.  I don&apos;t know why it wasnt working on me, but every single person I went to looked at it, and almost instantaneous laughed or giggled and paid no more attention to it.  Theses ufo&apos;s are getting more sophisticated.  It was almost like everyone had seen it a thousand times... could it be that since we are having more and more encounters that the extraterrestials have resorted to mind control?  I&apos;m not sure it was the flashing light, perhaps it was the script on the side of the vessel, perhaps the combination of the words &quot;Good&quot; and &quot;Year&quot; are some type of code words that allow extraterrestials to bypass our natural instinct of fear!  Again I am not sure as to way these words had no effect to me, but it could all go back to the creations of man, maybe we&apos;re some type of hybrid monkey that the extraterrestials used as slaves and as we developed we became more modernized and fearful so they had to implant genes into our gene pool to assure us as potential slaves for future use just in case their newly appointed slaves arent as useful as we once were.", "Black Cylinder object seen in the French quarter of New OrleansI was walking down Iberville St. towards Bourbon St. at est. time of 1845hrs CST.

I was thinking to myself, &quot;no way, this can&apos;t be happening.&quot; And continued to stare at the object to prove myself wrong of it&apos;s side to side motion. I went outside in my backyard and watched it fly over my house. It seemed to be in the shape of a triangle because of the white lights at the front point of it and on each end of what would be it&apos;s wings. On the bottom, there were two red lights that seemed to be pulsating and made a quiet humming sound. I tried to analyze it as best as I could so I would then be able to confirm to myself, that it was only a plane. But I was unable because of a glare or something from the white lights.

Maybe some new Govt aircraft. I called EVV and talked to ATC. No reports of low flying aircraft. Our house lies under the approach pattern for aircraft from the south-however we are 6 miles south of the airport-much too far for an aircraft to be at an altitude of 40-60 feet. There are too many power lines for it too have been a hanged-glider, plus it was dark. That would have been suicide.", "ufo came from thu8nderstormMy brother and I traveled to Hobbs, N.M. from Lovington,N.M. after a line thunderstorm had passed through. When we got to our aunt&apos;s house ,it was early evening and the storms were producing a lot of beautiful lightining over Seminole,Tx,approximatly 30 mile to the east. I saw what I thought was an aircraft landing light coming from the direction of the storm.I commented to my brother how fast it seemed to be moving, I said &quot;this is going to be loud&quot; because it seemed to be moving at a high sub-sonic speed. It passed about 3/4 of a mile to our south with no sound. at our south it appeared to be triangle shaped( a red light on the &quot;nose&quot; and a green light on the tail)I still thought it was an aircraft until it passed another 20 degrees to the west. at that time it appeared that the back was a triangle but there were three lighits that followed eachother around the outside of the triangle. it quickly dis appeared beyond the roofs of the houses.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I am a graduate civil engineer and I was employed as an upper level engineer by an international engineering-construction company who had transferred me from the Trans Alaska Pipeline to this nuclear power project in New Jersey. I was on the interstate bridge that crossed the Mississippi River driving east near sunset on Saturday, February 14, 1976, in Memphis, Tennessee.  This was the first time I had seen the Mississippi River.  As I was taking in the sights, I noticed a large &quot;structure&quot; in the distance that was slowly revolving and had slowly pulsing lights, much like a communication tower but it was too broad, it was rotating and it had multi-colored pulsing lights.  That caught my eye.  I was looking east at the &quot;structure&quot; away from the sunset so it was hard to see the mass of the &quot;structure&quot;. The portion of the &quot;structure&quot; I could see was about a thousand feet above the ground.  The &quot;structure&quot;  (defined by a dim outline and the pulsing lights) made a precise vertical rise of an estimated 200-300 hundred feet and then a precise vertical descent of about the same distance.  At this point I was straining to see what supported this &quot;structure&quot; that was making this precise movement.  I could not see any mass or structural support under the portion defined by the dim outline of the &quot;objec&apos;s&quot; mass and the pulsing lights.  I realized then this was not a &quot;structure&quot; but it was an &quot;object&quot; and there was nothing supporting it.  It then began an exact horizontal movement to the west for a few hundred feet and then an exact horizontal movement to the east. I decided to get off the interstate and get directly underneath the &quot;object&quot; to get a better look at it and to confirm to myself there was no structural support from the ground.  As I was exiting the interstate, the &quot;object&quot; began an exact horizontal move to the west.  The&quot;objec&quot; moved slowly at first, then accelerated at an astonishing rate of speed toward the west until it disappeared from sight. The sun was still visible in the west.  The speed of its departure was so quick that I was still on the exit ramp while watching it disappear in the distance.  I heard no sound from its departure nor did I see any evidence of propulsion devices. I later performed a calculation to estimate the average speed at which the &quot;object&quot; departed.  I estimate that the time it took to travel from a standstill until it disappeared from sight in the west was at least 2 seconds but not more than 4 seconds.  The visibility was at least 100 miles and probably more.  That means the AVERAGE speed the &quot;object&quot; traveled in this distance was at least 90,000 mph and possibly 180,000 mph.  If the visibility was 200 miles, these speeds would be doubled to 180,000 mph minimum and possibly 360,000 mph. Description of &quot;object&quot;  The mass of the &quot;object&quot;; was difficult to see when I was viewing it in the east and it departed so quickly that I only viewed the mass for a few seconds.  However, this is what I saw.  The &quot;object&quot;; was disc shaped.  I estimate its girth at 300-400 feet.  The thickness at the middle of the disc was around 100 feet.  I believe the &quot;object&quot;; to be circular at its girth as it was slowly rotating without any change in its outline.  It had multi-colored slowly pulsing lights (yellow, green, and red) on its girth and elsewhere on the mass. I continued traveling on the interstate for a few more hours and spent the night a couple of hundred miles east of Memphis, Tennessee.  I could not obtain a copy of any of the Memphis newspapers to find out if the sighting was reported and published. I have not been back to Memphis since then, but I always hoped to be able to return there some day and research the archive newspapers to read about the sighting. With the advent of the Internet, I performed a search for UFO sightings on the 2/14/76 date to see if someone else had witnessed and recorded the sighting.  The only information I found was about a UFO Crash near Cubatao River, Brazil 2/14/76 recorded by ((a well-known UFO investigator)).  At the rate of speed I observed the &quot;object&quot; to be capable of traveling, it could very easily have traveled from Memphis to Brazil in a few minutes.  I tried to find out more information about the crash in Brazil but to date I have been unsuccessful. I certainly would appreciate a response from anyone who (or knows of anyone who) experienced the Memphis, Tennessee UFO, or who knows about the Brazil UFO crash. I hope to hear from someone.", "((NUFORC Note:  We do not know whether the witness means 06JA01, or the morning of 07JA01.  We will attempt to clarify the precise date and time.

I was 20 years old at the time, home for summer after my sophomore year at UNC-CH. Considering the time period, it is important to note that I did not use drugs and drank very rarely.   We lived in the semi-country, about 1.5 miles from the Greensboro Airport.   I had just walked into the edge of the woods  to burn our trash in the burn-barrel.  As I came out of the woods, I saw a disk with a diameter of about 20 feet silently rotating just off my right side.  It was 30 to 40 feet off the ground and had alternating flat red and white lighted panels around its sides.  I stood there literally frozen for at least a minute watching the red and white lights as they slowly and silently rotated.  My German Shepherd sat down transfixed.  When I had the wherewithal to return to the house, I had to call him several times to come with me.  I went inside to call my father (no one was at home at the time), and my dog remained on the back porch steps, still transfixed.  Several minutes later when I went back outside, the disk had disappeared.  My dog, an excellent watchdog, never barked once. I can still vividly recall that night.  There is no doubt in my mind what I saw.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We have arbitrarily assigned a date.  PD))", "I was traveling north on Rte 91 home to VT on the evening of 12/26/00 at about 6:30 P.M. when I was outside of greenfield MA and saw what I thought at first was a meteor.  It was traveling from the east to the west. I know this since I was traveling north on Rte 91.  Two cars had just passed me on the highway and I know that they saw it too since they swerved in the passing lane in front of me just as I saw this object.  It was bright yellow/orange at the tip and neon green in the tail which was wider than the tip.  I did not see it dissappear over the horizon since I was too busy trying to make sure I didn&apos;t collide with the cars in font of me.  I saw only one mention of this object in the news the next night which was picked up by the Associated Press in my local newspaper.  I have watched the sky for most of my life and have never seen anything like this.  I have seen the comets in recent time - Hale Bopp and Halley&apos;s - but they looked nothing like this. More importantly, I have been seeing lights in the southeastern sky from where I live in northeastern VT for a few weeks.  They are clearly visible on a clear night.  I don&apos;t think that these lights are the normal star/planet sightings eventhough they are visible in the sky at dusk when the sky gets dark.  They seem to be suspended in the night sky at the tail of a constellation, which I cannot name since I don&apos;t know them that well.  They only move in the sky as the night goes on and as the constellation moves in the night sky.  The reason I feel they are different is that they appear to be flashing red, green and white lights.  This is visible clearly with binoculars.  They are much further out in the sky than any aircraft, because I have seen aircraft fly in the sky at altitudes that are are very high at the same time I am observing the flashing lights and the aircraft is far below these lights.  As the night progresses I can see other lights (not stars, I don&apos;t think) appear over the horizon from the northeast.  They seem to form a very large triangle in their positon in the night sky with this lower brighter object.  The two additional light points in the sky (also flashing colors) appear to be much further away than the one I can clearly see at dusk and thereafter. Can you tell me anything about them or has anyone else seen them?", "Fireball seen in the sky North of Fayetteville, Arkansas.I was leaving to go to work and getting into my car when I glanced up to the sky just in time to see what appeared to be a meteor or space debris entering the sky to the north of Fayetteville, Arkansas, at 05:20.  I was looking up at the sky when the object appeared.  The object entered the sky at approximately 70 degrees above the visible horizon and appeared to be heading straight down toward the ground.  It began looking like a falling star.  One to two seconds after appearing, it began to break apart into an orange fireball, with pieces trailing behind it.  The color then changed to a bright green.  It looked like it made it relatively close to the ground, because the clouds were illuminated, which made that entire portion of the sky flash green for a moment.  It looked like it made it to the top of the layer of clouds.  The clouds to the north of my location (where the object was seen) were broken at about 40,000 feet.  Skies over my head were clear at the time.  I heard no sound from the object.  The sighting lasted about 5 seconds.", "Six Spheres of light move into my vision over the 92 Albuquerque Balloon Fiesta,then vanish straight up.We had just moved to Albuquerque and were attending the 1992 Balloon Fiesta.

They too stopped &amp; remained motionless for a short period. Then all 6 began maneuvering independently in straight lines with no given pattern,right,left,backward,forward.

I said to my husband, &quot;What is that weird plane?&quot;  He said that he didn&apos;t know, but he&apos;d been watching it for sometime. He told me to watch because it would seemingly stop right in mid-air--which is what I had observed it doing. It seemed to be circling the highway, but keeping up with the traffic that was north-bound.  It was a clear day; few clouds.  No rain.  Other motorists appeared to be watching the craft was well.

I got in my car and drove to the beach to investigate (about two minutes away) and got out of my car and walked down on the beach.  The light was orangish and very bright.  I thought it was a planet at first(as bright as Jupiter) but Jupiter was straight up above me, along with another minor planet.  Watching the light, I noticed it was moving in a northerly direction very slowly over the ocean, and in the meantime descending gradually.  At that moment I assumed it was a plane coming in to land at the airport here, but it never approached the airport. I then drove north along Pebble Beach Drive to another pullout where I sat awhile, and to my astonishment the object began to move up and down and began to slightly accelerate at certain moments (the object was still very far in the distance) and then it would slow again.  At this instant I just knew it wasn&apos;t a plane.  The light then began to appear brighter, and then fade again, where it faded altogether and didn&apos;t reappear. I drove down to the end of the road to Point St. George to see if it had appeared again, but the sky was pitch black and there was no light to be seen.

I mean, if you ever seen a flying object which was silent? It always came in full view (100 feet across)  blinked in and it always blinked out and the object was in a loop. It kept coming over and over, all night long. I kept watching the see if I could see it coming, but always full view. Only lights on the tips. It was brown and seems that we could only see an outline. We (((deleted)) and I) watched it until day break and then we stopped seeing it. It was too over top for us. We could not understand it then and we still, do not understand. It just does not fit into any of the things we have learned. We were not doing anything. He was cleaning his window and that was all. We never went back to the football field next the down town campus to watch for it again, because we thought that it would never reappear after that night. But that is not the end of the story.

Approaching Green Ridge I saw what appeared to be a disc of light (such as a planet). It was the color of and amber sodium light. It remained motionless for a minute or two after I first saw it, and then started to move to the right. As I approached the 35 MPH sign in Green Ridge, it moved to the right, and seemed to spiral (like a kite without a tale). It spiraled at least once and I thought twice. At the 35 MPH sign, the road turns to the North East and I looked over my shoulder to the right and saw it plummet to the ground leaving a long tale. The light and the tale remained the same color as when first observed! Thursday night while at work, a person said to someone else that there was a report of a UFO in the newspaper. I had to go ask him where he saw it and he said it was in the break area. I went to find it and someone else said he saw it also in the paper but did not read it. Subsequently I asked a the school in Green Ridge, at the Casey&apos;s store and asked the police officer, but no one was familiar with the incident. This is not the first UFO I&apos;ve ever seen!

It stayed in one place for a very long time and then simply vanished.At approximately 21:00 hrs. I saw a round object that I at first thought was an unusually big and bright star. I was driving at the time, so I was not sure if it was moving or not. I sopped about two miles from my house to look at it. It did not move. It was over my left shoulder. It was fairly high in the sky, but looked big. At times it seemed as if a halo was around it. I continued home and when I got there the &quot;star&quot;was over my right shoulder. (I&apos;m not sure whether it moved or not while I was driving. It seemed to, but who can be sure when they are moving themselves?)I got out of my car and watched it for a while. It stayed in the exact same spot. I had my neighbors outside light (1/8 mi. down the road if that) and trees as a reference point. I finally went in and ate. I went back out to check on the star. It was still there in the same spot. I hadn&apos;t called anyone nearby, I was afraid I&apos;d look stupid. There was a whole lot of activity in the air, which is unusual where I live. I&apos;m way out in the country. None of the aircraft approached the object that I could tell. I went back in and picked up my camera, not really thinking I could get a decent picture but I might be able to get a better look at it through my 300mm lens. It was gone. But there were other strange things happening. Across the road, I could see lights moving through the trees. The lights were fairly big so I could not justify what I was seeing with my own eyes. they were kind off light pinkish orange. This is the best I can describe them. This continued for another 1/2 hour or so at random. When the big &quot;star&quot; had left, the air traffic had also calmed down. This star was big and I don&apos;t understand my hesitation in calling for a witness. I didn&apos;t call anybody until it was all over. Ther&apos;s one thing I left out and it might seem crazy, but I got really sleepy at one point and went in to lay down. I fell asleep, but it wasn&apos;t long. the dog was barking like crazy and my cell phone was ringing,so I woke up. That&apos;s when I grabbed my camera ! and went outside. Like I said it was gone. I looked all around the sky to see if had moved with the rest of the stars. It simply was not there. That&apos;s why I am convinced I saw something unusual.

It surprized me so I followed it with my eye. I walked past the trees into my side field to get a better look. My sons and I star gaze at night and we have seen satilites. Much to my amaze there was three objects. They moved at the speed of satilites. A jet was flying underneath them tracking west so I new they were very high. They acted like they were chasing each other with one sort of holding back. Four times they made a triangle and then darted around more. This lasted for almost five minutes.

Then our car radio began making this noise, not at all like static, but a banging frequency sound is the only way to describe it. There were about four to six of them, hovering the sky above us. They were vey small but were very bright. They were red at when still but a whiteish-blue when moving. They had no particular shape to them, round when still and flat when moving. They &quot;whistled&quot; when they moved, a very high pitched sound. They were so close at one time we had to cover our ears because of the sound. They were flying in all angles, speeding and stopping freely. They had no particular formation but they stayed in a close group.

She was in her car traveling home on Protection Ave, towards home. When suddenly in the distance she could see a craft(UFO) was approaching her car, It did not turn towards the small local airpot but instead came  right at her car. it did have very bright light and was sphere shapped. She stopped her car the next instant the UFO was on her left side hovering over a very large elm tree it made no noise. She was so frightened she slammed on the gas and drove home (2miles) and almost hit our house with her car, she came screeming saying she just seen a UFO and go get the bonoculers and look out back she was shaking she was so scarred, but we did not see a thing. she called the local airport and police to report the sighting and the next day there was an artical in the local papaer about the sighting and it reported 8 other people seeing the object that day, also the large elm tree did die after the sighting", "19 yr old man describes UFO sights in Maryland at night and in broad daylight.well i was in my room watching Saturday Night Live around 1230 am, when i noticed a bright light from a distance that got really bright then disappearing. so i kept watching the light and noticed it kept moving everytime it lit up again. so i got out of bed and walked to my window and opened it. i looked to see if i could still see and i could. then all of a sudden i just happened to glance up and i saw this enormous saucer over my house maybe 100 yds above the house. there were mnay different colors around this ship(red,green,purple,blue,yellow). at first i thought it was a helicopter or an airplane but this object made no noise. i could see it spinning and the lights flashing in random sequences but yet i heard no noise. it was completely silent. so i kept watching in awe as it hoovered and moved slowly over and past my house. so i raced to the other side of the room where my other window was to see if i could still see it but it was gone. so i ran down stairs to see if anyone had seen this, but everyone was asleep. i went back to see if i could see the first object from before but it too was gone. this wasnt the first time i had seen something like this before. i have seen 10 to 20 ufo&apos;s in my life, most of them in maryland. i have even seen them during the day.  In May of 2000 while coming back from delaware on the highway we were driving along when something had caught my eye in the sky. i looked up and noticed this craft maneuvering like no craft i have ever seen do before. it moved at a consttant speed, seemingly going the same speed as the car. so i pointed this to my friend and he was like what the....? then all of a sudden it jetted off at extremely high speeds. we couldn&apos;t believe our eyes. my friend told me he had never seen something like that before. i told him that i have but never during the day.", "Bright circular light fell straight down, had rectangular unlit form behind it.Bright light, brighter than halogen appeared to be about 5 x size of thumb, about 3-4 miles away.

One pointed out what we thought at first was a plane. All that could be seen was a blue ring of light that looked to be at a very high altitude. When we all managed to see it far up, it suddenly accelerated our line of vision, then as quickly as it started to accelerate, it stopped in mid air, and then zoomed backwards in a semi-circular motion. After this it accelerated again at a fantastic speed back in the original direction. Later on one (circa 15mins) of my friends saw it again returning toward the direction from which it originally came, again at a fantastic speed. Before the rest of us could locate it in the sky this time it was too late and had gone. Initially we were trying to justify what we saw, for instance lasers from a local nightclub, however we could see these as a shaft light led from the source up to the sky. It certainly was not anything man made that the general public are aware of, especially considering the speed at which it accelerated, stopped and then changed direction. Description: could not see any detail at all, condidering it was late and it was most likely very high up.m What we did see was a light blue ring of light the cntre of which was indiscernible from the night sky. The blue colour was quite  similar to the hyperlink colour on this page (where it says &quot;Click here to see examples&quot;) although bright like a light and not a dull colour.

And then I observed in the north an air plane and the speed was faster that the object in the sky.   It kept a steady even motion as it went across the sky and when it was in the west part of the sky it just vanished.  It was if someone turned off the light.   The thing that struck me was that it would move and at times seem to stop and stand still then move on.", "A flash of light went across the lakeI live on a small lake in South Carolina.

PD))Brillant light engulfs Mt Rainier Campsite (1966-67)Was told I should report this to the best of my memory by friends. My parents often camped at this campsite near Tootle River (Creek?)where my father loved to fish. One evening during the Summer Months when I was about 16 yrs old after we retired to our trailer (among about 6 other trailers)we were woke up by a brillant light that engulfed the entire campsite. I was on the top bunk where I had a small window (10X24 inches) to look out of.  The light was of emmense bright light that made the trees appear almost white ... there was kinda a &quot;sudden low base blast sound&quot; which is hard to describe when it appeared (There was no visible craft to be seen - only light).  The light seem to come from straight above the campsite shining over the entire area.  My parents were sleeping in the dining/converted bed area where they had the bigger window, I remember My dad replying &quot;What the SH&amp;t is that?&quot; and wanting to go outside which my mother urged him not too because she had a bad feeling about it, So they both stared at it through the windows. I could hear other campers making sounds of alarm and some movement.  I tried to see as much as I could through my tiny window but it was hard. Then suddenly the light blinked off and we were in total darkness again (as there were no street lights in the area).  I then heard one of the campers yelling at his family to pack up so they could leave.....hearing them drive off later.  But other campers stayed the night til morning. When we got up the following morning there was a Forest Ranger going to each of the campers asking questions and getting names of everybody. When he went to talk to my parents he said &quot;I heard there was a bit of excitement here last night could you fill me in&quot;. My Mom looked at my Dad and then looked at me &amp; my brother and told us to go down to the River, so I was unable to hear any other detail. But when we went back to the campsite, the other trailers were gone except for ours and one other.  My father refused to leave because he was determined to have his fishing trip.  That following night we were woke again t! o someth ing shaking our trailer violently which suddenly stopped as it began. We left the following morning.

I remember a couple of days before seeing the object, I had trouble sleeping, and was having wierd dreams. In my back yard, we have a drainage Ditch,and behind the ditch at that time, we had several thousand acres of farm land. My backyard faces the West, and beyond the farm land runs the highway enter- ing Brownsville,from North to South. I remember that a couple of nights before, while being outside at night, I would see a ball of white light on the other side of the ditch.  I could recall seeing the light barely over the brush along the ditch, but for some strange reason I didn&apos;t think about it. I remember seeing it several times, and it did stand out, but for some reason I didn&apos;t check it out. But then on that night, I Decided to take my dog,(a Great Dane) for a walk, I would walk her probably every other night that month, late at night. It was a cool night, and it was clear skies, I walked to the back yard, when again I saw this light, It apeared to be moving slowly up and down. This time I became aware of how this light was strange, and out of place. The light at that moment looked like a street light, I went to the ditch for a better look, as I got closer, I could not see it, because of the brush.  The Ditch on the other side is higher than the side I was standing on, so I was trying to figure out how I could get a better view.  As I stood there, this bright light shot up from where I had seen the light, It was the size of a golf ball at arms lenth,this is the best I could describe it.  It seemed to be rotating, and changing colors, It was not very bright, as bright as a 40 watt light bulb.  You could see like vapor, like when you look at gasoline, is the best way I could describe it, you could see the colors change as it rotated, I can&apos;t remember though which way it was rotating(sorry), but it was rotating horizontally. My dog also noticed it, she was scared but did not bark, She had her tail between her legs. I stood there for about 15 seconds, trying to figure out what it was, but then I became scared, And I ran inside the house thru the front door, with the dog. I remember telling my self, that no one was going to believe me about what I saw, So I ran into the bedroom and woke my wife up, I dragged her outside thru the sliding door going to my back yard. My wife didn&apos;t know what was going on, I guess I was pretty excited, but she saw it also, but this time, it was starting to move to the Northwest slowly. It seemed to be shrinking in size, It got to the size of a pea at arms lenth. I had built a elivated platform for my son, so I climbed it, and watched it, as it dropped behind some trees in the far distance Northwest of my home. At the time I didn&apos;t believe in ufo&apos;s, I was just a regular Joe, Didn&apos;t really give it to much thought, but now I have become a strong believer.

The first 7 have seemed to have stopped for about 2 minutes just hovering. When one would signal 2 bright white lights, another one would signal in the same matter. The lower one has join formation and one by one they would all signal two bright white lights. They where moving from east to northwest untill they disappeared. Two minutes after the last one disappeared. A low flying airplane was moving in the direction of last known location. This is the first time that I have seen them for myself.

It appeared to be about one block away and 100 feet high, and stayed there for about 5-7 seconds.

I said well they shimmer due to the atmosphere is that what you mean? She said no I&apos;m seeing one oh no there are two no wait there are three lights moving with us as we are driving.  I couldn&apos;t see anything as I was paying attention to the road.  At one point during this period I openly called to the craft and ((deleted)) screamed &quot;Oh my god!&quot; when I asked her what happened she said that as I was talking to the craft what she at first thought was a very bright light in the fields next to the highway flew almost instantly toward the car and was next to the passenger side window for about 5 seconds as we were going 65 mph..  When that was happening I had the feeling like something was happening in my mind, I can only discribe it as a fuzzy vibration that was supperimposed and lasted till the ball of light sped away.  After she saw the light speed off she reportedthat the craft were having a light show of blinking on and off as if the ships were communicating with each other.  I was by this time anxious to see this all for my se! lf and a t the next turnoff went to one of the corn fields to stop and get out of the car.  I saw two of the three craft going away toward Illinois and one coming toward us.  ((name deleted)) freaked out at this point, she said it was because this was klan country and a white guy and Black woman were in danger here.  So I got back on the Highway and was told the craft was still following us.

I waited till I was sure that she wouldn&apos;t wake up and took the first exit I could find. When I stopped the car in the corn field this time I got out of the car and saw a lowhanging cloud in front of me with the craft hidden just at the bottom edge of the clouds.  There were two sets of lights on the craft a set of blue lights on the top and a set of red on the bottom.  There were 4 or 5 lights visable above and below and they were going in sequence in opposite directions I never saw the body of the craft itself only the running lights.  I said that I was going inside the car now and if you want to come and get me you can.  I have no memory of what happened.

I had never seen anything interesting in the night sky until the night of July 25, 2000. After this event I immediately typed up what I saw and sent a fax right off to Mike Seigal at Coast to Coast AM. As far as I know he never covered it ...and I don&apos;t know of anyone but the 3 of us who were present who saw this event. However, I thought you might like to add it to your records and perhaps someone else has sent an account of it to you as well. Here is the text that I typed: Attn: Mike It is now 10:25 pm (July 25, 2000) Pacific. I live in Las Vegas, Nevada and just less than an hour ago I was on the very south end of the valley looking north towards the Stratosphere Tower (a distance of 10-15 miles if I had to guess) ...showing a guest of mine from the East Coast a nice view of the Strip from a high elevation. There were three of us present and we noticed extremely bright glowing lights at approximately the level of the Tower, but well beyond it. You could see the lights of aircraft crossing the Las Vegas Valley, but these lights were 20-30 times brighter and stationary with a slight drift to the right (East). One of these lights dropped suddenly to the valley floor and disappeared. After several minutes the others flickered and faded as well. As soon as they were gone another set appeared at a much higher elevation ...in relation to the tower, almost twice as high. These kept fading after about five minutes and reappearing in sets of two and three ...only a single time was there only one light in the sky. I called a local television station, KLAS channel 8 and asked them if anyone else had reported this ...they said no, but said they&apos;d train their stationary cameras on it (in retrospect, I don&apos;t think they took what I was saying seriously). All the while the Vegas.com blimp, a tourist airship here in Las Vegas was in the sky and provided a good point of reference. They took off from the North Las Vegas airport, about 25 miles from where I was in the valley, but they were much smaller (the airship is lit from the interior and the size of the Goodyear Blimp) in relation to the size and brightness of the lights. The best analogy I can draw is to the Phoenix Lights incident of &apos;97 that I&apos;ve seen time and again on TV. Unfortunately I didn&apos;t have a camera, but this incident was far and away more interesting than the Phoenix one. I understand that some explanations there include military flares, and this could have been what I witnessed. However, some of the lights dropped all the way to the! Valley floor and I wouldn&apos;t have expected that to happen if military excercises were being conducted on the Nellis Range over the other side of the mountain range in the north part of the Valley. However, as I mentioned, these lights did not all descend in elevation ...what one would expect if they were flares attached to parachutes. I hope that someone captured this on video ...there must have been many eyewitnesses, including those in the blimp, in the airport tower, and elsewhere. I&apos;m also curious if this will be discussed on the 11 o&apos;clock news, but as I finish typing this it is now only 10:35 and being a listener from time to time of your show I thought that you might enjoy this bit of information.

I thought I noticed movement to the north looking about  30 degrees up, just over some tall pines nearby. I then noticed two stars traveling west to east, one behind the other,  separated by what appeared to be a mile or more. I  thought it was probably a couple military jets but I did not see any blinking lights so I went in to get my binoculars. Through the binoculars the objects appeared as stars,bright white lights and nothing else. There was no sound  heard after their passing as there normally would be with jets.

I saw a red point of light dancing around on a single cloud, assumed someone was playing with a laser pointer. Then, the point started darting around beyond the boundaries of the small cloud, against the dark, starry night sky. I then realized that it was a vehicle, not a laser pointer. What I witnessed had the quality of a &quot;joy ride,&quot; of some presumably human pilot most likely taking a craft capable of non-Newtonian manoeuvers &quot;around the block for a spin.&quot; There was no discernable symmetry or discipline to the crafts movements; a few loops and zig-zags, darting over to another part of the sky, a few more loops and zigs before taking off to the south. The sighting started with the craft almost directly overhead, slightly west, then darting about 30 or 40 degrees due east, then departing southward. As mentioned, the craft itself was a point of fuzzy red light, and constant (did not blink or vary noticeably in intensity).", "Grandma&apos;s UFOIt was large.

While I have mostly recovered my memories have not. She was tired for a day after that and not really willing to admit to what she had seen.

No sound was heard.", "Time loss and multiple objects seen on Island of coast of Rhode Island, USA.I was doing seasonal work on an Island, approximately 14 miles off the R.I. coast, called Block Island. The house I lived in was on a hill with its front porch facing South. The house, called Langdon House, was leased by my employers for we, the hotel and kitchen staff. That evening there were only three of us home out of 13 other housemates. I, on the first floor, and two women on the second floor. At 8:45pm (eastern) I left my room, and to this day I don&apos;t know why I felt compelled to do so, grabbed a pair of binoculars and went out and sat on the front porch, facing south. It was mid to late June and still pretty light out. I remember this like I remember my own name. Due south was a light, midway from the horizon line, that seemed to be pulsating and changing colors. At first I thought it was a planet or a star, but when I peered through the binoculars the light looked too close, and its colors too distinct. Red, blue, green and white. I watched it for some time with binoculars. In fact I thought &quot;oh my god, this can&apos;t be what I think it is,&quot; when I heard a buzzing or a humming. I, still seated on the front porch, turned to my right and saw an object moving very slowly and seeming to hover at about 100 feet. It was vaguely triangular because it looked hazy, like orange translucence. But it gets even stranger. In the moment that it took to turn my head to the right, the evening light blackened and I could see no stars. Just the light in front of me facing south pulsing, changing colors and the object moving round my to my right. Right then and there I decided that I was not going to be the only nut witnessing this and ran into the house and up the stairs, where I found two female coworkers and housemates. I blabbered something about lights, my words travelling 80 mph. They followed me outside. When the three of us got back outside, we walked around the right side of the house where there is a driveway and a small side yard. The west side of the house. The island has virtually no street lights. There are no traffic lights. It is 7 miles long and three miles wide. Outside it was dark. There were multiple objects, all orange and hazy looking. They were everywhere. Hovering, bouncing. I also noticed that there was a light pulsating just like the first light I saw, only Due north. The three of us saw at least a dozen odd shapes performing many different feats. During this not one person walked past our house. Not one car drove past. Not one airplane flew overhead. This was strange because the Langdon House is on one of the ONLY main roads on the island. Less than a mile, SW, away is the Block Island Airport. The only way on or off the island is air or sea. It was a weekend and its usually a busy airport. The event ended at 9:15pm (eastern) according to my watch that evening and according to a clock radio in the room my companions shared on the second floor. Being keyed up by this nerve racking experience, the three of us walked less than a quarter mile down the hill to a local tavern, the Yellow Kittens. We left the house within fifteen mins if I recall correctly, after the event ended. When we got to the Yellow Kittens tavern the clock on the wall read 10:45pm. My wrist watch read 9:30pm.", "I have reported sightings on the two previous days and today again it looked different.  It almost looked like one giant sparkler.  The object moved only slightly and we were again looking west to northwest.  We did not watch it as much as we had the two previous nights, but tonight everytime we would watch it, it would get larger then smaller with it always being bright in color (red, blue, yellow).  There was a halo around it as well.  During the time we saw it, there was a plane that seemed to pass underneath it.  Nothing happened, just that we noticed a plane going by it.", "When I first saw this object it looked a very bright star.Two friends pointed it out to me.We were one and one half miles east of Gray,Ga.

On the left side was a port or a crater looking thing.

I started tracking a jet which was moving rather slowly to the naked eye, as it was seemingly at a high altitude.  The jet was moving from Southeast towards Northwest.  Suddenly, a circular row of lights moved right over the jet and kept going the same direction the jet was going, only much much faster than the jet.  The circular row of lights appeared much higher than the jet and much larger also.  It travelled from horizon to horizon in what I have estimated to be about 5 seconds and was gone.

I was talking to my older son, and suddenly my middle son yelled out &quot;Mama!&quot; and interrupted me. I looked in the rearview mirror to see what he wanted that was so important as to interrupt me, and all of my children were looking up through the empty back window, with shock on their faces. I looked up through the front window, and as close to us, as if it were only three stories above, sat a Hugh dark, saucer shaped, solid object. It had no sound what so ever, and hovered or sat in the sky right above us. I stopped the car, and we all got out.

PD))slow moving object burning and dropping pieces of burning materialMy apologies for submitting this form twice but the first date I gave was wrong. It was a little over a year ago, in 1999, not 2000. sorry I&apos;ve never thought of this as a UFO experience but I&apos;m watching a UFO-sightings show on the Travel Channel and one of the things that people in the show had video taped in Florida is the exact thing that I saw from my backyard. I had borrowed a night vision scope from a friend and I was playing with it in my backyard just after the sun had set. I often look at the night-time sky and I live right under the approach path of Ontario airport. Looking north/north-west over my rooftop I saw a sputtering light which looked like something burning fiercely, like magnesium, but not as bright. It was moving too slowly (in my opinion) to be a jetliner, and it wasn&apos;t losing any altitude. When I saw it I wasn&apos;t looking throught the night-vision scope but the magnitude diminished quickly and I began using the scope which had magnification as well as light-amp. Through the scope I could see the sputtering light very well and before it stopped I saw at least two to three small flare-type objects fall from it.  This is when I realized that the main thing was moving very slowly, like a blimp or something.  The &quot;flares&quot; would vanish within a couple of seconds and were not nearly as bright as the main light, and shortly after they dropped from the main part the  whole thing sort of faded away until nothing was visible through the scope or without the scope. I kept looking for something in that direction for 30-45 minutes and saw nothing.and at no time did I see any structure attatched to any of the lights. All of this, in my estimation, was taking place at about 2000 feet in altitude and I think about 20-30 miles away, possibly over the high desert to the northwest of Wrightwood.  I must say however that my ability to estimate values, distances, and altitudes has never been great. I expected to see something in the paper the next day about a airplane/military accident or even on the news shows that night, but nothing ever came of it. So, there it is, I hope this helps.  I would be more than happy to attempt to submit a mor! e detail ed report if you like. I&apos;m only sorry I didn&apos;t think more of it when it happened, and I could draw from a fresh memory. Thanks. By the way, I was reading some of the local reports and there is one in Fontana about 10 years ago- a red light 300-500 feet up- stationary, as rain clouds passed by it didnt move...yadda yadda.. Myself and a buddy saw a bunch of people out of their cars in slight rain and looking up, so we stopped and saw that red light.  But quite frankly think it was a light attatched to a kite or something.. but who knows.", "White, cigar-shaped, silent object flying at low altitude.On the morning of 3/12/01, at about 7:45 a.m., my Daughter and I saw a white, cigar-shaped object moving slowly, and at low altitude, from the southwest toward the northeast and then it turned slightly north, toward Mt. Diablo.  At times, it seemed to stay in one position, as if to observe something below, then moved forward, again.  The day was a bright, clear, cloudless morning.  The object was moving through the air at a lower altitude than I have seen many single engine planes fly.  It made no noise whatsoever.  It had no wings, no visible cockpit, no rudder, wheels, propeler, no cables or anything on or protruding from it.  I am only certain of what it was NOT: it was not a plane, not a helicopter, not a blimp, not a balloon, not a glider, or any ordinary object I have ever seen in the sky.  It appeared to move intentionally.  I did not have the benefit of binoculars, but with the naked eye, it appeared that it may have had narrow band of dark-colored metal very slightly bisecting the middle of the object, which gave the hint of an indentation or slightly &quot;segmented&quot; body, but I cannot be sure because it was further away from me, at that point.  Mostly, it appeared to be made of a smooth, cigar-shaped, bright white, non-reflecting material, i.e., not a &quot;shiny&quot; metal.  Because it had no visible means of propulsion, I was amazed at how slowly it was moving.  It&apos;s length was about the width of my thumbnail, held at arm&apos;s length.  The object was still in sight, when it was followed by a single engine plane that flew overhead, in the same direction (toward the northeast), but the plane was flying at a lower altitude.  So, for a brief period, perhaps 30 seconds,I had both the plane and the silent, cigar-shaped object in view, before they both passed behind the buildings and trees, and out of my line of sight.  The strange object was moving much slower than the single engine plane behind and below it.  It would seem to me that any observer in the small plane would have had a clear, much closer view of th! e cigar- shaped object.  I went in and called the FAA Office at the Livermore Airport, nearby, but they said they had no other reports nor did they see anything.", "light, going from very bright to very dim, west of Wrangell island,slight rocking movement.

He then said that it definately wasnt an aircraft that he knew of, and I watched the first go over the ridge, and then looke up again, and say another, sitting still, about that time it shot straight upward a few thousand feet, and just dissappeared.  I immediately got back in the truck and discussed what we saw as I drove away as fast as possible, and he said it was the first time he&apos;d seen anythign like it.

It was at least the apparent width of two fists at arms&apos; length, and although it was clearly visible and had well-defined edges it was not extremely bright. It was moving from north to south (approximately) when it first &apos;switched on&apos;, and moved across about 1/3 to 1/2 of the sky before it went off again.

It flew at tree top level and was as big as a 747 jet. No noise and it was traveling very slow. It had maybe 60 or 70 lights in different places. No certain order or anything.

We came around a line of high hedges that lined the street across from my house. On the other side of the hedges was a open field area.  Not a huge area but large enough to play ball. Thats what we were going to do. As we came around the corner of the hedge we all saw a silver disk approx 60 feet across just hoovering about 10 feet off the ground.  It was very close to a house on the other side of the clearing.  There was no sounds, no lights, it was bright day light and the sun was out. It just hoovered and would spin very slowly. We all looked at each other and said Wow! Then suddenly it thrust straight upward so fast it was like it vanished. A few seconds later, as we all were looking up into the sky, one of my friends pointed and yelled, There! There it is! As I again saw the craft. It was flying horizonal across the sky at about 2000 feet and there was a aircraft near it at one point. I remember the sun light shinning off the plane but not the disk.  I can see it today as if it just happened.  Because of obvious reasons I never told anyone about this until recent years. In fact as I was visiting my older brother in North Carolina. I brought this up and took a deep breath as I awaited my brother to begin to laugh. But he said&quot; Ya I saw it too! Not that day but another night with some of his friends. He is 4 years older than me. Same kinda craft but it was flying very close to the water tower up on the top of the hill. There was a school there also. I think it was Hoban.

On the evening of July 31, 2000 I was travelling south on I295 between Richmond, VA and Petersburg, VA, with 1 passenger.  It was very dark and stormy and about 9 p.m..  The two of us observed what appeared to be a very large, neon-green fireball travelling south parallel to I295 at what appeared to be treetop level.  It was travelling faster than the highway traffic, probably at 200 miles per hour or so.  The lower third of it was hidden by the treetops.  It did not have a long tail, but could have had a very short tail.  Its surface appeared to have a lot of clear-colored small bubbles associated with it.  Its size was comparable to a lemon held at arm&apos;s length.  I thought it was a meteor at first.  After thinking about it for several months, I considered the possibility that it might be a UFO.  The reasons for this are as follows: 1) it was travelling parallel to the ground, not arcing down; 2) it did not have a well-defined tail; 3) it appeared very large, and appeared to be at a very low altitude.  I am a geologist (PhD) and I knew that if a bolide of this size and scale hit the earth, it would cause a catastrophic event.  I figured that astronomers would have noticed it and reported on it. I heard nothing reported. The alternative explanation is that we were looking at the base or side of a UFO.  Since I do not know if you received my last report, please notify me when you  receive this.  My passenger was a 10 year old boy.  If the object was a meteor, it was gargantuan in scale, and looked like a planet speeding past.

It was grey in colour almost the same colour as the sky and boomerang shaped. I pulled over into the slow lane and watched it fly over a field to my left. Then it stopped and spun around very quickly like helicopter blades and just vanished. I travel on the same road every day and have never seen anything before. The road is called the M11. I have never seen anything like it before and I keep trying to convince myself that I imagined it or it was a plane or something, but I keep remembering that at the time I kept looking at it for those 30 or 40 secs and saying to myself, &quot;I am really seeing this and I dont know what it is!&quot; Please belive me I have always laughed at storys about UFO&apos;s and I don&apos;t really belive in them even now but I really dont know what I saw.

We do not know location of sighting in Alberta.  PD))Low flying craft with VERY unusual strobe pattern.It was a lowing flying craft, spotted approx 1:00 am - 1:30 am in the morning.  I am the son of a private pilot, and know enough myself that small aircraft do not fly approx 300-500 feet above the ground at night unless approaching a lighted airport. There is no such airport for at least 25 miles, which is just a rural airstrip, with the ground lights activated via keying the radio mike (no need for landing lights). The craft had strobes that did flash, HOWEVER there were two things unusual about this.  First, the strobes were white (there were two strobes for sure, but possibly a third, they blinked so erratically that it was hard to tell), not normal for Canadian aircraft (standard is red and blue), second, they did not blink at normal intervals, they blinked randomly. (note: it is possible the pilot was flying without his nav strobes and was blinking landing lights, but they seemed of the strobe nature, not of aircaft landing lights.)  The lights passed over the road in an east-southeast direction, being nearly directly above my vehicle as it passed over the road.  Believe me, it scared me half silly.  It is worthy to note that two years (this summer) within 4 miles of spotting these lights there was a suspected cattle mutilation.  Of that I do have pictures which I took myself.  If you so desire I could get them to you within a couple weeks (I&apos;m away at University right now, but will be going home in a couple weeks and could scan them.)", "strange soundI am an author/editor, and live in Wheaton, Illinois, about 30 miles west of Chicago. Around 3 this morning. I awoke to a sound unlike any I have heard before in my life--the only way I can describe it is to say, if you can imagine a gigantic, hi-tech helicopter that was the size of a battleship, that might give some idea. There had been a storm earlier in the night, but this certainly was not thunder--it was a steady but pulsing drone that was so loud and extended (and very mechanical sounding, VERY unlike thunder in that respect) I felt as though it must have spanned over a distance of five or ten miles. The entire house was mildly rattling at one point. So the next morning, I wondered whether I had simply hallucinated the entire thing, and asked someone who lives about a mile away if they heard anything last night, anything odd or different from normal. They said, &quot;As a matter of fact, around 3 in the morning, it sounded as though a gigantic helicopter was hovering right over my house. It woke me up.&quot; I regret not looking outside the window when it happened--have no idea why. I even wondered this morning if it was an earthquake of some sort, as I&apos;ve heard there can be unusual sounds associated with those. By the way, I called the local police department last night and they heard nothing about this. I have seen military helicopters flying in formation over a nearby region (there are several airports around here), once during the night--but this really didn&apos;t sound quite like that (the &quot;thump-thump-thumps&quot; of your ordinary helicopter tend to be spaced closer together, stacatto-like) --plus, there was quite a fog around here most of the night, and I have a hard time imagining there were many flights in the air as a result--but I can&apos;t say for sure. If you happen to know of any sightings or other odd phenomena that were reported last night in the midwest, I sure would appreciate hearing about it/them.

We arrived at an observation point that included a small parking lot and a roofed scenic looking area.  It oversaw Canyon Lake and its surrounding mountains.  We all proceeded to leave the vehicle and stepped out to the railing that protected one from a fall down the observation point&apos;s steep rocky terrain.  It was a very clear night with no wind.  It was warm enough where you would not need a jacket.  We then began looking towards the horizon line above the mountains where we noticed a formation of lights that encircled the canyon area.  Some of them were actually inside of the canyon.  We didn&apos;t say much at first because they were about a 1/2 mile to a mile away and shape and dimension were lost especially at night time.  We then pointed them out to each other speculating as to the nature of these lights.  Helicopters?  Airplanes?  There is after all an airport due west in Phoenix about 30-50 miles away.  We slowly began to realize that these UFOs were not moving in any conventional manner. we counted from between 10 to 12 of these objects.  And they began moving in a westerly direction right towards us.  The closer they got the more detail we could interpret.  Some of the craft appeared to be &quot;scanning&quot; the ground below with a white light beam and thats when we realized exactly what we were looking at.  There appeared to be about 10-11 &quot;disc/saucer&quot; type craft and one or two &quot;flagship&quot; type craft.  One ship appeared to our right and we could make out its very large size and the fact that it did not make ANY noise whatsoever.  This was one of the flagship type.  It was large, football field size, octogonal with a series of lights (white, blue and red) that went at differing patterns on the bottom and sides of the ship.  The craft underneath was whitish/tanish and the foreward area was very dark and shaped like a &quot;boomerang&quot;.  (My speculation is that it protects the ship through high radiation activities and is! dark be cause it is thick lead plating.)  It had several compartments underneath and a &quot;command&quot; area of some sort.  It had no markings of insignias.  It moved 20-35 MPH and soon disappeared behind some mountains.  We became shocked into a half fear half awe state.  Another ship may have noticed this and came up from behind a &quot;Prudential&quot; looking mountain and emitted a blue light beam at us.  It then generated a great wind or force of some sort that coupled with the blue light had a very calming effect on us.  It seemed to energize us and we could feel our &quot;chi-energy&quot; accelerate.  We began doing &quot;tai-chi&quot; type physical movements while they seemed to communicate with us telepathically.  The images and messages to seemed to be sharing with us we later verified the same experiences.  It then stopped after about perhaps 5-10 minutes.  Then another ship that appeared to be &quot;scanning&quot; to the left of us stopped its strobing light beam, elevated and turned towards us very deliberately.  It began moving at us and we proceeded to reenter our car.  It slowly came right over our car.  We rolled down our windows and studied it while it went past.  This description matches the flagship from above.  Definitely octogonal with a series of lights and ducts or compartment passageways evident underneath with a &quot;command&quot; center complete with &quot;boomerang&quot; shaped forward area.  And again it made absolutely no sound. Somesort of anti-gravity drive to be sure.  Our car was not on and we had no other electronical devices so performance interference was not monitored.  It then went behind us and disappeared behind some mountains in the east.  The other remaining craft all slowly disappeared before sunrise.  We explored the areas that we could access and found no traces of their visit.  Perhaps they were searching for a mineral or have a base nearby.  Maybe they were sightseeing. We KNOW they were NOT any terrestrial technologies responsible for these ships. We returned every weekend after and experienced many more UFO encounters but have ! never th ought to bring a camera and two of us no longer live in the area.((NUFORC Note:  Report seems to be serious-minded.

From what I can determine there was an object hovering over the Power Plant in Clover.  I also have heard that the deputies attempted to take several photographs.  (again hearsay) Two of the deputies went to get a different angle to observe the object, but when they entered an open field, the entire field lit up (as if it were a football field on the night of a game) (these were the two traumatized deputies).  The Power Plant had a meeting about this event the next morning (known for a fact) but nobody is talking.

I was out for the evening with a group of friends. We were warming our cars up outside of a restaurant we had spent a few hours at. I was standing outside of my car talking with some of them in another car through their windows. For some reason, I happened to look up and notice how clear the sky was. A few seconds later I either looked up again or something caught my attention. I saw this enormous &quot;thing&quot; that took up my entire peripheral vision. It seemed football fields in size. It was transparent except that you could somehow make out a cylindrical or cigar form (I couldn&apos;t really see the ends fully - the transparency sort of tapered off). It was rotating as it was moving across the sky (similar to a cement truck travelling down the road spinning the cement). It had (what appeared to be) stars attached to it that seemed to be evenly spaced apart, but not in any particular formation. The same size but maybe a little brighter than &quot;normal&quot; stars. You could tell they were attached to this &quot;thing&quot; because you could see them going around with the rotations of the anomaly as opposed to the typical stationary stars I could see through the object. One of my friends in the car I was standing outside of heard my exclamation and saw my expression and pulled himself out through his open window quickly to try to see what I was looking at.  He is an amateur astronomer and knows how quickly things can disappear. Without making a noise the anomaly made its way across the sky travelling quite quickly. The sighting lasted about 10-15 seconds until it was too far for us to view it any longer or disappeared. My friend and I were quite shaken after the event. He describes it as if the sky opened up. I describe it as if a piece of sky was cut out and was moving against the rest of the sky.

I assumed it was a planet as it is usually where we see what we believe to be venus (to the west) It was so bright though, I thought I would make a note of where it was in the sky, and see if it would move. For the first half hour or so, it remained stationary. After that however, I started to notice it slowly moving to another part of the sky. It was very suttle to someone who might just be looking up, but it was definitely moving. It didn&apos;t seem to be of conventional origin for the mear fact that it moved so slowly. I was watching it by myself until my wife came in the room. She usually poo-poo&apos;s the idea of UFO&apos;s but when she saw it and saw it was moving, it kind of spooked her. We had binoculars handy so we watched it and saw a better view of the object. It was very bright, and every so often would change to part red. Sometimes more red than white. Now we knew it wasn&apos;t venus- plus it had moved so far. It took a little over an hour for the object to finally disappear over the mountain. When I first viewed the object through the binoculars, it appeared as a huge ball of light. I could not see any indication that it was a conventional craft. I am not an expert, and have only seen something peculiar one other time, but this one stumps both my wife and I.

They were moving slowly and would fade in and out as they moved horizontally and vertically. The horizon line of the mountains would not be explainable as lights higher would fade out while lower ones remained. Just after the last one faded another one lit up slightly to the right and higher for about 5 seconds.  Perhaps the military uses different colored (and brighter) lights on helicopters?

We interviewed the mother, a computer programmer in San Antonio, and her children, filling out MUFON forms and having them draw what they remembered seeing.  We also took photos of the area, and walked all around the area.  . . .  The sighting occurred around 9:30 p.m., or so, with the object first seen hovering over a large field in front of the farm house, shining lights down on the field (the field had cattle in it when we looked at it and is subleased to another family) when one of the children saw it, and with lights off but clearly visible when the mother was alerted.  It came toward the house 50 - 100 feet above the ground, coming toward one of the children (13-year-old daughter] outside, who ran, quite frightened, inside the house.  (When last seen by one of them, it was quite close to one side of the house.)  The mother ran for a gun, dogs, cats and nearby coyotes were making a lot of noise and reacting, and then the object disappeared.  When they were outside the house, with the object nearby, they felt a lot of heat. They speculated later that they may have been exposed to radiation, since they all developed colds just after the incident  , possibly because their immune systems had been affected.  (Or, this could have just been a coincidence.)  Later, in the middle of the night, a radio and TV (that have remote controls) came on further frightening them.  . . .  There were some indications that they may&apos;ve been abducted.

The woman said she&apos;d meet with a local abductee support group, and is interested in being hypnotically regressed to see if anything can be remembered that  is perhaps being blocked from conscious memory.  . . .  Hearing all their stories separately, it sounded convincing that something unusual had occurred.  . . .  The craft had made no sound other than, perhaps, a low humming sound, that the mother thought she might&apos;ve heard.  . . .  They called 911,  sheriff&apos;s deputies came, and deputies continue to check on them almost every night. The woman&apos;s husband&apos;s response puzzles me a bit, as well as the fact that she had made little mention of him when she first told us about the incidence.  He had not been at the house when the incidence occurred.  The woman said he had been supportive when I asked how he fit in.  While we were there he was working outside, came in later, we were introduced to him, and he went to sleep on the sofa by the TV.  . . .  Personally I am a bit puzzled as to why he didn&apos;t share at least a little of his excitement, puzzlement, amusement, etc. at what his wife   and the children were reporting.  . . .  Ron Johnson, in Austin, told me on the MUFON amateur radio net this morning that he had run into similar responses from spouses before and that the husband&apos;s response should be mentioned in the report.  He encouraged making efforts to document the false pregnancies.  Also, he wanted me to remind MUFON members to watch Dateline at 9 p.m. Tuesday, when Dr. John Mach will be interviewed. - Cliff Gieseke, May 21, &apos;94 (From notes I made in 1994; I am no longer a member of MUFON; when I tried to report the incident to the Air Force at Lackland, they told me, to my amusement, to report it to the sheriff&apos;s department, which apparently now has the responsibility of protecting our air space -- Cliff Gieseke, San Antonio, TX)", "Triangle sighted near Orly airport in FranceDriving on highway from Orl&eacute;ans to Paris, shortly after toll booth noticed on the right shoulder of the highway three white lights in a triangular formation with a red one in the middle.

After she leaves, I often go out on the back porch to write in my journal.  The porch faces west, overlooking Blake and Vashon Islands and Puget Sound.  I had just stepped out on the porch and was admiring the clear night sky when an object traveling very, very fast crossed from the south to the north.  It caught my eye because I thought it was a shooting star, but then I realized that it was flying within earth&apos;s atmosphere. Moreover, it had least 3 distinguishable bright orange lights in an oblong formation.  It was too dark for me to make out the outline of the vessel itself. It flew at about the height on the horizon as a plane would, but was totally silent and at about 10 times faster -- it took about 10 seconds for it to cross the sky.  To reconfirm my thought that it could not possibly be a plane that had just passed, moments later one in fact did fly by (presumably coming from SeaTac airport as they often do), and I could make out its shape, hear it clearly, and it was much slower than what I had just seen. I took out my journal and wrote: &quot;3/13/01: It&apos;s dark and I can&apos;t see to write well.  I just saw something cruise through the night sky.  It had orange lights and was very, very fast and completely silent.  A plane just flew by, too, but slower - much slower - and I could hear it pass.  It must have been a satellite but it seemed so close.&quot;((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and believe the witness is an excellent source of objective information.

We usually take the main road up to Conifer, CO, but we decided to take the side road (Turkey Creek Canyon Road) this time. We were travelling about 30 mph when I noticed a glowing light up by the ONLY street light on that road. Just as I noticed the light it moved VERY QUICKLY towards the windshield (I thought it was going to hit us) then travelled with us for about 2 seconds when the driver suddenly hit the brakes and swerved out of the way at which time it QUICKLY flew off to our left through a clearing and over the ridge out of sight. The driver and I got out of the car and his date remained in the car crying and very scared. When we returned to the car we gathered our senses and I demanded that we each write down what we saw (as to avoid convincing each other of our encounter). When we compared what we saw, we all came to the same conclusion that we had seen a UFO. It was a translucent image about the size of an SUV. It had, what appeared to be a fan propeller, but it moved rather quickly for it ot be powered by a propeller. We could tell it had a very bright light because when it took off to our left it lit up the trees around it before darting down the ridge about 60-100 yards away.", "Carmel, Indiana on US 31.

In addition, I did see a jet approaching Indianapolis from the east  and it was clearly moving.  The bright light (or lights) I saw disappeared after about an hour although another set of lights, directly above but much higher, were still visible.  I&apos;m not sure what the object(s) were because 1) they did not move; 2) the one set of lights disappeared; and 3) no other lights (e.g., stars, planets, etc.) were visible in the night sky other than the jet that I saw.((NUFORC Note:  Venus currently is quite prominent in the southwest sky at the time indicated.

I watched it move N and it just faded away and I could not see it anymore.  I had been sitting there maybe 30 seconds.  The total sighting was about 4 minutes.  Just wanted you to know that at your urging on the phone today, I did call our little local newspaper.  He said that he had gotten a call about 2 wks ago from someone who had seen something very similar.  He is planning on putting something in the paper (without names) and I urged him to list your website and your phone number.  I also told him that you recommended a tripod and getting time, sight duration, and direction detail.

Identical.  13 years ago was when Belleville had a large, large amt of sightings.", "Pulsating lights over Northern NJMy fiance and I were driving home from a party on Rt. 80 East in the Parsippany area when we first noticed the object in the sky.  It appeared to be, at first, an elongated string of lights.  The size of the object was difficult to assess due to its distance from us.  As we continued home, we tracked the object as it headed east towards New York City.  My fiancee got a good look at it at one point when it was directly to our north side and said it appeared to be cigar-shaped, describing as looking like a butter knife when light is reflected off of it.  Upon arriving home and stepping out of our car, we continued to watch the object as it hovered well off in the distance, quite possibly over New York City.  Again, the distance was hard to estimate.  When we looked back towards the west, we were startled to see that 3-4 other similar &quot;strings of lights&quot; were hovering almost directly over our position but far up in the atmosphere.  We went inside to further observe the original craft, which still hovered in the east.  Its lights seemed to pulsate/strobe in intensity and change colors (red, blue, green, white).  These objects (3-5 on average) have appeared nightly in our sky now and there has been a dramatic increase in plane and helicopter activity since their initial appearance.  We live near Teterboro Airport, but a lot of the air traffic we have seen is NOT conventional or commercial airplanes.((NUFORC Note:  Witnesses may be looking at a twinkling star, airliner landing lights, or perhaps some other normal phenomenon.

There were two trails which appeared to be no more than 10 to 12 feet apart. They both had the tell-tale impulse shape ie: puff of smoke straight line puff smoke straight line etc. The trail that was to the right had an almost spiral look to it. I observed this for about 10 seconds then turned towards our front door and called my wife out to see the trail. It took her no more than 5 seconds for her to come outside. By the time she got there the contrail had almost completely disipated. I ran to the back of the house and went out the back door to see if I could view the aircraft that made the trail. Where the trail was at the back of the house  seemed to be where it had started. The trail went from East to West. I went out to the front again but there was practicaly nothing left of the trail at that time.

As the &quot;star&quot; moved across the sky it seemed to get closer. We thought it was a helicopter. As it grew closer we could see that it was semi-circular in profile and had windows with silhoulettes of figures in the windows. It stayed motionless for around 7 to 8 minutes and was about 300 yards away from us. I would say that the size of the craft in relation to the size of the figures was around 400 feet across. After a period of time I motioned for the craft to come closer but it shook from side to side three times as if to say &quot;no&quot;. It stayed where it was for approx 30 secs after this and then flew from its position towards the horizon and disappeared within 5 or 6 seconds.

The tiny objects seen, and photographed, over the volcano appear to us to be short contrails behind high-flying jet aircraft.  However, if the estimate of 35 minutes&apos; duration is accurate, that does not appear to be consistent with aircraft, which would be out of the field of view of the camcorder in that amount of time.  PD))For the past 3 days now I&apos;ve seen some objects hovering over Popocatepetl Volcano for upwards of 15 minutes, on the Cenapred live cam.For the past 3 days now I&apos;ve seen some objects hovering over Popocatepetl Volcano for long periods of time, on the live cam, and have been capturing series of still pictures. The first day the object actually came straight down from above the volcano and looked somewhat like a huge silverish colored cylinder. It took at least 15 minutes to make the descent and when it impacted Popo, whoever was manning the live cam actually zoomed in on the explosion. The next day I saw the same type of thing, only this time there was no explosion, though it looked like it would have impacted the top of the volcano. Then this morning I checked the live cam for any increased volcanic activity and couldn&apos;t believe it when I saw a disk shaped silvery colored object, at least the size of a huge jet or football field, approach from the left side of the screen. It hovered over the volcano at about a 45 degree angle for at least fifteen minutes, and once again, I captured the still pictures. The object today actually hovered up there in the steam and smoke directly above the crater for a long time, so I captured a total of 50 pictures of the thing. Each picture is about 25K so would have to be emailed separately, but I would send them to you if you&apos;re interested. This is from the Cenapred live cam and each captured picture has the date and time on it by Cenapred so you can see how long it stayed over the volcano, before it simply vanished. Please email me if you&apos;d like any of the pics. I have series from 3 days in a row now. If not, you might want to watch the Popocatepetl live cam for yourself. I am concerned, because if this is some kind of attempt to control the volcano, it could have repercussions in other areas, affecting earthquakes, or at least the movement of magma below ground. Could they be experimenting? And what kind of craft could hover up there right over the volcano in those extreme temperatures and air currents for long periods of time without being destroyed???", "Say some strange stuffA light caught my i as i returned home, it started at a high altitude and over a short period, it started as a white flashing orb and by the time it had got to the tree line it was red flashing white and danced around changing altitude quickly as well as direction.

I was driving North on Route 15 between Selinsgrove and Wiliamsport and I saw a cigar shaped metallic craft in the sky.  I watched it for a few seconds, maybe 10 and then it went behind a hill to my left, when I passed the hill it was gone.  It had been a little to the left of center in my windshield, but directly in the middle vertically.  I looked for it after the hill but it was gone.  It was pretty low, not high in the atmosphere, or else the craft was extremely large. I drove on about 5 miles further up Route 15 and saw it again only this time observed it until it dissapeared in the sky.  It was cigar shaped again, vertically, and as I watched it; it changed into a more normal looking UFO and suddenly dissapeared.  This time it was about 30 seconds I watched it because it was directly in my line of vision.  It was metallic just as the previous one I&apos;d seen.  It was a clear day with a couple of wispy small clouds in the sky that were burning away pretty quickly as you watched.  I noticed the time and where I was but I don&apos;t know the name of the town I was passing through.  It was about 7-8 miles south of Williamsport when I saw the second one, or the same one but the second time I noticed it.  This craft had no contrails at all, nothing coming out of it and when I saw it the first time it was moving, but the second time while it was cigar shaped it was not moving at all until it changed shape.  Then it moved slowly and just dissapeared.  It was bright day out and the reason I noticed it was because the sun shined on it caught my attention.  It was clearly metallic in colour.", "One bright white and two bright green lights that lit up everything like daytime, except it was night.I have 3 accounts of strange lights that I have seen and would like to know your oppinion on these sightings. Before I continue, I would like to say that I am a believer in the UFO phenominum, but I guess when you actually see something, it leaves you wondering if what you saw was a possible sighting.

But after the 1st flash that seemed to last alittle to long, just after it a green colored flash lit everything up and lasted a couple seconds. This sequence of white then green happened 4 or 5 times at about 1 minute apart from each other until I got up to the source of where it was coming from. Off to my left side maybe 150 to 200 yards away, ahuge circular white light appeared partially blocked in the trees. Then in the same interval previously described, two green lights, half the size, and on opposite sides of where the white light was appeared. As I tryed to find a place to safely stop and turn the car around to get a better look, the sequence happened one more time then it was gone and I never saw it again. Could this have been an electrical storm? There was no lightning bolts coming from the sky.

But after the vivid clarity of this one last night, I felt almost driven to find out what&apos;s going on here...This dream was in very specific detail and extremely clear and in color. Last nights, had a combination of disc shaped aircraft and what looked like shining mercury-like material craft...they were zipping across the sky in the Seattle sky leaving a golden haze colored trail behind them. Several large ships with cylindrical engines on the sides and a round disc in the center of the engines (like the Star Trek ship only with the disk in the middle of the engines and other complex connective elements between the engines and disc (which was a dark green color) I noticed a small US Flag decal on the bottom of the craft and some other symbols. I also saw what looked like several aircraft but they were unusual, they seemed to be escorting the other craft. The aircraft looked like overblown A10 warthog jets...except the engines were huge and they were very smooth on the surface...with some non reflective material that was dark green almost black in color. When I was about 14 years old (I&apos;m 42 now) I had a dream like this about similar ships landing at Moon Island near Hoquiam, Washington (in the 1970s) in that dream I called a good friend (who can witness this) ((name deleted)), and told him to look up in the sky...and he set the phone down (this is all in the dream) and went out to look into the sky...when I went back out to look up at the crafts all I saw left was what appeared to be one large star that broke into three pieces one fell over towards Moon Island (I was in Aberdeen) the other started desending toward me and I saw one headed towards ((name deleted)) direction several blocks North... A cylindrical object that looked very much like the old Apollo command module softly landed in my front yard and I called ((name deleted)) back and told him and he said something that looked like the LEM landed in his. Now here&apos;s the freaky part... the next day (this is NOT a dream) I was telling him my dream and he literally turned white because he had the SAME dream from HIS perspective...and remembers my phone call. Since then I&apos;ve had many, many of the ship dreams and they are in incredibly detailed, color...I can see every detail of the ships...and I always wake up excited and hopeful like we&apos;re getting closer to something. I hope I haven&apos;t wasted your time...maybe this can help in some way, maybe it&apos;s nothing...but I just felt led to share this with you and if you have any suggestions or can offer any help about others that have had this dream or know what&apos;s goin gon I&apos;d appreciate it. I hope I haven&apos;t wasted your time, but since I don&apos;t know if these are physical, psychic, spiritual or interdimensional issues, a dream constitutes on level of contact or reality to me and should be noted incase something else ties into it and can help you with your research&hellip;((NUFORC Note:  We traditionally do not post reported dream sequences, since they are impossible to document.

It hung in the air and several people witnessed.It was about 7:30 this December night. Not particularly cold outside. Directly north of my house, I looked up to see a mysterious, glowing cloud. It was eerie because it was cloudy that evening, slightly foggy. I was leaving the house to go to our bookmobile as we do almost every Thursday night. When I saw it, I couldn&apos;t believe that this glowing formation was real. It made no sound. The air was crisp and it carried no sound. I went running back in to call my boys to come and see, that took at least 30 seconds and it was still there when we came outside to see it. We gazed at it for at least two minutes. It looked quite close, close enough to see the shape of the light emitted from within the formation. It was oval, a long oval that wasn&apos;t defined. It was almost like, being close enough behind a curtain, that the people on the other side can see your shape, but not you. If I held me arm out at shoulder length, I would say it was the length of my thumb. Up high in the sky at about 45% angle. Low enough to see that it&apos;s close, but not so close. It looked like it could&apos;ve been 1/2 away, but because of the formation and the play of light, it could be much farther away. We couldn&apos;t see what made the light. We started walking and I saw a beam come out from the top,  it stopped for a split second. Then the beam went to the 10 0&apos;clock position. Again, paused for a slit second and then went to 8 0&apos;clock. It paused there and moved to six o&apos;clock. It then retraced it&apos;s steps and the beam at midnight shot back into the cloud from whence it came. It then just melted away. It was gone quickly. The beam was perpendicular all the way along. It did not seem to start out as a slit and then become a circle which becomes wider as the beam lengthened. The end of the beam being much wider than the spot from which it originates. Of course, when we got to the bus, I told at least three people what I had seen and about four of us were talking about the glow, &quot;oh you saw it too!&quot;. Only one lady saw the beam, just the way I saw it. We knew it was otherworldly, but we thought it was weird that we couldn&apos;t figure out what had made it.", "We had three sightings of bright white lights shooting across the sky at extreme speeds, with the third one seeming to land/crash.While making a pit stop on the side of the road, I saw a large white light shoot across the sky.  Despite its larger than usual size, I discounted it as a meteorite.  However, when we were another mile or two down the road, heading uphill, the driver saw another one shoot across the sky in front of us.  After comparing stories, we realized both were headed in the same direction as we were now driving, having turned on to a side road.  When we had traveled approximately another three miles, we saw an intense white light shooting directly down into a slightly wooded field area, at extremely high speeds.  We attempted to see onto the property where it seemed to have come down, but were unable to see through the trees and could not proceed without trespassing.", "Large bright white oval ball of light hovering over lynnwood or edmonds on 1/26/01 around 10:30 pmAs i was coming home from a friends house i turned onto my street and through my windsheild up above the tree line , i saw a bright white glowing object. I was intstantly stunned by how bright it was. It &apos;s as if it was above my house, because i was heading directly home and the object seemed to be directly in front of me. As i drove up my street the object seemed to sort of bob up and down but didn&apos;t appear to be moving laterally. As i rushed down the street and pulled into my driveway, i stopped my car and jumped out to run out to the street to see it, and it was  gone.  This object seemed to almost eminate this soft bright white light in a pulsating, circular way . It was brighter and purer of a light than i&apos;ve ever seen. I was very large in the sky, about the size of two full moons, but more oval. It was also completly silent out. If it were a helicopter or aroplane at that distance there would of been sound.

A short distance east of Venus I saw two lights close together about the width of my thumb held at arms length. The light to the right was brighter and faded slowly out. The light on the left faded and brightened a few times then went out. Both lights were stationary. Shortly after they vanished a commercial airliner flew over where they were. The lights were circular and had a pale yellow or golden hue. They were slightly less brilliant than Venus and had a softer definition with some haze around them.

It was approx. at a 200 ft. altitude level and it was close enough that I could tell it to be about the size of an 18 wheeler truck. If you put your arm out and stuck your thumb out horizontal it would be the size of your thumb from nail to knuckle. My best guess is that it was about 300 yrds out.

PD))A bright object followed the deputy sheriff&apos;s patrol boat for approximately seven miles.I was a deputy sheriff and a boat warden at Horsetooth Reservoir.  Horsetooth Reservoir is located approximately 5 miles west of Fort Collins, CO.  It lies between two small hills, one to the east and one to the west.  The laske itself is probably 3 quarters of a miles in width and seven miles long.  The length of the lake is north and south.  At approximately 3:00 A.M. I received a call at home from the sheriff&apos;s office notifying me that there was some sort of a light flashing in the water at the very north end of the lake.  I notified ((name deleted)) who was in charge of the Lalrimer County Recreation District.  He said he would meet me at the docks at the south-west side of Horsetooth where I was going to board the patrol boat.  We got in the boat, headed out at Thompson&apos;s Cove and into the main body of the lake.  It was an extremely dark night.  I drove the patrol boat north at a reasonable but safe speed, considering the darkness.  When we got to the north end of the lake, we discovered the flashing light in the water that was reported as a possible distress signal, was actually a bouy that had been placed in the water to mark temperature sensing equipment.  A bouy with a flashing light on it had been placed in the water by the State Game and Fish Department.  Realizing there was no real emergency, we were getting ready to head back south when, all of a sudden, a huge, bright object appeared just to our east and just above the hills on that side of the lake.  I could not make out a structure.  It was a very large, oblong-shaped, brilliant white light.  We commented on it and couldn&apos;t imagine what it was.  I started moving south in the patrol boat when ((name deleted))  said, &quot;((name deleted)), this thing is moving with us.&quot;  I stopped the patrol boat and the object continued just a little farther south along the ridge and then it stopped.  We started south again in the patrol boat, the object continued to parallel us.  When we got near the south end of the reservoir, the object was still with us and directly to our east.  It loo! ked like it was a little lower above the top of the ridge.  It made the top of the ridge appear as if it was almost daylight.  We could see the entire makeup of the hillside, even shadows.  At this point the object started giving ((name deleted)) and me a bad case of the &quot;creeps&quot;.  I stopped the patrol boat and we both sat and looked at the object.  I told ((name deleted)), &quot;This is getting too creepy.&quot;  So I shut of the patrol boat and turned off the running lights.  We sat in the boat quietly and just observed this extremely brilliant light.  After maybe 30 or 40 seconds the object left the area of the lake and in a split second headed north and became a tiny object someplace over Wyoming.  We watched the entire disappearance of the object.  The acceleration of the object was absolutely phenomenal and there was no sound whatsoever from the object.  I started up the patrol boat and turned on the running lights.  ((name deleted))  and I just kind of sat there and looked at each other trying to understand what happened.  When ((name deleted))  said, &quot;Do you need the publicity.&quot;  I said, &quot;No&quot;.  ((name deleted)) looked at me and said, &quot;Let&apos;s go home.&quot;  I turned the patrol boat into Thompson&apos;s Cove, tied it up to the dock and we went home.  This entire situation really shook us up a lot and I honestly don&apos;t believe we ever talked about it to each other again.  I think ((name deleted)) is now deceased and since I&apos;m now 68 years old, I think it is a good time to get this incident recorded.  At the time I did not want to talk to newspapers, radio stations, etc. and be in a position to answer any number of questions and opinions from all kinds of people.  When you are in public service the last thing you want to happen is to be caught in the middle of some kind of a controversy.  That possibility is bad enough when you are able to prove how, what, when, where, why, etc.  It would be a nightmare when, in the case of this bright object, all your proof disappeared in a split second into the night and was somewhere over Wyoming or who knows where?", "we were out camping when a bright light brought our attetion to the sky. all three of us looked up to find several beams flashing in sequence about 400 feet above us.There was no noise for the first minute,then then they started humming and zoomed off.((NUFORC Note:  No other reports from this area of Ireland for this date.

We came around a corner and saw a very bright light about a half mile away very low to the ground. When we first saw it, it was hovering over a hill top and shining a beam of light on the ground. We stopped the car to watch it for a moment. It then began to come towards us. We started moving again and it moved very fast to the other side of the road. As we traveled, it continued to move around us. At one point it stopped and hovered by us about 100 yards away. That is when I got a good look at it. In the distance it looked like a very bright light. Up close it looked like a saucer with a dome on the top of it. It was silver in color and emitted this very bright light from it. It made no sound that I could detect. It is very hard to describe the exact size of it, but it appeared to me to be at least the size of a house. Not humongous, but notsmall either. By then I was very scared and wanted to get away from the object. My daughter said she would keep an eye on it so that I could drive faster. We had at least 8 more miles to go and the thing continued to follow us all the way to the interstate. It stayed in the area for at least another minute and then vanished. I drove as quickly as I could to get to my friends house where I called my husband. He said that he would go out and look around. He called me later and said he had spoke to a friend of his that lives in the area of the sighting and that he had seen some jets flying through the canyon like they were looking for something.", "UFO hovers right above a rural house and fieldIt was 11:00pm, and I had just finished watching the TV show ER, the news was about to come on.  I lived in a house that is in a field, but surrounded by woods, it is the highest point in the town.  On a clear night it is absolutely beautiful, you can see everything in the sky, including all flight paths of planes crossing over you.  There was one person in the room with me, and my younger sisters were asleep in their room.  She exclaimed to me &quot;What is that out there over the trees?!?&quot;  The forest started maybe 1/4 mile away from the back of the house.  I looked and I figured it was just a really bright star, but then I realized I had never seen that star in that position in the sky ever.  I thought this was really odd because my family and I would lay outside and look at the stars all of the time.  I got a pair of binaculars to get a better picture of it and I saw that it wasn&apos;t just one light, like a star, it was two lights very close together, it looked like the headlights of a car.  It sat there for maybe 2 or 3 minutes, and then all of sudden it became just one light instead of two.  I sat there and watched it with this other person, who I might add firmly did not believe in aliens or UFO&apos;s, for another couple of seconds.  Suddenly, the light went straight up into the air and hoovered at this new height for another 10 or 15 seconds.  I started to run around my house, turning off all lights, TV, everything electrical that was on.  In my mind somehow I think I was afraid that if it sensed electricity or something coming from my house it would try to land, seeing that my house was the only house in the middle of this big field.  I had never experienced any thing like this, I didn&apos;t know what to do.  At this point in time all we could see of it was this &quot;headlight.&quot;  Then, it starts moving across the field in the direction of my house.  There was absolutely no noise coming from it, there was just complete silence outside.  I was standing out in the open on my back porch so that way I could clearly se! e what i t was doing; I was terrified.  It continued to move very slowly across the field, I am not sure how high it was off the ground though.  It finally crossed over the corner of my house, about 100ft. above me.  It was a circular or oval type shape, I could see a red dim outline of the craft, like it had red lights all the bottom if it. It was still completely silent.  It moved over my house and kept moving across the field, but to the left now heading towards the trees on the left of my house.  I ran to the big windows on that side of my house and saw it go over the trees.  All I could see of it now was the faint red glow.  It went up over the trees, it raised straight up again and then I could not see it any more.  The other person and I did not know what to do.  We knew that we should call somebody or report it but we didn&apos;t know who to call.  She called our local police station, they didn&apos;t really say anything.  I told my father the next day about what had happened and he confided in my that he had seen &quot;things&quot; out there at night before too, but nothing that close to the house or the ground.  That was the end of it.  I have not seen anything like that since then, I do not live there anymore, but my family still does and as far as I know nothing like that has happend again.  At the time I was 16 years old, and the other witness was about 24 or 25.  I have always thought that it was extremely possible for these things to happen, but like I had mentioned before the other witness totally did not believe in aliens or UFO&apos;s or anything like that.

One higher and one nearer to the ground.  As I passed the higher land, I lost sight of them.  When I parked my vehicle outside my home, which is on a higher elevation than where I was traveling, I no longer saw them.  I went inside my home to do my evening chores for my animals.

PD))", "White disc moves perpendicular to wind in clear sky, then suddenly disappears.I was in the back yard on a clear day today, except for a few normal contrails and cirrus clouds.  I noticed that a swarm of insects was flying over my home, following the wind direction.  I was annoyed by this, and scanned the sky to see if I could find out where they were coming from.  A few seconds later, I noticed a white circular object in the sky, almost directly overhead.  It was about half the size of a sunflower seed at arms&apos; length. It appeared to be self-luminous, since I could see no shading or shadows on its uniform white contour.  I quickly resolved that this was a rubber party balloon, and decided to watch it out of sheer amusement. Assuming that the circle was a balloon a few thousand feet up (which we can get from simple ratios, considering the size of a typical party balloon versus its projected size at arm&apos;s length), then the object&apos;s speed in radians/second, and therefore its implied speed, are within the normal range of wind speed, roughly 2-30mph.  But the analysis is not complete. First of all, 15-20 seconds into this boring event, the circle simply disappeared.  I don&apos;t mean that it stopped radiating and turned black, the way an airplane does as its reflective surfaces rotate with respect to the sun.  Rather, it disappeared, revealing the blue sky behind it.  I flipped my sunglasses on and off, scanning the sky around it, but found nothing.  There was at least a baseball-at-arms-length of steradial blue sky around the place where it had disappeared, so it could not have simply wandered behind a cloud.  I did not see any change in the object which might have presaged its disappearance; it simply ceased to exist.  I must admit, I have a Bachelor&apos;s in Physics, but my blood ran cold. But perhaps the &quot;balloon&quot; could have popped as a result of the cumulative thermal stresses of the high atmosphere on its rubber skin.   Originally, I had determined that this was the explanation, until just this evening, the following hit me, and my blood ran cold again:  I could tell from the way that the insects were sweeping over the roof that the wind was in a certain direction on the ground, about 5mph.  I could tell from the direction in which the cirrus clouds _and_ the contrails swept overhead that the wind direction was similar up high.  But the &quot;balloon&quot; had travelled in an apparently arrow-straight line roughly perpendicular to the wind direction.  So I would have to believe that the wind suddenly rotated 90 degrees, then 90 degrees again, between the ground and the cirrus clouds, which seems unlikely. I would note that this second fact also eliminates another possibility, which was that the circle was some form of exotic ball lightning emmanating from the local dormant volcano, Mount Konocti.  I have heard that such balls of light sometimes bubble out of the ground due to tectonic stress in the weeks prior to an earthquake or eruption.  Again, though, I would expect ball lightning to follow the prevailing wind pattern. I am left with these possibilities:  (1) The circle was high above the winds, i.e. in the mesosphere or higher.  It was simply a round satellite which for some reason popped of existence in an instant, without any signs of an explosion.  (2) The circle was not of this world, and either popped into hyperspace, or accelerated out of view so quickly that I thought it had simply ceased to exist. I do not think that this observation is meaningful or substantial unto itself.  I post it here just in case you get similar stories regrading this locale or time period.  I am reminded of similar white circles/balls which were observed in groups of 10-20 in the vicinity of Mount Popocatapetl(sp?) in Mexico.  I do not recall how such balls eventually disappeared from sight.", "Over a hill we had seen 4 or 5 lights in a semi-circle.  They were flashing in unison from yellow to white.  After about 2 minutes they faded and went away.  After the lights went away we climbed a hill to make sure that the lights were not coming from the ground, and sure enough we didnt find anything that could have been seen from where we were standing.  After the lights had dimmed and gone away we noticed a dark haze in the sky.  We also saw a couple airplanes flying around the area after the lights fadded.", "They&apos;re out there.

One started falling at a pace perpindicular to the ground, the other followed the trail it was previously was on.  After about 2 seconds of viewing these 2 separate objects, they disappeared from view, they faded out as if they had burned out.  The lights were bright white light.", "Stationary bright white light that turned red and appeared to envelope the object once it started to move at a high speed.This sighting occured in a rural area 4.5 miles west of Avoca, Ia. I was home on leave from the Coast Guard, and was visiting my mother and step-father who lived on a farm. Earlier in the day I went to visit a friend on his farm. My friend&apos;s farm is located in a hollow area between two hills, therefore I couldn&apos;t see much of the surrounding sky. I drove east 1.5 miles to a road that runs north and south. When I turned to go north, I started looking around, and noticed a bright white light low in the southwestern sky. The evening was crystal clear, because we had an ice storm the night before, and the night after an ice storm is usually clear. At first I thought it was an aircraft moving toward me with its landing lights on. To the southwest is Eppley Airport in Omaha, Nebraska, and Offut Air Force Base which is near Omaha. I am also an amature astronimer, and I know there were no planets or bright stars in that area of the sky on that date. I stopped the car and watched the light for a few minutes, then I drove onto the next road and turned west. As I drove home, I noticed when I crested the top of each hill, the light was still in the southwest. The object didn&apos;t appear to have moved any, because I took visual measurements using the farm yard lights near the object. When I got home I took out the binoculars, and tried to see if I could make out what it was. All I could see was a very bright white light. I put the binoculars in the house, and went back outside to watch the light. My step-father came out of the house, and wanted to go to town. The town he wanted to go to is Shelby. As we drove west down the hill I saw the bright white light go out, and the object turned to what appeared to be a reddish glow which appeared to envelop the object.  The object went from a standstill to a very high rate of speed in just a few seconds. I watched it travel north and inside of a minute or two it was gone. I said to my step-father that the bright white light that I had been watching was acting strange. It was bright white and dead still one second, then it turned red and sped off in the next second. I said to my step-father the U.S. doesn&apos;t have any aircraft that can do that. He who is one not to believe in anything strange unless it can be proved, said it was just an airplane or something. I thought it was an &quot;or something&quot;. The next day on the front page of the Council Bluffs Nonpariel newspaper was a story about the object I had seen the night before. A woman was driving with her children down a country road to her father-in-law&apos;s house to stay with him, because her house didn&apos;t have any electricity. The woman said she was driving west and saw the object. She said that when she went over the next hill, she drove right under the object. She said when she drove under the object the bright white light went out, it turned red and sped off to the north. This is occured exactly at the same time I was watching it. I will never forget this sighting as long as I live.", "There was a large number  of lights in the sky flying in geometric patterns.A night in the Fall of &apos;93 my little brother and I were driving on a county road near our home.  I am interested in the stars and as such I glanced up at the sky.  I saw what I believed to be a passenger plane flying west.  A few seconds later I witnessed an additional object flying directly toward the first.  I knew that the distance between the two would be great by differences in altitude.  Still, I watched off and on until they met.  Then amazingly enough, the second light stopped and reversed direction to follow the first.  Immediately, I stopped the car. I rolled down the widow to hear what I figured to be a low flying helicopter.  I heard no sound.  Then, the second light accelerated and began flying circles around the first.  As I watched in awe, the first light continued on its trajectory while the second stopped again.  When I took a wider view of the sky, I discovered not just one object but between thirty and fifty similar sized lights of varying colors.  They all appeared to be flying in what one could determine to be geometrical shapes.  I told my brother to get out and look.  We both stood in amazement for about five minutes watching the aerial display.  Then being only two miles from home and my small telescope, we drove on.  When we got home, we looked up to see if they were still there and discovered another light.  This light was much larger, white, and stationary.  The smaller lights would fly to the larger one, stop, and then resume the geometric ballet.  I went inside to get my telescope and my father.  My father, argueably the most skeptical man in the world, was speechless as he witnessed the show. I tried to get a better look with my telescope, but they only appeared as bright lights. After about a half an hour, they just diappeared.  I realize that this may seem odd to report five years after the event, but I had no idea who to contact until now.  I will not wager a guess as to what we saw but it is deffinately worth reporting. At the time of the event I was seventeen, my br! other tw elve, and my father forty one. I graduated valedictorian of my high school class, played several sports, attended church, and was active in community activities.

Bright light of a  fast moving craft frightened me in the night on the Oregon Coast.I moved to the ORegon coast in summer of 1984.  I am guessing the date to be in October of that year.  I was up late.  My husband was asleep in our travel trailer which we were living in at the time.  An unfinished cabin was on our property, where we had our belongings stored, and our dogs were sleeping out there.  I walked over to the cabin, checking on my pets.  There was a window facing west to the ocean.  Our place is about one quarter mile up a hillside from the beach.  I looked out the window at the night sky, which is clear and pretty there when it is cold.  A point of light in the sky began to grow rapidly.  There was no sound at all. It grew brighter and larger, and closer.  I cannot tell you how I know that it was closer, I just know. For some reason it made me afraid (other than it was unusual)  The dogs moved from the middle of the room and crouched against the west wall, to the left of the window, looking upwards at the window and whining.  I could not hear any sound, but it seemed that they could.  The light grew so bright, it seemed to spread outward from a center point and lit up the entire sky.  Again, I don&apos;t know why I was so afraid, but I crouched down in the corner with the dogs against that west wall, so that I could not possibly be seen from the &quot;sky&quot;.  This &quot;object&quot; seemed to be now very low in the sky.  From peeking out the window from time to time, it was my impression that it was moving very slowly to the north, but very near to the tree line.  Then the light seemed to be &quot;sucked in&quot; to the center point again. Then what was left at the center concentration moved suddenly and extremely fast in a Northwest direction and was gone out of my sight.  The dogs would not come out of the corner for some time.  I was afraid, and went back to the trailer and woke up my husband to tell him what I had seen.  He didn&apos;t take me seriously and just went back to sleep.  Eventually I managed to get back to sleep.  In the morning, I heard a radio report from the Salem area (towards the center of! the Sta te, about 70 miles away) that lots of people had called in the night before reporting seeing lights.  They were making fun of the reports, and I didn&apos;t hear anything else about it. If I could liken the craft to something that was normal I would describe it as a helicopter search light, except there was dead silence, and the light was so incredibly bright and actually &quot;grew&quot; outward to fill the sky.  I felt like it was &quot;searching&quot; for something.  dumn, I know, but it is the only way I can describe it.  I guess I got scared because my instinct told me not to let myself be seen.&hellip;", "They were dancing in the sky and the air was VERY coldit was REALLY cold that night...frost the next morning, which is very unusual here... it wasn&apos;t like space craft, they were small and bright like stars...and they would hover and then move three steps, and you could actually SEE their faces and they had legs... it was like they were dancing in the sky... and they were making this high pitched noise...the most incredible sight I have ever seen... I look for them every night... has anyone else seen something like this?", "3 hovering/slow moving objects in Dallas, TX, during rush hour.I was walking into a friends apartment complex in downtown Dallas, TX, and looked into the sky and saw what I initially thought was someone parachuting out of a plane at a very high altitude. There were 2 objects in the sky at the time between 45 and 65 degrees off the horizon. One closer (the parachute) and the other was further away (what I thought was the plane). I thought that this guy was crazy because this was in the middle of Dallas and it was very high up. This was going to be on the evening news for sure. I ran inside and got my friend who came out and I showed him and what appeared to be a parachute. When I returned it changed into a circular silver/white object that didn&apos;t represent the first object that I had seen, but still remained in the same location. I was gone about 15 seconds. The two objects matched each other now in color, size and movement. I asked my friend what do you think it is.. He said &quot;a plane of course.&quot; We turned around and I showed him a plane in the sky that was moving at a high altitude 180 degrees from the location of the objects. No comparison. The two objects were moving very slowly together in a northerly direction. Their movements were very calm and not jittery. I asked my friend if he had some binoculars or a zoom camera. He brought out a Nikon 35mm with a non-zoom lens. I was able to capture pictures of the objects, but not as close as I wish. I captured several pictures of the two objects and as they continued to move slowly across the sky an identical 3rd object appeared. Within 4 minutes all 3 objects were no longer visible. The sighting lasted a total of 10 minutes. I was able to capture about 5 pictures. Pictures will be sent in this evening (I hope!).", "I was sittingin my fathers car to take him home from work.

On this particular evening I was in the basement when I felt a low rumble, I dismissed it at first thinking it was just a passing jet, but when it continued past a minute or so, I went upstairs to investigate.  I had personally seen and heard of many strange things from the farm kids around town, but I had never seen anything like this.  It was a sort of triangular shaped craft that didn&apos;t appear to be more than 50 feet above the roof line of houses, and hovered with quite a bit of force exerted on the ground, yet with little sound (if that makes sense when written).  I watched the object for another 20-45 seconds hover, or slowly advance, and then it left extrememly quickly out of sight, not up to space, but straight along the plains towards Garden City.  As I have said, I had watched the aircraft on the flight plan since I was 7, and have never seen an aircraft behave like this, Perhaps this is an undiscovered hotspot?  It makes sense to me in the fact that Western Kansas has little population and most people are on farmers&apos; hours (early to bed, early to rise) after 10pm, life all but ceases to exist.  Also, with a large stretch of flat lands and hardly anything above a two story building, it would be easy to move low to the ground and avoid radar.

I must have been starring up into the sky do south looking for anything such as meteorites, constellations, I had been scanning the southern sky for about 20 minutes when I suddenly realised that there was a patch of the sky that was starless. At first I didnt recognise anything beyond that until I watched that area a few more seconds when this very large triangular ship materialized right in front of me. Its hard to explain but it was like-cloaked in such a way that at first you could stare right at it you wouldnt see it but when I focused on it I could easily see it. This craft was very close. Estimate size 200ft. I would estimate 60 yards away. Light eminated from it as if it had a low glow to it. No specific lights only the craft itself was lightly ablase. This led me to believe that its stealth quality was do to its ambient light equal to the light from the stars and street lights. Anyway I could make out the ships color which was a light brown or tan similar to the camoflage color used in the Military for desert combat. It was in a position gaining altitude at least a 45 degree angle and yaued left pitch where I had a good view of its top surface but not its bottom. It was perfectly silent as it moved gracefully and slowly at first. Estimate 20 mph. Then the higher it got and further  from my position it picked up incredible speed. It winked out of vision withen a few seconds heading in a due southerly direction. I was able to make out some details in the ships design such as rounded edges and the triangular shape was very slightly ovate in that it had a slight concave curve to its over-all body. It appeared very high tech and what I would expect to see in our own technology withen a few hundred years.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was hot out and we had all the windows and drapes open. I was watching TV. My mom took the trash out by the front door and after a moment she came racing back through the house and out the back door, she didn&apos;t say anything to me at first and she didn&apos;t even shut the back sliding screen door. I was into my TV show and only just sort of noticed her odd behavior. After a moment, she began to call my name in a frantic tone of voice. I jumped up and ran to the back yard. I looked up where she was looking and couldn&apos;t help but see this huge, and I mean huge oval shaped thing that was just glowing with a yellow white light. It was right over our heads, but didn&apos;t light up the back yard or cast the light at all, even though it was like the brightest thing in the world. It made NO sound at all. My mom yelled for our neighbors, next door (their lights were also on). They came out and the four of us just kept looking at it, I don&apos;t remember us talking much at the time. After watching it a while, I could see that the glowing lights did seem like individual lights not just one huge light. It was bigger than a blimp size, more like 3 or 4 large blimps, but the wrong shape to be a blimp. The sky was very clear and there was no sound at all. Suddenly, it just took off toward the west, toward the beach area. It was as if one moment it was over our back yard and the next moment it was gone.

As I live in the city of Los Angeles, I am quite familliar with the presence of helicopters in my day-to-day life. I happened to notice one such helicopter ahead of me as I drove in a south-eastern direction. I paid special attention because I noticed that the &quot;spot light&quot; was on. This was of particular concern to me due to the fact that a lit spot light on the freeway could mean that there is a police chase in the nearby vicinity and caution my be exercised. I kept my eye on the craft as I drove and I began to notice that the spot wasn&apos;t acutally on at all. In fact, I noticed that the helicopter seemed to be hovering through the air very slowly and smoothly. I then noticed that what I had mistaken for a spotlight was simply one very large white light. Further, I noticed that the craft had NO BLADES. The altitude of the craft was approximately twice that of what a normal helicopter would be navigating at, yet the craft, itself, was large enough to where my perspective of it&apos;s altitude was skewed due to it&apos;s size. Alarmed, I began driving directly underneath the craft and looked up to see that it APPEARED to be triangular in shape and had a series of ODDLY-COLORED lights flashing on it&apos;s underside.

A woman who sounded like she was in her late 30&apos;s-early 40&apos;s called in to ask if anyone else had reported an unusual light in the west. The station&apos;s talk show host disregarded the caller, but I ran outside and looked to the west. It was a very clear night sky. Low on the western horizon was a very bright light that was magnitude 1 in brightness compared to the rest of the night sky. It was very slowly drifting to the north-northwest. After getting a winter jacket, I ran from my backyard to a better vantage point. I positioned myself on the Capital Blvd. bridge over I-5 and sighted the object in the west. It was just sitting low on the horizon and after a few minutes, it would drift north and then stop again. The bright light was white in nature with an impression of red, but at my distance it was difficult to tell. I am familiar with the flight patterns of aircraft taking off from the Olympia airport to the south and I noticed that several planes had taken off, but changed their flight patterns from the normal pattern that would have taken them within close proximity of the object in the west. The planes were all banking sharply to the northeast. After about 10 minutes, the object had drifted behind some evergreens in the foreground. I decided to run back home for a pair of binoculars. Upon reaturning the object was no longer in view from the bridge. I changed position but still didn&apos;t see the object again. I did notice that several more aircraft had taken off and still they veered to the east.

Since I live near a Marine Air Station, I thought nothing of it. I went out to my truck to get my keys at about midnight. On my way in I saw the three sets of lights again moving toward the coast in a stop and go pattern. They looked to be the same as earlier. What got my attention was that they were flying close enough that if they were Hornet&apos;s I would have heard them. Also the stop and go movement, the changing of formation, and the lights. What I mean is, I was stationed at MCAS Beaufort and I have never seen lights on an aircraft that flickered like these. I watched for about 30 minutes as they made there way over towards the the twon of Beaufort. They were so close that I could see the objects rotate and almost flip without breaking their formation. I just went outside and the dogs around the neighborhood are going nuts, but it is really quiet. They are just barking away. I know the air station has a few helicopters(CH-46&apos;s) and I know the sound they make. There was no sound but what ever they were stopped and accelerated with no noticeable noise. I called MCAS to enquire but was hung up on.

They were there for about 5 more minutes before both of them started moving together very slow toward the South. 5 minutes later about 45 degress above the horizon looking south toward the objects 1 started to move toward the West and 1 continued on South a few more minutes and then started heading directly South. We observed the South bound object for 25 more minutes before it was not visable to the naked eye any longer.  The West bound object started to get obscurred by the bright sunshine and was never seen again that we could see after about 3 minutes it headed toward the West. Visability was cear and unlimited and not a breeze of wind to be felt. I did take a look at the objects with magnified eye pieces and thought i would clearly see a high alltitude weather balloon but thiis was not the case.  There appeared to be sorta like shock waves given off by the objects and every second they would go from a oval circle shape to a football shape of form. No aircraft of any kind was seen during this 1 hour period viewing these objects.

I was driving my girlfriend home one night, on Humboldt Rd. just passed over the highway heading away from the city. As we were driving up to the left I saw this circular light. The best way I can describe it would be that of light coming out of a lampshade that angles downward. This object was not very high, had absolutely no other lights such as a tail light on helicopters or any wing lights, and made absolutely no sound, or no sound we were aware of. The object travelled exactly the same speed as traffic. As soon as I saw it and realized it wasn&apos;t a glare or reflection I asked my girlfriend what the hell that was. She looked and watched it in awe. As we drove down the road watching it, it suddenly literally just took off. Instantly flew forward out of view, I&apos;ve never seen anything move so fast in my life. It was very eerie, I felt excited because I knew I saw something that is very rare to see and something some people simply can&apos;t believe exists as they haven&apos;t experienced it themselves. I dropped her off and she too was shocked and knew she saw a &quot;UFO&quot;. I haven&apos;t seen anything of that nature since. However, in summer of &apos;99 I was swimming in the backyard of a friends house around 3-4 a.m. when we saw a blinking light as far as the stars. Now, this blinking light we found very odd, especially the individual whose pool it was because he watches the stars a lot, because this light changed direction numerous amounts of times. We would watch this light blink once in one area of the sky. About a minute later it traveled I would say the length of the big dipper and blinked again. Then another minute later it would blink up in a total different area as it had changed course. We watched this object for approximately 20-30 minutes. Very odd.((NUFORC Note:  Date, time, and duration of sighting all appear to be approximate.

At first sight, I thought maybe it was an airplane but upon further examination it clearly wasn&apos;t an airplane.  I think my first words where &quot;what kind of airplane is that?&quot; or &quot;what the heck is that?&quot; as I pointed the object out to my cousin. The object appeared burnt-orange or amber in color.  There were no distinguisable lights or strobes on this object as you would see on an airplane or helicopter.  The whole object appeared to be dimly illuminated and slightly shimmering or hazy.  Although the object seemed fairly close, the manner in which this object was illumination made it very difficult to determine exactly what shape it was.  I would have to identify it as triangular shaped and it appeared to have a flat bottom surface. When we first saw the object it was just slightly in front of us and traveling away from us in an east, northeast direction.  At one point, as the object was moving away, i thought the back of the object seemed to have the shape of a boomerang with the ends pointing down.  The object was traveling in a very smooth, fluid-like motion and was completely silent.  It was also traveling deceptively fast too.  Upon first sight the object was roughly the size of the finger nail on my pinky finger held at arms length but in about 5 seconds it had traveled far enough to appear as a mere point of light.  As we were both watching this thing in disbelief and trying to figure out what it was it instantly shifted directions and was heading north for about 1 second the shifted directions again and was heading east for about 1 more second until it vanished from sight.  I have never seen any plane or helicopter on television or in real life that could change directions so rapidly.  We were both completely awestruck by what we witnessed that night and I have been thinking about it o! n a dail y basis ever since.", "Bright amber/orange spherical light moving erratically at nightAmber/orange spherical light that moved erratically from a distance of approx. 400 metres away at about 500 to 1000 feet altitude towards me. It was off to my right above the terraced houses of an inner city area of Cambridge, England.  On a still windless night with low cloud and drizzle there was no noise. The movement was sometimes quite quick and at other times it remained still for minutes. At the time I was arriving home at ((address deleted)) Road in the east of the city and was looking upwards over roof tops in the direction of the suburb of Cherry Hinton.  I could not take my eyes off the object for fascination until it moved out of sight becoming too low over the houses to the south for me to continue watching it. I had been drinking alcohol during the evening but have no doubt that my senses were not being deceived.  It was a very sobering experience.  I have told very few people about the incident in the intervening years for the reason that I do not wish to seem like I am making up a fanciful story. I record in your form above the date of 11/11/1974.  In fact I cannot recall the exact date but it was in the early hours of a Thursday morning between November, 1974 and February 1975.

It was my girlfriend who noticed the 2nd craft. The sky was clear, and sunny and as the craft were illuminating a bright white light, that also appeared rather odd.", "Sphere with SpikesComing home for Christmas on 12/27/99 my brother and I were driving east on Interstate 80 over the Sierra Nevada Mountains, when I noticed a large bright light coming of the mountain top, coming from the south. As the object came closer it appeared to get larger, very bright, and spikes coming out of it. I was the passenger in the car, my brother driving. I couldn`t believe what I`m seeing, so I told my brother who is driving to look to right up the mountain. I needed him to view the object because his eyes are better than mine. He seen everything I did and confirmed what I was looking at. Of course I viewed it longer, because he had to drive. I was getting a little scared at what I was seeing because it was getting closer to us. Well we lost sight of it at that point, because of our distance traveling. We did see the object one more time about three miles more up the road, but at more of a distace away. Then if disapeared. I would say this object was at least, 300 yards in diameter. The strange part of all this is, we forgot about seeing this object. It wasn`t until 4 months later that it popped back into my head. I can home that day and asked my brother about it again, he said he forgot about it also, untill I had reminded him of the event. about me:I`m 44 years old and Iv`e worked for General Motors for the last 23 years, and I consider myself very level headed, as for my brother.", "a flap opened on the craft and beings walked outWhen i was cycling one night in march 1980 i saw a very bright light in the sky circle shaped i was sitting on my bike one minuite and then i saw a craft in front of me a flap like door opened and some beings walked towards me they were approximetly 6ft tall there were about 5-6 beings they had oval heads and black oval eyes there bodies were a grey colour.

It was a clear night, no cloud cover. My middle brother and I were sittimg on the left hand side of the airplane just behind the wing area. I first noticed what appeared to be a rocket with a short fire trail coming from the left and from behind us. I immediately got my brother&apos;s attention and as the rocket got closer to us it became larger and the fire trail behind it grew longer. After watching this happen for about a minute the rocket was approaching towards us faster and faster. After watching this for 20 seconds we both got our father&apos;s attention who was sitting a few isles in front of us on the other side of the plane. He got out of his seat and came over and we showed him the rocket. He then called my mom, my youngest brother, and a family friend of ours to come over to our side of the plane and look out the window in order to see this object too. By the time they all got out of their seats and saw the object, approximately 45 seconds of time had elapsed since the beginning when I first saw it. By this time the rocket appeared much larger and was located just a hundred feet from the end of the wing. Instantaneously, the rocket fizzled out and changed shape into a &quot;typical flying saucer.&quot; The saucer remained just off the end of the wing tip and then several white lights appeared in the middle of the craft; they looked similar to small windows. The craft then expelled a bunch of white sparkling lights and fire trails (simliar to sparklers) and then emitted all kinds of different colored lights that flew in all directions. Then the craft  literally disinegrated before our eyes and vanished, but I should note that it streaked away from the airplane while it vanished. The whole sequence of events lasted over a minute. Furthermore, we immediately questioned the flight attendants about it and one or two of them said! they sa w the craft too. Shortly thereafter they inquired the pilots about the event. They told us that the pilots responded to them by saying that they had personally not seen the craft or the event, but that they were contact by 2 or 3 other commercial aircraft flying nearby who reported they saw an unidentified aircraft flying close to our airplane. They wanted to know what was going on. Our pilots said they never saw the object(s).((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It would be hard to estimate the altitude but I would guess 5-10 miles.  The craft/jet trails were positioned where it appeared that had the craft been moving, it would be travelling from north to south. As stated above the jet trails were white in color but were unusually short, much shorter than what is commonly seen.  From my perspective, they were both an inch to an inch an half in length. Additionally, they did not appear to disperse from the effects of the wind, as would normally be expected. The jet trails were not close together, separated by about 15-20 degrees horizontally. Since I was driving a vehicle, I had to divert my view briefly in order to drive safely.  At one point, I looked up and the plane/jet trail to my right completely disappeared!

Since the incident I have been keenly interested in military technology and the UFO phenomenon. I have always sought an explaination as to what I observed but so far have been unsatisfied. I was staying up late with a younger child.  I believe it was a summer night about 1:30 or so in the morning.  I don&apos;t think we were supposed to be up but when you are that age and you have a friend over you sometimes want to stay up all night and play.  My bedroom window faced north just outside a highway and I was looking outside at the sky and hills when I noticed an airplane.  I would guess now that it was 5 miles out?  The airplane was rather odd however.  Instead of the alternating red/green wing strobes it had 2 red strobing lights evenly spaced that flashed slowly and simultaneously.  I became very interested because I had never seen an airplane at night that had lights like that.  I watched for a while and it seemed like the aircraft was floating in the air.  It was moving (north-south), but every airplane I had seen fly before would have passed over by then (I had been watching for maybe 5 mins.)  I wanted to know what kind of airplane it was!  I opened the window hoping to hear any engine noise.  Was it a jet or rotory craft?  as it came closer over the window, I turned off the light partly out of fear partly to cut the glare from the room light.  Fear.  I still couldn&apos;t make out the shape, just the lights.  I began to stop thinking it was an airplane.  I was very afraid but excited and curious at the same time.  The object was just overhead.  I cannot remember the silhouette.  But it must have been 200ft overhead just gliding over slowly lights blinking.  Absolutely no noise!  I could have ridden my bicycle faster than it was traveling.  My friend saw it too, but I don&apos;t remember his reaction.  As soon as it left my field if view (directly over the roof), I ran to my parent&apos;s bedroom.  I wanted an adult to see it!  They told me to go to bed.  I rushed out the front door I was no loger afraid, I wanted to see it closer.  At the rate of speed it was going it should have still been over the roof.  When I went outside the night was still and quiet and the object was gone. I have seen all kinds of airplaned since.  Blimps, ultralights have motors...  Other airplanes have engines that make much more noise.  I have seen a jet at night with only a single red strobe, but never two that flash slowly and simultaneously.  Now that I know more about aircraft, I realize that at that altitude and speed it should have stalled.  It couldn&apos;t have been going more than 15mph. I wish I had more visual details to report.  Many years have gone by and it was night.  The memory still strikes me.  I hope taht someday I will find a decent explaination but I am afraid I will never find one.

Visibility was about 20 feet. While sitting on my car hood on a known turn out with at least a 100 foot drop off past the guard rail, we realized the crickets in the area became very quiet. A few seconds later we were illuminated by a intense light beam. I looked at the light and saw it was mounted on some type of bracket with a dark projection below it resembling a boom microphone. We ran for the drivers door of my car and as we entered the car the light turned off and the fog swirled as if a large oblect left upward. At no time during the encounter did I hear anything.

One really bright light, which i thought was Venus or something.It was stable and really bright, very high in the sky.About 1 minute later, a second light appeared right next to the other bright light, equally bright. My friend suggested it might be a wing-light to a plane that was turning directions or something, but as he said that, the lights dimmed and began moving quickly in different directions. They were moving pretty fast and eventually they began following each other but at a distance, changing to much dimmer lights. They were not planes. I know that.

From the perspective of the movies the helicopter sounded large and POWERFUL...like a &apos;huey&apos;...the only light on the copter was a single small red light...I&apos;m not sure of the location on the copter because my attention was fully focused on the orange light which by then had moved completely out of sight.

While outside watching birds with my wife, I was scanning the sky when I noticed what I at first took to be the bird we were looking for. Then I thought it was a small plane circling high overhead. It wasn&apos;t a bird. No movement of wings, it was a distinctive plane shape, rigid. That&apos;s what I used the &quot;cross&quot; shape; it&apos;s the closest description. I took a second look because several things bothered me: the object did not appear to be that high for its size. It wasn&apos;t a private plane. I can&apos;t explain that well. It just felt wrong. It seemed too small, and I started thinking it was a remote controlled device. But it seemed too high for that. There was no one near us however, and there was no sound at all, not the sound of a plane in the distance or that distinctive whine of a remote controlled toy plane. This is a quiet summer day in the country, and the object was over a empty field. You can hear planes all the time, from jets to smaller craft. I saw a private plane fly overhead during this time, and the difference was obvious. If this is all that happened, I would assume it was only one of the above: a high flying small plane, or a remote controlled plane. I wouldn&apos;t have thought much about it at all. But what it did next was very strange. I noted that it was flying lazy circles, like a bird, but a very rigid flight. That&apos;s why I could observe it for so long. Suddenly, the object &quot;took off&quot; shooting toward the northwest in a straight line. It disappeared from sight well down the road to the highway, OH route 66. It went very fast, gone in a second, and again, it was a perfectly straight flight path. Not the swooping movement of a bird. It shot off, like a gun fired it. It did not descend or make any bird-like movements. No noise, and it went too far for it to be a remote controlled toy. It astounded me. I don&apos;t claim that it&apos;s a UFO, but well, I can&apos;t explain it away, and it did not act anything like I expected it. It flew very fast and did not deviate from the direct line. My wife did not observe this part of it, and in fact focused on another object that was a bird, so she had stopped observing my object a few minutes before.", "I was walking home from work, and was within a block from home.

My sighting was made in the parking lot of my apartment building on a very clear early night sky. Traveling in a more or less straight line from west to east were two lights in close proximity, one red, one white. They were blinking on and off in rapid stroboscopic fashion. As they moved at a fairly fast rate of speed (faster than a jetliner trailing contrails) the lights moved in unison in rapid jinking or zig zag movements along the straight flight path axis. The very swift directional zig zags veered of the flight path axis about 20 degrees above and below the flight path. Directional movement angles were extremely high, approximately 60 to 90 degrees every one or two seconds. I watched these lights move along the fairly straight flight path for approximately 30 seconds until they disappeared behind the roofline of my apartment building. What caught my eye away from the bright light of Venus was the rapid and severe directional zig zags of the lights as they moved forward. Their changes in direction were instantaneous. I&apos;ve never seen a light or discernible object in the sky make such quick movements. There was no shape or object visible in the darkening sky, only the white and red lights moving as a unit. I am a writer and illustrator who specializes in aviation and space technology and history. I&apos;ve had 6 books published on the history and technology of aircraft and 8 books on space exploration technology/history and astronomy. I am very knowledgeable about the flight capabilities of existing (officially acknowledged)aircraft and spacecraft. No current aircraft or spacecraft is capable of the very quick directional movements that I observed. I don&apos;t know what the lights were, but they were not the lights of any known vehicle.

I observed it for 15 seconds or so and lost sight of it as I went lower into the valley.  I know the area well so I know the object was over the stadium or very close to it.  It would have been 200 to 300 feet long to see it at that distance, about the size of the blimp.  It seemed odd at the time that it would be there because it was too cold for any event and none were in season. When I could view the  stadium area again, in only two or three minutes, it was gone.

One night while viewing stars with his four inch scope he came accross a ball shaped object hovering in space. The ball was large enough in his small lense so that he could actually see some sort of hyroglific writting on the object. He desperately wanted to go in and get his larger ten inch scope but did not leave for fear of losing sight of the object completely.

I decide to go out for a little walk to stretch my legs at about 21:30 (9:30pm). As I was walking west on the enterance road I happened to look up and saw a ball of light come out from behind a building to my right. This ball of light was a very bright white and was approximately 1 mile to the northwest of me about 300 feet in the air, possibly a little higher. The ball of light was traveling from the north to the south at a speed I would estimate at about 200-250 miles per hour. As the ball of light was approaching the centre city area, it all of a sudden did what I think to be a 90 degree turn and go straight up into the air for about 200-300 feet. This ball of light hovered for a second in one position and then came back down to its previous position and proceeded back off to the north towards Scranton, PA. By the time I got to where I can look to the north, the ball of light was gone and never saw it again. What I found very surprising is that the ball of light took the same track out that it came in on. There was no noise with this ball of light. It was just a ball of white light, no other colors in with it. There was no streak or trail behind it. I am not aware of anything in the world that can do such a perfect maneuver without some variation off of its track. I would estimate the size of this object to be like extending your arm and holding a little rubber super ball or a quarter in the air. I asked around to other people I was working with that night, if they saw anything but they said no. I know I was not seeing things. Some people say maybe your mind was playing tricks on you but I don&apos;t think that is it. Like I said, it was pretty early in the evening about 2130 hrs.

PD))My oldest sister was born at Walker AFB (Roswell) NM in 1952, I was born there as well in 1954.  My Dad, now deceased, was an Air Force Air Policeman and worked nights on the flightline at Walker.  Sometime between 52 and 54 a UFO landed on the flightline at Walker.  My mother told me of the morning he came home from work and he was terribly excited and at the same time freightened about something that had happened on the flightline that night.  He said a large unidentified craft landed directly on the flightline that night.  They had surrounded it for several hours.  There was no contact between the occupants and the base officials.  Finally, just as suddenly as it landed it took off and was gone.  Everyone who had been present for the event and had been told that the incident was to be classified top secret and that they would not speak of it to anyone. It also interesting to note that when my mother told me about this she said that during the time they were stationed at walker no one had ever mentioned the original Roswell incident.  That they heard about it years later on TV.  Seems odd that they would be there 3 or 4 years after the original event and no one ever talked about it even in passing.", "Close encounter in Texas, missing time.We were staying at a friends in the country outside Van Alstyne, Texas and we were sitting outside looking at the woods out back.

We had a lantern out over the water to attract the fish.  It was dead quiet and no breeze whatsoever.  My father-in-law and I shifted around in our small boat and ended up virtually back to back (east to west).  The fish had quit biting for some reason, so we tried to get comfortable and be real quiet hoping the fishing frenzy we had just experienced would return.  My eyes started wandering from my fishing rod when I looked up and saw directly over me an &quot;orb&quot; moving incredibly fast.  It was perfectly round and I mean perfectly.  It was divided in half by bright &quot;colors&quot;.  I believe the blue was in the front (or the direction it was heading)and the red in back.  Perception wise, it looked about half the size of the way a full moon looks to the naked eye when it close to the horizon.  . It was almost directly above me, possibly a little to my right or south.  I watched it fly by at an incredible and steady speed. What made the experience even more awesome was that it appeared just above the clouds.  There were a few small cumulus type clouds slowly passing overhead.  Each time the object passed over one of these clouds, it lit the cloud up and turned it a beautiful red and blue (the whole cloud) for about a fraction of a second.  To see those clouds light up one by one as the object streaked by was unbelievable.  What made it seem even more eerie was the fact the there was absolutely no sound from the object and everything else remained perfectly still.  It disappeared on the horizon somewhere pass the trees and I just sat there in disbelief.  It was then that my father-in-law finally broke the silence and said something about how &quot;God really knew what he was doing....etc. And I broke in and said &quot;Did you see that&quot;.  I immediately told him that we had just seen a UFO and he said he wasn&apos;t sure what it was, but we both agreed it was an awesome sight.  Before we could discuss it much further.  The wind picked up and clouds rolled in! at an a larming rate. We barely got the engine started when all hell broke loose and we almost got blown off the lake.  We managed to get to shore safely in a full blown thunderstorm.

I called a neighbor and he said that he couldn&apos;t see it because of trees in his yard but his brother in law had seen the same type of object earlier (unknown if earlier was earlier that night or another day).  My neighbor immediately asked if I had seen the different colored lights that I previously described.  After speaking with my neighbor, the object seemed to either move further in the distance or had dropped and then faded out of sight.  The object had 5 or 6 very long and sharp pointed arms.  The red and blue lights were around the center.", "The object my friend and I saw was two huge red ball like objects with a long neon blue trail.The sky lit up for about a minute and all of a sudden two huge looking balls of fire flew over the mountains with long neon bright blue tails.

I do not recall the exact property, but looking at a map, and recalling a brook that passed through the farm, I would say that I was on the south side of Rte 253 right where the brook crosses 253.  After a day of helping around the farm, just after dark, I was sitting leisurely on the grass against an embankment  facing the highway.  The hill I was leaning against sets back about 3-400 yds from the road. I was chatting with a young lady that joined me there as a guest. I was 19 and she was about 24.  As we spoke I noticed what appeared to be the wing lights of a small plane, above the hills which are beyond the highway. The lights looked to be about a mile or so away at that time. The lights came directly over the road and over the farm toward us. They took quite a while (perhaps 5 minutes)to reach the farm area and by that time I had surprisingly noticed that there was nothing but space between the two lights.  A plane that travels at 60 mph would have taken only a minute to get to us.  They were glowing a subdued dark orange, were about 12-15 feet in diameter with maybe 40 feet separating them. They were not discs, but were spherical.  They made an almost inaudible crackling noise like static electricity and appeared that way too. The two balls went directly over our heads perfectly parallel and side-by-side bearly skimming over the hill I had been leaning against, which is to my memory, about 2-300 ft up. They passed over us without slowing down, but they were moving at only about 10 mph.  Immediately trailing the two spheres were like a static-y charge, like a kind of faint sparkle. Stunned for a few moments as I realize what we had seen, I ran inside the mobile home there, which was the camp kitchen and screamed about what I&apos;d just seen.  The couple of folks that were there were busy and thought I saw something way up in the sky.  So I ran back outside and there were still 2 trails where the two UFOs had p! assed ov er.  I never pursued any action, nor did I call police or any authorities.  What I saw was real, and very close. Twenty years after the fact I want to know what I saw!((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

My cousin and I, both 13 at the time, observed a large round &quot;saucer&quot; type object over the highway while staying at a nearby campground. The object was observed while gathered around a campfire. We were singing songs with approximately 10 other &quot;campers&quot;. It was about 8:00 in the evening. Someone noticed the object in the sky and we all stopped singing and became entranced with the object. It was very Large, perhaps 100 yards wide, and had lights all around it. (It looked like a &quot;UFO&quot; looks in most hollywood movies) The object just hovered over the highway and campground for what seemed to be a half hour or more. In that time no one said a word and we all were motionless and entranced with the object. The few cars that were on the highway at the time the object appeared had come to a complete stop and no other cars appeared. It seemed as tho time were standing still ...other than the fact that we could plainly see the object and that we were aware of our surroundings. After the object began to move away, everything went back to &quot;normal&quot;. The singing was started again and the cars on the highway took off. No one mentioned the object we had just seen. Later that night, I woke up and got out of our tent to use the restroom. I then observed the object several miles away in the sky, did my business, then just went back to sleep. My cousin and I did not discuss this at all until approximately 5 years later. (and have since discussed it about every 5 years or so) We both recalled seeing it and all the same details of the &quot;sighting&quot;, and, to this day we are 100% convinced that we what we seen was most definitely some form of &quot;alien&quot; spacecraft. We did not see little green men and don&apos;t recall being &quot;abducted&quot; but we are sure this happened and would like others to know!((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

PD))Observed bright light at close range, amasing movement, then hovered and my vehicle quit and lost all electrical system.I was 25 yrs. old at the time, married, 1 child, worked in the automotive field, licensed pilot. Was working late at the shop and upon heading home(12:30-1 a.m.) I stopped at intersection of hwy 91 leaving town. Intersection is on top of a hill or plateau w/ a small private airstrip directly across the highway. I glanced to my right before pulling onto the highway and noticed a single bright light approaching slowly from the east at approx. 1000 feet AGL. I first thought someone was possibly going to try to land as it was noticeably descending and it looked like a aircraft landing light. (I am a pilot and had a friend who had his airplane hangered there.) Thought it unusual as there are no runway lights. I waited thinking I would shine my headlights down the runway if he circled to land. The light crossed in front of me at about 300-400 feet AGL, I thought, this nut is going to try it. At the same time as it passed directly over the airport hangers, it drops instantly into the valley that drops off the plateau immediately west of the hangers. It went strait down to within a couple feet off the ground FAST and then flew west across the small valley at a speed several hundred mph in a zigzag pattern still hugging the ground. I sat open mouthed. At the other side of the valley was a stand of tall cottonwoods and it flew right up to them and then did another 90 degree strait up without slowing down to a height of probably 1500 feet AGL and went west a short distance and appeared to stop in midair. I sat for a minute astounded by what I had just witnessed, and then turned west on the highway still watching it sit there. (I lived two miles west on the highway) I drove to within 1/8th mile of my house and stopped on the side of highway when it appeared to be strait north of me approx. 3/4 mile. I got out of the car to get a better look at it and to see if I could hear any type of sound from it. It was silent, I thought about shutting off my engine to get complete silence, but decided it might be wiser to leave it running. I stood and watched it for several minutes, it never moved and I had an eerie feeling like it was watching me also. I remember I was lighting a cigarett! e when s uddenly my car QUIT!! Didn&apos;t miss or stumble, just quit like I shut off the key. Goose bumps rushed over me as I was a mechanic by trade and that car NEVER, EVER quit before since new. I looked down into the car and there were no dashlights, no digital clock, engine/oil lights...nothing! I reached in and pulled the headlight switch on...nothing. I knew the battery was only 2 mo&apos;s old (multimiles best 5 yr. batt.) and I thought this can&apos;t be happening to me. I walked to the front of the car and the light was still sitting there motionless. Scared/angry, I yelled at it not to even Think about it! and began walking toward my house 1/8 mile away. I reached home and still it never moved, went in the house, sat in the chair and chain smoked two cigarettes while watching it out the window, never moved so I went to bed. I awoke about 4 a.m., got up, looked out the window and it was gone. Got up next morning, I walked back to my car, thinking, this will tell the story, actually hoping it wouldn&apos;t start, proving that it was just coincidence, got in it, stuck the keys in the ignition and turned them...lights, buzzers, everything...tried starting it, it started instantly, I shut it off and it started instantly again. I never could make out any shape of the craft or whatever it was, just a steady bright white light, didn&apos;t pulsate or change colors or anything like that. It should be noted that for a year or so before that and after that, there were cattle mutilations being reported in central Nebraska.  Don&apos;t know if there is any connection. Later that summer I personaly witnessed one about 4 miles west of my house. A white charlia cow, a &quot;perfect&quot; 4-5 inch hole where they removed the sexual organs in the rear, and a perfect 4-5&quot; hole in its chest in front where they removed the heart. The cow was still sitting in it&apos;s sleeping position with it&apos;s head curled around as if it was still sleeping. It never awoke or moved, no sign of any struggle, no blood anywhere! Not on it or near it. None! several other people saw it also, along with Greeley co. sheriff. There were no tracks of any kind around it, happened on a saturday nite/sunday morning.

However, I have always had a lingering, unexplained fear of the area where it occurred. Things have gotten rather muddled over the years, but the elements I distinctly remember are standing in the back yard with my mother at about age 2 years old, while an fiery yellow- white orb, about 10 feet in diameter, came down and hovered about 2 or 3 feet off the ground in front of us. After a little while, it flew away in a kind of wavy motion toward the southeast. I also seem to remember laying in bed afterwards while my mom spoke to a policeman at the front door. I&apos;m not sure how this could have actually happened. I am sure my mother does not remember it. Our neighbors would have had to have seen such a thing. And I doubt very much whether a police report of the incident exists. All the same, I have always been afraid to go in our back yard at night. When I was about 6, we added a family room onto the back of the house, and the area it was built on was the same area where the event occurred. I have always felt very nervous going into that room at night. Still, I don&apos;t think I &quot;remembered&quot; the details of this event until I was about 11 or so and started hearing about UFOs, so it may be some kind of false memory.

There appeared to be about 5 lights on each side.   I think at the same time.  The lights were a white color, nothing unusual.  There were trees in the way and we were trying to find a place to pull over so we could just watch this thing, by the time we went up and over the hill (lost sight of it behind the trees), it was gone.

It was quite high up, and appeared to be a bright star.  But, the object darted back and forth, keeping in the same general area of the sky.  It being July 4th, we initially dismissed it as some sort of fireworks, but the object remained, nearly straight above us for at least an hour and a half.  It continued it&apos;s behavior of darting back and forth for the duration of the sighting.  It appeared to make some subtle color changes (orangish to reddish to purplish) but we can&apos;t be sure.  We could have been staring at it for a long time causing our eyes to play tricks on us (I&apos;m a natural skeptic) but if I was forced to answer; I say it did.  The sky was cloudless and there was no wind, and no sound emitted.  I recorded it on my video camera but with the absence of background stars it gives almost no evidence of it&apos;s behavior.  It only shows a light in the sky.  Also, after an hour of observing, we heard the sound of jet aircraft but none were sighted.  They (or it)were probably under the treeline (we were in a heavily wooded campground) out of our line of sight.

At first thought it was a tower because of the light configuration and the height off the ground, approx 300 ft. high. Then my wife asked if I seen the lights.  She said, &quot;I didn&apos;t know they put a tower up there.&quot;  I responed by saying there is no tower there, only houses.  As we got closer,  We could clearly see the triagle shape.  My wife looked to the north and notice a similar light configuation not to far away hovering.  I then looked the the south, I noticed the same thing to the south.  With out thinking, we came up to the road near to the lights, I turned down the road to get a better look.  We came about 500 ft from the object and could clearly see the object was grey and had three red lights on the corners with a white light in the middle.  It was completly silent.  When we got closer and object slowly moved to the east.  My wife noticed the other object to the north moved in a paralle line to the large object.  Then the radio went out.  As we went around the circle at the end of the road, the object began slowly moving west.  We past under the object.  My wife said we should go staight home.  We were only several min. from home.

I&apos;m doing this because someone official must know. In the later part of 1989, at approximately 9 p.m., while driving home from dinner at my mother&apos;s house, I noticed bright lights moving very slowly toward my right, above the tree line.  I&apos;ve always been intrigued by U.F.O&apos;s and feel I&apos;m quite knowledgeable on the subject.  I had always thought that if I had ever saw one,I would not be afraid, but rather I would want to approach it.  Was I ever wrong.  I stopped to observe a round shaped disk coming my way above the trees to my right while still in my truck.  Slowly it approached.   Surrounded by very, very bright lights, not blinking lights but solidly lit.  At this time, the object is right by me so I get out of my truck, leave the door open, walk around the door to the driver&apos;s side fender and look at the craft.  When I realized there was no noise coming from it, that&apos;s when I knew what it was.  The biggest rush of fear went through me like I never  knew.  The craft was only about 50 yards from me.  I jumped in my truck, drove forward 200 yards, made a left, stopped and watched it slowly move away for about five minutes until I couldn&apos;t see it anymore.  My house was just around the corner.  I went in and woke up my roomate, ((name deleted)).  He went to bed way early because he had to go to work at 4:00 a.m.  I told him what I had seen.  He said I was crazy.  We went out front in the yard and I started telling him the story.  Just a few minutes into my story, as I was pointing in the direction of the sighting, we heard a noise from behind.  We turn and look.  About 3 or 4 black helicopters buzz the house and fly in the direction I&apos;m pointing.  Steve didn&apos;t think I was so crazy then. I&apos;m reporting this because lately it&apos;s been weighing on my mind.  50 yards is close!  If someone would contact me, I would like to tell them things about the craft and the amazingly effortless way that it moved. Please take this sighting seriously.  I am a business owner in Austin and have a reputation as an honest person.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

(The 70&apos;s} We lived by a cornfield and the corn was still green, so it must have been some time during the summer.  This happened in Yorktown Indian, right beside walnut street, a few miles out side Muncie, about 40 miles from Indianapolis. I remember that my parents would invite my grand parents over to watch the strange lights and vehicles in the sky. I remember seeing a few cigar shaped objects in the sky my self, but this isn&apos;t the main part of my sighting. As a kid the neighborhood children and myself would play in the cornfields. Most of us knew about the lights, but being young we really didn&apos;t think much of it. What we did find that that struck us as odd was a circle burned into the corn, far out in the field. It was as I remember a perfect circle of charred corn stalks about six inches wide, and the circle was about fifteen to twenty feet across. The corn was pressed flat, as was the unburned corn inside the circle. We knew the field pretty well and there was no farm machinery that went through the field during those summer months. Out side the circle were sets of footprints that led out of the circle, but not very far from it then back to the circle. What we found so unusual about them to us was that they were maybe 4 to six inches deep, with no tread marks, the bottom of the prints were flat with no tread that would be on a normal shoe or farmers boot. On the surface of the footprint in the dirt was something that looked like green moss. There were no tire marks leading to or away from the circle. The soil wasn&apos;t soft, we didn&apos;t leave prints this deep, while we ran and played in the field, and that&apos;s what we found odd also. I brought my mother out to the site so she also witnessed it. She didn&apos;t know what to make of it ether. My older brother was one of us kids that saw it also. There are no military bases in the area, or even a airport of any size, so I don&apos;t think it was some &quot;government project&quot;. As far as I know the field is still there, and Yorktown is a very small town sleepy farm town, so I don&apos;t think anything has been built over the area. If needed I can locate the other people that I knew at the time to verify the story, (the other children, by brother, and mother.

In the Winter I had a clear view from my window in Beachmont all the way to the Blue Hills in Quincy. (Across Logan Airport) Well one night I noticed in the sky pretty far away (I&apos;d guess 10-20 miles) at about a 40 degree angle off the ground, two small but bright lights (about the intensity of Jupiter) chasing eachother in strange circles, zig zags, drops, changes of direction, reverses, stops and hovering. This went on for about an hour until the both zoomed upward and toward the west until they faded from view. I had the impression they must have been over quincy or farther south. I had seen airplanes out this window for 16 years up to that point and had never (nor have I since) seen anything like that. They were not airplanes.

We thought at first it was an aircraft from the local airport (approx. 5 miles away).  But, because of the tremendous acceleration of the objects, we knew that it could not be an airplane.  As the objects passed almost directly above us, we heard no sound at all, even though they were travelling at a high rate of speed.  As they sped away, they seemed to change direction very abruptly.

It was definitelly not an airplane as we know what airplane look like as we have the LAX and SM airports close to us.  As a matter of fact, we saw an airplane go by with it&apos;s blinking light clearly identifiable. Initially, this object moved back and forth (did not go in a straing line in one direction) for what seemed like a minute.  It did not look like a helicopter moving either.  All of a sudden it started moving north-west and it even created some sparks (the same as a broken mufler that&apos;s dragged on the pavement) and then it disappeard behind the homes in our view.

They were too small to discern any detail. They were about as bright as a typical airplane, but seemed a little bigger. I called my two friends outside to look, but they didn&apos;t get outside in time to see anything. I watched the lights for about 30 seconds total. They were about 40 degrees above the horizon, about 1 handspan at arms length apart from each other. I believe the one on the left was stationary when I first saw it, then it started moving slowly to the left away from the other one. (It was moving w.r.t. the clouds behind it.) It moved a total distance of about one handspan. The one on the right was stationary the whole time. Both lights faded out about 30 seconds after I first saw them. I saw nothing remaining after they faded out, and I never heard any sounds. I noticed that a car had stopped down the street.  After the lights faded out, the car drove over to the three of us and stopped. There was a couple in the car who had been watching the lights as well. They said they had seen them from the nearby freeway, and had pulled off to watch. They said they had watched for about 5 minutes total, and that there were three lights initially. Apparently this third light had started out stationary and then slowly moved to the right, away from the other two lights and disappeared before I had come outside. We all agreed that they were much more orange than the red broadcast tower lights visible to the east, and too orange to have been red airplane lights. The couple speculated that the flickering orange color looked like fire and may have been candles tied to balloons, except that all three were moving in different directions, which seemed strange. There&apos;s a very slight, variable breeze outside at ground level, and the clouds aren&apos;t moving noticeably w.r.t stationary objects. The weather is cloudy--no stars visible--and the lights were below the clouds. When they disappeared I couldn&apos;t tell if it was because they entered the clouds or because they faded out. There&apos;s a lake about a quarter mile to the south. I didn&apos;t think to ask the couple how far away they thought the lights might have been. Maybe it was just a prank, but I figured I&apos;d report it in case anyone else saw anything unusual. I would guess that others probably saw it too since it was visible from the freeway.

I was a mechanic doing all manner of repair work besides making cans for the salmon with Continental Can Co. equipment.  I made the cans and then we checked constantly to insure proper sealing. When the salmon season was over I decided to go to Anchorage and secure a job.  this was not to be and I found myself working for the Civilian Conservation Corp.  I helped establish the Camp at Eklutna, 27 miles north of Anchorage, on the now old highway.  This was the construction site of Eklutna&apos;s Power Plant buildings and all were still intact and we took it over. The exact number of young men who arrived there was probably ten and they were all, I believe, from the Eastern States--New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts.  It was cold, 20 to 25 degrees Fahrenheit, with about ten inches of snow on the ground.  We all slept in the large bunkhouse and free time was spent around the coal burning stove playing cards, reading or just conversation.  One of the fellows was called Peterson.  Weekends were long and the biggest activity was chuckingcoal in the stove.  Everyone took turns to keep the fire going during the night. On this particular Saturday night Peterson and I decided to try to hitch a ride to Anchorage and go to a movie.  the others thought we were out of our minds with the freezing cold and all.  the two of us started out, the sky was ptich black with the stars glistening like jewels and the air was still.  Walking along at a brisk pace, to keep warm, we much have covered four or five miles and no cars came.  As we entered an open area we heard this sound, turned around and saw this intense bluish light.  Oh, joy! a truck it had to be with one headlight burned out.  Wrong!  It was not on the road but up in the AIR!  This was startling to say the least.  The sound we heard was like the sound of a jet turbine being shut down--not a high pitched sound. Dumbfounded--it took a few seconds for us to react.  It seemed it was moving rather slowly--maybe 35-40 miles per hour.  In the ensuing moments we flattened ourselves in the snow when it passed overhead.  In the few moments I looked at it, it was to all appearances cigar-shaped with the bluish light on the side.  However, a few seconds later, when light faded some, i looked up and it appeared wider. Peterson and I were now standing up looking at the object heading east.  It was headed toward a mountain or high foothills.  As we kept looking at it, we both thought it would crash into the mountain.  It seemed to lift up and went over and down the other side.  We looked at each other and exclaimed, &quot;What the hell was that?&quot; We decided to return to the Camp, which we did, wondering what it was we had seen.

I thought wow an owl. But thier was no flapping wings and after a long look I was thinking, &quot;That is the biggest owl I have ever seen.&quot; So started to think it was a larg grey balloon. Like the ones you to advertise with but it was a waired color for that Grey, Black, and white. The white was dirty and bloochy streaks. Going with the balloon I stepped on it. Well I was going 65 MPH and the balloon was accelerating away. Then was just plain gone!!! I fallowed this balloon from Pheasant Dr in Gilbert to 74 St in Mesa this is a distance of 1.5 miles maybe a little less. Thier was a balloon going plus 65 MPH in Southeast Mesa on a Friday night? No. This was no balloon or an owl. It made no noise or smell and had no lights. In thinking about it The only reason that I saw anything was the fact that this thing was &quot;flying&quot; just above the light polls along the side of the road. It could not have been over 50 feet off the ground. It stayed at that height for the whole encounter till it was gone. I wonder why it was so low. This is really odd because half a mile to the South thier is a line of high tension power lines. The fallowing day their was a flight of three F-18 Hornets that where fly around that part of the valley.

The  light would also go green, red, yellow  and just a bright clear light.  It stayed in the same spot for approxametlly an hour. In the mean time, I called 3 neighbors to see if they saw it and they did, some even made a call so there were 9 households who saw this.

This light was pretty far away, straight in front of us, from our vantage point just peeking over the tree tops. At first I thought it was an airplane tower light but it seemed too bright and high.  My husband asked, &quot;What is that?&quot; and we started to explain it away-plane, helicopter, etc..  Then it moved straight up and straight to the left and repeated this movement as if going up stairs a couple of times, until it was high in the sky, like a very bright star, in front and slightly to the left of us. At this point we were talking to each other- is it some military helicopter or UFO or what? Also at this point we were driving on a straight road and we had slowed down considerably.  Then the light dimmed from a bright white to a orangish color and began moving in a straight line directly to us.  It was weird because it was very far away and we never took our eyes off it but it was right on top of us too quickly.  It was like it moved very slowly and steadily yet it got to us faster than it should have. At this point we had stopped in the middle of this road and turned off the headlights.  There was no one else around. The UFO stopped and hovered directly above our car and slightly to the left about 20 ft.? above us.  I&apos;m not that great with measuring distance but it was right on top of us. It was about 4 or 5 times the size of our thunderbird turbo coupe, Triangular with rounded edges, apparently black in color and had many lights on the bottom.  Because it was right on top of us we couldn&apos;t see the top but it did appear to have a &quot;windshield&quot; on one of the points facing the same direction we were.  It made no noise, created no wind that I could tell and even though it had lights it didn&apos;t give off light or light anything up.  It was slowly turning back and forth (left and right) but not all the way around.  From the time it reached us to the time my husband stuck the car in gear and went peeling down the road was probably only 30 seconds or so.  I felt like an animal, we were both crying and panicing.  The UFO crossed over the top of our car so that it was on the right side. To the right(out my window) was pasture and the UFO was flying at the level of my window-4 or 5 ft. off the ground (?) and seemed to be playing a game with us, it would stay along side the car, then back off and catch back up, shoot ahead and wait for us, etc.. this lasted about a minute or 2. I was looking from it to my husband who was trying to drive and screaming at him to get away.  At one point I looked back and it was gone.  We made a right turn and I was looking in the sky and found it looking like a bright star again, about 1 minute after it had disappeared.  We made another right turn so as it was directly in front of us, high in the sky and it just dove down into the trees at an extremely fast speed.  That was it.

It was rapidly moving much faster than a satellite.  I asked my husband and my father what they thought it was. It was very bright, brighter than any star in the sky.  We had no idea what It could have been.  My daughter became scared and we went home.", "I was outside of the police station with my dog when I got this sudden urge to look up. I saw a black triangle flying really low and making absolutely no noise and had no lights turned on. It was going at a slow speed heading north towards Memphis, TN. This was the first of my sightings of different types of craft.((NUFORC Note:  Date appears to be aproximate.  PD))", "1 object splits into 2 (white - red light)A friend and I were out walking in a town park.  We noticed airplanes the whole time we were walking and ironically were talking about UFOs. We were heading back towards the car when I spotted a bright white (almost fuzzy) light flying horizontally quickly just above the tree line about a 1/2 mile away from us.  I watched it for a few seconds without saying anything to my friend, but then I realized I couldn&apos;t make out that it was a plane, plus it was flying so low I told him to take a look.  Just about then, the white started to sort of fuse into red and as it turned completely red, it suddenly split into two separate red lights.  The &quot;newer&quot; light sort of did a sharp u-turn up and backwards as the other remained steady on it&apos;s course horizontally.  Then the one further behind headed back in the direction of the other only further back and higher up.  We watched until they were out of sight. We assumed because it was July 3rd, that probably Hanscom Airforce Base in Bedford was putting on an air show.  It wasn&apos;t until a year later I found out Hanscom didn&apos;t have their annual air show that year, plus the objects must were so much closer than we realized and Hanscom is too far away to witness their aircraft.", "there were 3 of them , maybe more but they were there and observing EVERYTHING.It was new years eve and i was down in sydney harbour looking up in the sky waiting for the big fireworks party to begin.At first i saw a shooting star and said to my companion &apos;did you see that,a shooting&apos; star,she said no so anyway aswe all do i made a wish.THEN i saw a nother one But this time it stoped ,it just sat there looking like all the other stars up there but i kept on staring at Until ZOOM, it shot right up and beyond the clouds where you could not see it. Oh boy was my heart racing i was in complete denial , i thought ah bugger it i didnt see it.so by this time i was in party mode and then bang boom blast,happy new year, the fire works had started it was awsome but i still had this niggling feeling that wouldnt go away it was that so called shooting star i saw and i dont know why but i had paid no attention to the fire works any more and looked behind me away from the fire works over my shoulder straight up in to the semi blacsk clouded sky and there it re apeard.It came right out of the cloud staight down, sat there for 2 seconds and ZOOM staight back up again.I could not believe what i had just saw, this time i was convinced it was a ufo and i will never forget that night ever for as long as i live.I know exactly what they were doing, they wanted to see the biggest fire works display ever just like we all did and being the year 2000 i believe they where celebrating mankinds efforts for making it this far or even giving each other a pat on the back for what they have created US the human race...((NUFORC Note:  We trust that the witness means the date of December 31, 1999.  We have changed it here to the correct date.  PD))", "My family saw 15-20 UFOs that appeared as lights for 3 consecutive nights.My husband saw them first then asked me to come out to see.  We saw objects very high in the sky near the constellation Orion.  We went out to look every so often between 9:00pm and 10:30pm.  They were there the whole time.  The UFOs were brighter and seemed to be closer than the stars in Orion. At first they seemed to be stars but when we took time to look at them we could see there were two lights very close together.  Every 10-30 seconds (approx. it varried) a sparkling light would shoot out from each &quot;craft&quot;. They remained mostly stationary but we occaisionaly saw one move  a short distance, suddenly. The second night, we saw them again in about the same places.  We invited our 19 year old son out to see them. One seemed larger, brighter, (we assumed it was closer) but the second night everything was about the same as the first night.  Tonight, 2/1/01, the third night, there were clouds early in the evening but some of them (5-6) were still visible, even though Orion was not visible.  The one that seem closer than the others was now even closer.  Later in the evening, 10:00pm the sky cleared.  At that time the one that had been close was gone and only 4 remained. My husband and I are educated and our son is in college, we are a stable, Christian, family.  My husband works for a department store and I work in a college library.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with these witnesses, and they seemed quite sincere.  We believe they may have been looking at bright planets, or &quot;twinkling&quot; stars, but we are not certain.  That would not explain the number of objects they allegedly witnessed, and it would not explain the objects that allegedly were reportedly ejected from the lights.  PD))", "Very slow-moving, silent, triangular formation of lights; some RF interferenceI was driving US Route 30 East from Forest Hills (just outside Pittsburgh) to Irwin.  This is the usual route I take home from work.  My wife was in the car but was dozing and laying down.  As I came over the hill near Norwin High School I saw a light in the eastern sky - nothing unusual at first.  As I approached the intersection of 10th Street (Irwin) and Rt. 30, I noted that it was getting very much brighter (white) and was slowly &quot;pulsing&quot; in brightness - about one second from bright to dim and one second back again.  When I got closer, perhaps 1/2 mile from directly underneath it, I could see that it had two close-set front lights like headlights, both white, which no longer appeared to be pulsing.  It also had a red light on its port &quot;wingtip&quot; (relative position of the lights implied &quot;wingtip&quot;, but I could see no silhouette, only the lights), so I concluded it was a plane. It was moving to the west very slowly, though.  When I got closer still I could see the starboard &quot;wingtip&quot; light which was also red.  This struck me as a bit odd.  It was passing nearly directly overhead at this point.  My car&apos;s digital clock read 6:48 PM.  I was listening to a Pittsburgh  station (1410 KQV-AM) which breaks up and fades back in a lot in Irwin, but the static is typically just white-noise.  As the object passed overhead, the signal was lost in a wave of loud &quot;angry&quot; buzzing, which caused me to shut the radio off.  The car was not otherwise affected. The object was moving west very slowly indeed at this point.  Since neither size nor distance were known I&apos;ll put this in terms of objects at arm&apos;s length.  Its length was about 1/2 the width of a normal music CD at arm&apos;s length, and it was moving (when directly overhead) about 1 CD-diameter in about 7 seconds. Since it was moving in the opposite direction to me, I thought this was unusually slow for a non-hovering aircraft, so I rolled down the window to see if I could hear it (thinking perhaps it was a helicopter and the &quot;wingtip&quot; effect of the red lights was an illusion).  I could hear absolutely nothing but the other cars - no &quot;airliner roar&quot;, no chopper blades, nothing. I should note that I work near several hospitals in Pittsburgh.  If a helicopter is sufficiently low to appear that large (and they often are), I can easily hear it going overhead, even over the roar of a busy Pittsburgh street and my car&apos;s engine with the windows rolled up. So between the red (not green) starboard lights, the radio interference (which was gone after I passed about 1/2 mile &quot;behind&quot; the object), the slow motion, and the silence, I&apos;m very confused.  Again, all I could see was two white &quot;headlights&quot;, closely set, with two red lights at &quot;wingtip&quot; positions.  I guess you could call it a &quot;triangle&quot;, but again I emphasise I saw no silhouette, only the lights themselves. It may have been a perfectly conventional craft, but it was nothing I&apos;m familiar with.", "Light seen pulsating from white to completely red then completely orange and back to white seen west of SacramentoIt was about 9:00 PM on Saturday.  We were driving westbound Hwy 50 from Mather Air Field. We saw a bright white light, which we thought was an aircraft leaving Sacto. International Airport flying southbound.  This object was not progessing southbound like the many aircraft that we have observed daily. (We live in the flight path of Mather Air Field) The object&apos;s light remained bright and round instead of changing as a normal aircraft would as it flys. Once we got home, we got the (10 X 50) binoculars out to observe the object.  The object had moved from the area of the International Airport to (what we can only guess) as the area of West Sacramento. The object was low in the sky and now hovering or stationary.  Two different airplanes, on their normal flight paths from Mather Air Field &amp; Sacto. International Airport were in the sky at the same time.  We compared the object to these aircraft.  Thats when you could really see the difference between the &quot;object&quot; and the two aircraft.  Both aircraft had easily identifiable flashing navigational lights, the object had no navigational lights of any type.  The &quot;object&quot; could be described as a round white light which slowly pulsated to completely orange, then completely red and then back to white again.  It slowly decended until it went out of sight.", "Saw a bright white/red light moving very, very  fast forward, up, down and backward in the approx. area of Mt. Rainier.I was in the left rear passenger seat of my car with my husband driving (my mother was in the front passenger seat).  First I saw what I thought was a falling star, a bright stream of light in the Eastern night sky falling in a slight curve for what, in my visual field, was approximately 4 inches, but was located a great distance away, so of course would have been far greater in length.  A minute or so later I saw a bit farther south but still in the Eastern sky a fast moving light that was first bright white, then red, alternating.  This object was moving very fast and again a great distance away.  The object, continuing to change from bright white to red, to bright white, etc,  then began to move in an erratic fashion, jumping forward quickly, then up and down in a zig-zag fashion--not straight up and down but more in a pointed sine wave pattern.  At this point, I said something to my husband, and he pulled the car off the freeway.  After he started watching the object, we saw it move backward, in addition to up and down.  We continued to observe this odd motion for as long as we could.  The lights from oncoming vehicles on the freeway made it impossible to continue observing the object.  I observed two objects (the &quot;falling star&quot; and the red and white lighted object) and my husband saw only the red and white lighted object).  I didn&apos;t think about it at the time, but on telling my sister about it today, she pointed out that the direction we were looking was toward Mr. Rainier, where there have been repeated sightings over the years.  Neither, she nor I nor my husband have ever seen (or reported seeing) a UFO before.  I am a medical transcriptionist and my husband is a skilled laborer in a paper mill.  We are not given to flights of fancy.  We do not drink alcohol nor consume drugs.  We are honest, God-revering, regular people.  I am 49 and my husband is 45.  As we both saw the same thing, I am sure that what we saw was a UFO.", "Flying Saucers Over Lake in St. Paul!I was looking up to observe the full moon that was coming over the horizon, and there they were, right over the lake.  5 flying saucers hovering over Long Lake.  They made white streaks in in the atmoshpere as they slowly moved twords me.  Then all of the sudden, a very large flash occured, and they rocketed straight twords the heavans.  Each spacecraft was around 10 feet in diameter.  They hoverd out on the lake for almost ten minuets before leaving.  My parents and friends did not belive me when I told them.  They craft were mysteriously silent.", "Project Twinkle green fireballs sighted in Korea during same period of 1948-1950 as in the U.S. Southwest.I have never seen a UFO; however, my father told me an interesting sighting he had when he was in junior high school - sometime in 1948-1950 - in Korea.  It was during the daytime when he saw a bright bluish-green light in the sky.  It was so bright that it seemed to light up the whole area even in daylight.  It seemed to be hovering in the sky and my father assumed that it must have been a comet that was flying directly towards him so that it created the illusion of hovering.  It disappeared after a while, and he never told anyone about it because it was so strange.  Also, he noted that there seemed to be some sort of cylindrical/prism-like shape inside the light and sketched it out for me. I happened to be flipping though a book on UFOs and noticed a blurb about Project Twinkle and realized that the dates and descriptions matched exactly.  So, I guess that this means that the perceived phenomena was not restricted solely to the American Southwest. Also, my father is highly rational and pragmatic and doesn&apos;t indulge in thoughts about the paranormal.  Neither of us previously knew anything about Project Twinkle.  The perfect match between his description and dates with the Project Twinkle sightings confirms that what he saw was real.((NUFORC Note:  Date in 1948-1950 is approximate.  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))", "Sometime during an August sunday afternoon, I spotted an object at the intersection of Rt. 684 and I84 at  Brewster, NY. This occurred in (I believe in 1975). I should add that the sky was perfectly clear. The object in question was in a stationary position above a stand of pine trees at the intersection of the two main traffic arteries. It appeared to be approximately 40-50 yards above the tops of the pines. As I noticed something in the air in close proximity , I thought to myself,  &quot;That&apos;s  just an airplane - Danbury Airport is just up the road&quot;. Turning towards my right (into the curve) I looked up again at the object with a deliberate intent of identifying the aircraft (I have always been fascinated by aircraft - and simply wanted to look at what I thought would be some variant of a Piper Cub). When I actually saw the craft, what I saw resembled a hovering 40-gallon oil drum -but I estimated it to be &quot;about the size of a contemporary Caldillac sedan&quot;. It had a series of three rings of blinking lights - the top revolving in one direction - the middle revolving in the opposite direction - the bottom going in the same direction as the top ring. I tried to maintain a &quot;back-to-the-road-back-to-the-thing&quot; visual contact - but at my last gaze - it simply vanished. You may think this is flight of fancy or mistaken identity, yet the next day, the sighting was FRONT PAGE news on the DANBURY NEWS TIMES newspaper. The article quoted a Danbury police officer who ran home after his shift an retrieved his video recoreder shortly after dusk  in an effort to videotape the movements of the object. This officer was an aquaintance of mine (since he had married a college acquaintance of mine) - his name is indelibly etched in my memory. I saw the video not long after the incident, and it simply showed a very shaky image of a &quot;spot&quot; of light. It seemed much as if you tried to take a video of Sirius with a rather shaky hand. Yet the fact remains that the sighting was confirmed by a credited news organization and a police officer. Anyone can scan the (well the way they did it then) microfisches of the NEWS-TIMES for 9/75 and find the reference, unless the material has been supressed. I had for years, kept a copy of the paper , but as time has gone by cannot find it at hand. I do know one thing is certain - that what I saw that day was NOT OF THIS EARTH((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I woke as usual, went down to the bathroom and I noticed on the outside of my left bicept a circular bruise that looked exactly like a donut with a small red dot in the middle. It was approximatly 1 inch on the outside in diameter and a quarter inch on the inside. It was not at all painful to the touch and for the life of me have no idea where it came from! I do not bruise whatsoever even if I take a good solid punch on the arm lets say so I was to say the least shocked to see this. I went to my Doctor that same morning and showed him and he said the only possible reason he could think of  that I could have bruises appear like that might be if I had a low platelet count so I walked next door and had my blood tested. 2 days later he told me everything was normal. The bruise stayed with me for about 3 days or so. My  question is though have other people ever woke up that you have heard from and seen a bruise or mark like this on thier body. I swear it looked like I had been givin a shot with a needle in the arm because of the small red dot in the center. Very wierd, scared the hell outta me ..........

About 23.45 last night (01/26/2001) when I was walking the dog I seen something in the sky over the Dingle/Toxteth area in Liverpool, England. There was no engine noise at all - It was silent. There were 4 red lights in a diamond shape. They went on and off about once a second, not flashing but fading smoothly up and down. It travelled south east passing overhead, but not directly over. When it was over our area the size was similar to a large commercial aircraft a few miles from an airport coming in to land. There were no red and green port &amp; starboard lights nor any flashing white lights, only the 4 red ones. The speed was much faster than a commercial jet. Within 30 seconds it had travelled in to the distance and I lost sight of it. There were patches of cloud but otherwise the sky was very clear and the stars were all clearly visible.

At that time my daughter was tired and when I got excieted about the incident and suggested that it was a UFO she quickly stated that we han seen a comet.

I am situated approximately 48 miles S.S.W. of Fort Worth and 45 miles North of Waco, Texas. As a former commercial pilot, with instrument and multi-engine ratings, I noticed that this particular contrail had a base which appeared over the apparent S.W. horizon and the angle was so steep (probable 60 degrees) that it immediately caught my attention- I went to the window for further investigation (thinking, perhaps this is an airliner in distress) - runaway elevator or loss of control, etc.--when much to my amazement, this object did a abrupt verticle ascent from a fixed point- that&apos;s right- no pull up with a normal curve at contrail bottom- I&apos;m talking about a change of direction, speed and ascent almost instantaneosly to the verticle- 90 degrees ascent and it accellerated as it went forward. Since the sun was setting in the Western sky and we had a clear sky this contrail and object was clearly visible, especially since it was reflecting in varying intensities as it passed throgh our upper atmosphere. I caught a very good reflection of the object with binoclars I keep in the kitchen- it HAD NO WINGS- EGG SHAPED, (not tublar like a missle) METALLIC SILVER WITH REFLECTIVITY OF BRIGHTLY POLISHED CHROME-- my estimate of altitude would be in the 25-30 thousand feet range when I first saw it... as it accellerated upward, the contrail was not continious, but rather sparoidic as if it were passing through different temps...

The only major military based south of me is Fort Hood (approx. 100 miles as the crow flies) however, President Bush&apos;s Texas compound is prob! able 60 miles S.S.W- I called my parents, who live next door out to witness the event, but by the time they made it outside all that was left was the tale-tale sign of the lower contrail, except that the portion of the contrail that went verticle was still evident and they were also amazed as to the phemonenia. Hope this wasn&apos;t Saddam&apos;s avowed 1st attempt at retribtion. If it was however, our missle defense worked, because I&apos;m still here to report this sighting. There was no sound involved in this incident. From now on, I will replace the binnoclars with a video camera.

It appeared just above the horizon and flew at a very constant speed and passed my line of vision to the north of me.  It was bright in the center and seemed to appear dimmer as it radiated out, and then brighter on its edge.  It did not streak across the sky like meteors I have seen.  It did not leave a trail, smoke or sparks and it seemed to travel parallel to land.  It was much larger than a star, but appeared about a tenth the size of a full moon.   Since it did not change in size or shape as it moved, I assume it must have been very high in the sky.  I heard no sound, and I often do from aircraft flying in the area.  I ran downstairs from my bedroom to try to catch sight of anything on the other side of my house and saw nothing.

Went just under the moon and continued in a perfectly straight line moving at about well if I put a measuring tape up in front of me to use as a guide I would have to say it moved across that measureing tape about 1 to 2 feet per second in a perfectly straight line.

It was very far away and about the size of a dime from our view point.  It crossed our horizen in about four minutes.  Moving much too fast to be an air craft. We were facing in a southwest ward direction.((NUFORC Note:  It seems to us that a high-flying aircraft would be visible for the amount of time indicated by the witnesses.  However, we do not know what it was they witnessed.  A dime at arm&apos;s length is approximately the percieved size of a full moon.

I noticed a red light in the southern sky away from the fireworks, approximately 45 degrees up from the horizon, sitting motionless.  I asked my fiance if she saw it too, and she stated yes.  We watched it for a couple of minutes and it did nothing.  We both got up and went down to the parking lot and I got out a pair of binoculars to view it with.  My binoculars are fairly low quality and they did not help much, but I did observe something apparently fall from the light and leave a burning trail as it went down to the south of us.  Another guy was in the lot when we were looking at it, and I asked if he saw it too, and he stated he did.  I told my fiance to stay there while I ran up to get a cell phone to call somebody to see if they could observe it.  But while I was running up to our apartment, my fiance said it grew smaller and vanished.  While we were still out in the parking lot, it (or something similar to it) appeared or reappeared in approximately the same position in the sky, but only further to the east.  This light, too, vanished after only a short period of time.  My fiance and I both discussed what it might have been.  Could it have been a burning ember from the fireworks caught in the upper atmosphere winds?  We surmised not because we did not see any motion whatsoever.  An airplane or a helicopter?  Like I stated, we thought not because of the lack of motion.  An acquaintance suggested it might have been a homemade hot air balloon.  That seemed plausible to me because, when I was a kid, my dad used to make them out of sheets of plastic and sterno fuel.  Anyway, I know we were not the only ones to see this, because I&apos;ve read other accounts of this on this web site and the next day on a local radio talk show, I&apos;ve been told people were calling in describing the same object.  Was this of extraterrestrial origin?  I have no idea (and I tend to be a skeptic), but it does fall under! the def inition of UFO-Unidentified Flying Object.((NUFORC Note:  Please see other similar reports from across the U. S. for the same date.  PD))", "explosion in the skyok i will never forget this but the above info is not quite accurate one was a fireball, one was triangular. he he dig this, &amp; i&apos;m telling the truth. the fireball was moving somewhat slow, at first i thought it was a meteor, but it was moving way too slow. it was moving from n.w. to s.e. more south than east.it was also coming down.when all of a sudden there was a white colored blast and a blue pulse of light ( this is the hard part to describe) shot towards it. it was at a very fast speed. almost like a laser, they met &amp; exploded. this happened about a half mile in front of me. i drive truck, a truck driver behind me saw it too. he asked me over the c.b.&quot;did you see that?&quot; i told him yes. we discussed what it might have been inconclusively some of the things; a dark triangle ilumminated during the white flash,a red blink just before the flash. we kinda thought it might be star wars shooting down a missle but the speed &amp; shapes were just wrong. i hope maybe that someone else reported this because i&apos;m really curious, what was that. i would have reported it sooner, but, no p.c. never had listened to A.B. &amp; didn&apos;t even know there was a place to report it w/out being drug tested lol thank you, now i&apos;ve told((NUFORC Note:  Date is apprximate.  PD))", "Grenn trailing orb seen in Iowa woods!I&apos;m seventeen and I just witnessed something very crazy. My friends and I were out four wheeling in my friends truck. It was some trails by the Des-Moines river. We were dirving back over this ledge, when plain as day, there was a green light in the sky. At first it looked like a green star. It sat there for about 2 to 3 secounds, then it seemed to fall from the sky, green light was trailing behind it. My friend and I started to freak out. I still can&apos;t belive that it happened. It was only two hours ago. Any ways the object was a perfect orb. You could tell that it had three deminsions to it. One of my friends and I are the only ones that saw the whole account. Another member of our party just saw it fall. My other friend that was driving didn&apos;t see any of it. We couldn&apos;t stop talking about it. My friend that was driving started making fun of us when hiw head lights cut out. We started to go up a hill and couldn&apos;t make it up it.I then looked back and I saw a flah of light come out of the woods were the object had apeared to fall. It was a bright flash that looked like a giant flame for about a secound.Nothing else happened after that."]
