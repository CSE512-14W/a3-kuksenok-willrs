["Disk shaped, red lights circling the outside, flying on the treeline in the high country in the Sierra NevadaThis is only one of many experiences I have had. I wrote down as much as I could remember back in 1986 and saved it. It was suggested by a local man who had been studying UFO phenomenon since the age of 13 that I write it down. This is only one entry I wrote in a Journal over a two month period.August 2, 1986 I went camping overnight at Clarks Fork. It was at dusk when I noticed a small bright light directly above me, the sky had no stars out yet and this light was close and glowing. It is my 21st birthday and my boyfriend and I are going to go to Kennedy Meadows for a drink. It is dark now approximately 9:30, we are driving toward the main hwy to go to Kennedys. We both see a very large bright glowing light up to my right of the car, just above the treeline. It is moving along as we do then over the mountain and it waits. It moves ahead the waits, then moves ahead then waits. By now I am telling my boyfriend I do not want to go anywhere. I want to watch them.I can feel that they are here. We are approaching the bridge at Clarks Fork I asked my boyfriend to park facing the object because it is in front of the car, low in the sky its very large and glowing. We watched it for what seemed forever. It is hovering there, moving to to the right then back in front of us. It is much larger than the one I have seen at home maybe because it is closer, like the night on the way back from Tahoe, really big and close.I asked them in my mind to come closer so I can see them then it comes closer then stops. I feel they do not think it is time. I don&apos;t know how I feel that, I just do. My boyfriend actually agrees it is really a UFO, he sees the way it is moving. Now he believes me. While we have been watching, he noticed  a yellow one to our left side, not moving,glowing big just like the white one to our left side. Then the yellow one moves slowly away back toward the mountain as we decide to go back to the campground. They are both followed us. The yellow one stays more in back and the white one moves more in front. I am looking up and around to spot them. They are here, I am comfortable with that. As we went to sleep in our sleeping bags in the back of the truck, I am watching the white one up through the trees toward the Dardnells. The yellow one is behind us but still in sight. All of a sudden a disk shaped craft with red lights all the way around moved past the white one circling, its spinning as it hovers horizontally across the tree tops; moved past the white one circling in the air. It has landed I believe, but it came from nowhere and went very low. God, there is no noise. Oh my god I can&apos;t believe it. It is round. I looked for it but it was gone I believe there are several crafts here, I feel the presence. I am to tired to stay awake. I hope they come see me tonight. I had a cup of water in a white styro foam cup and set it on the edge of the truck bed toward the cab and asked them in my mind to take it so I&apos;d know they were there. It was gone in the morning, nowhere in camp to be found anywhere. I never did have that drink and no alcohol this night.I attended a MUFON meeting here in the area many years ago. One man wanted to put me under hypnosis, but I had lost time and been visited in my bedroom and felt scared, part of me still is afraid. I do know that they meant me no harm because they kept me from panic, they stopped that physiologically in my body, but they used their minds to do it. Now I am ready to find out what happened all of those times. I have had sightings since the age of 8 or so and then visits. Please contact me. Please, I am 39 going on 40 this year and I want to know finally.Thank you for your time.", "I was berated by your answering service for waiting over a quarter of a century to file a report, but who in the hell do you contact in Tangier, Morocco in 1976?  I was west of Tangier,Morocco.  Additional witnesses were my wife ((name deleted)), tour guide ((name deleted)), and a taxi driver.  The day was sunny and the sky was clear of clouds.  The landscape was arid, barren and obscure of any vegetation.  I could view approximately 25-30 miles of horizen.  The taxi was directly west of Tangier moving in an easterly direction.  I observed a bright, stationary light in the sky in the direction of the city.  The light appeared as a large conventional aircraft with running lights on and that would be flying directly towards you.  I asked the tour guide &quot;where is the airport?&quot;  He indicated to the right and south of our position.  I noticed that the light did not change in intensity or altitude as a descending/ascending plane would have.  After observing the bright light for about one minute, I observed three silver disc move out from the light and stop.  They remained stationary for approximately 20-30 seconds before they maneuvered slightly outward and upward from the light.  They moved very rapidly, almost in formation, and became stationary.  Two additional sets of three silver disc moved out from the light and jockeyed around in different positions.  They moved rapidly to positions and became stationary, other than an occasional adjustment by singular discs but basically remained in sets of three disc per formation, comprising a total of nine disc.  I approximated the size of the craft to be 30-35 feet in length and 6-8 feet high.  Their movements were basically smooth and in formation.  The first set of three disc moved slightly in their formation and I had the perception that they were playing or were ready for a &quot;drag race&quot;  After observing the entire formation of ten craft for approximately one minute, the first set of three disc took off at a very hight rate of speed towards the south.  They had covered approximately one-third of the 20-25 mile horizon, when the two other sets of three took off.  Nothing appeared to be any type of mirror reflections of light.  All three sets of disc after taking-off were only visible for approximately 4 seconds before they moved out of my range of view to the south.  As soon as I lost sight of the flying disc, I looked back to the area of the lighted craft, expecting to see the light or a dark silouette like a plane would appear with its running lights off.  Nothing was visible.  The craft was gone. I did not have a video camera, or camera.  Of course, this type of photo or video would be valid proof of aircraft technology far beyond public comprehension.  I would be a millionaire and very famous individual had I possessed cameras that day.  The vehicles traveled in excess of several thousands of miles per hour.  I am a retired Navy Commander and have been in association with current technology that the military openly possessed.  These vehiles surpassed the military SR 71, F-16, stealth bomber, Aurora or any other fathomable aircraft that we could imagine.  The incident I observed in November 1976 might also correlate to the contact that the Iranian military pilot had in September 1976 in which a spherical disc came out of a light and circled the Iranian pilot prior to rapidly disappearing.  I heard that additional sightings may have occurred in Portugal and England during the fall of 1976.  I have nevery observed any military aircraft equal to the speed and maneuverability of what I saw that day.  I did relate this story to several military colleagues at my duty station in Rota, Spain but was not prompted to file any official report to any higher authority.", "4 dancing lightsI saw 4 circular lights dancing in the sky the sky was very cloudy the clouds were stratus clouds. the lights would come togeter in tghe center of their dance then they would sperate and go 4 different ways and then come back together again. the lights went on a crcle like square path. it lasted a very short time then they were gone almost as if they vanished.((NUFORC Note:  Possibly advertising lights.

There was a quad-search light display in the Tysons Corner area (NW part of the Capital beltway) in February. Driving the beltway at night, it was eye catching and visible for a considerable distance.  I wondered if you would get any &quot;UFO&quot; reports from it.Joan WoodwardFairfax, VA((END ADDENDUM))((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Joan Woodward for submitting the note regarding advertising lights.

As I crested the hill, I noticed 4 cars stopped on the side of the highway, people out of their cars, staring into a field to the left of the highway.  I noticed two lights in this field moving quickly, sporadically.  I stopped my car and got out.  I recorded the following events on my CELL PHONE CAMERA.  I have 8 pictures of the event.  There were two lights/crafts.  They would &quot;float&quot; above the ground about 10 feet, and just kind of jerk back and forth, as if &quot;hound dogging&quot; above the ground.  Then, one craft shot directly up and became bright pink.  The other craft turned bright white and shot to the right and behind a hill.  They both came back together to the original area, and their light was dimmed.  Then one of the craft started to glow orange. and shot up about 50 feet, then back to the ground, and the two just circled a bit.  Then one turned a bright green and started this zig zag movement, and the other one turned blue and shot to the right.  They traded places in the sky, and one of the pictures I recorded shows a distinct blue saucer shape.  They then came together, turned a bright pale yellow, and shot up straight in the air.  They were gone.  All of the witnesses shared their experiences before departing, changed forever.  We believe we witnessed a true encounter.  When we went to leave, we had no idea that we had spent 21 minutes observing this phenom.  It was as if time had not passed in outselves.", "Lights in the sky at summer camoSo this was a while ago, I was at a summer camp in Wrightwood California and I was sleeping outside and were looking at the stars because thet sky is really clear in that  area. so I&apos;m looking up and all off a sudden I see this round object flying in the sky, it was to far away to tell any specific features of the craft but I  knew that it had to be a UFO because of its flight path It went from side to side going across large distances in a short amount of time, like from one sided of the canyon to the other. It flew back and forth for a few minutes, then it flew straight up into the air maybe like 90 feet higher than it was originaly, then there was a bright white light around it and I didn&apos;t see it again after that,", "Two bright, large pill shaped objects fly very quickly across the sky, hover and then slowly fade until gone.My friend and I had just got coffee and were walking downtown. We had to wait at the busy streetlights to cross, and while we stood around for the light to change, I looked up in the sky and there was a bright, kind of pill shaped object rising out of the horizon to the north (or so?) and it was getting what seemed very close very quickly. I know very well what a regular plane looks like flying at night, and it wasn&apos;t like that. There were no individual lights or colours; it seemed more like an ambient orange-red-yell-white strip of colour. At first, I thought it was an illuminated blimp, but it was moving what seemed very quickly and I don&apos;t think one could have gone so fast. I yelled to my friend, who also saw and was shocked. For a moment I felt extremely afraid, because I thought it might be a burning aircraft or meteor headed our way. It got to be about the size of an eraser on the end of a pencil, before it stopped and seemed to not move at all for about 10 or 20 seconds. Then, it started moving south (we were facing the east, towards the harbour), much slower than before. It kept moving until it was south and lower in the sky than the moon, about the four o&apos;clock position of the moon. We thought it was immobile again, until we realized that it had moved up a tiny bit, but now was getting very slowly smaller and smaller. My friend yelled something, and I turned to see another one come zooming up exactly where the other had been. It seemed brighter and bigger than the first one, but travelled the exact same path as the former, albeit a bit faster. The colours were also a little more distinguishable - mostly what looked like overlapping orange and yellow white, with bits of red. it moved accross the sky until it was about a thumb&apos;s length away from the first one, which now could be mistaken for another star in the sky, were it not for its bright red (almost Mars-like) colour and the fact it was still fading away. Then the second flying thing also began to move up a little, and fade out of site. Soon, the first one had completely vanished, and about two minutes later (we stood and watched the entire thing) the last one too became smaller and smaller and more and more red-coloured, and it also went out like a tiny red star. Really weird. There were plenty of other people downtown that night, so maybe other people saw it too. I have seen lots of different things in the sky but nothing like that - nothing so bright or large. Or something so big move so quickly, and seemingly low (but it was very difficult to tell just how faw away it was).", "The light moved quickly across the sky to the East.My friend and I are students at local colleges and our backgrounds would not suggest either of us are cranks.  Both of us were in different cars and driving to the same destination but on different routes.  I saw the light appear in the sky and move away quickly.  It was obscured by some trees and when I got past the trees, I lost site of it.  I called my friend to tell him and he saw the same thing.  A mile or so ahead, as I was turning my car on a different road, I saw the object again.  I was now traveling north while it moved east.  I saw it appear to vanish as it went off in the distance. It is worth noting that I a few nights ago, while standing outside near this same location, I saw a light in the sky go off in one direction, then another light appear and travel in the other.", "Auckland New Zealand Sighting 1 March 2005Object was quite far away from me.  Object was decreasing altitude.The entire object would light up red very often. Object then changed direction and flew to the right without changing altitude.  My view was then blocked by neighbouring houses.  Was not seen again. I am 27 years old.  In my entire life I have never seen a aircraft that flew so smoothly or was entirely lit.", "more on the 1958 &quot;fireball&quot; in Winooski sky in case you didn&apos;t recieve the PDF file I sent of the newspaper clippings.newspaper, Sat Apr 20, 1958,  Mysterious Fireball Sighted Here; Reported to Have Dropped in Lake  A mysterious fireball thought to be a meteor flared brilliantly in the sky northwest of Burlington at 9:30 last night. Numerous residents called police to ask about the object. It was seen by the CAA control tower at Burlington Municipal Airport.  The tower said the fireball also had been seen from Albany, N.Y., and seemed to fall straight down toward the lake.  Pieces seemed to shower away from the main object, which changed in color from whitish to a dazzling pale green as it neared the horizon line.&quot;It looked something like fireworks that showers apart,&quot; the man said. The U.S. Weather bureau here had no information on the object, but said teletype messages indicated it had been seen in Scranton, Pa., and Buffalo, N.Y., among other places. Some detail may come from astrologers (sic--astronomers) who might have followed the fiery object.The Burlington Free press, Burlington, VT, Monday April 21, 1958; page 1(?)  &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t Talk Too Much&rsquo;  Fireball in Sky Baffles Area, Especially Cote  By Vic Maerki  A dazzling ball of fire suspended from a parachute, a red flare, blinking &quot;signal&quot; lights and a burned-out area in the Winooski woods remained the ingredients of a puzzling mystery last night. Most baffled of all was Lyman (Shorty) Cote of 65 Pine St., Winooski, athletic trainer at the University of Vermont, who witnessed the entire display.&quot;I don&rsquo;t know what it was,&quot;  Cote said last night.  &quot;But I&rsquo;m sure it was something mighty interesting.&quot;The Air Force seemed to think so, too.&quot;  Col. William Hevde, commanding officer of Ethan Allen Air Force Base, confirmed the Air Force&rsquo;s interest, but claimed an investigation failed to reveal any clues.The unusual sequence of events began shortly before 9:30 p.m. Friday when a fireball, thought to be a meteor, flared brilliantly in the sky northwest of Burlington.Hundreds of persons saw it.But Cote saw more than that.&quot;I was watching TV and noticed this brilliant red fireball when I glanced out through my picture window,&quot;  he said.&quot;It was falling and all of a sudden appeared to slow down.  Then the color turned from red to white and sort of pale blue.It was then that I clearly saw the outline of a parachute.Then it seemed to land in the woods behind Fitzgerald&rsquo;s dairy farm off the Malletts Bay road.  It flared up red.&quot;  Calls Police  Cote promptly called the Winooski Police to notify them.  They said they would check with the air base.A short time later, some Winooski policemen arrived at Cote&rsquo;s house and at their request he tried to guide them to the spot where the object appeared to have landed.Capt. Joseph Sprano of the Winooski Police Department said a swampy area between Cote&rsquo;s house and the spot they were headed for blocked their efforts.&quot;But I plainly saw two blinking white lights, like flashlight signal lights, at the spot Cote was pointing to from his house,&quot; Sprano said.Cote said he was pointing out the spot to the police when a red flare went up and the blinking lights began,  Police and Cote tried in vain until about midnight to find their way to the spot.On Saturday morning, Cote tried again.This time he was successful.He said he found a scorched spot in the woods, but no signs of life or of the parachute.Later on Saturday, two enlisted men from Ethan Allen Air Force Base paid Corte a visit and he guided them to the spot.&quot;They seemed to know what it was all about, but told me not to talk too much about it,&quot; Cote said.&quot;The sergeant also told me not to touch anything,&quot; Cote said  The two airmen left, but Cote said a helicopter was seen later Saturday &quot;hovering just over the treetops.&quot;  Hovde confirmed that an Air Force helicopter was sent out to search the area, but said it found nothing.Will File Report  He said he will file a report with Washington, but added that he had no knowledge of what it might have been.He said he had none of his aircraft in the air at the time and did not know of any planes in the vicinity.The mysterious fireball seen in the skies earlier was confirmed by the CAA tower at the Burlington Municipal Airport.&quot;? newspaper, ? date, ? page  CAA Officials Say Fire Ball Down in Lake  BURLINGTON - Appearing to be a meteor, a flaming red &lsquo;fire ball&rsquo; flared brilliantly in the sky over northwest Burlington here last night.At approximately 9:30, residents of the area reported sighting the object and telephone rang, people questioned police and airport officials as to its identity.The CAA Control Tower at the Municipal Airport also sighted the object and explained that it had also been seen from Albany, N.

Sleeping outside in the backyard, it was warm and clear. We were laying on sides talking and did not notice the object until we decided to go in house and get a snack, which required climbing stairs. When tilting my head back, I saw it. Round with neon like light, Green in the center and a orange ring of light on the outer edge.  Very intense.  Could not see any structure such as doors or windows etc. As far as size, hard to say against a night sky, but if Space Needle is about 600 feet high,this may have been 800 feet and about 50 feet in diameter. It made no sound and was perfectly still. It disappeared in an instant. Minutes later a Navy fighter which was flying so low and slow I could read stuff on the bottom of the wings. The plane was headed south east. May have come from Whidby island navel station. This happened in the Greenwood area in north Seattle.((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

To my right a silvery ,cigar shaped object floated a few feet above the ground matching my speed and following the curve of the road.  Suddenly, the object began to move away and up into the sky at about a 40 degree angle at an incredibly fast speed.  It disappeared in a second, maybe two.  I was aware that there was no sound at all.((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))", "Strange glowing lights hover and then streak across the night sky in Bellflower, MOWhile walking from my grandparents&apos; house to my parents&apos; house (across the street) on what I believe was the evening of Dec. 24, 1993, I saw a strange light over our neighbors&apos; house (approx. 100-200 yds distance between where I stood and their house).  What intrigued me about the light was that it changed color from blue to red to white and back again but not in any particular sequence or order.  Also it seemed to hover over the house.  I would estimate that the light was several thousand feet in the sky.  I located it as hovering over the house because the house itself was the nearest landmark that it appeared to linger above and because I could, of course, see nothing beyond the house because it impeded my view of everything else behind it.  But as far as the light goes, I would estimate that it far up in the night sky.  What was strange to me though, besides its changing colors, was its hypnotic quality which cause me to stand and watch it for quite some time.  As I did, it came closer to me (I know not how much it actually moved) and then retreated a few times.  It also seemed to zig zag from right to left and back again during this process.  I was afraid to leave it for fear that it might be gone when I got back, but I was ultimately able to pull myself away long enough to run in my parents&apos; house and get my mother who promptly followed me outside.  I quickly pointed it out to her.  As soon as she spotted it, the light quickly flashed across the night sky from horizon to horizon in the matter of a split second much in the same way that a ship in science fiction movie would go to &quot;warp&quot; or &quot;light&quot; speed.  And that was the end of the encounter except for my mom calling the county sheriff to report strange lights in the night sky.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

It wasn&apos;t flying very fast, and slowed down even more when it was right above my head I could not hear a single sound of an engine or sound waves of any kind. All of a sudden, it picked up speed and raised its altitude quite jurastically, almost like a roller coaster ride...just straight up. When I thought it was long gone, it came back down in the same exact path as it had gone up. It returned to the same position above my headm then left again, in the same path as it had come(NW). At that point, I had no idea what I had just seen. I ran into the house to see if someone could come out fast enough to witness what I had just seen. Sure enough when I got back outside, it was long gone.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

For some reason I felt compelled to look up and, almost immediately, I saw what I thought was a shooting star traveling from South to North in the sky at a very high rate of speed.  I continued to watch it and, when it neared the horizon, it made a right angle turn without changing velocity.  It continued to travel East until I could no longer see it.  It was then that I realized that I had seen my first UFO.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))", "Object at high altitude and moving extremely fast makes instant course reversal without turning.My sighting took place in the middle of June 1995. I do not remember the specific date. I was camping alone on a remote beach located about ten to fifteen miles west of the town of Cameron, located in Cameron Parish Louisiana. The beach is located about a mile off state Highway 27, which runs along the Gulf of Mexico coastline from Cameron to Port Arthur, Texas. I had spent the day on the beach fishing, and was spending the night. The weather was perfectly clear with no clouds and no fog. I was laying on the beach, just looking at the stars and thinking. At 2 a.m. I noticed an extremely bright object moving across the sky at very high speed. The object was coming in from out over the Gulf of Mexico and moving toward the beach, moving from south to north. I spend a lot of time outdoors and I am used to seeing aircraft at night. The object was moving extremely fast, much faster than I had ever seen any jet move. It&apos;s speed reminded me of a bright bullet. It was also at very high altitude, higher than what airliners normally appear to be, and seemed as if it were up among the stars. The object was quite bright, like a brilliant white light, and appeared to be quite large considering that it seemed to be so high. I was not able to discern any particular shape, only a very bright object. My first thought was that this must be a military jet of some sort, but then something very remarkable happened. While maintaining speed the object suddenly reversed direction. It did not make a turn. It did not stop and then reverse. It was as if it hit a solid wall and bounced back along the exact same course. One second it was moving north, and suddenly it was returning south along the same route in a perfectly straight line. I had never before seen any aircraft do that and have not seen anything like it since. Because of this amazing straight line course reversal, I am convinced that this object could not possibly have been any comet, meteor, or known aircraft. I observed the object fly out over the Gulf of Mexico until I could no longer see it. The entire incident lasted only about a minute or perhaps a little less. I told my sister about it, but told no one else, out of fear of ridicule. I have decided to post my sighting now, thinking that perhaps someone else may have had a similar sighting in the area. As for my background, I have two college degrees, am a former police officer, and at the time of the sighting was teaching biology at a local university, where I taught for six years. I was not drinking or taking drugs of any kind. I&apos;m not making any wild claims, only reporting what I saw.", "This appeared to be a very large object, traveling at great speed, with no sound.On the evening of 2/24/05 at exactly 20:02 ( we received a phone call at 20:03 so the time was exact) I was saying good bye to a business friend in front of my house in Bellevue, WA.  He had just unlocked his car so my eyes were diverted then I heard him say &quot;What the heck is that&quot; and so I looked up to where he pointed.  I first thought it might be a shooting star but then noticed that the object appeared to be  a line of stars or lights (maybe a comet).  When my eyes focused more closely I noticed that the lights were in the shape of a large V. The lights were of the same intensity as the stars around.  However the lights moved together at great speed and as one object.  There appeared to be four or five lights per side of the triangle.  When my eyes focused on moving object for a second or two, I then noticed that the object had to have great size and mass and was also moving at great speed.  The object was first observed at a nearly overhead position and moved from overhead to the east and into the dull hazed light of the full moon.  I will mention that the sky was completely clear and no clouds.  It was also a complete full moon.  The object moved east and faded into the moonlight within 10 to 15 seconds. We were so excited.  I am 53 years old and a gemologist for over twenty six years.  My eyes are attuned to visual comparisons of light and color on a daily basis.  I know what I saw was not a common plane or object. I am certain that we saw something quite unusual and if not very lucky to view it when we did that it would be very hard to view on a normal basis.  This is because the object blended into the night sky so well and the lights that formed the object matched the starlight intensity exactly.  This object was built to be difficult to see. I estimated that the object traveled over the Seattle area from vertical sighting to the East in 10 to 15 seconds so the entire time over Seattle area was no more than 45 seconds to a minute.  I also live where commercial jets do travel over my house from the south to north route.  The object was 4 to 6 jets in width on each side of the triangle.  That is to say at normal viewing it would take 8 to 12 commercial jets in  width to produce an object that was of the size of the triangle we saw.  Also the lights were white/whitish and NOT blinking green or red.  I do know what this was but I have seen satellites, but not from my house and these lights on the craft were much brighter.  The commercial jets that I see are commonly very easy to hear also.  This object produced no sound.((NUFORC Note:  We believe this gentleman called NUFORC on the evening of his sighting, and we did not have time to speak with him at length, because of the airing of the ABC program on UFO&apos;s on this date.

Looking to my left towards town, lots of airplanes in the flight path, one right after another~probably 3 heading towards Sea-Tac International Airport. I look to the right after hearing someone talking kind of loud and excited. I see 2 lights in the sky very low and bright. As I lean out my window to get a better look, suddenly I see 3 more, they&apos;re spaced as if in a circle around 1 different looking thing. I figured the 5 positioned around the center light must be those low flying &apos;planes&apos; (that hardly make any noise at all). All of them seemed to hover including the center one. They weren&apos;t very high in the sky either, lower than planes fly (by the way, they weren&apos;t in or near the flight paths) and I&apos;m not hearing anything other than cars going by and loud voices. My binoculars are old and they don&rsquo;t get real clear images but the center light especially should&rsquo;ve been easy to see if I had good binoculars! Anyway, they all sit there for about 3 or 4 minutes and then the center one starts heading to the left. At this point the lights on it looked as though it could be a saucer shape 2 big white lights with a thin blue light behind them with 2 other smaller lights next to the big ones but spread out a little. When it leaned to its right to leave, it got very, very bright. Once accelerating in that direction, it looked like 2 round sections-one on top of the other - one light white and the other a pinkish purple but very soft. I believe they were flashing as it came by pretty close, maybe a couple of blocks away heading towards Edgewood sort of diagonally. Half way there it began jerking back and forth very quickly maybe 3 times and then continued on. After it got by the Yeast Plant it then looked like it was made up of 4 sections that were staggered and they were all a goldish-white almost amber. Turned to look at the other 5 lights and one was already moving in the same direction but was closer to me. It too got very bright as it banked to follow the other one. As it went by, it looked to me like a Thunderbird design. Can&apos;t really explain it that well but could draw it. I didn&apos;t think about watching the others, not sure if they were still there but wanted to call someone to see if other people had called it in. I figured there were a lot of calls, it being early evening and all the cars I heard go by and the voices I heard must&apos;ve been watching them too but the officer sounded surprised when I asked him if anyone had called in about them. He said nobody else had called other than me! That really surprises me - I don&apos;t know what they were but I really got the feeling at first when I seen this, was that they&apos;re actually letting themselves be known. There has been so many things happening around here for months that we can&apos;t explain.I don&apos;t know if this really covers everything I watched because I am so excited and needed to get this written quickly for future reference.One more thing that has been happening around here for maybe 3 or 4 months, we hear loud popping noises kind of like it sounds if you live close to a military base practicing, sounds like artilliary. But we&apos;re too far away to be hearing that, never heard it before and it&apos;s at all different times of day and sometimes night, like right now (21:05).

As the moon shone down and it just appeared to wisp upon whatever invisible material the cylinder was made of.It looked like glass but we know thats impossible, so it would be as a molecular structure that I knew nothing of. We went searching for the end of it as it seemed to touch the earth.We dorve a little way,maybe 1/8 of a mile and it seemed to end in the woods.We were in a semi-country neighborhood so we just couldnt go trapesing in the trees and leave our vehicle and it was fascinating.As we tried to find a closer entrance to the woods , it started to fill with what appeared to be smoke,and the amazing thing was the steam never left the confines of the cylinder,even though it was invisible except for the steam it held. The steam began rising and as we got to a better viewing area the steam turned darker like smoke and the cy;inder kept it&apos;s three dimensional shape thill the smoke became totally black and the cylinder started to rise simultaneously it became more two demensional and looked like a telephone pole in sillouette and then became like a solid object and seemed to pass in front of the moon,rise up further,then cross the moon and move out of sight.We all forgot it till years later and my one buddy has passed away and he had finally remembered it.My other buddy is still around, we are just kids around 52 and 48.

It was almost gliding.  There were no markings on the plane at all.  Zero....nothing on the tail or under wings.  I had a viewing angle from side...then I quickly ran to see it going away  I have basically assumed this was a sample of Military spy craft...as Lockheed has a development above the University.If flying at night...and or painted black.....this craft could fly overhead of people or areas with very very little notice.I am sure I saw this.....and lean towards earthly device...but would be classified.

So I assumed it must be another plane.  But as I studied it, I realized that it was too bright to be a plane, and there were not the typical blinking green and red wing lights around it. As I was staring at it trying to figure out what it was, it began to pulse.  Not blink, but pulse, at first slowly and then faster and faster.  As it began to pulse very quickly, it suddenly shot straight up, not at a curve, but a 90 degree ascent, and was gone in less than a second.

I was a dismount in the Army 3-41st at the time and was 20 years old. We had a fairly large perimeter we were guarding. There wasn&apos;t anything to do, but look at the stars. I was amazed at how many stars could be seen in the sky in the desert. I was watching airplanes, satelites in orbit and just star gazing. I had been watching the sky for probably close to an hour before seeing this yellow-orange light moving across the sky at a consistant speed, not fast or anything that caught my eye.  I continued stargazing and watching other objects in the sky.  I was kind of tracking the objects seeing where they were going and what they were doing.  I was keeping track of a satelite an airplane and this other object which I thought was also an airplane. I was looking at these three items when I couldn&apos;t find the yellow-orange light. It didn&apos;t flash like the other airplane I was watching and wondered where it had gone.  I thought I saw it in the sky but it was not moving.  The position I was facing was toward Baker California. The object was to the left of Baker, I have no idea of the distance. The desert is very deceiving about distance but Baker was atleast 20 miles away. I focused my attention on the object and was about to dismiss it as the plane I had been watching when it moved. It made a series of movements and returned to the position I first saw it sitting stationary in. The first movement was side to side it moved left, then right past center, then left past center, then right past center, then returned to center. It then moved up and down starting in the position I first saw it in stationary.  It moved up, then down past center, then up past center, then down past center, then back to center. It then did what I would call a four leaf clover move. What was strange about it, or what stuck in my head is it never took the same path during this move and returned to center. Between each of these moves it would return to center and pause for about a second to a second and a half. By this time I am running toward another soldier in my squad that has a set of binoculars I wanted a better look at the object and also for someone else to see it besides me. The event was over before I made it to him. The next two moves is what I couldn&apos;t believe. The object paused a little longer after the clover leaf move, maybe two seconds, then moved away from the ground in an arc towards the sky. The object appeared to be in the place I first saw it stationary and also where I would describe the edge of space at the same time. The yellowish-orange light was about 3 inches long and the same width and intensity as the object. The light caught up to the object in a fraction of a second. It then paused again for about 2 seconds and went out into space as far as I could see at a slight angle away from me. The light appeared to be wherever it was going and where it was at the same time again and then the light disappeared after it. This sighting was so incredible that I believed I was seeing things. I started changing my mind when I saw seven helicopters come from behind and to the right of me, go the the area I saw the object, circle the area, then return where I saw them come from.

I was looking up thinking that this may be the only time in my life that I might see the sky with no aircraft in it at all.  I noticed a metallic looking sphere(ish) object sort of darting around very high up.  It was so small that I could barely see it.  It was moving about in sort of a random pattern much likr a bird might, not taking up too much of the sky in its movements.  Then I saw another and another until there were maybe 5-7 up there.  They appeared to be maybe chasing each other.  It really could have been birds by their movements but I couldn&apos;t see any wings and they were so small that, if they were birds, they would have been very high.  And, if they were birds and very far away (to appear so small) then they would have been moving really fast.  A man that I did not know was next to me and noticed me looking up.  He saw it also.  The bus came and after I got out I could not see them again.  I&apos;m not sure if I believe in UFO&apos;s or not and this sighting is not very exact or detailed, but I wanted to get it out there.

It was very large and right above a drive-in movie, which was having a swap &amp; shop where there were at least 100 people.  I was two blocks away in my front yard and watched with amazement.  I ran up the block and watched the craft as long as I could until it finally went out of site.  I asked people at the swap &amp; shop if they had seen the saucer and no one had seen anything.  I couldn&apos;t understand why or how this could be, because it was about as big as the drive in itself.  The saucer was hovering over the drive-in for five minutes or so then moved on west slowly.  My thoughts were it was a blimp or something like that but it looked too real to be a blimp.  It was very real and I seem to be the only one who saw it.  Now that is strange.  But true!", "My father explained an event of a large cigar-shaped object in perfect flightThroughout my life, my father has described an event that dramatically impacted his perception of UFO phenomena.  He has mentioned this story many times. While viewing the ABC special with Peter Jennings on 02/24/2005, at my asking, he elaborated this story in detail.  My father was a college student in Georgia at the time.  He was travelling to Greenville, SC on US 29.  This was before I-85 was constructed.  He told me that as he approached the Tugaloo River, which is also Lake Hartwell and also flows downstream to become the Savanah River, he came across something strange. He was driving an MG convertible with the top up, as it was wintertime.  Before he crossed the bridge that spanned the river, he noticed a strange object that made him stop his vehicle and watch the event before crossing.  He saw a large cigar-shaped object that glided &quot;perfectly&quot; down river from his left to right.  He described the color as a distinct green.  I asked him if it was a phosphorous green like older computer monitors and he said that it was like that green, only more of an earthy green.  The object &quot;floated&quot; perfectly in the same direction.  My dad specifically stated how he noticed the precision of the object&apos;s movement.  The object continued out of sight down the river.  After the object was completely out of sight, my dad continued across the river.  He said that there was a car coming from the South Carolina side of the river that also stopped to watch the event before crossing.  He said that the driver of that car also decided to cross once the object was gone.  My dad said that he looked straight at the face of the driver of the other vehicle as they passed.  He described the driver as a white male who had an amazed look on his face.  The two vehicles continued on their way without stopping.  To this day, my dad says that he wishes that he would have stopped and spoken to the other driver. My dad said that he rolled down the window of his MG while the object was moving in front of him and that the object made absolutely no sound.  He said that it seemed to almost &quot;absorb&quot; sound it was so quiet.  His vehicle never lost power throughout the entire event. This description of events has remained constant throughour the many times that he has told me this.  He is older now, yet still very lucid in his description and would be willing to share this with others.  He is adamant that the event occured in January or February of 1960.  What is interesting is reading the other events concerning a green cigar in the early 1960s. It is interesting to note that on two separate occasions, we have witnesses similar events at the same time over the last fifteen years while being about ten miles from each other.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

After watching it for awhile, he thought it looked like there were actually two objects dancing around each other.  He came and woke me up, and we tried looking at it with my binoculars (which are better than some telescopes).  I too thought it looked like there were two separate things.  It looked like a ball of light, about the size of a very large star, and sometimes it would separate into two balls of light.  Even through the binoculars it still only looked like balls of light with red and blue parts.  Sometimes the two things were so close together it looked like one, and sometimes they looked like they were circling around each other.  Their position in the sky did not change.  We watched it for about a half hour total, and since it wasn&apos;t doing anything different we went to bed.  We are going to see if it&apos;s there again tonight.  My husband does not know how long it was there before he saw it; he had been on the computer and noticed it out the window when he got up to go to bed.((NUFORC Note:  We have amended the date above to 2005.

They continued moving slowly across I-19 heading East to West , then abruptly picked up speed , then altitude. they were completely out of sight on the Western horizon about 1 minute after this abrupt speed and altitude change happened.After getting over the shock, we both remember that there was a faint outline of a straight wing or structure on one side of the object.

It was late in the evening and we were returning to port after spending the entire day fishing. I was steering the boat and the other two were out on deck when I suddenly heard them screaming exciting. At first I thought they spotted a whale shark but my brother came running up to the captains house screaming &lsquo;look at that thing off of the portside. I quickly exited and noticed a cylinder shaped object about &frac12; mile from us protruding from the water. It was sticking straight out of the water about 45-50 feet and looked to be about 4 feet wide. The object quickly disappeared under the water and reappeared a few seconds later closer to my vessel. It elevated to the height of 60-70 feet within 5-6 seconds and stayed stationary for a few seconds and submerged again. It reappeared again moving further away but the height of the object rose to a great elevation, It begin moving in the direction the bow of my vessel submerging as it was moving.  It was completely under water when it was near my boat. We looked in vain to see what this object was attached to be nothing ever broke the surface of the water. I reported this incident to a friend that works for the coast guard. He said he knew of nothing that would that be capable of supporting such a cylinder and elevating itself above the water and submerging in a few seconds. I&rsquo;m hoping someone else has reported seeing a similar object here. Any help will be greatly appreciated.((NUFORC Note:  We have written the witness, inquiring whether the object might have been a periscope of a nearby submarine.  We are awaiting a response from the individual, and will add any further comments we receive back from him.  PD))((ADDENDUM TO ORIGINAL REPORT))Mr. Davenport I just received your last email regarding your request. I&rsquo;m inclined to say no to any attention this may bring to family and me. I think the size of the object rules out a periscope.  This object was the size of a support pylon you would see under an overpass. It was huge.  My estimation is that object was at least 4 feet wide, circler and appeared smooth and black. I really have no way of knowing the distance of the object except for dead reckoning. Without embellishing the size I still think it broke water and rose to a height of 45-65 feet. The ascent took several second and it remained stationary before it slipped below the water. The lapse of time between submersion and resurfacing was 30-40 seconds and within that time frame it moved 300-500 yards while it was underwater. It did indeed change directions. As the object surfaced and submerged it did cause a wake and disturbance in its area.  Its velocity I guess was approx 20-25 knots when it made its final descent as it moved. At no time did we see what the object was attached to if anything at all. I did not make an official report to the U.S. Navy for obvious reasons. Mainly I didn&rsquo;t want to suffer any ridicule and I do not want nor am I seeking publicity. I just want a logical explanation as to want we saw. Quite possibly it was something in military in nature.I do know that it moved in a conscious nature. Something controlled the manner in which it moved. I hope my email sheds some further light and answers some of your questions. Thank you for your time.P.S I made a typing mistake regarding the time the event took place.

Bud Glade was on guard and reported that he saw a number of objects that would move rapidly in one direction and then shoot off at an angle in another direction. This was in the spring of 1951 as I remember. Bud was wounded in Korea but he should be living in SLC. I saw him a number of times after the war. Anyway, I&apos;ve heard of this flight behavior before. It was common in that day. Can you tell me what it was? It could have been military flights flying in formation. I have another question you might answer. In Korea in the fall of 1951 the sky looked as blue as possible with possibly faint clouds. What we saw were wave forms exactly like those when you toss a rock into a pool of water. It looked to me that the waves formed far north. I thought that maybe there was a nuclear test in the USSR that send out the wave forms. Can you explain this atmospheric behavior?  I&apos;ve never seen a UFO but my dad said that he saw one of the cigar shaped critters over Zion&rsquo;s or Brice Canyon back in the 50s. I saw part of the latest network TV show on UFOs. I also was watching the History Channel tonight with the Chinese stuff. I&apos;m not a member of the &quot;Church of the UFO&quot; but I do enjoy listening to what others say. The problem in my opinion is that there are too many nuts and too little hard evidence or plausible explanations. But UFOs are fun and some people make their living that way. I heard that &quot;Nuclear Scientist&quot; speak at ISU in the 1960s. I&apos;ve forgotten his name, but he was making a buck touring around. He was not very convincing but he was fun to listen too. Besides, ISU was paying his fees and it was free to me. His stuff didn&apos;t impress me at all at that time, but he has gathered more since. I remember in the 1950s that a &quot;UFO&quot; went flashing over the SLC Airport. I could see that it was an airliner after studying the thing. I also knew that there would be many UFO reports. There were! I called the newspaper and told them that it was an airliner. They did not retract their story even though they told me a zillion people had corrected them. So the story is still in there for anyone to read in the library with no retraction. So it became part of &quot;UFOalogy&quot; or whatever it is now called. Anyway, I do hope you are having a great time with your stuff. Are there UFOs? Of course there are. They are flying objects not identified. Nothing more until someone comes up with credible hard evidence and shows it to the world. I&apos;m sure that any aliens would run like scared rabbits if they came within our radio traffic (and could understand us) or if they picked up our nuclear explosions. I wouldn&apos;t expect any hint of them after 1945! What really scares me is that we could someday send our species out to ruin the rest of the universe.

I watched a craft cross the valley below us it passed over a town over our heads and out towards the moors (Dartmoor). The craft was about 120meters long eighty meters high at one end and forty the other and about forty wide. Basically an L-shaped building. Travelling at about 50mph and at a height of about 50feet. Every straight edge was as a flourescent tube. Underneath were three white lights joined by huge pipes. At the rear of the craft there were two wing like structures which seemed to be emmiting a blue/purple light this appeared to be propelling it along in a Northerly direction. The craft emmitted a low electrical humming noise as it passed overhead - similar to a sunbed or electro magnet((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

As we approached the connecting freeway highway 15 from highway 58 there was a truck blocking the road because he tried to turn around and got stuck.  After several attempts of people trying to help him, cars found a way to get around.  There was a ditch behind the truck, and cars tried to drive partially under the truck into the ditch.  We made it, and not far up the road there were red and blue lights coming toward us.  I assumed it was a police car.  When it reached us it stopped or drove backwards because I was still driving.  It all seemed like in slow motion.  There were no wheels underneath, and we were looking desparately for tires.  It hovered right next to my car and the drivers side as if it was looking in at us.  I said, do you see what I see and she said yes.  I proceeded to try and get away and it stayed with us a short time and then took off like a light, there was no sound as I rolled down my window.

Temp. was around 40 deg. My father was outside getting ready to start unloading his van , when he came in and asked us if we wanted to see a UFO . As soon as he pointed in the direction that he had see it we rushed out onto the deck , me just expecting to see some strange lights , as we had seen on two other encounters, looked straight up over head where dad was pointing. I was awe struck to see three triangular shaped crafts just barely visible in the night sky, seeming to just be giving off a glowing reflection and a slight silloet. one of the ships had a amber light and they were headed north at an speed of 60-80 mph perhaps a little slower. I could make out some detail of the under side of the vessele as i strained to take in as much of this spectical as possible just faintly seeing possible panles and contures in its structure. As they headed to the north and i was assuming that that was it they reached the hilltop 1/2 mile to the north of us and to our amazement made a 180 degree turn and headed right back over us for a second look. At that moment Im thinking can we hitch a ride . Well knowing that a photo wouldnt develope well under such low lighting we all just stood and looked on as they proceded over and continued heading south and out of sight over the dark horizon. All the time I qas watching I was listening for the slightes sound and all i could make out on that calm cool night was a faint whir like wind or air passing over the crafts smooth surface. When the crafts were at the hill crest I could estamate their altitude at around 500 - 900 ft. , and then on their second pass I figure that they were around 100 ft in length and 75 ft in width and perhaps 25 - 40 % larger .My girl friend At the time who always looked at me strange when I would mention some of the questionable sightings I had in the past was speachless and never mentioned this to any one that I know of , and this is the first public mention that I or any of my family has made of this outside of a few close friends and relitives.After looking through some of the reports and finding a few that could be in the same time frame and had very close discriptions as to what we saw I thought I would let them know their not seeing things , well yes they did see something ...Im sure that after I post this som other details will come to mind but their was soo much to take in in those few short minutes that seemed to go in slow motion.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

As we watched it, it let off four (4) smaller circles (bright orange) off the lower right and as all were in complete view; everything suddenly vanished. My Dad had checked the evening news and the morning paper and nothing was said about this. However, at the breakfastroom at the motel we were staying at in Green Valley, we had a comment from a neighboring breakfast couple stating that &quot;You saw that too???&quot;.AWESOME!((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

We ended up somewhere around Goldfield, Nev. south of Tonopah. One night we were in the back of a pickup off a main highway. There were four of us in the truck, which had run off the road and was stuck in the sand. We had spent hours trying to dig out or drive out, but the truck was buried up to its hubcaps. We decided someone would have to walk out in the morning and try to get help. Meanwhile we were stargazing. We started talking about &quot;flying saucers&quot; as we called them in those days. My girlfriend said, &quot;Let&apos;s see if we can contact a saucer to help us.&quot; So she and I started trying to telepathically contact a saucer. Not long afterwards we all saw a light approaching. I don&rsquo;t know the direction it came from. It looked just like a bright star except it was moving towards us. It got much brighter as it drew overhead, about the size of the blunt end of a pencil held at arm&rsquo;s length. At that moment we felt the truck move. It rose straight up in the air about a foot or two off the ground, floated to the middle of the road, and gently set down. Then the light moved back in the direction it came from and blinked out. My memories of that experience were verified by my friend when I contacted her for the first time more than 40 years later. The first thing she said was, &quot;What do you remember about that night?&quot;  We agreed on all the details except I remembered screaming and she remembered laughing.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates he works in the newspaper industry.

A very bright beam of light shone on me from behind, and thinking it was a car coming, moved to the side. But a car didn&apos;t pass me. I thought nothing of it since I had passed a house not far back (opposite the cliff) and maybe the car had stopped there (didn&apos;t look back). A minute later again a light from behind, throwing my shadow directly in front of me, and again moved the side so a car could pass, the light went out and no car passed.Another minute or so later it happens again and I noticed my shadow moving in an odd way, turned around to see what was going on and saw a bright light, maybe twice the apparent size of a full moon in the treetops high up on the cliff.  Just as I looked at the light it went off, fading out and seeming to turn as it did so. I stood there puzzling on what was going on, knowing that there were no trails on this cliffside.I continued on my way another few yards and the light came on again. It did seem to be a beam of light, shining directly at me, since it only illuminated the area right around me.  And just as before, when I looked up at the light, it faded out and seemed to turn as it did so.  I saw some diagonal movement of the light before and during it&apos;s fading.  I continued into Pana for a much needed beer, but unable to tell anyone for several days of the events of that evening.Years later saw two men on an afternoon talk show telling of there experience while in a small boat on a lake at night. Their description of the light, turning or swiveling as it faded out, seems almost identical to my event. Also read in a book about a couple hiking an area well known to them after dark, and seeing a similar light shining at them from across a valley, moving through the treetops on a cliffside too steep for any trails.", "Very low, very slow flying, silent, black trapezoid viewed by 4 family members for about two minutesOn the particular UFO sighting night, I had been out of doors for quite a while  and was getting chilled and tired of the lawn chair. The duration of my stargazing session was probably from around 8 PM to nearly 10PM that nite. Just to be safe, I&apos;d say that the hours from 730PM to 11PM found me outside looking up. Well about the time I get up to go inside, my mom or dad, comes out back to get me. Here&apos;s the odd part. I&apos;m right outside a little ways into the back yard (which is chainlink fenced for our dog) to be apart from the ambient light from the house. We had sliding glass doors to the back yard and a small concrete patio. So I&apos;m out in the yard and instead of going right into the den through the sliding doors I get up  and walk north to  the yard fence gate and go through it around to the carport and enter the house through the utility/laundry room into the kitchen. I took off my coat and may have had a blanket to put away and then go into the kitchen which opens into the den.  Huh....no family in the den??? Wonder where they went, I&apos;m thinking? About that time they all ( both parents, older brother, and younger sister) come back into the house through the sliding glass doors into the den. The ensuing conversation goes something like this.Where&apos;d you guys go?-I ask.Out back looking fo you! -they replied.All of you?-I ask.Yea,...did you see it? See what? The UFO! No,........you guys are kidding me, right? NO! didn&apos;t you SEE it? No, I didn&apos;t. Where was it? What did it look like? It was right over the house, It was HUGE, black and made no noise! They all were looking at me quite seriously and no acting or practical joking was going on because my disbelief and smiling about their responses should have cracked at least my little sister&apos;s composure. She was about10 -11 years old at the time.You guys are joking, right? No! they insisted.How big was it? What color was it? What did it do, where did it go? What did it look like? WHY didn&apos;t you get me? They thought I was also looking at it the same time but didn&apos;t see me because I was walking around the house and went under the carport. Plus they were all looking up. My dad, a 20 year Army pilot then got a sheet of notebook paper folded it in half and drew what they witnessed. It was silent, dark grey or flat black in color without insignia of any kind visible. No panels, windows, landing gear, protrusions or cockpit were visible. Four small red lights located on the underside that were constant in nature were seen. The altitude was twice a telephone pole above the ground as it flew over telephone poles and the tree tops in our neighborhood at the time were lower than this.  Size of the craft was in the 60-80 foot width and 45-55 foot length. Flat was the general profile description my family gave. The drawing my dad did within a couple of minutes of the sighting was that of a trapezoid, not a true triangle, but an equilateral triangle with the apex missing  at near the half-way point.  No rounded edges or bulges. The small red lights were located near the corner points of the craft. Altitude and speed remained constant during viewing.They viewed it for about 90 seconds to two minutes as it went from North to South across the backyards of Victoria drive (map availabel upon request) crossing Rucker Blvd and continuing  on out of view. Estimated speed was between 5 and 25 MPH maybe closer to 10 MPH. My dad held up his hand palm down and demonstrated a slow, smooth flight. He also indicated that he could have hit it with a baseball, hand thrown.Kind of amazing to me after all these evenings that I&apos;m out back with good quality &quot;big eyes&quot; as I call them (binox) and my normal path into the house would have put me right into the den with the family, but noooo, I go slowly around the house under the carport while the first of my family members to see the craft calls the rest outside to witness the event and I miss the whole thing.

My brother and I had one many, many years ago and I would very much be interested in finally reporting something that was only shared with my parents and a few friends.  My friends, when hearing my story, were somewhat incredulous but knowing that my brother and I are of very serious character, they find it very hard to believe that we are making up a story.  Needless to say, my parents believe us wholeheartedly. A summer evening, either 1974 or 1975, a friend called me to pick her up from the mall since her brother had neglected to do so.  My mother asked my younger brother (either 9 or 10 years old at the time) to accompany me.  As I drove on Ford Avenue (Woodbridge, NJ), over the NJ Turnpike bridge, my brother motioned to the sky and asked me to look at what he had spotted.  I was in awe when I saw a very large disk surrounded by a series of round white lights all along its perimeter.  It was quietly hovering -- not a sound was heard from the sky.  It looked like there was also a dim blue light emanating from it -- as if it were at the tip of an antenna -- this light was very hard to see so I can&apos;t attest that it was anywhere associated with an antenna, or exactly where it might have been located. As the object hovered, it amazingly began rotating vertically on its axis, then it became horizontal once again and dashed away behind a set of trees directly in front of our line of vision -- that&apos;s when my brother and I lost visual contact. I&apos;m sorry that I did not look at the object more intently -- I was driving, and when I slowed down to take a good look at it, the drivers behind me began feeverishly beeping their horns.  I may have missed seeing the object altogether if my brother hadn&apos;t spotted it.  I surmise the other drivers did not see it -- they wouldn&apos;t be in such a rush to drive along if they had. I&apos;ll never forget the sense of wonder and fright (I was trembling slightly) at witnessing such an object.  My brother and I had not ever been interested in UFOs nor did any reading on the subject -- we were not in the least bit biased and prone to interpreting unusual sights to be UFOs -- needless to say the sighting spurred our interest. When I got back from the mall (without my friend who finally had gotten picked up by her brother), my brother and I related the story to 2 little girls in the neighborhood -- they had seen exactly the same thing!!

The center craft in the formation had a bright white strobing light directly in the center  on the bottom.  The shapes were each about the size of a dime held at arms length.  There was absolutely no discernable sound from the formation before they were overhead, during the flyover, and after they&apos;d passed.

Could it have been a helicopter?  I don&apos;t think so it was pretty high but unusually bright and with no noise.  There were planes much higher than this object and I could make them out with no problem. Most of all because of their FFA lights.

As it flew over it would flash different colors: white, blue, red, and green, one at a time. It flew over the buildings doing unremarkable moves and came down like it was going to land but flew right back up. I kept asking my husband what it was and he said it looked like a military flight training exercise known as touch and go, they fly in like they are going to land but fly right back up. Then I said &quot;why would they be doing training exercises at 10:00pm and flying that low to the buildings. He said the military trains at all hours of the night and it was probably the El Centro base.

We started up the sand dune trail toward the beach, when suddenly(and for the first time ever) my seven year old dog pointed toward the beach end of the path and her backhair was standing up.

There were NO people on the beach but off to our left(West) and approaching  us at a slow speed were three glowing spheres of strange light. I looked down at Kahlua and she was following these objects and didn&apos;t move.  (She was not leashed) They were about 5 feet above the shore where the small waves were meeting the sand.I could see the foam of the small wavelets illuminated by the spheres ,directly below them. They were in an echelon formation (like jets fly off each others wing tips). One sphere was ahead of the other two and they were each off to one side and behind the lead sphere.  Their surfaces were of a yellow/pink static light that ran around the globes like little lightning bolts but thin and many.  It was very quiet ,except for the breeze rushing past our ears off the lake. I remember seeing lightning way across the lake near Chicago (which you can see the taller buildings on a clear day).It was miles away and barely saw the lightning.  These globes were about 3- 4 feet in diameter and a few feet apart and moved Eastward directly in front of us.  That&apos;s when I got a good look.The static surface gave me a good view of their outlines and they were perfect globes. I got goosebumps and hair must&apos;ve stood on my arms. I pinched myself to make sure I wasn&apos;t dreaming. Kahlua never moved except for her head while staring at these spheres with me.The globes kept moving and seemed to speed up and we watched until they became a single light (due to distance) and they disappeared downshore as they moved out of sight toward New Buffalo,Michigan. I often wonder why I and/or Kahlua never walked or ran closer to see these at close range?  It seemed I didn&apos;t want to move. I was afraid.I had lived and walked this beach for at least 1 year and never saw anything as puzzling as this. The globes were controlled and never wavered once in their flight.I reported the sighting to the Michigan City Police the next day but they just laughed and said it was probably &quot;airplane lights&quot;. No way...not 80 -100 feet in front of me along the breaking waves and illuminating the foam only.  I sent this report at the time, to Dr. J. Allen Hynek at Northwestern Univ. but never heard anything more.I&apos;m a blue collar worker with some collage and was sober and wide awake at the time. I also knew the beach area at night since I lived just a few minutes walk from the water&apos;s edge and spent much of my my free time there.Question: Has anyone else reported close encounters with lights,spheres, or otherwise along the beaches of Lake Michigan ?? Thank you for letting me report this unknown.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  We have heard many such reports of luminous spheres.

However, on this morning we were awakened from a sound sleep by a noise that was directly over our house and was like a grinding noise, like a stump grinder or shredder. It was NOT a helicopter or plane. It was definitely coming from above and not around, and upon getting up to see if there was anything around, noted that there were no lights on around the neighborhood, nor did the sound seem all-encompassing. It seemed to be located directly over our house, toward the back bedroom area and lessened in intensity as I moved to the front and opposite end of the house. It seemed to make the house shudder, like a heavy vibration, but even though the sky was fairly clear, there was nothing in the sky when I got to the point where I could see out a window. I was afraid to go outside, because the noise was that threatening. My husband was as stunned as I and our daughter, who sleeps downstairs in the basement, was also awakened by the noise and the vibration. This is not the first time we have experienced what we believe to be extra-terrestrial events, though my husband and a friend witnessed the last event and have not posted it.

My first thought was the object was an airplane. It flashed about every 40 seconds or so. There was not an exact time frame between each flash as the flashes varied in the timing. The object remained in the same spot for about 45 minutes. It appeared to be the size of a bright star. I could not see an object, just the bright flash.

It was like a star and moved cleanly but as we watched, but it slowed in speed which was strange, so we watched longer. The star like object slowed down so much it stopped and stayed stationary for a bit and then shot off very quickly, disappearing. I have seen satillites before and they emit the same amount of light. It just seemed strange for a satillite to slow to a stop and disappear like this object did.I have another sighting in Florida while I was visiting from Atlanta, I was on my cell phone outside,cause it didnt work in the house, and for a cool 5 seconds I noticed a light, just like the sighting previous, zigzaging thought the sky.

I think something very interesting about my encounter is that it happened again in 1989. The first encounter happened when I was 8 years old with my friend ((name deleted)) also 8. We were camping out in his front yard. He and his family lived out in the country. We were about to go to sleep in his Pop up trailer and all of a sudden there was a very deep thrust noise and the trailer began to vibrate. We ran outside to see what was happening and looked up and saw a very large cigar shaped object hovering above us. Lights underneath the craft of different colors seemed to flash from left to right one after the other across the bottom of the craft. We ran inside to get binoculars and accidentally wake up his father who than came out with us. We were outside again within seconds and the craft was gone. We did think we could barely see it hovering on the horizon for some time but it was too far away to see anything. Chad and I were avid model airplane builders and were very familiar with military aircraft. We knew what we saw was not a blimp because there was no way it could have hovered over us and then been miles off the horizon within seconds. My second encounter happened in 1989. Also in Midland, at my child hood home. At approximately 2am again I had pulled into my driveway after leaving my girlfriends home. I decided to listen to a song before I went inside. As I was sitting in my car my car began to vibrate and I heard a very low base noise. Suprised, I made sure my woofers were turned off in my car and turned down my stereo. I noticed lights reflecting off my sisters car and immediately looked around for other cars and there were none in sight. Then I noticed the lights were reflecting off the top of her car. I got out, looked up and saw once again a large cigar shaped object with lights flashing left to right across the bottom of the craft. Both times it seemed to to be about 100 yards long and about 100 ft. in the air. Once again I ran inside to get binoculars and ran back outside (waking my mother accidentally). once again it was gone. As I scanned the horizon I could see it. This time I was 19 and had a car so I got into my car to chase it. I never could get any closer to it. It seemed to just stay out of my visual reference, no matter how far I drove. So I turned around and went home. Thank you for your time, please call with any questions or collaborating evidence. John DeFrance", "Two objects leading a third, or was the two  objects being followed ?( I am in my 50&rsquo;s ), and at approximately 9:15 p.m. CST on Friday, March 11th 2005, I took my dog out into our back yard. It was a very clear night and the stars were bright.  Maybe 10-15 minutes had passed by and I looked up at the sky just to gaze at all the stars.  Then something caught my eye.  Coming from the East was a pair of objects that looked about as bright as a star and traveling side by side and maybe 100-200 yards across from each other.  Both were a steady white color and traveling at what seemed like a high altitude.  But, behind them, and maybe at a slightly lower altitude, was also another object.  It almost looked as if the front two objects were leading the back object, or the back object was following the front two. I could not see a shape or anything other than the white lights of the first two objects. The back object had what looked like three colors that rotated and they appeared to be towards the bottom. It had red on the starboard side, white in the center, and blue on the port side.  These lights were all about the same intensity as far as brightness. To me, it reminded me of a toadstool. That is, it looked like a disc on top and then like a short stem in the center and that is the area which the lights appeared to be coming from.  As I watched these three objects approaching the Des Moines area, the two white objects traveling together made a gradual turn and took a new heading of SSW.  As they made the turn, I could see stars in between them so this seemed to rule out the idea of them as one large object. No contrails could be seen. The object with the rotating lights continued on its east to west path and as it passed over head I did not see any lights, but once it passed over, I could once again see these rotating colors.  The first time I saw it I was going to dismiss it as a jet that maybe had its landing lights on, because that would explain the white light in the middle. But on planes, the lights are apart and you see a black gap between them.  These lights appeared to be side by side and reminded me of the lights on top of a police car, only larger. At no time was noise ever heard.  Between the time I first spotted these objects until the time they passed out of sight was probably 3 minutes.", "I saw what appeared to be a large boomerang shaped craft with pale blue lights along the leading edge.I was driving east toward Boone, NC, along US Hwy 421, which is in the NE corner of the state, at approximately 10 - 10:30 PM, about the middle of December, of 1982.  It was a cold &amp; crisp evening with no clouds, and was a beautiful starry night.  I was looking out my side window toward the nearby mountains which the road paralleled, when something above caught my eye.  There was not any other traffic on the road at this time.  Slowing down somewhat to try &amp; get a better look at what I had thought I had seen, I rolled the window down &amp; looked out &amp; up.  At this time I saw a bunch of pale blue lights in formation overhead moving slowly toward the northeast.  I pulled off the side of the road &amp; got out of my vehicle.  Overhead, at what I guessed to be maybe 1000 - 1200 feet above, I could just barely make out the shape of a large dark boomerang and the pale blue lights were evenly spaced along the leading edge.  The lights did not waver and were constant.  I could easily see the stars behind the object blotted out as the shape passed in front of them.  Shortly after pulling over, another vehicle came along heading in the same direction as I had been.  My lights were still on, &amp; I assume they must have thought I had a vehicle problem, as they slowed down &amp; pulled over a short distance behind me.  They saw me standing by the side of the road peeering up, &amp; they also got out to see what I was looking at.  There were 2 or 3 people in the other car.  I never did get their names, but pointed out to them what I was seeing.  They saw it as well.  The shape seemed to be moving quite slowly across the sky.  There was no sound at all.  I assumed the altitude of the shape above, as I had nothing to gauge the distance by, it being dark.  But looking at the object &amp; holding my arms extended upward &amp; pointing to either side of the boomerang itself, my hands were approximately 3 1/2 feet apart.  This is the only way I can judge how big the shape was, other than that the shape was about the same size as the B-52 bombers, which used to do fly overs on a regular basis over the area during the early days of the Vietnam War, in training missions.  These bombers used to fly at about 1000 - 1200 feet, close enough to the ground that you could see the windows along the side, &amp; could easily make out the markings on the wings.  I watched this object as it slowly passed overhead, until I could see it no longer.  I don&apos;t think it was any kind or type of conventional aircraft, due to the fact that it made no sound whatsoever, &amp; it seemed to be moving too slowly for its size.  I have never seen anything like this before or after this one night, but I will certainly never forget what I saw.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Helicopter very dark against sky. Sky and stars very clear, very sparse occasional cloud. Noticed a red stationery light in sky maybe 20 degrees above horizon, at first thought to be a star or planet but then realised that there was a circle of red lights all equidistant surrounding whole area at roughly same altitude. Distance unknown but above occasional clouds. Through binoculars lights appeared to change red and green. Helicopter appeared  to be tracking same circle. Through binoculars helicopter appeared to have in addition to minimal flying navigation lights two or more very bright red small lights located mid fuselage possibly lasers. Helicopter increased altitude for approx 5 minutes in direction of one light. Lights remained stationery for entire duration and helicopter circled for 1 hour approx. Helicopter then departed - lights remained but futher duration unknown as now very cold and tired so stopped watching. 3 adult members of family all saw same occurrence. Cause of lights totally unexplicable as nothing like this seen before.  Helicopter definitely monitoring them as flightpath matched the circle and occasionally hovered sideways to the lights. Possibly a military experiment? However these were not flares as did not descend or drift. Area is long known for strange occurences so hence report, have never seen this activity before.

We got off our bikes and watched the object for about five minutes in its stationary position. It made no noise of any kind. It then,literally, accelerated at tremendous speed to a point 45 degrees to the west and below the treeline about five miles away. The point where we were standing was atop a hill above the surrounding area. Within another second or so it began rising above the treeline to the northwest. After a few seconds of rising above the treeline to a point about 45 degrees in declination, it began quickly accelerating  up and down and side to side in 180 degree reversals of direction while wobbling. It remained black in color throughout this 10 minute period from the start of our observation, again making no noise and was now positioned about five to seven miles distant. It also appeared to have a slight atmospheric disturbance around its immediate periphery. I could not believe what this object was doing in terms of its erratic movements, apparently without being affected by the force of gravity. If it were, all on board would have been crushed to death due to their own inertia. The object then came toward us and again was almost directly overhead at the one o&apos;clock position facing Nortwest but very low perhaps no nore than a few thousand feet. It was highly polished, appearing black because it appeared to be reflecting light. It tilted downward towards us and I could then see the shiny metallic-chrome looking surface with an elevated central section, about one-third the diameter of the craft. It then righted itself and slowly moved away back over the treeline to the west where it had disappeared over the treeline the first time. I have seen weather balloons, aircraft of all types and even the SR-71 Blackbird at several hundred feet of altitude in 1965 when it was still top-secret. I could see the pilots with their spacehelmets on throught the cockpit windows and the red pin stripes that surrounded the fuselage.I did not find out what it was until 1975 when I saw it in an Air Force recruiting station. I have seen videos of UFO&apos;s that looked and acted exactly like the one I saw on television, and have downloaded pictures online several years ago of the object that I saw as photographed by others all over the world. Those pictures show the same black-appearing underside that I saw when looking up at the craft, and also the shiny metallic chrome-like upper surface when obseving the craft at an angle from the side. I am convinced that the black on the underside only appears black because it reflects light, and at certain angles, much like a mirror can appear to be black to an outside observer. I am a science teacher and an amateur astronomer with an 18&quot; Obsession telescope with Binovision. I am thoroughly versed in astronomy and the sciences and I can tell you unequivocally that this craft was definitely not of this world.A few years ago I downloaded a picture taken by someone in Switzerland in 1975,the same year as my observation, and I have e-mailed it to you using your hyperlink.

In the evening hours roughly between 8:00 and 9:00 P.M. in the summer of 1980 or 81 (the year is sketchy for me because I was only about 5 years old at the time) My mother, brother and I were on our way to pick up my older sister from a friends house on the backroads of Hancock County, Indiana. It was only a few miles from home on the way back when my mother stopped the car and turned off the motor and began frantically rolling down the window. My brother and I were in the backseat and my sister had shotgun. My brother and I enquired as to why we stopped and my mother told us to look through the windshield directly in front of us. Upon looking ahead all four of us saw what appeared to be a large round white light moving very slowly and low to the ground from right to left crossing the road in front of us. My mother was trying to get the window down to see if it made a noise, it appeared not to. When it finally reached the other side of the road above a field the object blinked out like someone flipping a switch and as quick as it appeared it was gone. We were all in awe and a little frightened by this. We did not report this to anyone outside our family, my mother being worried we might become the town kooks or something but we found out later we were not the only ones who witnessed this object. Apparently a farm family had a terrifying experience a little earlier that evening and had reported it to some sort of investigators I am not sure who, and a burned circular imprint was found in a field close to the family&apos;s farm. To the best of my recollection this object somewhat harrassed the family by hovering near the home for quite a long time.

A famous actor purchased the property and had the old beach home demolished and built a new home there.I believe my sighting took place around the eleventh of April,1987 but I&apos;m not certain as to that exact date.  However I am certain of the following. While I was admiring the beautiful ocean scenery from the back porch facing the ocean ,I saw a UFO.It just appeared before my eyes.It did not merely just sail in from some perimeter.It manifested instantly.It was a fairly dark night and this tubular shaped UFO was very large.This also was a very up close encounter.I called for my son and after several emotional outcries he finally responded by rushing out to the back porch.He still is very haunted by the memory.I too have no equal experience to diminish this.As far as features go,there were no signs on this craft revealing it being assembled by the usually standardized fabrications we see in aircraft such as rivetings or weldings or paint.However there were metallic trims around the many windows that adorned this airship from front to back that seemed to be the only thing I could define as perhaps seeming &quot;natural&quot; to my eyes.It was raw metallic and flawless in it&apos;s design.It had semblance to a blimp but however this was a colossus that stretched several hundred yards in lenghth and had no carriage or motor housings.It made no noise that I might discriminate and the ocean was relativity quiet. A brilliant ray-beam of light emitted from the entire bottom side.My son left in my car to go in pursuit of this craft as I watched it slowly travel left to points ahead.A short time later at 11:00 PM the local news media reported that the Coast Guard Auxiliary Station at Carolina Beach, N.C. issued a statement that the UFO being reported by people all up and down the Eastern Seaboard was nothing more than just their drug surveillance vehicle.Me and my son began to laugh.It was the one time we could as that UFO was and still remains to this day the most spellbinding encounter to date.He posted his post about this years ago on this website and no one has backed him up as he asked for.Well here is my account.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

One night two of them were so low that I thought for an instant that they were street lights and when one of them left the area, it was flying below the roof tops of the businesses across the street from my house!) Anyway, the two airplanes were high above the flashing star and seemed to criss-cross, they were both in the flight path (going opposite directions).  This is when I noticed another very bright flashing light closer to me which was just below the flight path and flashing mainly red and white.  It began jerking back and forth quickly for about 4 seconds and then quickly began to move off to the right, past the cell tower across the street from my house heading for Auburn.  I checked back for the first &rsquo;star&rsquo; and it was still flashing mainly white very far off.  By this time, it was about 10:08pm, that&rsquo;s when I went downstairs to write this report.  There has been so much going on in this area (Sumner) for months and we have some pretty incredible video footage shot a few weeks ago out my bedroom window, looking towards the football field.  Actually, we have quite a few stories and good video of at least four sightings.((NUFORC Note:  One of five reports from same witness.

What was this thing?My husband (fiance at the time) and I were standing out in front of my parent&apos;s house in the driveway, kissing goodnight.  The moon was bright when we started our goodnight kiss, but within seconds it appeared to suddenly became very dark, and very quiet.  It was as if we were standing in an absence of sound. We stopped kissing and looked up into the sky, and moving directly over my parent&apos;s house was a HUGE black triangular craft.  It was absolutely silent, except for a slight hissing of moving air.  The craft could not have been more than 100-200 yards over the house, so we got a fantastic look at the underside of the object.  There were dim lights on the underside, and on the back of the object as it moved away from us over the rest of the neighborhood at a VERY VERY slow speed.  We just stood there in complete silence watching this thing move away until we could not see the object any longer. Once the object passed, we could see the moon again, and normal night sounds filled the area.   Both of us, looked at each other, quickly said goodnight, and I ran into the house. He quickly got into his car and drove to his home.  I was pretty freaked out by what we saw, and looked for an explanation in the paper the next day, but there was nothing reported.  We are not located near an airforce base, nor have any military maneuvers run over our city that I am aware of.  This object was so low to the ground, it was as if we were looking up at the underside of a Star Wars model.  The object was moving from the West to the South East through the night sky. I told my folks the next morning, but they shrugged it off as something military.  Was this a UFO, or could it have been a secret military craft?  We have not spoken about this to many folks for fear they would think we were nuts.  We didn&apos;t realize that there was a place to report such sightings, or we would have reported this when it happened.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

I told her I grew up as son of a loadmaster in the air force. And that is no helicopter. It had a orange/red glow on the bottom like molten steel. In the middle section it had pulsating lights of different colors. It moved extremely slow towards lake superior, then hovered. When it hovered the blinking lights got really fast and colorful. Then it slowly decended to the lake and I lost sight of it. No Sound. I was In the navy for 4 years on an aircraft carrier. That was not any aircraft that I know of.

My father was a house painter with a sixth-grade education, and mother was a secretary. Anyway, they lived in a little town called Emerson, which is perhaps 25 miles from New York City. On this night, around midnight or perhaps 1 a.m., they were coming home from a bingo game or similar small-town event, when they saw a large, brightly lit and low-flying rectangular object near a major thoroughfare, Kinderkamack Road. It was so large and well defined that they first thought it was a billboard, and they remarked something like: &quot;Gee, why would the town put up a big billboard like that?&quot;  Then they noticed that it was moving slowly and silently over the town. It just moved away, over some treetops, and that was the end of the encounter. They never reported it to law enforcement, and they never heard of anyone else in town seeing this object.

This thing had the mechanics, details and lights. And of course it was dead silent!The date and time is not exact. It was summer and late, as we were tossing a beach ball around. A neighbor boy who was 7 and lived across the street of me to the left and my close girl friend who was 11 at the time (and lived 1 house north of the boy);and I was 8 years old at the time. At some point the ball got away from me and landed just into the boy&apos;s front yard. As I picked up the ball, I looked up to see a glowing round (dare I say) saucer shaped &quot;thing&quot;. The disk was silent, floating above the full grown maple tree line; and from where I was standing, just above the boy&apos;s house. It seemed as if it was glowing, yet it did not give off light as a lit football field would on the horizion. The detail on this thing made us stand there in awe, watching it. There were mechanical &quot;things&quot; all around it, such as pipes, cylinders, and other devices. Much like a person looking at the workings of a cars engine. It was bright white in the sky, with the exception of a red flashing light. The flashing light was a slow strobe, and very rythmic. The thing we saw was not moving and never did actually move, yet no sound what so ever was heard. If you have ever seen a picture of Disney&apos;s Space Mountain, this thing would somewhat resemble it. The slightly domed top (lit white) {liken it to the lid of a pan or pot} and the details were round the item like a deep pan, and a flat-ish bottom. The duration of time we stared at this object seemed like an eternity, as we screamed for our parents. Unfortunatly our parents thought we were just playing and ignored us. As I ran into my house to retrieve my parents so that they could verify this thing we were seeing, and they finally made their way outside. The thing had disappeared. I asked my two friends, and they said this thing that was glowing disappeared, only leaving the red flashing light for a few moments. Then the flashing light also disappeared.We live very close to a small air field called Lost Nation Airport and I have lived with small planes, helicopters and even personal jets flying in and out of there as long as I can remember. I know what these things sound like, what they do and what they can never do. I also know that the only way in 1974 that the detail we saw on this thing could ever be duplicated is if you had a painted, detailed picture and projected it onto a large screen (such as a drive in movie screen)and somehow hung it high above the tree line. I am to this day bothered by this image and truely wish to know if the three of us were the only ones to witness this. Something like this could not have only been seen by elementary school aged kids in the middle of the suburbs! Mentor, even then, was a dense area of houses and it was a beautiful, warm night. There is no way that anyone else could have missed it (at all). I often wish I could have some way to draw it or recreate it, much like the movie Close Encounters.

We grabbed our shotguns from the boat and both loaded up with SSG... equivalent to Double O Buckshot. My intentions were to rattle some buckshot off from it if it got too close!

Then, it seemed to rapidly...and I mean rapidly... evaporate going almost directly straight up into a perfectly clear, star-filled sky. The actual moon was still plainly visible in it&apos;s original location. I then realized that the hair on the back of my neck was standing straight up. I have never experienced this feeling either before or since. My friend turned to me in astonishment and said how are we going to tell anyone about this? I said forget it, if we tried to tell this to anyone they would think we were both either idiots or worse...totally crazy.

I happened to look up at the sky and saw a commercial airliner.  I kept watching it because it was so clear I could make out the colors on the jet.  Then I noticed a small shiny orblike thing flying right under the tail of the jet.  The shiny orb was very small compared to the jet.  I called my dad over to show him and to make sure I was seeing it right.  He was amazed by this also.  About 5 seconds later it moved from under the tail of the jet to side of the jet; still beside the tail.  Then it moved back under the tail; and to the other side of the tail; out of sight for a couple seconds; and then back under the tail.  The craft moved unlike any type of jet I&apos;ve ever seen.  It was very fast and precise.  I told some people about the sighting but most say it was probably a fighter jet refueling.  I really don&apos;t think this because of the size comparison to the airliner and the precision of the craft.  Then it dropped further under the tail than usual and sped off from under the jet at an incredible speed. Me and my father agree what I saw was not a refueling jet.  I followed ufology pretty much all my life; and I take it quite serious; none of this is exagerated.  I&apos;m thinking it could be linked to the &quot;foo-fighter&quot; sightings made by many pilots.  My dad has also has had many incredible sightings in the past.  I will have him report his soon.((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))", "On approx. September 12 of 1992 (a Monday, Tues. or Wednes.) I was at home alone finishing dinner when I heard my pack of dogs start up a chorus that means something&apos;s up that needs checking into. I walked out to the edge of my deck and looking east(and a sliver south) could see 3 small white lights in an equilateral triad configuration(somewhat obliquely presented) hovering a few degrees above the ridge of a hilltop but to my crude estimate maybe a mile or two beyond it. I said to myself &quot;I know what that is--they&apos;re back&quot;, instinctively recalling my sightings of August 29,1991(see NUFORC database). I watched this triad for about 8 seconds when it&apos;s three lights broke formation and seemed to swarm around each other like bees in approx same amount of sky. After maybe 6 seconds they reformed to original triad. Another 8 or so seconds they buzzed like bees again. And then again returned to rigid triad config. Seconds later one of these tiny lights shot forward toward my direction and in 2 seconds manifested itself as a glowing sphere of fluorescent white light I guaged to be 5 to 7&quot; in diameter positioned maybe 3 to 5 feet above the top of eastern hilltop ridge(about 1500&apos; from me) and immediately began descending said hill along a sandstone outcropping, all the while nicely illuminating the scrub oak and manzanita about 4 feet below it. I was so startled I turned around to fetch my rifle thinking some one was running down the hill with a light(tho&apos; there are no trails and it was way above the bush). I caught myself in two steps and quickly faced back to keep observing. The orb descended at about 8 to 10 mph following sandstone outcrop at an angle and then abruptly cut level to the right for 20 or 30 feet then followed another similiarly dipping sandstone outcrop for about 40 feet---lighting up tops of the scrub-brush for 25&apos; in all directions. Suddenly a smaller globe of white light came on about 2 or 3 feet below it, this one maybe 2 or 3&quot; in diameter with similiar intensity. They continued on in tandem for another 10 feet, made an abrupt leveling to right for 30feet or so and then began ascending the hill. After rising 5 feet the small orb seemed to swing as if on a pendulum maybe two swings and then blinked off. The large orb continued it&apos;s ascent to the top of the hill and then shot eastward back to rejoin original triad. From beginning to end of this &quot;probe&quot; action might have been 40 to 60 seconds. Once rejoined in the distance I watched for some 10 to 15 minutes the same bee-like/re-triad sequence. At this point I hauled my 4.5 &quot; Celestron refractor to a good spot to observe but two small white lights,one larger than the other, with the smaller one moving back and forth a couple degrees in 8 to 10 second cycles, towards and away from larger light, almost or maybe touching it on &quot;inward&quot; part of cycle. This action continued for 20 minutes or so followed by a breif re-showing of third light and then back to the two. I got bored and came in for coffee. Went back out and sure enough it was still there. I continued watching and the two lights now seemed to rise at same rate as nearby stars. I tracked this for another half -hour as the two rose several moon widths--went inside for a few minutes--came out and it was gone. Soon after, I went to bed, shaking my head, trying to sleep and wondering just what in hell I had seen. It then seemed to be a bit scary. Next morning told mother and sister of it and how it looked like triad craft I&apos;d seen a year before. It was then I realized I hadn&apos;t told even them of that earlier sighting---which is what really spooks me! My sister thinks I well could&apos;ve been abducted on first round--I have no recollection of such--but still to this day cannot explain not telling even family, til this second sighting. I conveniently procrastinated taking hike up to sandstone ridge to look for anomalies and such for atleast 4 years afterwards--and found nothing unusual ofcourse when I finally did. As said in other report, I would&apos;ve reported this sooner but just found this great website. Already have seen similiar accounts of probe-like orbs. Must say I&apos;m a true believer that &quot;they&quot; are here --seeing makes quick believing--and what I saw,-- I don&apos;t think humans have even back-engineered yet.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

Very fastIt was a little after 6:00 a.m. and the sun was just comeing up. as we were driving on Hwy. 54 to go to Camdenton for work at the state park we saw a triangular shape hovering over a field. but then after about 2 min. it flew away at atleast 100 MPH. It flew up and to the west.It was black in color and had a light at every point. But it wasnt very thin it was about 1 story thick.

I was about six at the time, and had never heard of the word UFO.  My father was a pilot in the Army, at one time we lived near Edwards AFB saw lots of wierd things the government was flying easily explainable. We were at my neighbors house in Glennville Georgia its located approximately 30 minutes away from Ft. Stewart.  ((witness #1)) who was also six, ((witness #2)) about eight, and his older brother about seventeen, my sister who was eleven and me.  We were jumping on ((witness #2)) trampoline and ((Witness #1)) pointed to the sky and said look at those lights over there.  There were two bright white lights in the distance. They looked like very bright street lights to me. Just ignored them and kept on jumping. I can&apos;t tell you the exact date when it happened but it was in the summer of either &apos;76 or &apos;77. ((witness #1)) had to go home to eat dinner and it was getting darker. Sometime later we decided we better head home as well. Before we set off down the road I looked over at the lights and they appeared to be getting bigger.  I dismissed them again and walked along side my sister.  My sister says she was watching them the whole time and that they were following us.  I noticed the wind started to pick up and dust was blowing everywhere which I was farmiliar with because helicopters do the same thing. My sister screamed out run they&apos;re following us.  At which point I looked up over my shoulder and saw a craft wing that looked alot like the Stealth.  But it had lights on it that had such a bright clarity to them like halogen lights but brighter and white.  It made no noise and its movements were serpentine in motion it moved very slow almost hovering and it made no sound.  I took off running and left my sister behind.  I remember running into the house hysterical saying its got my sister, its got my sister.  Soon after my sister came in crying in a panic too.  So my dad went outside to see what it was and there was nothing.  It left without making a sound.  To this day my sister never talks about it, it was so horrifying. My dad being a pilot said that planes can cut their engines off and glide.  I excepted that and when they declassified the Stealth Bomber I thought that would explain it.  I saw the Stealth and it makes a lot of noise.  Nothing I have seen flown by the military that I know of can compare to the technology of what ever that was that me and my sister saw that summer night. My sister can give you a better description because she was watching it the whole time, but she won&apos;t talk about it.((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  We will invite the witness to have her sister submit a report of her recollections, as well.  PD))", "three bright bluish-white lights. possible triangle craft?I was watching the twilight fall over the mountains southeast of my house, when I noticed three bright bluish-white lights moving very slowly and fairly low in the sky.I watched these lights for maybe two or three minutes, then they quickly picked up speed and altitute disappearing over the mountains near madera canyon.", "Large object with two bright lights, passed overhead silently. Half-circles connected by rectangle.Approximate Location: Lat: 42.50 Long: -83.76  UFO approximately  300 - 500  ft in width  minimum. Altitude 800  to  1000  feet  minimum.  Craft  is  best  described  as two semi-circles connected  together with a single  beam. The rounded edges of the semi-circles were on  the outside edge of the craft. The  craft  moved  in  a  perpendicular  direction  to  the  beam connecting the  semi-circles. The craft was  totally silent. Only two  small white  lights were present at  the semi-circle edges, which neither changed  in color, or intensity. The  under body of the  craft is  thought to  be a  light grey.  The velocity of the craft was  anywhere from 50 to  100 mph. The direction  of travel was S-SW to  N-NE. The duration of the  event was approximately 1 minute,  thirty  seconds. Nothing of an extraordinary nature occurred except the appearance of the craft.It  was about  a quarter  after eight  o&apos;clock, myself and a friend were leaving my home. It was  a clear night, and as we was walking to my car, I was gazing at the stars. Not many stars were present,  as  there  was  a  slight  haze  present  in  the upper atmosphere. A small  group of stars caught my  attention and were approx.  30 degrees  above the  horizon and  directly South of my home. Not seeing anything unusual, I proceeded to walk to my car, I put the key  in the door, then glanced back  at the small group are stars again. I then noticed  that two tiny lights were moving together and at a fixed  distance from each other. The lights appeared to move  in our direction. I immediately pointed the lights out to my  friend. The lights appeared to be a great distant apart, not something you would expect to see in the night sky.  I assumed at  first that there  must be two  objects, flying  together.  The  object  appeared  to  be  very low to the ground, not more than a couple  of hundred feet. Thinking I could get a good  look at the object with my  spotlight which I keep in the trunk of my car, I  quickly unlocked the trunk, and proceeded to retrieve my spotlight. As I proceeded to get the spotlight, my friend  continued to  watch the  lights. After a few seconds I had I plugged the spotlight into  the cigarette lighter, and pointed the light at the lights. The light was not able to illuminate any part of the object. I  panned the light between the lights, hoping I could see something.  At this point I realized  that the object had to  be at least  800 to 1000  feet high, and  that the lights were  about  300  -  500  ft  across.  I  deduced  this simply by estimating the  distance away that  the object was. It was flying at a low altitude and it was huge. The object flew directly over our heads, and passed over my home. I continued to shine the light at the object, but saw nothing. I considered the lights belonging to a single object is  because they moved toward us,  and did not vary in position with respect to one another, I therefore assumed that they were connected to a single object. The lights passed directly over us, and no sound was emitted by  the object.  I specifically   asked my  friend to  listen for anything.  We heard  absolutely nothing.  The object  traveled at what seemed to be a  constant altitude, with a constant velocity. The lights did  not change in intensity or  color. The object did not rotate  or maneuver in  any unusual respect.  It glided over, not making a sound as it passed. We attempted to chase the object in an automobile. We drove several miles north along the service drive of U.S. 23. A heavy cloud front was approaching in from the north, and we gave up hope of following the object. We stopped and stood outside of the vehicle looking up at the approaching cloud front. While standing outside of our vehicle, a craft  emerged from  a the clouds. The craft  which appeared was fully lit with running flashing running  lights, and landing lights.  The landing lights had  illuminated  the  clouds  just  before  it  emerged. Looking carefully at the  craft, we noticed about 20-30  red lights which appeared  to be  mounted to  the front  of the  craft. They  were brilliant  red,  like  heat  lamps  used  at  restaurants.  There appeared to be  no pattern to the way the  lights were mounted on the aircraft&apos;s  front, it did  seem that there  was some type  of surface  area   to  whatever  was  holding   the  lights. I have never seen anything similar before or since that was mounted to the front of the aircraft. Almost immediately after the aircraft appeared  from the cloud, the roar of jet engines was very loud. Was  stuck me as odd was the amount of noise  generated by this  aircraft, and it&apos;s  low velocity. We thought immediately that it must be a helicopter because it was moving  very  slow.  The  craft  traveled West to East,  crossed  over the expressway (U.S. 23),  and  headed  in  the  general  direction  of Detroit Michigan. I would estimate that  the craft was about one thousand feet  from the  ground, and  traveled less  that one  hundred and fifty miles per hour. After waiting  around for about a  minute for something else to happen,  we left the area and proceeded South to my home. We could  still see aircraft that emerged  from the clouds, it stayed  on course, and  was disappearing into  the horizon. We did not see that aircraft again. When we returned home and discussed what had happened, my friend stated that she saw the shape of the object as it passed overhead. The shape she drew was basically a circle cut in half and separated, then a rectangular bar connecting the halves. As stated above, I could only see the lights mounted on the edges which seemed to shine toward the center of the object, but I could not make out any shape. I believe my vision was impaired because I was holding a bright spotlight that I was using to illuminate the object. I believe my friend was being sincere about what she had seen. I can say with a high confidence that whatever this object was, it was a single object, it was traveling at a very low altitude, and there was absolutely no sound generated by this object. The following Monday, I called the FAA at Willow Run Airport and reported the incident to a  FAA investigator. He said that he would  look into  it, and  call me  back. I  did not remember his name, and I am not sure that he gave it to me. On Wednesday  of that week, I  called again to the  FAA, and talked to  a Mr. ((name deleted)) (sounds  like - ((deleted))),  he said he had heard nothing of  the report.  He asked  around the  office, and found no  one who remembered the  report. He then asked  me about the  incident, and  I told   him everything,  with of  course the exception of the actual visual sighting  of the craft (shape as described by my friend). I told him it must have been a blimp.The following Friday, I  called the  FAA back,  and asked what the about  progress of  the investigation.  Mr. ((name deleted)),  then told me that  he passed  the report  the Mr.  ((name deleted)),  and that he would contact me.About  an hour  later, Mr. ((deleted)) called.  We had  a long discussion  about  the  event.  He  told  me  he  personally  had contacted all major airports in  the area, which was an extensive list I must say, and they had  no reports of a blimp in the area. He  then  contacted  Goodyear  and  asked  them. According to Mr. ((deleted)), no blimps were operational in Michigan. He went on  to tell me what happens when  a craft appears on radar. When a  craft has a transponder, it  relays the aircraft&apos;s ID code back to the control  tower. No aircraft were operating in the  vicinity  at  anywhere  near  the  altitude  given.  Then we discussed the possibility of large aircraft without a transponder. The  control  technicians  are   responsible  for  recording  all incidents  of  these  so  called  &quot;primary  targets&quot;, none of the airports reported any primary targets  in this area. He contacted all the airports in the  surrounding area, and nothing was found. I must say that Mr. ((deleted)) went far beyond my expectations of a  FAA investigator. He  was very frank  and honest about  the entire situation, and  had gone far beyond his duties to attempt to identify this aircraft.  At the end of our conversation, he told me that this report is not closed,  and will remain open.My hope is that one day someone will be able to review historical radar data to determine whether the object that we had seen did actually show up on radar.One thing is for certain, it was not a figment of our imagination, a meteor,  or swamp gas.", "Large disk-shaped object with three lights sighted on rural highways outside Oshawa/Pickering, Ontario.My friend ((male name deleted)) and I were going East on Highway 7. ((name deleted)) was driving. The object was gliding quickly West just below the clouds when I noticed it, and I could see only its lights, but not yet its shape. After a few minutes, it went into the clouds and lit up the mist enough to see the droplets in the air, and its disk shape was at least three times the size of a commercial aircraft. It hovered for a good solid 10 minutes. It faded into a tiny point, then returned to it&apos;s original size!  It changed position from being horizontal to vertical to the ground, but mostly remained vertical. It had three lights. The bottom light was a very bright, brilliant white, and very large. It was flashing extremely fast, and somewhat erratically. It appeared to be made of overlapping light rays. It had an almost a solid dome shape, but looked like a flower, or a thousand-petalled lotus like the traditional image of the crown chakra. The middle light was a dimmer, flat, solid circle, slightly off-center to the left of the bottom light. It was closer to the bottom light than the top, and was not flashing. The top light was a dark red colour, also a flat solid circle, and was flashing slowly and steadily. The top light was lined up with the bottom one. My friend and I both experienced strong tingling sensations around our chest and crown. I got rushes throughout my body. The object began to move again. It then faded out of view for a few minutes, flashed the red light once more, and was gone. An hour or so later, when we were returning to Toronto, travelling West on Regional Road 22, the object reappeared. It was very low in the sky and drifting slowly down over Lake Ontario, in a vertical position to the ground. The intersection we were at was stuck on stop in all directions, except for one pedestrian light on the left side in front of us, that was stuck on go, for about five minutes. The radio faded out for as long as the intersection lights were stuck. Again, my friend and I felt tingling at our crown and chest, once again I got rushes, and the air generally felt alive. Things of ours that were with us got really staticky after that, and stayed that way for about two days. When the object was out of sight, seeming to have either gone over the lake into the US, or [and this is what it really seemed like] into the lake! There was no sound from the object at all. And, just my luck, the camera in my bag had just run out of film!

It was a completely clear night out no clouds in the sky what so ever. We estimated that the object was about 200-500 feet above tree top level. The object made no noise, it moved through our field of view in less than 10 seconds. It had an appearance of a stingray shape, the middle underside of the object was lit up but had a tan-brownish color, the edges of the object were distinguisable. It was a smaller size object, not apparent aircraft size (much smaller). No position lights were seen. One of the observers has worked on aircrafts for 10 years both military and civillian and what was seen was nothing that could be explained.", "Orange glowing fireball in the sky in Leesburg, FLMe and my mother witnessed this craft for a very brief period of time. It appeared to be a fireball in the sky, as we were driving North on hwy 44, going towards Eustis, I glimpsed over to the East of the Van, and witnessed this bright orange glow, it was way too big to be any typical aircraft, or an explosion. There was no sound, and I&apos;m very sure that this was not a weather balloon, or anything of the sorts.

It is possible that because of the night sky and the brightness of the object that is bigger and higher than my perception. I was struck by how perfectly round the object was.

I could see the pattern of veins in the membrane. I poked it with a stick, and it was tough and leathery. It was also pale greyish-white in color. At the time I had no ideas about it, and I sort of forgot about it. Later I read two books, one about UFO sightings in the same area...and another about secret govm&apos;t experiments with anti-gravity. It seems that this is the effect that this technology has on living tissue. The authors of the books desribed things almost identical. Within a year or two of my experience, another friend said he saw a UFO (black triangle) about 1 mile from this location, still other friends reported seeing strange animals in the woods.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

It continued across the sky and little pieces seemed to burn off and disappear.  The light disapated and continued all the way to the horizon and dissappeared beyond the tree line. It was not like other debris or meteors I have witnessed in the past because it lasted so long. It headed from west to east in the sky starting at about 11:00 position and ending finally at the 5:00 position behind the trees on the horizon.", "This happened some years ago: I had taken my dog outside, it was dark, pm.  I noticed what I thought was a star, the longer I looked, I thought this was a VERY Bright star, A star, but too close to the ground.  I do not know how long I was outside looking at the light.I went into the house, where my two teenage daughter&apos;s and a boy friend was, and told them to come look at what I had been watching.Again, I don&apos;t know how long we were outside.All of a sudden the LIGHT started toward us, (going east) it took some time,  and then I thought it was a helicopter.There was no sound, it was triangular in shape, and 2 or 3 different colored lights besides the white light in the center and dark in color.  It went over a neighbors house.My daughters teenagers approximately 14 and 16 and the boyfriend 16, and myself saw this. I have on my left thigh, a hole, sorta pitted.

Since then i have figured out that it was 9:15 because i dialed 411 at 9:21 to get a friends phone # to tel them to look up at the these lights  Also since then we have figured out that the lights wer emaybe the size of 1 or 2 737&apos;s as the other night we saw a plane fly over our house and the size of the plane allowed us to roughly determine the size of what we saw..as what we saw was maybe 300-500 feet away from our house (we live in the country in total darkness with no city lights or anything) and the tops of the trees and part of the gorund covered in snow was lit up orange...On the tuesday after our house (wife, fatherinlaw, motherinlaw and I) saw this a friend phoned me and mentioned her husbands two contractor buddies and a couple children at a group home about two streets over or maybe 8 acres away saw the exact same thing.  I was told by my friend that they were so scared they hid under their house until it moved away as they thought it was going to crash into thier house (that is how close it was) ..when it slowly moved away (which was towards my house ) they came back out and watched it slowly move away and stop and then shoot straight to space.  i have phoned them a couple times but i am afraid they are still to scared to talk about what happened...these two objects were so close to our house and i guess their it was unbelievable...it was truly unbelievable and has changed my life forever...on the wednesday after our sighting...in iqaluit (nunavut) CBC reported a story of two bright orange lights over that city following each other and sounded like a mirror image of what we saw that night....Also since talking to the UFO BC web site people...i have read recently that there was 2 other sightsing out here in teh past 7 years....similar story...All i can say is i wish i could talk to somebody to understand what we saw...Again there was no sound...and also since talking it over many times we both agreed we saw a red lights in the middle as it got closer and top and bottom was the orange...the strangest part i will never forget was wathcing it go away...it didnt go north, south east or west...it went UP...i had goosebumps the size of elephants on every inch of my skin...

Came back into living room where I told him that tonight would be a good night to see the green northern lights.  Took a peek outside to see if it was actually clear and two quite large VERY ORANGE lights were slowing coming towards the house very slowly.  They seemed side by side and we noticed no other flashing lights or anything.  We heard absolutely no sound from the outside as we looked towards the weird lights.  They continued to approach the house ( we live in Mary Lake Country Residential Subdivision, 15 minutes outside of Whitehorse Yukon).  They went ot he side of our house and we watched them for maybe 5 minutes as they just seem to hang around outside slowly moving away.  The lights then came really close to each other, then one went up , the other went down, and vice versa.  Then the right light slowly appeared to move farther away with the other light following the first light.  The lights didn&rsquo;t go further away but rather straight up.  Then one just disappeared completely.  Then the last one just sat there way up in the sky and appeared to have some additional colors flashing    I ran back downstairs as I went upstairs to watch them move away.   I got back, the other one had disappeared.   My heart is still beating fast.  I have never seen something so silent, so bright, so close just float by my house.   Weather :-30  Wind, nil; clouds, none    Never had such a weird feeling, and as I write this I remember the TV flickered a bit just before I saw these northern lights, but they were not the lights I originally looked outside to see?

These lights were approximately 2/3 of the way down from the Shafer Butte/Bogus Basin area and away to the northwest from that area so I know that it wasn&apos;t the lights from Bogus Basin or any vehicles on the road to/from Bogus Basin nor are there any buildings or structures of any kind in that area of the foothills.  The lights formed what appeared to be the windows or lights attached to a saucer shaped/disc type of object.  The object appeared to be of great size (approximately 100-200 meters across) since our vantage point was about 10 miles away and the object still appeared large to us. These bright golden lights would go on and off.

I was 5 years old and we were moving bit by bit into our new house. I was &quot;helping&quot; my mom take things out to the car. She was going to take me with her to the new house that evening and I was excited about getting to play in all the new rooms. I remember going out the back door with something in my hand that I was going to take to the car. Mom was still inside the house. There was a very, very bright light. I looked up and there, hovering above the house, was this huge object that just seemed to be made up of very white, bright lights. I have no idea what shape it was and could not see anything but the lights. It was silent except for a strange electrical sound -- zed-zid, zed-zid -- and started to slowly move away from the house. I remember screaming and running inside, terrified and crying. I don&apos;t know how articulate I was in trying to get my mother to look outside and see if it was gone. She didn&apos;t see anything and couldn&apos;t understand why I was so upset. I refused to go outside again that night and lost all interest in going to the new house to play.((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.

It witnessed it standing still two times, and at both occations it flashed a very pure white light that blinded me for a short time. First it moved at about the speed of an airplane but when i came back with a camera it was moving very fast. It left a trail similar to an airplane. It reminded me of a short film about comets. Why I&apos;m sure it was not a comet is because comets do not stop and flash. I wish to keep the picture i took to myself.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

I was making a crude star chart to research and i.d. some of the constellations I could see. It was a beautiful, clear night with a few small clouds and a nice crescent moon. I was fairly intent on the sky trying to make sure I got the major stars in their proper position. The time is approximately 8:30 PM. As I&rsquo;m looking up I see off to my right 2 glowing orbs moving directly together at what had to be a high rate of speed. They were moving in a very straight line in a generally south west direction side by side, closely together. Their path from horizon to horizon took maybe 4 to 5 seconds and then they, for a lack of better words, disappeared. The objects appeared to be glowing and were orange in color. If I had to guess at their size from my viewpoint, I&rsquo;d say about the size of dimes, maybe more oval than perfectly round. I have an amateurs interest in astronomy and have done lots of star gazing over the years. I&rsquo;ve seen meteor showers, comets, missile launches, etc. This was like none of those. After they passed, I was a little shaken, not quite sure what I had just seen. I walked back in and called a friend. I had to share this with someone! After I got off the phone I walked back out and was staring to the skies, a little stunned. After about 5 minutes (approx. 8:45) to my amazement I see another group of those glowing lights, this one containing a fairly tight cluster of maybe 5. These were higher and looked a lot smaller. These were moving  in a more westerly direction and their passage lasted maybe 3 seconds. These appeared to be flying higher or further away, so I couldn&rsquo;t comment on shape, but they definitely had that same orange glow. I go back in call my friend again. I come back out and continue to stare at the skies in amazement. I guess about 10-15 minutes later, (around 9:00) I see one more cluster, maybe 6 or 7 of this time, moving at about the same position and direction as the second cluster. I continued to scan the sky for maybe 20 minutes more, but didn&rsquo;t see anything else after that. I went in and made some notes and drew a picture of what I saw on the &ldquo;star chart&rdquo; I was making. I&rsquo;ve been checking the news and the internet, hoping to find something that would explain this sighting, but haven&rsquo;t seen anything other than similar sightings from different times in the past. I called the local police station to see if possibly there were other reports or info. they might have. They directed me to call NASA, which I haven&rsquo;t done but may. I was really hoping there would be a logical explanation for this incident, but haven&rsquo;t found it yet. Any help, comments or collaboration anyone could offer would be greatly appreciated.

It was December 03 2002, a cold clear night. A movement in the sky caused me to look up and at first glance, I thought it was a flock of birds. I realized very quickly, that it was not.  It was some sort of craft, shaped like a triangle or a boomerang.  I dont know how high the craft was but it was very large.  It was dark at the time, but I could clearly see the outline of the craft.  On the underside, as it passed over, I could see fluorescent type lights, equally spaced, under the craft. There must have been at least ten of these lights.  The strange thing about this sighting was that there was not a sound as it passed overhead,It just sort of glided over my house moving toward the southwest. I was amazed at the sighting.

I was operating a Jeep with a canvas top with the top in place. I had driven half a mile to a gas station where there was a Soft drink machine. I bought a bottle of Coca Cola, and drove to the center of town and into a parking lot with buildings on three sides intending to sit for a few minutes and enjoy my drink. I was backed in near the the rear of the lot facing the street. There was only a car now and then that was passing by, and the area was deserted and very quiet due to the hour. As I sat drinking my soda, I became aware in my peripheral vision of some kind of movement to my right. In this direction was a long narrow driveway that rose up from a street below that ran along the banks of the Wepawaug River. I was shocked and alarmed to see coming up the hill on the ground a deep black &quot;patch&quot;, about 15 feet wide and 30 feet long. It had the shape of a large gasoline storage tank of the type buried at gasoline stations, but just the &quot;footprint&quot; as it had no height at all. What really scared me was that my first assumption that it was a shadow of something passing overhead was not confirmed by my frantic look out the window and up, and by the fact that it seemed to be completely opague, that is I could not see the ground under it, and it looked for all the world like it could have been a huge piece of black velvet, and it had that kind of a visual texture. It was moving toward me very slowly, perhaps less than two miles per hour. I had enough time to really panic and then when I decided to jump out and run, it was too late because it was over me. I spun around wildly in my seat looking in every direction expecting something to come in after me, but nothing did. Then I saw that it had passed over me and was again on the ground moving very slowly away from me in the same direction, toward the two story building to my left about 100 feet away. I again looked out expecting to see something overhead, but there was nothing. It continued moving toward the building, flowed up off the grounf and up the side of the building at the same deliberate slow pace and dissaperaed across the roof and was gone. There were stars out, no lights in the parking lot, and nothing I am aware of drove by during the minue or so that it took for all of this to happen. I was too afraid to move for about five munutes, during which time I kept looking around to be sure nothing else was going to happen. I then got up the courage to drive out of the lot at high speed. I was afraid to go back there again for weeks. I never reported this for obvious reasons (except to family and friends of course), not needing the ridicule that was sure to follow. I was about 22 years old at the time, very wide awake and alert, and not at all tired. I remember it vividly as I was so terrified by it. A relative (sane and rational to the best of my knowledge, as I believe I am) told me he had seen something like it some time earlier near a swamp in Milford, and we concluded that there might be some connection to water, as what I had seen did come up the hill from an area close to a small river. One thing that stands out in my mind is that I remember questioning my own sanity  halfway through, when the thing was over me and I could not see any sign of it, hoping that was the end of it, but then the shock of seeing it reappear as it continued away from me, and the fact that it took enough time that I had a good opportunity to reconfirm what it looked like the last time I saw it, and the fact that even as it climbed the wall of the building, you could not see the building behind it, and it did not in any way seem to be a shadow, but a solid &quot;thing&quot; of some sort. I still make no conclusion about what it was, but I do know I have no desire to see anything like it again, at least not when I find myself in such a vulnerable position.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

Than withen mabey 10 to 15 secounds another cluster of lights appared again directley West that began as just one light turning into what looked like mabey 4 or more in a somewhat jagged line, that again dimmed out one by one.(BTW the sky was clear on this night) My wife ran in the house to get her parents as we couldent beleve or figure out what we were seeing. Just as my wife,son &amp; her mother had came back outside one more single light was seen to the high SW part of the sky.There was also quite a few normal aircraft flying in random back &amp; forth patterns aroung the area of sightings. At first I thought what we were seeing was some kind of lighting from the aircraft, but the type of lighting we saw &amp; the way it faded out was unlike anything my wife or I have seen before. I would decribe it as a small ball of fire, slowly lighting than slowly burning out.It has been driving me nuts ever since we had seen it, as until finding this web site I havent heard of anyone else anywhere in or around Kokomo that has seen it. But from what a person in Peru IN decribes it would be the same lights we had seen &amp; was also the same night.", "dark to light brown &quot;rounded boomerrang&quot; or crescent moon shaped object moves silently overhead.I was at the local track just before midnight with my dogs. just us, and was looking up at the stars when the movement of an object almost directly overhead caught my eye.The best way to describe this object was sort of like a boomerang or crescent moon shape, uneven on 1 side, dark to light brown in color. A few words came directly to mind, &quot;Bird&quot;, as in hawk or eagle, or pterodactyl.&quot;Wing&quot; &quot;Boomerang&quot; &quot;Kite&quot; &quot;Stealth&quot;, and &quot;aircraft&quot;.And an adjective that came to mind was &quot;gliding&quot;. I said softly, outloud &quot;What the heck is that&quot;.I put my hands up around my eyes to block out the lights along the horizon and at ground level.It moved straight and swiftly towards the north at a constant speed.When I thought &quot;bird&quot;, the thought came that there was no flapping and I&apos;ve seen birds soar or glide and this was much more direct and constant more like an aircraft. When I thought &quot;stealth&quot; or &quot;aircraft&quot;, I subconsciously made a note that it had no lights and there was no sound, and noted the uneven 1 side.I even had a subconscious thought that it looked sort of prehistoric, yet was modern, as if it were a remote control aircraft built to look &quot;prehistoric&quot;. I was uncertain what I was seeing but certain I was seeing it.The lights around the high school are particularly bright, with numerous streets with street lights and houses just to the north as well. The sky directly overhead however was particularly clear and black, and the stars more visible than common.Although I saw it somewhat well, it was much more the movement that made me see it to start with, and follow it, otherwise it sort of blended in with the night sky. It seemed to be moving at a constant height or altitude and faded into the sky within about 15 seconds as towards the north over town the sky wasn&apos;t as dark. I clapped my hands at 1 point to see if it perhaps it were a bird and if I could get any reaction from it. I could not really estimate how high overhead except to say when I thought of it as a bird, it seemed to be maybe 100 to 200 feet overhead. When I thought of it as an aircraft it seemed to be like a low flying plane, maybe 1,000 feet or so overhead.But again it seemed way to big to be a bird, perhaps the reason the thought &quot;pterodactyl&quot; or prehistoric came to mind. I made note of the constellations overhead, it seemed to have moved between or through the constellations Leo and the big Dipper, right to left as I faced East.It was cold out.I estimated the time to be around 11:43 p.m.I looked up for a few minutes afterwards without stopping but saw nothing more.I then was looking up for much of the remainder of our time at the track. I will make a few drawings of the object. Misc.An example of the way it blended into the sky, in the movie &quot;Close Encounters&quot;, when richard dryfuss&apos;s character is in the power company truck at the railroad crossing, as he sees the lights,and then it becomes silent, and he looks up directly overhead out his front windshield and you see the object moving in the sky, it reminded me of that somewhat, although this was moving faster and more steadily. Another thought came to mind, the government tested the stealth aircraft in this region back in the &apos;80s, and for a few years people in this region, particularly a county maybe 30 miles away, were reporting sightings of a ufo in the shape of a bat.It was later learned this was the stealth aircraft. There is a rural county airport, Mercer County airport&quot;, directly to the north in the direction this object was moving, maybe 6 or 7 miles as the crow flies from this location.This is not a south to north flight path for low flying aircraft for this airport. Aircraft approach the airport from the east. I have never seen anything like such,, or something that I haven&apos;t been able to explain before.", "3 Triangular objects, bright white lights with 2 round red &quot;tail lights&quot;, slow speed, low altitude3 bright white lights forming the shape of an obtuse triangle, with approximately .25 mile between each object. The top object and the one on the right slowly began heading south.the object on the right passed us first- we were on the balcony and it was south west of us, maybe 3 city blocks laterally away and .5 mile high, traveling at approximately 30mph.  At first we heard a faint noise-almost like a prop. plane- then that went away as the object neared us.  There were white lights that would at times combine with a blue and a red.  the object was white(or silver?), triangular in shape, but the bottom of the craft bowed down like the hull of a boat.  the back of the craft had two round red lights (like tail lights on a corvette!)  the size was approximately 18 ft. long and 14ft. wide.  The two crafts passed over identiticly ( about 3 minutes apart from each other) kept the same speed and then when almost out of sight, gained altitude and continued going south-east. The 3rd craft (which would have made the left corner of the triangle)  then proceeded forward and went over EXACTLY as the others did", "I watched a light behind my house for hours &apos;till the sunrise came, then it followed the dark &apos;till it was out of sight.This happened quite awhile ago, I&apos;m not too sure of the exact date because I never paid too much attention to it considering I never thought i was going to need to know it. Nobody would believe me anyways. I was up late one night and I was tired and out of my mind. Since I was so tired and zombified, it made the whole experience that much more harder to remember every little detail for the time line. I just so happened to look out of my back yard one nite and seen a light far in the distance. It didn&apos;t look like a UFO at all from the distance where I was from the object. The only thing that made me pay attention to the light was that the light was higher than any other light. The light was also a different color than any of the others, it was white with a bit of blueish flicker. From where it was lingering, it was an impossible place for it to be considering I know the of all the lights in the back of my field. The UFO was much too high for it to be a street light, and it was over a golf course... not over the construction area where a few high buildings were being built at the university. Over to the right of the UFO were 2 towers used to lift building material to construct 2 buildings at the university. Those 2 towers had lights on top of each of them, but the lights were different from the UFO that was to the left of my view facing the field. At first that&apos;s what I thought the light was, a tower light. After thinking of how the light was much too far to the left and away from the building sight, I knew it was not part of the construction grounds. It was too far away and closer to me. After realizing that the UFO wasn&apos;t what I thought it was, I grew more skepticle about it being a street light.  After I ruled out everything, it took about 30 seconds to see the light wabble back and fourth. That scared the shit out of me, and my heart started pumping because I never thought I&apos;d see something so unrealistic and unexplainable. It was very windy night out, and I figured that it was a light post shifting left and right. My heart beat calmed and I felt a relief that I wasn&apos;t going nuts, but I also felt very disappointed because in my heart I wanted to see a &quot;UFO.&quot; I stopped looking at it and made myself believe that it was just a new light post, then I walked out of my room and into the t.v. room. Before I left the bedroom to go to the t.v. room, I decided to mark the light with the trees directly underneath of the UFO. The trees were in the golf coarse, and there was so many trees that it seemed like the golf coarse was just ALL trees. The trees were very distinguishable and I took a mental picture of the trees underneath of the light. When I was watching t.v. I got ansy to see if it had moved or not, so I came back to the bedroom about 5 minutes after I first sat down. I was shocked to see that the light had moved durastically from the spot that I had marked it from. I felt my body get very shaky and weak. I was so scared so fast that I was able to feel it in my arms and legs. My heart started to pound again and so many thoughts flew through my mind in a matter of seconds. I remember sitting at my back window paralyzed and scared to move. After about a couple of minutes of watching it, it was wabbling constantly and slowly shifting to the left and right. All I remember doing next was taking off the screen from my window so I can stick my head out of the window to get a better look. After watching it and paying more attention to detail, I could kind of make out windows on the object, and it changed color, too. The color looked like it changed from white to blue to red all in that same second, but multiple times. It reminded me of looking at stars, but close to me. I was very tired and my eyes felt blurry, but I know what I saw. I remember thinking to myself that this can&apos;t be happening, this is too messed up. I must have sat there for 3 and a half to 4 hours watching it move. Just over the middle of watching it, I had then seen a flash of light come out of it shooting down towards the ground for maybe half of a second. I was so scared i ran out of my room and across the hallway and into my moms room to wake her up so she can watch it with me. My mom was very sleepy and was supposed to work at 6 am that morning so she wasn&apos;t in the most enthusiastic mood. I told her about the light and the beam of light that came out of it. I explained I had been watching it for hours and it moves. My mom sat and watched it with me for about a minute. Her eyes were very squinty and she looked like she was gonna pass out, and after that minute she told me that it wasnt moving and I should get to bed. I was so pissed off and told her to keep watching. She was very stubborn and forced me out of the room with her bitchyness. I left, but didn&apos;t stop watching the light. Maybe about an hour after I woke my mom up, the sunrise was very near, maybe 15 minutes away. I went to the other side of my house and I was able to see the other side of the sky getting brighter. I got exremely excited and couldn&apos;t wait to see what the hell the light was, whether it be a stupid light post that was keeping me up all night, or a UFO. It was a UFO, the light was getting brighter, and as the sun came up, the UFO kept in the darkness, and very, very slowly flew away from me. after about 30 seconds of watching fly away, I busted into my moms room and made her get up and watch it fly away. It didn&apos;t seem like it phased her at all, she showed very little interest. I remember saying &quot;Look! The light is moving now! It&apos;s flying away!&quot; My mom said it looked like a plane and once again kicked me out of the room. The light was gone and I didn&apos;t know what to do next. I felt like I had seen an angel or something, my mind was so alert and I wasn&apos;t able to sleep. The next day my mom mentioned how I saw a light and woke her up to watch it fly away to her boyfriend. She talked about it like she believed she also saw a UFO. It was only after she realized what she had seen when she was coherant that she was actually interested. Thats&apos; what i remember of that nite, but I&apos;m sure if I sit and think about it, a few more details might come up. The funny thing is that that experience wasn&apos;t my only experience with another witness, I have 2 others. My mom is just the most credible with her being and officer and all.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))", "Green Cone UFOAt 12:14 am I looked into the sky. It was a clear night and I noticed a tiny bright light slowly coming my way.  It took about 40 seconds to actual come right above me.  It was very bright, green colored and coned shaped.  It stood above me for about 2 seconds than took off back up into the sky.  It started doing zig zags around the night sky than vanished.

I realized it was a UFO when I noticed its shape, size and the way it moved itself. The shape was like a silver, gigantic coin floating horizontally, bigger than a bird, and it was flying about 100 ft above the ground. The thing that really cought my attention was, its movement. It was as if a string was pierced through the middle of it and the &quot;coin&quot; was balancing itself while forwarding on a perfectly straight line, above the golf course. I thought I was going nuts, but the wierdest thing was, a year later, I saw the same object doing the same thing, as if being its routine or something. The only thing that kept me from thinking that I&apos;m seeing things again, was my mother being an eyewitness too.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

PD))", "It was triangular in shape, massive in size and eerily quiet.I was a State Trooper working the night shift and was patrolling US83 south of Canadian, TX.   It was around 10:30PM local time.  I always had a citizens band radio on and had been listening to two truck drivers enjoying a conversation.  It was an unusually warm evening for a winter night and I was wearing short sleeves and had the car window cracked a bit as I slowly patrolled northbound.  As this is the Texas panhandle area, the land is fairly flat, but with some rolling hills every so often.  I could see the two trucks ahead of me and all three of us were driving north.  The two trucks were approximately 1 - 1.5 miles ahead of me.  As we neared the Washita Creek bridge on US83, the road dipped down into a little valley.  I lost sight of the trucks as they dipped lower than me.  One of the drivers was talking away when he suddenly stopped and said &quot;What the hell is that&quot;?   I heard the second driver say &quot;What are you...oh hell!&quot;.  The radio was silent for a few seconds and then I heard the second trucker say &quot;I nearly ran into you when you stopped.  Are you pulling over?&quot;  To which the other trucker said &quot;Hell yes...I want to see it&quot;.  By this time I was starting down the incline toward the creek and I could see one truck stopped and on the side of the road and the other pulling past it to park in front of it.  I still didn&apos;t know what they were talking about but started slowing down.  I crossed the bridge and at that point I saw the driver of the truck just in front of me standing in the middle of US83.  He was looking west and upward.  This was the first time that I realized a very bright light was shining onto the ground from what appeared to be a very large dark object which seemed to be about 1,000 feet in the air and maybe a mile and a half away.  I remember thinking this because I&apos;d been down the dirt road that runs from this location west and was fairly familiar with the topography here...and I could make out it was over another hill.  I was afraid I&apos;d be run over from behind so I started to park my patrol car on the shoulder beside the first truck. I could see the second driver running to the first one and pointing at the object.  At this point, a small passenger car topped the hill just north of us and started slowing down...probably from seeing the two trucks and my car parked there.  But as the car passed by I saw the brake lights come on and the car slightly screeched to a stop right in the middle of the south-bound lane.  There was a female driver and she stepped out of her car, right foot still inside but standing outside the car, and was looking at the object.  I asked her to quickly move out of the road.  She turned to me and said &quot;What is that?&quot;  I told her I didn&apos;t know, but to please move.  She did so quickly and then came back to us.  Now there were the two truckers, the lady and myself standing on the shoulder of the southbound lane.  I couldn&apos;t hear a sound from the craft but could see a immensely bright beam of light shining straight down.  The light didn&apos;t sway back and forth like a search light or anything...it just shone straight down.  Suddenly I was aware of the fact that the object appeared to be moving toward us very slowly.  This was because I realized the sheer dimensions of the craft.  It was a moonless night..or as best as I can remember it was moonless.  Thousands of stars in a totally black sky made it very easy to see that the object was indeed moving toward us.  It was triangular in shape.  That was obvious almost from the start.  The point was forward as if you&apos;d imagine a triangle being mobile and one of the points being the front of the object.  (I hope that makes sense)  There was absolutely no sound coming from the craft. Not even a whisper.  I realized no one was talking...I think we were completely confounded by what we were seeing.  After around five minutes, the object had gotten to a point that I felt it was within a mile of us.  I still had the strong sensation that it was higher above us than it appeared.  That&apos;s when the bright light simply shut off and it was easier to see the outline of the craft. The mere size of the craft was incredible.  If my references are even near what I think they are, I&apos;d estimate the size of the craft to be at least 1000&apos; per side.  It was massive.  The reason I use this word is two fold.  One is from the dimensions of it.  But the other is this.  As the craft neared being almost directly over us, I remember feeling weight....felt something heavy on me.  It also seemed as if there was a haze around the object...just barely off of the surface that seemed to make the stars near the edge flicker before they were occulted by the object itself.  I also remember realizing I was holding my breath.  And although we couldn&apos;t hear anything, one of the truckers said,  &quot;Do y&apos;all feel that?&quot;  It felt as though everything, the road, the air, us...everything seemed to be vibrating.  Up to this point, I don&apos;t think what I felt was fear....just amazement.  But when the craft was directly over us, something happened.  I was staring straight up at it, and I remember at this point that the women started sobbing and ran away to her car.  She left before I ever said another word to her.  The object was black. Much blacker than the sky.  This may have been an illusion from all the stars in the background, but it was darker to me.  But as I looked up, I suddenly saw a circle appear...just forward of what would be the center of the object.  This circle didn&apos;t light up. It became darker...as if there was absolutely no light shining from it or reflected from it.  Without a doubt it was darker than the rest of the craft.  The craft literally stopped directly above us.  One of the drivers asked me if I should call for help.  I told him I didn&apos;t know what I&apos;d say.  The thought did cross my mind, but I was thinking they&apos;d be thinking I was crazy back at the Sheriff&apos;s Office.  The craft then started pivoting above us...with the point moving clockwise in relation to me until it was pointed in a generally north-west direction. Then it began moving again.  I remember hearing one of the truckers talking, but my ears felt as if they were going to pop.  Again, there wasn&apos;t a sound from it...but a tremendous feeling of weight or pressure...sort of like when you dive deeply into the water.  That kind of feeling.  As the craft moved off slowly, one of the drivers said something about driving to the top of the next hill to see it more clearly.  He started to turn away and at that moment the craft sped up noticeably, then shot off to the northwest in a matter of 3-4 seconds.  The drivers asked me what we should do and I told them I didn&apos;t know.  I don&apos;t know what we saw, what we experienced.  One of the drivers, the one that said he wanted to see it from the hilltop, ran to his truck and drove north.  I ran to my patrol car and got in, passed him on the way north and pulled over at the top of the rise.  We all got out again but couldn&apos;t see anything.  I remember my ears were ringing like mad.  Looking back, I think this was side effects of an adrenaline rush.  I&apos;ve been in shootings, high-speed pursuits and numerous other tension-filled moments and I always have that reaction.  After some time, we all got in our vehicles and left.  I went straight home.  I undressed and took a shower.  I still could see the object in my mind...and am absolutely convinced about the darker circle inside the craft.  I then sat down at my desk in the study and sketched out the craft on a piece of paper.  I then went into my bedroom where my wife was asleep.  As I lay down, she rolled over to kiss me goodnight but stopped and asked &quot;Have you been fighting a grass fire or something?&quot;  I said no and asked why.  She told me I smelled like burned grass or hair.  I told her what I&apos;d seen just an hour earlier.  She knew I was sincere.  The next morning, I got out of bed and walked into the bathroom. As I looked in the mirror, I saw that my face looked like I had a very light sunburn.  Not deep red...just a little blushed.  I looked down and most of the hair on both arms looked as if I&apos;d been synged with a flame.  I called my wife and she came in and gasped at how I looked.  We looked in the bed and there was a mass of burned hair on my pillow and the sheets.  I say burned...I mean it was very brittle and it and I still smelled like I&apos;d been fighting a fire.That was 12 years ago.  I still see it in my mind and I sometimes dream about it.  I&apos;ve never told anyone other than my dearest and most trusted friends.  I have no doubt that what I saw was real.  I have no doubt that it was huge, it was manned, and it was being intelligently operated.  I&apos;m not assuming anything...that it was an alien craft, a military craft or whatever.  But what I saw moved with great stealth when I first saw it and was able to reach an unbelievably high speed in the blink of an eye.  So...as you&apos;re reading this, you may think I&apos;m nuts.  But this is the single-most bizarre thing I&apos;ve ever experienced, and I&apos;m absolutely convinced it was real.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

PD))", "Bright light with smaller lights over mountains near Deckers observed for over an hour.My five friends, three of there small children and myself went to my friends cabin about 4 miles south of Deckers in the mountains.  At around 11 pm the adults were sitting outside the cabin enjoying a beutiful summer night, the sky was clear (on which we were making comments about how crystal and big the stars were) when we noticed a bright light literally on top of a small mountain direclty across from our mountain, about a 1/4 of a mile away, we were basically at the same height and the light was in direct line of sight.  We started speculating as to what it was, our best guess was a flood light on a cabin? only there were no cabins on that mountain.  After 10 minutes or so of discussing it, we lost interest and went on to other subjects when suddenly the light went out.  About fifteen minutes later, the light reappeared only this time it was about 100 feet above the same location, and more intense.  It was about the size of a quarter when my arm was outreached, it was a yellowish/orange color and had no sound.  We were all speculating as to what it could be but nothing conventional fit, we watched it for 10-15 minutes when I noticed it was very slowly rising (there was a big pine tree right underneath it and based on the trees upmost tip is how I first noticed that it rising).  After it was about an additional 100 feet in the air (about 1/2 an hour after it first appeared in the sky) three small, very intenensly bright white lights, they reminded me of a diamonds sparkle, appeared around the first light.  After a few minutes all three of the smaller lights darted, in a zig-zag manner to the south at a very high speed, we lost sight of them behind a mountain.  At this point the first, large light started slowly dimming out until it wasnt visible, then it would slowly dim on to its original brightness, the cycle would take about 5 minutes from bright to dim to bright agian.  At the same it was acsending a little faster than earlier but still very slowly. We watched it ascend until it was out of sight, about an hour after the little lights had darted off.  This wasnt a specutlar sighting from what I&apos;ve read since, but it really raised my curiosity on this issue.  One peculiar fact I&apos;ll like to point out, before the incident, I had noticed airplanes on a north-western path above us, one about every 20 minutes or so (the red blinking lights stood out in that crystal clear sky), during the sighting, no planes flew over.", "While crossing the driveway of my front yard, I happened to look straight up.  There was no particular reason that I have ever been able to recall for doing this, since no sound or  motion &quot;got my attention&quot;. Directly overhead, I suppose 1200 feet or so, was a circular object.  It measured about the size of a quarter at arms length and had the same reflected appearance  as the moon during daylight hours.  It  was not the moon as the reflectivity was even across the surface. The sky had light puffs of motionless clouds several hundred yards apart, each about the size of a fist. The object disappeared over or into one of the clouds; I wondered if it was a weather balloon.  And I suppose it could have been, except that it came back out from the cloud to its previous position.  This motion was repeated twice again, then it failed to reappear.  I had the distinct impression that it was trying to hide. Since the clouds were small, I watched for perhaps better than ten minutes, waiting for the object to reappear on the other side.  It never showed.  The objects behavior has stayed in my memory for over  40 years.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

We saw an object that appeared black and round moving very slowly away from the airport. The sun had not set yet, so it was very easy to discern the shape at that point. It was traveling east, so it was coming towards us. Within 200 feet, the object spun, and took on a cigar shape. We ran outside to take a closer look, and by the time we got there, it had disappeared. That only took approximately 5-7 seconds. There were no clouds at the time close by. I have never seen anything like that in my life. I called the airport to report it, and was referred to the national guard station inside the airport.

We actually were watching the Peter Jennings ABC speacial UFO&apos;s Seeing is believeing. We had waited all week for the show.

We were having a beer and discussing UFO&apos;s, which I had brought up because of my interest in the issue. The gentleman said that they see stuff (UFO&apos;s) all the time out in this rural area of Nenana. I asked him what all has he seen and stated that I have always been interested in viewing a siting but had not been really fortunate enough to view anything distinct. He stated that all we had to do was watch the sky outside his home and we would likely see something. We stepped outside to prove this and as I was waiting I asked him what he had seen. He said just look up and watch the stars very closely. I said are you sure it&apos;s not a satelite because they look like stars and move steadily across the sky.  He said just watch when you find one.  So I watched, and I almost instantly saw a star moving slowly across the sky. I said &quot;Well thats a satelite.&quot; He said just watch. As I was watching this star, which looked like any other star but moving like a satalite, it stopped and changed direction. It was stopped for about 5 seconds and started back in the other direction it had come, I was startled, because I thought that satelites were in orbit and they cannot move in the opposite direction back to where they had come and planes cannot just stop and change direction. The object had moved about an inch in my view then returned and stopped. I then viewed, as it was returning, another about an inch from the first star or UFO doing the same thing. I noticed it moved about the same distance and then returned to where I first viewed it. As I was watching in absolute awe I started to notice others moving and right after I started spoting all of them I saw one of them shoot like a shooting star with a short trail unlike other shooting stars I had seen before which had long trails mostly. Nevertheless it was very much like a shooting star. It could have been one but the other things continued to move about in different direction stopping and changing directions. The getleman who showed me this stated that you view this pretty much every night anytime. I have not visited since but I would be curious if someone could bring out a telescope and view these things up close. This is near a base called Clear Airforce base.

They looked like 3 full moons, in a row. The first one was large, middle one, was smaller, and the 3rd one, was the smallest--like the &quot;3 Bears&quot;. They were moving along at a steady pace, over the Lake--white in color, very solid--very self contained. no light radiating outside their perimeters. There was no sound. I wanted to call my husband, but knew that by the time I went downstairs, and awakened him, they would have disappeared around the curve of the Lake-which is the course they were headed.                         I am very much skeptical of UFO sightings--so I thought maybe they were weather balloons, or, ect. I never heard of anyone else that saw them, so I still don&apos;t know what they were. I have heard of other sightings in the Lk Arrowhead, Big Bear area. My husband is more of a UFO buff than I, having had a sighting when he was an Airforce Pilot. He was a little disappointed that he hadn&apos;t been awake to see what I tried to describe.((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

We left in the early evening and by the time we reached the R.I. border it was dark. I happened to see a moving red sphere in the sky and mentioned it to my wife, the sphere seemed quite high and was about the size of one&apos;s small fingernail. We watched it on and off until it was out of sight. We talked about it a bit until we reached our destination. On our way home later that evening, there it was again, we were on a dark stretch of road with trees on both sides and I told my wife I had to stop and see if I could get a better look. I got out of the car and was searching for the sphere, all of a sudden an enormous object appeared directly over my head, it made no sound and seemed to be not too high over the trees.My guess is that the craft was about 100 feet or so in diameter, it cast a bright red glow which covered the entire area we were in, as I looked up under this thing I could see three spoke-like features, they looked like they might be a silver tone with a red glow reflecting off them, the rest of the underside was very dark with a reddish look. I later thought that the under side of this thing reminded me of an Automobile steering wheel with the spokes angled either upward or downward, witch way I couldn&apos;t determine; but it was fascinating. My wife began to yell at me to get in the car, that broke my fascination and I jumped in the car which was still running and sped away, as I looked in the rear view I could see the red glow and all of a sudden the thing just flicked away. Except for a few friends, I never reported what we saw. At the time people who reported such things were considered loony, so why bother, nobody would believe us anyway. I am always looking to see if anyone else has ever seen an object like that one, but haven&apos;t heard of anyone yet. Has anyone ever reported such an object to you people?

I first noticed what appeared to be an airplane with lots of lights flying in completely the wrong direction.  It was going from east to west, which even my husband thought was strange.  We both watched it from our front porch for about five minutes, until it dissappeared.  This was enough time for me to see the shape, a wide cylinder, along with the color in the lights-we noticed white, red, yellow and blue-which spanned the width of the object.  It appearred to fly erratically, in a &apos;zig-zag&apos; pattern, as my husband stated.  When it was almost gone we heard a loud noise, similar to a plane, but much bigger, and too high and too late to be a plane.

After reading the other testimony, my stomach has been shaking and I am estatic to realize that no one had slipped me LSD or anything that made both me and my other friend question WHAT THE HELL THE GREEN ELLIPSE WAS????!!!!! Our personal explination at the time (Still coherent, but a bit intoxicated from Jack Daniels and Coca- Cola and cigarettes, period. PERIOD.) was that if there were aliens that were studying humans, a change in poulation density from the area of Manchester, which is a farm/field for 51.5 weeks out of the year, would interest a reasearcher. Seriously, 100,000 people assemble for 3 days? I&apos;d like to study that kind of population spike- something was happening...Also, being a HUMUNGOUS skeptic about the situation- in all honesty, it looked like the largest, luminous, ominous kite I&apos;ve ever seen;  If the thing was a kite, it must have been flying outside of the entire venue- I would have been able to see some kind of string to support a large craft like the one in question, or a quick reflection streak of light that would have caught my eye; nothing though. I can&apos;t remember if it was windy in the first place...  It hovered very slowly as we almost forgot about the music and speculated, questioned, feared, and awed at what the hell this glowing green hovering object&apos;s purpose, orgin, and location were. Everyone else in our proximity were really intoxicated and were useless to get to pay attention...I take everything with a grain of salt. My friend swears that it was a UFO; I am personally indifferent. it really does make sense for the &quot;aliens&quot; to study a population spike like a huge music festival, given that there are aliens with green ellipse-shaped craft that moves like a kite. Honestly, it was truly un-conventional, unidentified, flying, and a tangible object. I can only pray to have my entire reality questioned like this again.  Unbelieveable.  I will go under polygraph any time, any day. I want to believe. I wanted to find out what that object was. It dissappeared after an hour of noticing it though. Grrrrr....", "Was watching the sky, and saw a green light zig around the sky. Slight Humming noise,", "That&apos;s no meteor, or satellite, or ANYTHING I&apos;ve ever witnessed! =)I apologize for the unclear date of the event.  That is my best guess due to the fact that the reason my mother and I were looking skyward that evening was due to the fact that a newly found comet was supposed to be in the vacinity of Earth and observable with the naked eye. (the year could have been 07/22/86) I can imagine based upon what we saw that NUMEROUS other witnesses are available to report this one.  So here are the details.On the 5:pm news Channel 32, the ABC affiliate at the time in Louisville Ky., reported that a new comet would be passing within eyeshot of the earth later that evening within a specific constellation which I cannot recall.  I have been a amateur astronomer since I was in 4th grade and possess a number of telescopes.  I became excited about the comet news and later that evening forced my mother and sister to join me up on our second floor roof deck with a clear view of most of the mid-west sky.  After locating the constellation, possibly Orion, which was directly overhead, after looking for several minutes I was dissappointed in NOT being able to see any comet at all.  This was bizarre to me as the newscast was very specific and I thought my knowledge of the sky was reasonably good.  My sister quickly lost interest and was looking down at her feet (something she regrets to this day) when the following occurred...in precisely the spot in the constellation where we believed the comet would be visible, my mother and I saw a spectacular METEOR whiz directly through the spot where the comet was supposed to be.  I immediately reacted with a shout of excitement &quot;DID you SEE THAT!&quot; just as mom reacted with &quot;WOW!&quot;  I have seen literally over 500 meteors in my lifetime and what happened next defies all knowledge of meteor behavior... The moment the meteor&apos;s bright white light dissipated, I assumed it was just pure luck that we happened to see it instead of a much slower if not stationary comet within the same region.  But as this though instantly crossed my mind. a second meteor appeared with the same intensity and duration only this time it was exactly on line with the first meteor but farther toward the horizon...in the direction of Downtown Louisville about 9-miles to the West.  My mother also saw this second one.  The second burned out immediately and then a THIRD meteor made its appearrance also on the same line as the first two!  It then burned out and yet a FOURTH meteor followed on the same line now nearly at the sky&apos;s west horizon.  This was an absolutely silent event which lasted roughtly 6-seconds.  When it was over I was speechless, as was my mom...but I mamaged a &quot;...did you see that?&quot; her response &quot;yes.&quot; and THEN I  went NUTS with excitement!  It was clearly not a meteor as meteors do not switch on and off, and the on&apos;s and off&apos;s were in equal lengths/times.  Judging by the speed and duration of the event, the object had to be moving a AMAZING SPEED to go from a point directly overhead to the west horizon in only 6-seconds at that altitude.  And finally, I have seen satellites, and the shuttle, orbiting the earth in the past...and they were practically stationary compared to this thing. I realize that we are talking about an event over a decade ago, but perhaps this description corroborated other reports you may have received.

While scope was tracking Saturn and waiting for the optics to cool down for better views, the SW sky was being observed just in case any more orange lights like the ones sighted on 02/24/05 might reappear, which, surprisingly, they did. The first instance happened at precisely 19:23 {the hand controller for the scope can display the time among other useful information} involving 3 orange lights flashing once sequentially one after the other, spread out at roughly a heading of 238 degrees and 12 degrees above the horizon plus and minus around 3 degrees for each coordinate to encompass the total area in which the phenomena was first noticed. A quick GOTO of the scope to the star, Aldebaran, and then switching the &quot;targets&quot; submenu to &quot;terrestrial mode&quot; {disables the RA motor so it no longer tracks celestial objects} before slewing to middle of the region of sky containing the orange lights via the use of the scope&apos;s red-dot pointer/finder is how these objects can be precisely located and documented by me. The second incident occurred at 19:27 and was quite similar at about around 3 degrees lower above the horizon than the initial group. The third and final incident was at 19:32 hrs. I was able to slew the scope&apos;s red-dot precisely onto the location of the center light as they illuminated a few seconds longer than before, they were also tightly bunched together this time at a precise heading of 242 degrees/ 13 arcminutes and an altitude of exactly 5 degrees/17arcminutes plus or minus 5 arcminutes - the average accuracy of GOTO slews to celestial objects after a precise polar alignment.The orange lights did not stay on long enough to get a peek throught the scope, unfortunately. Whatever these things are {satellites? Iridium flares?} must of moved below the treeline and eventually the horizon after the last series of flashes. Absolutely no nav lights flashing while briefly observed if these are some kind of aircraft. Numerous aircraft were spotted travelling towards the general area of Ft. Smith at the time, which were definitely adhering to FAA regulations. Location of observations is at 35.26N by 093.40W.The sky was clear with the Milky Way next to Orion easily visible.", "3 Christmas Tree Cookie Cutters in Triangle FormationIt was a bright, sunny, windy day. I was mowing my backyard lawn and went to dump clippings into trash can. As I came up with the grass catcher I was looking due west. There were 3 black christmas tree cookie cutter crafts holding a triangle formation. I went quickly into my house and asked my wife to come outside. She asked me, &quot;Why?&quot; With a bit of aggrevation in my voice, I said, &quot;Come on!&quot; She came outside with me, I pointed in the direction they were and asked her what she saw. She said, &quot;Christmas tree cookie cutters&quot;. I asked her if she could hear any noise emitting from the craft. She answered no. We watched them together for a few minutes. They were not rock solid in the sky. It was a windy day (10 to 15 knot winds with slightly higher gusts) and they were being knocked around a bit.  Nevertheless, they held a constant formation. All at once, in formation, they quickly shifted to our left around 3 degrees then 6 degrees to the right (this is an estimate). They did this twice in about 3-4 seconds, stopped, and then accelerated at an unbelievable rate straight up and out of sight in around 2 seconds. My wife and I just looked at each other and I said, &quot;Do you think they were ours?&quot; My wife said, &quot;I hope so.&quot;   On that afternoon we could hear about 3 of the air national guards&apos; C-130 cargo planes. They were on the tarmac warming up their engines in preparation for moving out of Van Nuys Air Port that they had used as a home base for many years. It looked like the UFOs were looking in that direction, toward the airport possibly watching troop movements. At this point the story is over, until. . .Around 6 years later my wife, who is a teacher, and I were at a school function, sitting at the faculty table. The night&apos;s function was going fine and the kids wanted to play bingo. So they handed out bingo cards and they started playing. Those of us seated at the faculty table were not too intrested in the game and were just kind of playing along. All at once the gentleman next to me held up his bingo card, showed it to me, and said, &quot;Look what I have&quot;. The card was a tan color with black plastic slides. With the center free slot filled and two black slides filled on either side of and one row below the center spot, the card&apos;s 3 black squares formed a triangle shape. I said &quot;I have seen that before.&quot; He said &quot;Around 6 years ago?&quot; I said &quot;Yes.&quot; I told him they were due west, he said they were north west of him. He lives 1/2 mile south of me. I don&apos;t know the math but such information means that the UFOs were not very far away.  Later on, I asked my friend why he showed me his bingo card with that triangle shape. He said he did not know why. We now say with a smile that we have a &quot;cosmic connection&quot;.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I know the decade - the 80s; I know the day - Friday; I know the time - 5:30; I know the season - winter. I know the time and day  because I was meeting my husband, a University Professor, after he left school, at the house of friends for a drink before going out for dinner. It had to be winter because it was already dark. I took back streets to avoid stop lights, had stopped at a two-way stop and, because there were no other cars in sight, was preparing to cross the intersection when  all at once  shining above me was a  bright, bright white light, not a searchlight type beam, but a hovering object with light diffused all around and about, seeming to come from within. It could not have been more than 30 feet above me and made no sound at all. I was so startled that I couldn&apos;t take note of any particulars.  It just radiated light.  I couldn&apos;t move, but after no more than a minute, the light rose straight up to a great height and sped away in a north westerly direction, very straight and purposeful, very rapid.  I followed it with my eyes and headed in the same direction in my car but it was moving much too rapidly and I couldn&apos;t of course follow a straight course. When it was just a speck of far-away light,  a shower of sparks fell from it and it was gone. When I got to the home of our friends, I told them my story and then called the police to ask if anyone had reported an unknown object in the sky.  No one had.  I can&apos;t imagine that I was the only one who saw it.  Perhaps there were those who wondered at it but didn&apos;t report it, or perhaps those seeing something streaking across the sky didn&apos;t think it unusual.  I probably would have been among any of those except that I had seen that object rise from just above me before it sped away. I had no idea what to do with such information and, too, didn&apos;t want to be among those being laughed at for  telling  outlandish stories about flying saucers.  So - I filed it away in my memory bank and thought of it seldom until I saw the Jennings program the other night.

It was so low it looked it was going to land, but we are 16 miles from the nearest airport.

She said that it would have gone over our house from the direction it was traveling seconds before we saw it, but she never heard anything.

Instead of continuing through the city to our home, he turned back and headed towards the lights, which made our journey home through the country roads. What we saw were about 8 and sometimes more very large round lights following the south side of Mine Rd. As we drove beside and watched them, trying to figure out what they were, we began to notice that some would suddenly go dark while another would light up nearby. They all stayed fairly close together and they continued their path directly beside us. We turned left on Landsdowne Rd and they also turned with us. Landsdowne Rd is several miles long, so we drove slow and observed.They stayed beside us. We had no preconceptions about UFO&apos;s, therefore we did not feel any threat from this, just curiosity. Suddenly a helicopter appeared in the sky on the north side of the road. When we heard the helicopter&apos;s engine and saw the small light in comparison, we realized that the lights that we had been following (or following us) made absolutly no sound. When we turned right on the next road my husband decided to keep past our development and go as far as the small airport to see if that was their destination. They continued beside us and on past the airport. This seemed to be a never ending journey and we were beginning to feel a little strange about it so we turned around back to our house, which was just a few blocks off the main road. We could still see them behind us and they seemed to be hovering. Once home, my son went to get his friend to tell him about this. They climbed on the garage to see if they could see them. The lights or whatever it was had crossed the road into a large unpopulated area next to our development. My son and his friend watched them hover in that area until they got tired and came in. Of course I had no fear then about abduction, etc. because I wasn&apos;t aware of such things. Today, I would not have taken it so lightly.The next day someone called into our local radio station and was talking about the lights and how none of the local military bases had anything like this in the air. I then knew that more people than my family had witnessed this. It was a very dark night so we couldn&apos;t determine if the lights were attached to one large craft or each was a seperate craft. I would love to know if anyone in this area recalls anything about this.

I pulled over to listen, but I could hear nothing.  It was very high in the sky.  The best way to describe it would be that it was a rectangular shaped object that moved very, very slowly to the north.  It seemed to have four circles that appeared to pulse rhythmically in order - as one would brighten, the one before it would dim.  What really got my attention was the only bright light (not overly bright, at that) that came from it.  My main thoughts were that it was some type of aircraft since it had what appeared to be the same type of light that I had seen on commercial aircraft that were like headlights.

Dull black is what we saw. The ship was bigger than anything I had ever heard of, maybe being 6 football fields or larger. It was so large, neither one of us could tell if it was round or square or what... although I watched it intently, I believe it was of a rectangle shape, for we could see two of the sides, but not the other two. I looked to the right and to the left into the tops of the trees to see just how big the thing was, but could not see an end to it in either direction. It flew just above the tree tops, at least it looked very very close to us. As it flew over my car (with my daughter now screaming histerically) I noticed that while one side of this huge ship was just beginning to hover over the car, the other side that was seeable was still about a quarter mile down the street. The bottom of the craft had something &apos;molded&apos; into the bottom like huge rooms with rounded off corners sticking out of the bottom. There were round tubes that went from one &apos;room&apos; to another. I only got a look at the part of the ship that came over the road. I drove even slower, hoping that someone would come down the road so I could stop them and tell them to &quot;Look! There is a ship!&quot; I saw no lights what so ever and the bottom of the ship was extremely visible to the naked eye. I wouldn&apos;t ever call it a UFO. This was a ship. It was bigger than anything I or my daughter has ever seen, and it flew right over my car and over the town of Zebulon, North Carolina. This is not the only time things have been seen here. I emplore the public to please report anything seen of this magnitude in or around Zebulon, North Carolia or anywhere else for that matter. Someone besides us had to have seen this huge ship or even got a glimpse of a ship that has huge molded &apos;rooms&apos; on the bottom! I have yet to read of anything like this in your postings or anywhere else on the internet. I need other witnesses besides my daughter and myself.((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))It was in the late Spring of 1994, my daughter had turned 12 in January of that year.

It had a form of antigravity . it moved over the hills always at the same level from the ground.The shape was different in every way. It seemed to be built to fill its needs for space from what was inside the craft. I first noticed the ship when driving down the highway. It was across the highway from me going east bound. It would be there for a short time then it would be gone and then back again then gone again. This was the reason I stopped.

Looking southeast , it bobbed &amp; weaved along a crestline, as it aproached us much like a helocopter, only much faster. As it covered a few miles in a few seconds. It altered course, somewhat more westerly,still fallowing the ridgeline. At its closest point, approx inline with soledad cyn rd, it ascended plumb vertically, climbing maybe four thousand feet, until the ceiling,and out of sight, in about three to five seconds.

The night was cool and there was some overcast clouds as we were talking and fishing, then I spotted some lights overhead and thought they were coming from hi-beams such as an automobile. I thought they might be police patrol car spotlights (we were not supposed to be fishing at night because the lake was closed after dark) So now we were on the alert and thinking  we would get busted by cops so we remained silent for a minute or two. Then, across from the lake we saw a bright round metal ball about 20 to 25 feet in diameter peek out from behind a tree top, while hovering some 30 to 40 feet above the ground. At first I thought it was a spotlight that someone was projecting onto the trees, but almost simultaneously I realized that there was no attached beam that could be making the spotlight, plus , it was partially obscured by the tree tops. My friend and I looked at eachother and   we could not believe our own eyes! Then, the light slowly went back behind the trees and suddenly was gone. A few moments afterwards, the light appeared directly above the lake (approx. 100 feet or less above the water) but this time the shiny round object was obscured by the overcast clouds/fog but we could still see it shining. The next thing that happened will stay in my memory forever, this thing started emitting three sets of light blue arced pulse-typed  light rays. They were coming down in three rows and when they hit the surface of the water they simultaneously bounced back up through the arc stream for about 10 to 15 seconds and this thing made absolutely no noise. After this , it took off and was gone forever.This event happened 12 years ago but I remember most of the details clearly as if it just happened. After watching Peter Jennings&apos; report on UFO&apos;s two nights ago, I learned of the National UFO Reporting Center and this was my experience.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

The sun was bright and I was looking out of the passenger window so the light would not blind me and I was scanning the sky, When I seen this Huge cigar shape like ship.  It was flying from my right to left as if sitting in the car.  The craft was a dull brownish grey had like this jet like fire comming out of one end, but it did not leave any exhaust in the sky and their were no vapors like when you look at the road on a hot day.  There were no windows or stickers on it. It was flying about 6000ft.  It was so big that it looked like gigantic submarine flying over us.  I told my uncle to stop but he was too scared.  I was pointing to the other cars on the road at the time so that they would maybe look too but no one did.  I was not high at the time and was not tired.  I was already used to working the night shift and staying up a little because I had that night off.  I got my uncle to pull over and that is when the ship shot another ship just like itself out of its rear, going in the direction it came from.  My cousin saw the secound and started to freak out and I said lets stop but he still wouldn&apos;t. I watched the 2 ships keep going until I could not see them anymore. I watched tv and nothing I asked people that I knew at the time was on that road that morning going to work and they seen nothing.  I now I seen it because I was in the day time and clear as a bell, no clouds or anything.

PD))", "Possible UFO- but more importantly, the alien experienceI can&apos;t be certain whether this was actually a UFO, because I live approximately 5 miles from the Airport.  We see and hear jets/planes/cessna&apos;s/helicopters everyday, all night long.  However, the odd thing about this craft was that, it was triangle shaped, and it had odd patterned lighting.  They were arranged to illuminate the craft, and the lights were all white.  Whereas, on the normal aircraft that we observe everyday, there are an array of colors like yellow, white, blue, etc.  Anyhow, the lights were not only arranged oddly, but they blinked and glowed in a very transe like manner.  They blinked so fast and in some sort of pattern, it really stood out like an oddity, nothing that we&apos;re accustomed to seeing.  I was on the balcony of our third floor apartment when i saw it, so I called out for my sister, and she came out and dismissed it as a plane.  But, I just had that &quot;odd&quot; feeling in my stomach.  Anyway, this hasn&apos;t been the first time for me to have these &quot;supernatural&quot; occurences. I believe I was visited by &quot;aliens&quot; one night while I was sleeping.  I woke up several times, paralyzed, and couldn&apos;t speak or move, but I was able to think clearly.  I could not see a clear figure, but I was very terrified and frightened and the being that was in front of my face was telling me to go back to sleep, and was putting something into my ear.  The second or third time that I awoke, I couldn&apos;t take it anymore, so I started praying telling the being that in &quot;Jesus Christ&apos;s name, to go away, and leave this room&quot;.  And it finally left me.  I did research and found out that there are a lot of people who&apos;ve had the same experiences as I, and there is a site that you can learn more at:  www.alienresistance.org  I Believe that all of these sitings and experiences are part of what Christians believe to be the &quot;Great Deception&quot;.  What this means is that Aliens are going to show themselves and try to get people to worship them. In reality these &quot;aliens&quot; or &quot;Gods from above&quot; are really demons.  Why do you think that every alien abduction or experience like mine is always so frightening and terrible?  &quot;Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the last days some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron.&quot;  1Timothy 4:1-2  &quot;For there shall arise false Christ&apos;s, and false prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.&quot; Matthew 24:24((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

I saw in the medium distance, maybe a mile away at most, what looked like two streetlights in the northeast, only higher up in the air. Two amber-ish/off white colored lights. They didn&apos;t seem to be moving very fast, and I was trying to keep my eye on them off and on while I was driving. I didn&apos;t think much of it, because they could be helicopters or some kind of normal aircraft, so I was just mildly curious. I drove into my driveway and got out of the car and waited to see if I could see the lights again. At this point they were obscured by some taller trees in our neighborhood. Eventually one came over our neighborhood- not directly overhead but nearly- and I got a pretty decent look at it. Let me say first that there was not anything other-worldly about this, it followed the &quot;rules&quot; and physics a normal kind of aircraft would, but at the same time it didn&apos;t match up with anything I&apos;ve seen or heard before. It flew at the approximate altitude and speed I would expect a helicopter to fly at, not very fast, but not unusually slow either. In any case, it was not at the altitude of a commercial airliner. The prominent, constant bright light on the craft obscured my vision of the actual shape/texture of the craft, being that it was night. If it had wings, there were no lights on them. On what I interpreted to be the side of the craft, there were small lights with a repeating pattern, very similar to what I&apos;ve seen before on registered aircraft. I believe one was red, the others might have been white or blue. I don&apos;t remember how many of these smaller lights there were. No more than three. I believe the pattern was two-step in that one pattern flashed followed by a slightly different pattern, and then the entire sequence repeated. The entire sequence didn&apos;t take longer than two seconds to complete. Again, it was much like the patterns I&apos;ve seen before. Now, the only thing that did not cause me to dismiss this as a helicopter was the sound. There was no loud, rotary sound. It sounded very much like the sound of a distant commercial airliner, the kind of low-frequency-air-jet kind of sound, only very subdued. It wasn&apos;t nearly as loud as I would expect for an aircraft flying at the altitude of this craft. Hearing this kind of sound with a low-flying, slow-flying craft did not make any sense in my mind. Again, the sound itself was not particularly unusual, but in the context of what I was seeing, it seemed very unusual. The craft progressed toward the southwest, toward our downtown. And the second craft followed in a similar direction about 20-30 seconds later. As far as I could tell, the craft were identical, and they flew at the same altitude and speed. The entire sighting from the time I first saw the two lights in the medium distance to the time they were out of my sight was probably no more than four minutes. Possibly a little less. To follow-up the sighting I called one of our local TV stations about an hour later, and they had received no calls about odd aircraft. The next day, Wednesday, I called the air traffic controller tower at the Eugene Airport, and the representative there said she was not aware of any government or military aircraft flying over Eugene the night before. My best guess is that these were military craft, but they resembled nothing I have seen in the past.", "Weird Light BeamI dont know, if this was an alien sighting, or if it even counts as one, but it&apos;s something I experienced several years ago, and just shrugged it off, not thinking that I could be involved in something like this. It happened during the summer, about 7 or 8 years ago, and my cousins and I were bored and so we decided to go see a movie. But before we left, I had to finish up a load of laundry. Now, our house is the middle house in a cul-de-sac, so when we open our garage door, it faces the cul-de-sac and the street that leads into it. Our washing machine and and dryer are in there, and so when we do the wash, we can see the outside world. After putting the clothes in the washer I opened the door to the house, to go back inside. The door, is the kind, that when open, it automatically shuts close, real fast. Well, I opened the door, and all of a sudden, my entire garage is flooded in a bright neon lime-green light. I turn around and see that the entire neighborhood is flooded in this light. Everywhere I looked, everything was covered in this light, as if someone was holding a light, right over our cul-de-sac. I didnt see any object, but after about 10 seconds, of being in light, this huge shadow came out of nowhere and then flew off to the western sky. And then there was this weird wind (like a suction)and the trees blew along with other debri, to the west and then stopped. The light &quot;flew&quot; off too, and everything turned back to normal. I turned around and started to walk back in the house. Now, all this time, the door has been opened. And if you recall, I told you that it was one of those sprung doors, that shut as quickly as it opened. Well, right then and there, the door shut, right over my left foot, ripping up my nail on my big toe. The Dr. said, the nail would never grow back, because the nerves had been lifted out, but it did, and to this day, my toe has a nail. Something, my Dr. said was a &quot;miracle.&quot;  I dont know what it was that happened that day, but I always thought, that it had something to do with an alien. So, I was wondering if you can shed some sort of information on this, and tell me, if you have another experience such as this, recorded.

It must have been about 100 ft away, and I noticed what I thought was the front.

There were about 6 surfers heading toward the waves with surf boards under their arms.  They were pointing up and then I saw it....a cylinder like a cigarette shaped thing with lots of lights.

So the distance was like 500 miiles travelled in about one tenth of a second.  There was no light trail like the kind the starship Enterprise used to leave.  That is what I saw.  My mom and my step dad both saw it too but claim now that they can no longer remember seeing it.  I saw this thing just last December, a photo, in my Encarta computer encyclopedia.  The only thing wrong with the Encarta picture is that the lights were purplish not reddish.((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

At first, it appeared to be going up in the atmosphere then it hovered and came to a complete stop. It turn eastward and continued traveling east at an unbelievable speed. It was huge appearing to be silver and red in a rectangular shape. It was flying in the direction of the moon, then it stopped abruptly, turned left and went straight up until it was out of sight which was almost immediately!", "Very Bright lights illuminating entire horizon moving quicklyAny idea what this was?  This happened Saturday night and no we weren&apos;t all drunk.  Several of us besides me were sober.No I am not talking about aliens but it was wierd.  My family and I were hanging out at my Mom&apos;s house. I have a 3 million candle spot light were shining it around the around looking at caves and stuff like that.  Real indian caves but thats another story.After I turned off the light a light appeared on the horizon. It was very bright and seemed to move across this hill side. It wasn&apos;t on military property but somewhere on our ranch. The light lit up the horizon many times brighter then any car headlight. In addition no car could get where we think the light was coming from and all my years at the ranch we have never seen car lights from this far, they just disapate to fast. This went on for about 1 minute stopped and then restarted again about 10 minutes later in almost the same spot.Then it stopped for about 30 minutes and reappeared on a mountain called Bald mountain. This mountain is on military property called Fort Hunter Liggett. The same basic thing happened the light was very bright and lit up the moisture in the air. The light went off and then reappeared further west of where it was at.Here is where it gets wierd, my brother and I know those roads on the base. There is no way to move that far in 5 minutes. So we might be able to believe it was a helicopter but it was on private propery an hour before that. Also why would the military have a light that bright and shine it in the air? The last wierd thing is that there wasn&apos;t any sound. Everyone believes the light was too powerfull to be mounted on a automobile. I haven&apos;t done a very good job at explaining how bright this light was.  It illuminated the very air it went through. I have seen spot lights at car dealerships and this was much brighter and wider then those lights.", "Tiny reddish dot moved past Constellation Gemini &amp; Planet SaturnKindly refer to my earlier report to NUFORC of 13th Feb., Sunday, where I described my sighting of a slow-moving reddish-golden blinking light near the Orion belt.This evening, six days after my first sighting of some unknown lighted object, I was again out in my porch to see-off some visiting friend. While returning inside I looked up most unsuspectingly just to have a glimpse of the shiny half moon. In front of the moon, the twin stars of Constellation Gemini &ndash; Castor and Pollux were shining while a brighter Saturn was beside the pair.At the last moment of my glance, I suddenly viewed something very unusual.I could very, very clearly watch a tiny star-like reddish-brown dot resembling the reddish-orange star &quot;Pollux.&quot; The dot flew past Saturn and Constellation Gemini that contained &quot;Pollux&quot; itself.Now I put a most careful attention towards the particular point of the sky. The tiny dot of reddish light slightly diverted its path and continued moving smoothly, faster than a plane but much slower than any shooting star. The &lsquo;red dot&rsquo; reached a nearby region possibly that of Constellation Cancer and apparently vanished. Please note that the red dotted light did not blink or quiver but was a fixed dot of light.Could it be a satellite or some kind of space junk ? Or was it some real UFO ? I am truly amazed to be able to witness a couple of strange sightings in the night sky within a single week !", "Great &quot;Globe of Light&quot; on the italian sky on March the 8. 2005From the Ligurian Ufological Center.We have received these two event descriptions from Mr. F. M. and his friends and from Mrs. E. that we are glad to submit to your attention (sorry for the bed translation in english)  &quot;On the day 8 March, at the 19.20-19.30, together with other 6 friends we  were stopping by the motorway restaurant near Milan, direction Genoa; the sky was clear, suddenly an enormous bright sphere appears at an altitude of around 5000 mt., west-east direction, in front of the constellation of Orion. The bright sphere slowly stirred, lightening more and more ; the sphere has remained suspended without moving for about one minute, then two airplanes have arrived, one would have passed under it, the other on the side. The globe first went out and then it comes on again, becoming bigger than before and again it starts moving quickly, to go off then suddenly when one of the two airplanes was passing under it . I had already heard about the &quot;globes of light&quot; and seen the video-tapes of the Ligurian Ufological Center, but I was at the same time captivated and sceptic. Now I am even more intrigued since I have seen with my own eyes this extraordinary event and I am not alone, also my friends and their wives have seen it. We all agree in to say that what we have seen is an ufological phenomenon.Now we wonder: what will they say those pilots of the airplanes that have surely sighted it? F.M. &amp; c.&quot;  &quot;I am passionate of UFO, even if have never be so luck to see one. But yesterday evening 8 march around 7.30 p.m., from the balcony of my home I&apos;ve seen a great brighting star running in the sky; suddenly it went off when two airplanes were arriving near it. Was it a globe of light like those in New Mexico?&quot; E.", "Witnessed a light, moving at right angles travel across the sky, strobes flashing 3 times, and 4 additional lights emerging.While looking up at the stars, I saw a light moving at right angles in a zig-zag pattern from the eastern horizon going west. I told my husband and two friends there with me to look at it. We all agreed that it was not an aircraft of any type we knew ( my husband was a licensed pilot) and I was a student pilot at the time. It was high in the sky, estim. at least 10k feet or higher. It traveled in a straight path above the horizon, and as it reached the western sky, suddenly a very bright strobe light flashed 3 times in rapid succession, and 4 other lights emerged rapidly from the source of the light, flew rapidly away, and all disappeared.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "The time of the sighting was probably sometime after 11pm on friday march the 5th.  Walking by the intersection of McCowan Rd. and Danforth Rd., I was already paying attention to the planes in the sky.   Then, incredibly a large fire trail formed across the sky, just under the constellation Orion, as some large object burned up, heading in the general direction of Buffallo.  The trail then faded after about a 4 count.  This was no garden variety meteorite or &apos;shooting star&apos; that I am familiar with from camping trips to northern Ontario.  I was absolutly stunned by the sight.  There might have been some flashes from the direction of the landing, but the light pollution made it hard to discern that positively.  The sky was clear otherwise. I was besides myself.  This was the most spectacular earth entry that I have ever witnessed.  And right above scarborough.  I was watching the sky with greater intensity.  I walked on down Seminole Rd.  It&apos;s somewhere on this road that I saw what looked like a plane with a large white light speed by across the horizon.  The light was too bright for a regular sideview of a plane and the speed exceeded my expectations.", "Bright light hovers over Higgens Lake, MI  one night1974 or 1975 during deer hunting season Nov.15th - Dec.1stThis is my fathers version of what we saw on the night of november between the dates of November 15th to December 1st 1974 or 1975. At about 9pm-10pm at Higgens Lake,MI I was up deer hunting with my son when we both observed an extremley bright light. It was the brightest light I had ever witnessed, it lit up the inside of the cabin just like daylight. It was hovering over the lake just above the tree tops. Everything was extremley still, almost like being in a vacum. I was extremley afraid and I told my son to put his head underneath his covers. I was afraid that whatever it was might be coming in to get us if it saw us. I to buried my head underneath the covers. After what seemed like a few minutes, I looked out the window and the object was gone.What bothers me is that we never discussed it the next morning with each other. Not untill recently have we discussed in depth what we witnessed that night.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Please see son&apos;s report!!

At that i ran and got my camera and tape and filmed the incident. The lights would form a straight line, then would move to a triangle shape, then move far aprt. I also noticed that each light would blink or dim then others would follw.3 lights total. When zoomedd in with my camera i noticed ligh shooting off from the red lights whitish in color. I watched this take place over ten minutes.

It was subtle in it&apos;s movements as far as floating/gliding.  My brother and I were looking at the stars when my brother noticed the object in the sky. He pointed it out to me as it went directly above us and over the roof of the apartment building.  We ran outside to the direction it headed and it was gone.  The object looked oval with dark colored pertrusions in the shape of rounded rectangles off of the back 2/3&apos;s of it roughly.", "THE SIGHTING.It was a clear, summer&rsquo;s evening in 1947 (or 1948.  I can&rsquo;t be sure of the exact year).  The sun had just set over the foothills of the Cascades north of Leavenworth.  My childhood friend and I were playing in a vacant lot next to my house in the small town of Cashmere, WA. which is nestled in the Wenatchee River valley.  We were both starring off into the clear western sky when, in the southwest, we both saw four circular (like dots) light green objects moving toward the west in a diamond formation above the top of the foothills southwest of town.  It was hard to judge their actual distance and speed, but they were moving quite slowly.  We watched them move slowly west for less than one minute; and then, one at a time, each object went from a lumbering speed to streaking away at a fantastic speed (i.e., we saw each leave a short green streak and it was gone in an instant).  This event would be analogous to the Starship Enterprise jumping to light speed, leaving the momentary streak of light (cf. Star Trek movies).   After they were gone, my friend and I ran to tell my parents what we had seen.  My Mom said, &lsquo;Well, tomorrow go down to the local newspaper office and given them your report&rsquo;.  We did just that the next day, but they were not interested.While my friend and I now live in different states, we still recall/discuss this &lsquo;sighting&rsquo; whenever we see each other.  Like so many others who have witnessed a UFO event, they often say, &lsquo;whether or not people believe UFOs exist, I know what I saw&rsquo;.  We know what we saw in the sky on that summer evening years ago, but we don&rsquo;t know what they were.  I think it is fair to say that no earth-based &lsquo;flying machine&rsquo; at that point in time could have possibly behaved as these four objects did.  When they streaked away out of sight, it was almost like they simply departed from our &lsquo;optical window&rsquo; and immediately entered a part of the electromagnetic spectrum that our visual mechanism cannot perceive.I have never communicated the foregoing to anyone, except my own family; and for the record I have been a science professor at the university level for the past 34 years.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

When I got onto the street I was facing to the west and saw a unknown craft approximently 10-12 miles which on a compass would be WWS to SW. It looked to be on the otherside of the mountain range which is about 9500 ft. there.  Immediatly after I saw it I killed the light&apos;s on my vehicle and drove to a parking lot up the road where I could get a better view.  I watched it for about 15 minutes it would hover for a couple of minutes then move left or right a little, it had light&apos;s flashing on it that would flash in differnt repertion&apos;s of Blue, Red, Green, and White, at times all light&apos;s would stay on.  During that 15 minutes I had turned my headlight&apos;s on to take off and all light&apos;s on the craft immdiatly turned off after my light&apos;s had been on for 10 seconds, I then drove back down the street out of view then came back with my light&apos;s off and parked again.  About a minute passed and the light&apos;s came on again on the craft.  I decided to a county road that circles around and comes back to town, the road that I took also cut&apos;s off and goes in the mountain close to where I saw it at.  As I turned off on the county the light&apos;s still flashed until a little after I topped a hill where my light&apos;s where easily seen in the sky, after that the light&apos;s never came on again on the craft.  I came home and then about 30 minutes later one fighter jet possiblly a F-18 (wingspan didn&apos;t look like a f-16 th only other jet they fly here) flew about a block or two away from my house coming from a straight from where I saw the light&apos;s. The light&apos;s on the craft I saw that night didn&apos;t flash at the same rate it varied from somewhere of .20 - 1.0 seconds, it could of been a helicopter I couldn&apos;t see a shape because it was so far away, but there are several lavish ranches on the other side of the mountain&apos;s just about where the lights was at.  The airforce does do training flights here occasionally but I&apos;ve never seen just one flying that time of night, they alway&apos;s have another jet within a couple mile radius and which there was none others that I could see.  It could not have been a star or planet in the sky as what I saw was bigger and brighter than the rest of the objects in the sky.  The Lat/Long for the general area I saw it at is 37.25&apos;N  105.12&apos;W, it is not a tower, the closest one to that area is about 5 miles which is a repetitor tower which has no light on it.  In my best opinion the craft was about 1000 ft above the ground based on visual referance with surrounding mountains, the town here is viturally asleep or no one comes out after 23:00 at night untill about about 6:00 in the morning.((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witness might have been looking at the star, Sirius.  It gives off vivid color, and it is very bright.  Its chromatic nature would be reduced, it the observer were at a higher elevation.

Behind R.P.s place was a single lane road , then a ditch , a two lane road , another ditch and then 100 feet to the treeline . 75 yards in total and i looked up to see a saucer sitting over the trees and pointed it out to R.P.

Although saucer shaped the edges were not sharp as it appeared to have square windows around it&apos;s circumfrence . We watched for about 1 minute and then it drifted west and out of sight . There was no sound . The dimmension of the saucer should be very accurate as i know the exact distance to the first grove of trees and it was sitting just above them .

I am retired, after working 33 years as an electronics engineer for a popular aerospace company, and have taken part in designing some of the modern warplanes you see today.Back on June 6, 2002, I was camping at a place called Tuttle Creek, near the town of Lone Pine, which is near Mount Whitney (the tallest mountain in the continental United States). I know it was the 6th of June, because that was my 68th birthday. I was with another retiree, a buddy of mine, ((name deleted)).  After a long day of fishing and BSing, we cooked and ate dinner, watched a VHS movie in my RV, then went to sleep. It was about 1 AM, and I woke up because, well, my buddy&rsquo;s snoring was just too loud for me to sleep through. I went outside and sat on the picnic table to have myself a cigar. After about a minute or so, I started to have this stange feeling, like the little voice inside me was talking.  It was then that a light or reflection above me caught my eye. I looked up and, low and behold, there was this triangle craft moving above me, I would guess, about 5-10 mph. It was about 1000 feet up, and and it didn&apos;t make any sound.  It was about 50-60 feet long by 30-40 feet wide, and had a reddish-orange light on each point. The sky was clear and you can see all the stars, except for the ones that this craft blocked out. I pounded on the RV to wake up ((name deleted)). He came out cussing at me, and I all I had to do was point upward to shut him up.  He was just as shocked as I was.  We watched this craft for almost 5 minutes, and then suddenly the craft started to move faster, and within a few seconds it was out of our line of sight. We stood up the rest of the night exchanging opinions about what we thought the craft was.  We came to the conclusion that it was either a new experimental secret government aircraft (we both worked on the F-117 Stealth Fighter, so we knew that it could have been a new secret aircraft), mass hallucination (that was ((name deleted))  2 cents), or an extraterrestrial craft.

It made no noise as it flew/glided about 200feet and went right over the houses in full view of everyone i didnt see any markings at first i thought it was a plane but it made no noise and flew really low.  I saw it for about 8 seconds before it either diasappeared or flew away really fast plus it kind of caqme from out of nowhere  I am really worried becuase it seems as though they only let certain people see them??

This is a reoccuring event worthy of investigation. I lived out in the countryside while I was growing up.  As children, all us neighborhood kids would ponder the wonders of the great night sky. During the latter half of the 70&apos;s roughly the summer of 78&apos;s several of us saw an object dart from place to place at incredible speed only to jart off in another direction at impossible angles of trajectory.  We summoned our parents who also witnessed this event only to get the shoulder shrug, oh well. Part 2. 1984, 5.5 miles north of home. A friend was having problems with his soon to be wife. We took a drive so as he could discuss his problems. Upon driving for no apparent reason I sugested we pull over and talk about his problems.Within 6 or 7 minutes everything changed from &quot;personal problems&quot; to what is passing in front of us. The object was and is not of this earth.The night was peacefull, a gently breaze if best. A field of crickets chirped as in a wave like sound ( if one has been in th country they know the sound) the object moved with exacting precision.At this point I said tho my buddy, Lets get out and stand on the car. I told him immediatly it was a u.f.o. No sound. At the point the object entered our plane of view, the crickets stopped. no sound, a pin drop dead silence.The object passed by approximately 300 ft. away, following the contour of the ground, up a small hill and over the top and down the other side, out of sight. At this point I told my friend that it was going to a large 15 acre pond/lake. This pond/ lake  is very deep. left over glacial sink hole approximatley 100 -125ft deep. I know this because I hunted the land years earlier. It is private land.I also knew whatever it was knew we were there. I told my friend &quot;lets wait a minute because it will be back&quot; Less than 2 minutes had bassed and The object returned up over the hill, only with an intensely bright ambure essence light, scanning the ground back and forth as if searching. Note: the craft is only feet over any brush or tree at any given time, following the conture with precision. At this point the objet was directly in fron of us, slowly comming closer.I felt a sensation only experienced when I had dental x-rays bluured vision. I asked my frfiend if he had felt anything wierd and he had. We opted to leave immediately. jumped in the car and left. CURIOSITY KILLED THE CAT ! I could not leave the scene entirely so we apt to view from a distance. A half mile north was a paralell road to view with caution. Apon driving there another object with the same intense light came almost straight down into the same area. With this we left. apon arriving home my ever trusty cat freaked out. my brother and his friend asked what was wrong with us because we didn&apos;t look right. I explained the event without fanfare. The cat would not come near me for 2 days. Never before or since has this occured, animals are sensitive plain and simple. LIFE GOES ON : several years pass. 4 to be exact. August 1988. Apon driving home, again I see what I know is not a star, planet etc... Same vacinity as child hood,as well as the very close expeience. Nervous I drive north again 5.5 miles. As I approach the same spot, it becomes apparent that the object is large, stationary and when I stopped and turned off the car, dead silent.After observation for approx. 5 minutes taking all vantage points, marking distance at about 1100 ft. and general observation. the object began to move. I got in my car and idled at a pace of 5 mph. for a quarter mile, watching in awe. The object increased speed, I followed up till120 mph. at this point the object shot like a cannonto approx 15 miles in two seconds, no more.Again awe.More years go by. I see an old friend that lived within a quarter mile of these occurances. I casually ask if he had ever seen anything of the sort. Yes , many times, unexplainable , remarkable movement that nothing of this earth can produce. I FEEL STRONGLY THAT THIS EVENT COULD BE CAPTURED IF SOMEONE HAD THE TIME TO OBSERVE AREA FOR ROUGHLY 2 WEEKS ANY GIVEN AUGUST.. FOR THAT IS WHEN I FEEL IT MAKES A REGULAR APPEARENCE. If I had equipmentIE:proper video, camera electronic sensors etc. and a little more time I know there would be no argument as to the validity of other life. This is no joke and I wish some day to have time and resorces to accomplish and prove with hard evidence the reality of life elsewhere.

I then noticed a point of light slowing descending toward the ground,it was perhaps 1 to 1.5 miles away.  I noticed it and commented about to my friend.  I thought it was strange for a aircraft to land in a corn field that surrounded the apartment building we were in that night.  The next day I read in the local paper about the state patrol been called by a farmer who saw some bright lights on his land.  The police then chased and were chased by these airbourne lights that night.

I was at bat &amp; looked out toward the wall in deep center field. The outfield wall was a side wall of a School Bldg. At the top of the approx 3 story Bldg wall I noticed an object seemingly not far above the School bldg.A perfectly round pure alabaster white object.It gleamed so white ,like nothing I ever saw before.We stopped the game &amp; watched it for quite some time.It sat &amp; sat, not a sound. After about 15-20 mins it very slowly moved NWest about a few City blocks without any noise of an engine, etc.After moving a couple mins it stopped &amp; sat again for a few minutes.It then appeared to go directly West into a nearby cloud. It was gone. A minute later it came out from the cloud &amp; it had a matching partner that sat close to it. They both moved back near the direction of the School yard, moving slowly &amp; quietly &amp; seemingly not too high up. They sat for about 5 minutes near us, then moved due North slowly until they were some distance away from us. Possibly 3 blocks away. All of a sudden they both bolted out of sight so fast that in seconds they disappeared.Still not a sound.Many of the guys acted as if we saw nothing. I believe they were upset &amp; didn&apos;t want to face that we just saw two UFO&apos;s. They&apos;d say they were clouds,etc. About 6 or 8 of us had no doubt what we saw. Needless to say we never finished that ball game after that event.Oddly enough that night the Air Force sent some recruiters to the school yard to see if they could sign up some of the older guys that hung out at the school yard.We thought they were coming to talk to us. When we went up to them with our story of what happened about 7 hours ago, they just &quot;poohed&quot; us off as some kids that were making up stories.Tonight I saw the ABC TV Special about sightings &amp; felt that I had to tell you of my experience. Only my family knows &amp; I believe they think I made up the story because they don&apos;t believe. I know what I saw. This is a true story &amp; I had to tell someone else &amp; your operation seems to be a perfect outlet for my information sharing.Though it has been many years since my sighting I assume any information may help your research.I suppose I may be one of the only guys still around that was at the sighting.

My mother, my sister, and myself were traveling home after they had picked me up from marching band rehearsal at my high school&apos;s football field. Mom was driving, my sister was riding in the front passenger seat, and I rode in the back seat. Approximately 1/2 mile from the school, I noticed a light above the trees on the other side of a field. This area is mostly vast farmland. The light had a reddish/yellowish glow. Upon noticing the glowing light, I said to my mother without taking my eyes off of the light, &quot;Mom, you might want to pull the car over. I think you want to see this.&quot; As I remained transfixed on the light, Mom pulled the car over. She jumped out of the car, as did I and my younger sister. The three of us hopped a small ditch and stood in the open field looking at the light. The moment the three of us stopped and stood together to watch the light, the light began to move toward us. While in the distance, there was no way to tell its size, shape, or distance. As it began to move toward us, I could see a large red sphere of light, flanked by a smaller yellow sphere of light on each side of the larger red sphere. It moved slowly and made absolutely no sound. As it approached, I could see the red glow reflecting off the field in front of us. As it grew nearer, static electricity grew strong as well raising the hair on my arms and head. From the moment I first noticed the object, I looked away only twice. Once I looked down at my arms to notice my hair standing up and the red glow reflecting off my skin. The second time I looked away, a car was passing by. It was a friend of mine leaving rehearsal as well with his mother. I watched them pass to see if they noticed the light, or us watching it. They passed by without notice of anything. It was then I turned back to look at the light when I realized it was almost directly over head. The three of us grew highly anxious and embraced one another tightly. My mom stood in the middle, I was on her right, my sister was to her left. We never spoke throughout the duration of the event. As the object hovered directly over head, I could see through the light. There was no structure within it. No apparent source from which the light emitted. The red and yellow lights were bright, but not blinding or hurtful to the eyes. The lights appeared electric, yet soft, like a neon sign. That moment in time is the last memory either of us have of witnessing the object. For all three of us, there is no recollection of the object departing, us departing, us going home, us returning to the car, or even discussing what we had seen. The object hovering directly above us is collectively our last memory of that entire night. It was a few years later while in college that I remembered the incident. I was outdoors one evening photographing shots of the moon. Upon later developing the images, I noticed a small metallic-looking ball hovering near the moon in the frame. I had taken several shots and the object appeared in one other photo, only this time it had moved much closer to the moon. Viewing these photos startled me. It was then I remembered the incident with my mother and sister in 1986. Upon recalling the incident in 1986 with my mom &amp; sister, I was quite disturbed when my memory didn&apos;t last beyond the object hovering above us. I promply visited my mother to ask her about it. She rememberd the incident vividly with the same detail as myself, with no memory of the object&apos;s departure, and no memory of the incident at all until then. She and I called my sister on the telephone to inquire about the same night. She too remembered the exact same incident with the exact same voids in her memory. Later, the three of us met face to face to recall the events of that evening and our memories, and lackings thereof, were in perfect accord. I do not know what it was nor do I claim that it must be alien. The only thing I know it to have been was a UFO...an Unidentified Flying Object. A UFO that left the three of us with some very unusual effects.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

We were driving near the lake, I cannot rmember if we were actually lost or just killing time til we picked up my brother. I remember looking out onto the lake, and my grandmother said, &quot;What is that?&quot; then I saw a reflection in the water, and looked up.. there was a very bright light, a sphere, as I remember coming straight at us.There was NO sound.The car stalled, (a brand new Lincoln) as we tried to turn around and leave, my grandmother was VERY frightened, and the light came right at us and suddenly was gone.This is the best I can remember it.

And it seems to coincide with a report on the same day from Princess Anne which is due West-South-West of Ocean City, MD.  I would have been 11 in June of 1970, my birthday being August 17, 1958. I saw a fast moving object in the North Sky, at an elevation of between 45 and 60 degrees.  It was nothing more to me than a bright light, but what struck me was its speed and dissimilar shape to that of surrounding stars.  To me, an Amateur Astronomer, it appeared that if all the surrounding stars were between magnitude 5 to 8 this object was closer in magnitude to 3 to 1.  It was that stark in the night sky, and I have to tell you 1970 was a time in Ocean City when light-pollution was not a problem.  Often during the summer months one could easily see the bright belt of the Milky Way tracing across the sky at about 12 o&apos;clock high. This object traversed almost straight across the sky, as I said at a high velocity, but suddenly it turn north, and began to sink slightly and veer off to the left.  Then all of a sudden it was gone. Needless to say I was dumb-founded, and terrified at the same time.  I would not tell anyone of what I saw out of fear of being ridiculed as a kid with a very active imagination. My guess is that the event sighting in Princess Anne was to do surveillence over the Wallops Island NASA facility, and the sighting I made might have been the same craft or another one altogether.  I surmise it was doing surveillence at Dover AFB, which is relative to the direction I reported seeing the craft traverse the night sky. I cannot begin to tell you how much this sighting upset, but it did, I was more scared at what I saw than I was excited, and for years I wondered if anyone else saw the same or similar events. I came to your site after seeing it the ABC News Special Report on UFOs which aired this evening (24 FEB 2005) and when I researched your database for Maryland sightings I was shocked to find something similar occured in Princess Anne at about the same time.  To me, this is no mere coincidence, for I am certain that what I saw that night WAS NOT a star, nor a meteor, nor a comet, its path of progress across the sky was too varied an the turn that it made to the north, which was abrupt, does not coincide with any natural law pertaining to heavenly bodies.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.

As we got closer we could see that they were not solid, seemed to swirl and quiver like jello.  Were silverish white but changed to orangish color.   The top object shot straight up into the sky, followed by the other two following slightly slower.  Hovered very high in the sky for a few seconds then slowly started to dim/disappear.  Almost looked like baloons, but moved very fast. There were two other cars on the road that runs parallel to the road that we were on (on the other side of the field).  Objects were closer to them than us.  Both cars stopped.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous.  PD))", "It was not a UFO.

Aprox 3:30amI saw blinking intense amber light that I first mistook for a planet. After looking back to the sky I noticed it had moved a drastic amount in the sky. I put my head on the windowsill to keep my head steady and noticed it move from a static position to a constant velocity for maybe 3 seconds and then stop with no acceleration/deceleration.

There was no sound. My friend and I looked at one another and did not speak...for nothing could be said to explain what we saw.

It was a flourescent green object similar to a glow-stick. The light appeared and traveled at a very high rate of speed about 30 feet over my head. It probably went 40 to 50 feet from my right to left. The light then just vanished. I have no idea what it was. It was too close to ground to be a meteor crossing the sky. It seemed as if it were just above the tree tops. I could clearly see the outline of the object to be a small cigar shape.", "Monstrous round silent UFOI&apos;ve never talked about this with anyone but the people who were there because I doubted anyone would believe me.  The thing I remember most about this event was that - for something so stupefyingly amazing - I don&apos;t remember a lot about this event, and none of us talked much about it afterward. This happened when I was in high school and I don&apos;t know the exact year, but it would have been approx 1982 or 1983.  Four of my friends and I were in the desert north of Phoenix in a very rural area where it was pitch dark except for the stars and the light of our fire.  We had been there long enough to build a camp fire and at the time the sighting occurred we had not consumed more than one beer each. At some point we all noticed something looming in the distance, coming very, very slowly towards us.  The only way I can describe its size is monstrous.  It was way bigger than a house, or even a couple of houses.  It was virtually silent for its size - I do remember a sort of low humming sound.  There were definitely lights on it, but I don&apos;t remember how many; I seem to recall that it had lots of little lights on it.  We couldn&apos;t see into it; I don&apos;t remember seeing &quot;windows&quot; in the craft.  It was definitely round in shape, but it is possible that part of it was &quot;cut out&quot; - I don&apos;t remember. It moved directly over top of our group at an extremely slow rate of speed.  I remember feeling a sense of awe, stunned and amazed, but very calm.  We all were.  No one was hopping up and down and going crazy with excitement, like one might think you would in such a weird circumstance.  We just watched it go over.  I &quot;think&quot; I remember seeing it disappear behind a mountain. The next day, I remember the radio station KUPD had a few people call in and they were talking about a UFO sighting in the same area (approx 7th Street and Union Hills Drive).  But the weirdest thing is, none of my friends who were there, none of us talked about it much.  It might as well have been like we&apos;d seen a kite flying.  No big deal. About 10 years ago I had the chance to talk to one of my friends who was there, who ended up marrying the boyfriend she was with and who was there that night.  I asked her if she remembered it and she said she did.  I asked her to ask her husband if he remembered it, and she did that while we were on the phone, and he said he did.  But again, it was like &quot;no big deal.&quot;  I know what I saw, and I know we all saw the same thing.  I wouldn&apos;t expect anyone to believe it unless they&apos;d seen it for theirself.  I&apos;ve always thought that maybe whatever was inside of it had a way to make our reaction to it numbed or dulled, because aside from seeing it, the most fascinating part of the experience for me has been that we didn&apos;t alert the media or that every time we got together that wasn&apos;t all that we could talk about. I fact, we never talked about it except that one time I mentioned above when I asked my friend and her husband if I remembered it correctly - that was probably 8 years after the fact.  I&apos;ve always kind of wondered if we lost time and just didn&apos;t realize it, but I simply don&apos;t know. That&apos;s all I know.  I wish I could remember more details.  I&apos;ve never seen anything like it since, and I had never seen anything like it before, but I wouldn&apos;t mind seeing it again!  I don&apos;t remember if the thing left a trail.  I don&apos;t remember there being an aura or haze around it - it seemed crystal clear.  It was dark brown or black, hard to tell.  It was matte, not shiny.  I can&apos;t remember if the lights on it were blinking at all and I can&apos;t remember if there were colored lights, just remember white lights.  Our vehicles were turned off, so I don&apos;t know if there were electrical or magnetic effects. I just watched the Peter Jennings special and that is what inspired me to come to this web site, to see if maybe someone else had seen it and reported it here.  Like I said, I&apos;ve never talked about it to anyone other than the people who were there, for fear of being sent directly to the nuthouse. :)((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

We obseverved them swaying , than coming to a complete stop, only for them to race off faster than the eye could see. No sooner had the objects left from our sight an airforce jet, soon raced to the area, that gave us releif in knowing that we we did observe this and it had to show on readar for the jet to arrive so soon.

It was early dusk with clear skies.Looking west I saw two bright white lights maybe two miles distant approaching at approx. 40 to 50 mph as they cleared nearby hills(3400&apos;) by about 200 to 300&apos;. At about 1/2 mile each light resolved itself into 3 smaller white lights located at the vertices of perfect equilateral triangles. The two craft kept approaching directly towards my position with the one on right side leading by 100ft and about 100ft separation to the other.  Both were absolutely silent and headed directly above me as they moved due east.  I watched intently when &quot;on a dime&quot; the lead craft suddenly stopped straight above me (at I guess anywhere from 700&apos; to 1200&apos; above). Looking straight up I saw the craft as a dull metallic triangles against the blue sky--I can&apos;t recall much else right then except maybe a central circular feature and the fact the other craft had proceeded east over a hill. I became increasingly nervous as it sat perched directly above. After about 30 seconds I panicked and ran down the hill (1 minute) to my truck parked in workyard.  Looking up it was still there and the other one was slowly rejoining it from the east. I jumped in truck and drove it across New Idria Road and up my driveway to my home (about 90 seconds), to find out that both craft were still just hovering there (in echelon as before). So I watched them in their silence. After a few minutes one of them headed slowly east over the hill again and minutes later returned again.  I went for my camera (35mm) to find no film--highly peeing me off-and I had no one to call (nearest neighbor 6 miles north).   returned outside to watch more of the same action (silent hovering with one and then the other every 5 to 10 minutes smoothly tracking east and then returning-in a sinister manner I recall thinking}.  I think I found binoculars but could not hold them steady to any advantage. I flipped them (the craft) off in my angst but quickly &quot;apoligized&quot; and started making arm motions &apos;to come on down&apos; and sit a spell--to no avail. It got dark and yet they were still there. I pulled out my flashlite to signal--it did not work nor did any others I could find (not unusual but I can&apos;t say I checked later to ascertain their real status). In the dark I could see and remember the white lights at the vertices. At one point I got a stiff neck and went in for a sandwich. Back outside--still there.  An hour or so after dark they finally glided off slowly(at max. 15 mph) in tandem due east.  It seems it was 10:30 pm or so then. They made me feel uneasy and it&apos;s strange but I cannot recall telling anyone about it (except maybe one friend-who can&apos;t recall) which just wasn&apos;t and isn&apos;t like me.  And I might have even forgotten all of this but for the fact that a year and two weeks later I had another sighting which I will report (here in NUFORC database) as September 12 of 1992. It was this later sighting that seemed to trigger my recall of this one. Both sightings were absolutely real but leave me very perplexed (esp as to not telling folks and even not recalling this sighting). I have no recollections of being abducted (though I&apos;m curious enough to want to try hypnosis) and it seems certain that this first sighting began a recurring &apos;nightmare&apos; of not being able to find light switches in dimly lit dreams of mine. Other details: My best estimate of craft size is 40 to 60&apos; on a side. Dull metallic silver hulls.

As we were leaving her house one evening, I glanced up into the night sky and was startled to see a formation of square-paneled amber lights in the shape of the number 7 gliding swiftly and silently across the night sky. I immediately said something to my friend to look up and tell me what that was, but it moved too quickly and she did not see it. I say it was shaped like the number 7, but I wonder if it was actually a triangular shaped object and the lit amber panels were making it appear to be in the shape of the number 7. However, there were also a couple of amber light panels in the middle left portion of the number 7, which makes it seem more like a distorted, backward capital F. I would say it was gliding at about the altitude of a small private plane, though it looked to be as big as a city block.", "UFOs amused by July 4th fireworks over Lincoln, NE?We were at a friend&apos;s home a few miles outside of the city limits of Lincoln, Nebraska.  We were looking out at the night sky (there were fireworks going off above the city out in front of us).  We then noticed a cluster of 5-7 lights high above us.  These were DEFINITELY NOT fireworks.  Nor were they stars.  And though I certainly could not completely rule out conventional aircraft, whatever were behind these lights moved (slow, hovering, basically in formation) unlike any conventional aircraft I&apos;m aware of.  They also seemed to be very large.  We watched them for a few minutes and then they were gone.

There was a total fire ban at the time due to the high risk of wildfires, so it was absolutely dark. Around 2:30 in the morning we were sitting around our picnic table in the dark, when suddenly we noticed a strange light in the southwestern sky that hadn&apos;t been there moments before. The light was white, and at first it was about as bright as the brightest stars in the sky. However, as we watched the light grew brighter and brighter, although it appeared relatively stationary over one point of the valley, quite high in the sky. Eventually the light was brighter than any star or planet could be. I don&apos;t think it was a helicopter, because we would have heard a helicopter in the still night, but this light made no noise. As we continued to watch the light, it would move up and down and side to side in the air, but not very much.  It also grew brighter and dimmer at intervals.  As we watched, the intense bright light faded again, and eventually vanished completely.  The sky in that area was dark again.  Moments later the light reappeared in the same spot, and soon it was shining brightly again. The way the light waxed and waned reminded me of watching a lighthouse from a distance, where the light gets brighter, then fades away, then reappears. We continued watching the light for about 45 minutes. In this time the light gradually moved away from us in a southwesterly direction.  We noticed that in addition to moving up and down and side to side, the light would appear to change shape, sometimes seeming to be two connected points of light, sometimes one large round point of light, sometimes a square shaped light.  The light would also seem to change colour - it was dominantly white, but sometimes seemed orange or green in colour.

They were moving pretty fast but not abnormally fast and in sync with one another.  The best way i could describe it is they were moving like butteflies move.  Almost &quot;dancing-like&quot;.  They were flying upward in a northeast direction.  Twice they moved towards each other almost touching and then right back away from each other.  All the while they kept flying in the northeast direction.  Finally they went behind a building so they were out of my line of sight.  I would guess that if I lived in the building they went behind (approx 20 blocks away) I would have seen them extremely close.  I couldnt believe what I saw and was speechless.

I should say that I&apos;m a college student who has studied Astronomy throughout high school and college, so I feel I&apos;m a pretty observant person. Last Saturday, February 19th, at around 2:35 PM, I was sitting at a traffic light when I just decided to look up at the sky since it was such a gorgeous day, not a cloud in sight whatsoever.  I looked over to my left, which would be looking north, when I noticed an object in the sky at about 45 degrees elevation to my line of sight.  It was greyish in color and cigar-shaped, and was traveling at quite a brisk pace; if I had to estimate the speed in relation to a car on the ground, I would say about 30 miles per hour.  If I had to estimate the size of the object, I would say it was about the diameter of a quarter if held at arm&apos;s length.  I would estimate the elevation to be 500 feet above the ground at the most.  If memory serves me right, this would make this a right isosceles triangle, meaning that the distance on the ground between myself and the object was about 500 feet.  I feel this is about right.  The object also seemed to be &quot;hazy&quot; - it would best be related to heat fog that one sees when looking down a tarmac road on a hot day. When I first noticed the object, it was traveling west, parallel to the direction my car was facing at the traffic light.  I was looking out to the north, and my car was facing the east.  I was intrigued by it because it was definitely not a helicopter, because it was flat, and did not have any rotar blades.  I see a lot of helicopters in this area, and even if they are as far away from me as this one was, I can hear noise, but this made no sound.  I got the impression that it was not way far away in the distance, but was close.  After watching it for several seconds, I looked ahead to see if the traffic light had changed, and upon seeing that it was still red, I looked back to where the object was traveling, where it should have been had it continued along the same path, only to find that it was gone.  Just gone.  Surprised, I looked around the sky intently, thinking that it might have changed direction.  I still could not find it, and I never saw it again. The object was traveling in the middle of the sky when I noticed it, and I only took my gaze away from it for 2 seconds, so I have no idea where it could have gone in that time if it really was just a plane or helicopter.  I spent the next 15 seconds before the traffic light changed looking all over the sky, just in case it had disappeared due to the sun&apos;s reflection, but I still could not find it.  I would argue this was possibly a conventional airplane, except I cannot get over the fact of how a conventional aircraft could disappear that fast.  There were no trees it could have disappeared behind, nor any cloud cover.", "Not planes satellites or space debri for sure!Went out onto deck for a smoke and started to star gaze.

(guessing that hight, because there was a plane on the horizont that was barely visable) There wasn&acute;t any noise, (the object was to far away anyways) and the object didn&acute;t leave any contrails.Imo it was travelling at a relativly high speed. it crossed the horizont in the 2-3 minutes we were watching, a plane (in my opinion) takes about the same time.((NUFORC Note:  The video is not very helpful in establishing what the object might be.

It was moving quickly at first, and then slowed down. It was pretty big and couldn&apos;t distinghuish it from any other aircraft I&apos;ve seen before. It was not a balloon, it did not fly erraticly like balloons do. It flew in a vetical, controled speed, and at the same altitude. It never floated higher as balloons do. Weird!!!

I was in the overlook at about 34.6801 north and 94.6325 west (visible at http://terraserver-usa.com/image.aspx?T=1&amp;S=10&amp;Z=15&amp;X=1752&amp;Y=19193&amp;W=1 ).

I was looking in a direction approximately parallel to the direction of the scenic overlook drive, south-southeast.  I was alone, and I know of no one else who saw this. While I was looking at the stars, I saw one, fairly high in the sky, start to move.  From my perspective, it appeared to move downward, toward the south-southeastern horizon.  It looked like all the other stars.  I saw no other movement, other than airplanes, in the sky.  I watched it for about 15 seconds, during which it moved from being fairly high in the sky to being fairly low, when it was hidden behind some clouds.  I had seen several meteors before I saw this star move.  The star moved too slowly to be a meteor and there was no trail behind it.  The only oddity about the star, other than the movement, was that it appeared to flicker or twinkle less than the others.  After it caught my attention, it appeared to be more solid than the other stars.  I could not see how far away it was or how quickly it was moving, except that it was on the other side of the clouds.  The sky around the star was clear until it moved behind clouds that were low in the sky.  While I was watching the star move, the sky was clear in its vicinity and I saw many other stars near it.  The apparent movement was not caused by movement of clouds.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))", "I was anywhere from 6 to eight years old when it happened.

It hovered overed the parking lot for about 5 min. and then began to move south east - we then caught up with the flying object and got out and looked at it, we heard no sound of a engine, or no smoke or any sign of a normal aircraft.

It then reached a point to where it stop getting higher. As we watched, one of the little balls of light broke off and fell then quickly disappered. Then after about 2 min. the whole thing disappered. It disappered for about 30 seconds then reappered. It sat in the sky for about 1 more min. then it just flickered away.

II could obtain the exact year from old friend who lived at address, but if anyone wants to check into it further it was on the first or second Day of the Winnipeg international air show. My Brother, a friend and myself were watching the air show from another friend&rsquo;s balcony. It was the top floor (14th?) facing east. I was on the balcony having a smoke and watching the &quot;Snow birds&quot; do there routine. They broke formation and one flew past the apartment (approx height and distance to follow). As it did I caught sight of what looked like a metal flake that came off the plane. (This was not in the area prior to the plane passing by)   After watching it for about 4 seconds it became very apparent to me that this was not a piece of the plane. It was round like a beach ball (refer to following beach ball description) 6 feet in diameter and very shiny. There was no light except for its metallic reflection. Picture one of those beach balls that is divided into 8 different colored sections, now remove 3 of them. The larger side (5 slices) was bright polished metallic in color. The 3 missing sections were just that, missing and you could see the inside of the shiny side, which appeared dimmer.I yelled for everyone to &quot;get out here and see this thing before its gone&quot; they came out expecting to see some part of the air show, but all had the same &quot;what the H@#l is that&quot; reaction I did. It was aprox 500&apos; or more off the ground (snow birds might be able to provide better distances) and about 1000-1500&apos; (3 or 4 residential blocks) away. It was very clear what we were seeing, the sky was blue, only a few nimbus clouds and a moderate wind (20 kmh? could check airport weather for exact info) It rotated consistently about 1 per second giving it a pulsating look. It remand fixed at that point in the sky for about 2 minutes, then began to move straight up over the course of 20 to 30 min (still rotating) completely unaffected by the air currents that day. We watched it until it was no longer visible. I would like to include here that myself and one of my friends both saw what looked like 2 specs (very high altitude approximately 5 min prior to losing sight) These specs moved very fast side by side formation from the SE to NW as they passed the &quot;ball&quot; they made some sporadic movements then continued NW and out of sight over the apartment we were in. (It is very possible that the specs were a trick of the eye from looking up at the blue for so long however we both saw them around the same time do similar motions)I am sure that more must have seen this as thousands were watching the air show that day and the plane I was watching would have led others to look in that direction not to mention the pilot himself might have seen it. I will include here the areas of the city I am referring to but If necessary can be removed. We were located in the ((apartment name deleted)) east phase ((floor deleted)) floor. The object would have been over Thompson Dr between Portage and Ness ave. (1 or 2 block radius but possible further out) The plane was moving in a NW to SE direction.

We were screaming the whole time (as teenage girls do) so I&apos;m not sure if any sound accompanied the light.  Unfortunately, as we were so frightened, we did not look out the window to locate the source of the light.  Finally, my father,  awoken from his sleep with our screaming, came to my bedroom.  We recounted the story.  He insisted it had something to do with the transformer that lies at the far edge of the lawn.  He went outside to investigate, and found nothing amiss with the transformer.  After this sighting, my friends and I experienced a few other similar sightings over the next few weeks, cultimating in a sighting (also late at night) where the lights appeared to be coming from the side of the house.  This time, they were so bright that a light that turns off at sunrise outside my house turned off.

I have not told this to many people because like me before the experience I would think myself weird so I know that is the way others will look at me as.", "Flying light over a feild on the way to work.There was a small light over a feild when we were driving to work. I told my friend that i keep seeing something and for him to pull over. We sat there looking at this little light moving all over the feild from being very low to very high in the air. Then out of no where it was just gone. Im not sure what it was. But we felt like it wanted to be seen.", "series of three red lights moving in a north to south direction, no noise, then disappeared.While driving north on a local street, I was crossing the intersection of west farms road, rear the manasquan resovoir, when a slow moving series of red lights (all part of same craft, I think, lights did not blink and were tight in configuration) moved slowly in a north to south direction. No noise could be heard. The craft passed by and then dissappeared as fast as it appeared. Altitude approx 800 to 1000ft. I watch the skies in this area quite a bit, and I know the flight patterns in the area for both commercial and small private planes. I can assure you, this was not your typical flight pattern, nor light configuration of any plane.", "Me and 3 of my close friends witnessed a strange event. We saw a large green fireball streak across the night sky and it traveled from east to west. It was very fast and very brightly lit. Whe observed the fireball for about a minute and then suddenly to our amazement, it exploded and formed into 3 white disk shaped craft. Then they just disappeared! We cannot believe what we just saw.

The light made an impossible turn to the south and dissapeared behind a cloud for about half a second, and then darted out at exactly the opposite direction, as if it had made a 180 degree turn on itself, instantly, it did this &quot;peekaboo&quot; thing twice before returning to its present south westard course and disapeared finally behind the clouds.", "Three flying saucers suddenly appeared  in the sky, hovered, darted forwarded, hovered, then disappeared.It was daylight, on a sunny day, blue sky.  Several were outside our work building, taking a break.  I do not remember the exact time nor the exact date.  I only know that it was in the early 1950s, and after seeing Peter Jennings program recently, I realize that it was probably 1952.  Three saucers appeared in the sky in the distance, northwest of where we were.  They hovered there momentarily, then moved very suddenly, very quickly, toward us.  The movement was much faster than any airplane or other known object could move.  They stopped, in the near distance, and hovered briefly, then just disappeared.  They were shaped like discs with a rounded dome in the center, and they were white.  We could not believe what we saw.  We all decided they must be something the military was exerimenting with.  Vandenburg Air Base is to the northwest of Wilmington, and we thought they must have come from there, but we also felt they could be genuine UFOs.  The incident has never been explained.  It just happened, and I saw it clearly.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))", "very large craft, moving at the speed of light, no sound, lots of lights, jet aircraft came to invesitgate.While camping in a remote area of western NC under crystal clear skies in mid February, my friends and I noticed a light moving erraticly in the heavens at what appeared to be great altitude. This light was &apos;brighter&apos; than and &apos;larger&apos; than the stars and moved in a stop and go fashion under no normal flight plan operation. The light seemd to cris cross the sky at great rates of speed and then began to descend closer to our location. We were surrounded by mountains in a secluded valley and the light went down behind a large ridge in the heart of the wilderness area and a glow appeared from behind the ridge and began to move from one end of the valley to the other. As we sat mesmerized, all of a sudden this very large craft making no sound rose up from the valley floor and was almost as large as the ridge itself. The light we had seen earlier in the sky was apparent that it was the underside of the craft and the craft was circled by many flashing and mulit colored lights. We could &apos;feel&apos; someone was inside and knew that we were there. This behemoth craft lingered for a moment and then shot skyward with no sound and moved as fast as one can think. Faster than our eyes could follow and all of this with absolutely no sound but a strange sort of vibration in our stomachs. We stood there in awe for a few seconds and then began to hear the rumble of something coming our way into our little secluded valley in the middle of a wilderness area. All of a sudden several jets appeared deep in the valley and directly over our camp so low we could see the lights on the wings quite clearly. We counted several jets but in rality this may have been only a couple making passes over our location. It was if the jets came to investigate what the larg craft was and I must tell you that there was absolutely no comparison in the kind of propulsions between the craft and the jets. The craft was in space again and we could see the same light moving somewhat erracticly and then was gone. The odd part of the story is that I had built a large fire and we noticed that it was burned down to ashes. The really odd part of the story is that we were supposed to continue backapcking for several more days and we simply left the next day never speaking of the incident in 4 hour drive home or for that matter remembering it. A few months later at an outside evening event several people were talking about UFO`s and suddenly my friend just burst out crying and yelling at everyone that they didnt know what they were talking about and that only he and myself and our third friend knew what was going on. It was at that moment that we all three had a sort of collective memory and began to relate to each other what took place that night and even remmbering not speaking about it until then. This event has caused great stress to all three of us for the past 25 years and is accomapnied by strange dreams and I have tried to report this to several investigators through the years only to get no response. I should think that if Federal jet aircarft left the ground that night in the deep south, probably from north Georgia, that somewhere there is a flight record of that event. I just want to know if you can help. It should be added that my friend and I are sort of aviation buffs and I can tell you that after many airshows and a wife in the air force that this craft was like nothing that we have available to us. Also at the risk of ridicule, a few months later the movie &apos;Close Encounters&apos; came out and we were all completely stunned at how close the final scene was to what we experienced that night. I just cant explain how large this thing was. Thank you.", "It could move very slowly or very quickly but either way it moved without making any noise.In 1965 I was 21 years old and worked for GE in Utica N.Y. in the radio receiver department.  I earned a two year degree in Electronic Technology after I graduated from high school in 1962 and went to work for GE.  Later I worked for AT&amp;T at a Microwave Relay Station.  AT&amp;T transfered me to a Satellite Earth Station where I worked for 17 more years.  I retired from AT&amp;T after 32 years service.  I have never smoked a cigarette, never did drugs, and I have never a had a beer in my life.  I have two daughters, one is an OBGYN doctor and the other is a speech pathologist.  They have had to listen to this account since they were old enough to understand it.  This is what happened, nothing has been added to make a better &quot;story&quot;!  What follows is the truth as I lived it.  It was Sunday night and I am not sure of the exact date.  I was returning to Utica, N.Y., where I lived, after a weekend home with my parents in the Loyalsock Creek area of Pennsylvania.  I had just purchased my new TR-4 car and was going north on Route 87 about 21:00 at night.  About an hour into the trip, I noticed some lights off to the right of the road.  I traveled this route many times and knew that the only thing in that direction was an empty field and what we call a mountain here in Pennsylvania.  The lights made me curious because they were red and green and flashing like the old railroad crossing once did.  The only difference was one side was green and the other was red.  If I had to describe the colors for someone, I would say they were &quot;Christmas Red and Green&quot;.  I slowed down and looked right and decided I had plenty of time so I would stop and satisfy my curiosity.  My first thought was that I was looking at someone working on the mountain side, maybe cutting lumber, but that didn&apos;t fit.  Next I thought it could be a helicoptor, but this was 1965 and we just didn&apos;t see that many of them.  I stopped my TR-4 in my lane of a two lane highway.  This was a very remote area at that time and I wasn&apos;t worried about traffic.  I looked at the lights and wondered just what this could be?  It was about 200 yards away from me and looked to be about 100 feet up the hill.  I shut off my car and let the headlights on so if that rare bit traffic would approach, they would be able to see me.  A Triumph is very small so I was able to reach over and roll down the window without getting out of the drivers seat.  I leaned over and put my arms on the open window and turned my head to hear what sound was coming from the lights.  No noise at all, except for the sounds of the October night.  I looked at the red and green flashing light and wondered just what was going on over on the hill.  I can&apos;t remember which side was green and which side was red.  As I sat in my car trying to figure out just what it was, that I was looking at, I became aware that it wasn&apos;t on the mountain side, like I first thought, but in front of the hill and above the field.  This soon became very clear to me because what I was looking at had started to move.  One thing people have the ability to do is determine if someing coming towards them is going to go left or right or directly at them.  The lights were coming directly at me at about 50 feet above the field.  I remember thinking &quot;Wow what is that&quot;, when I became aware of two very obvious conditions.  First, this thing was 50 feet up in the air and was moving very slowly directly towards me!  Second, it was completely silent!  No noise at all!  I remember thinking that nothing that size could be in the air and moving towards me without making any noise, it just isn&apos;t possible.  It was about 50 feet wide and 10 feet high, I would guess.  And I hate to say it because this is the point when people start walking away, but it was saucer shaped.  I watched it approach me until I realized that it was coming very slowly directly at me and it wasn&apos;t a blimp or helicoptor or plane or anything else that I have ever seen.  At that age we tend not to be afraid of anything and think that we are 10 feet tall and bullet proof.  It took a lot to get me afraid in those days.  At that point I started to think that I wasn&apos;t in a good spot since this thing was very slowly going to be right on top of me in a very short time.  Whatever I was watching was also watching me!  I decided to get out of there fast!  I rolled up the window and started up my TR-4 and put it in first gear and stepped on it!  I just had time to put it in second gear when I realized that there was, what I thought at the time, another one directly in front of me.  It was just off to the side of the road above the guard rail and about the height of a telephone pole.  I thought, there are two of them!  I quickly looked back to the center of the field to find the other one and it wasn&apos;t there.  I realized that the one I had been watching move so very slowly towards me had moved about 150 yards and came to a complete stop in about 3 seconds.  There it was with those red and green lights flashing and it was only about 50 feet above the road.  I looked back and forth again, yes it was the only one.  It couldn&apos;t have moved that far and that fast and been able to stop in 3 seconds.  It did all of that and never made a noise, complete silence!  All except one noise, my heart was beating so fast and hard that I could feel it in my throat.  I have never been that frightened in my life before or after that night.  My first thought was to hit the brakes and not drive under it.  It didn&apos;t take me long to figure out that if I hit the brakes and stopped I would end up parked directly under it.  I made a quick decision to shift to the next gear and drive under it.  I remember looking out my windshield at this metal object with the green and red flashing lights as I drove under it!  I drove the next few hours to Utica without looking into my rear view mirror!  I don&apos;t know if I was so frightened that it would be following me or if I had just been that shook up.  One thing was clear, for some reason I wasn&apos;t going to look into my rear view mirror for any reason and I didn&apos;t. I have a few regrets in my life, like most people, but the one that is at the top of my list is that I drove away.  I wish today that I would have gotten out of the car and waited for whatever it was to get to me, at least I would have known exactly what it was.  Very few months of my life have gone by that I didn&apos;t think about what it was and what happened that night.  I was within 50 feet of this object.  I had a really good look at it.  It wasn&apos;t a reflection from an airport 500 miles away.  It wasn&apos;t swamp gas!  It wasn&apos;t a star or the moon!  It was real and fast and silent and close.  And yes the one that makes me feel the worst is when someone looks at me and claims that I made it all up or that it was a dream that I remember or some other total nonsense.  Very strange isn&apos;t it, we both think that the other is talking total nonsence!  One thing is certain, nothing back then could do what that object did and nothing today can do it either.  And unless some government has had some really great technology that they have kept secret, it didn&apos;t come from earth.  Many years back I was having my yearly physical and at the end of it my doctor asked me if anything was bothering me or if I had any problems.  I looked at him and said yes I do have something that has bothered me all my life.  Out came the whole account of the events just as I have written here.  I asked the doctor if he could use some method to take me back to that night to find out if anything more had happened?  He asked me if I had trouble sleeping or working and if I was happy?  I said no and everything was great.  He said that&apos;s the reason I won&apos;t do anything.  It could only harm you.  He said &quot;I believe every word that you have just told me and I wouldn&apos;t tell anybody what you have just told me&quot;.  I didn&apos;t speak about it for many years but I am 60 years old now and I just have this feeling that I would like someone else to know the secret that I am convinced of.  I hope I don&apos;t end up wishing I had followed the doctors advice.  A lot of people wonder if something very strange is going on, it is!  The problem is, there are so many nut cases out there that nobody believes it when they hear the real thing.  When I think about it, what a wonderful way to cover up what is going on, just keep putting out stupid accounts or faked pictures and movies and soon nobody will believe the truth when they hear it.(NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

I could see no navgational lights on the craft. When I first spotted the object it was directly South of our house. When it got to about 15 degrees above the horizon, from my vantage point, it disappeared, as it entered the shadow of the earth. So it was reflecting light from the sun and was very shiny.

Then seemingly out of know where a second red light appeared directly below the origonal. Slowly this second light started decending towards earth. I watched it go down untill it was behind the mountains. I looked back up and there was another one decending in the same way as the first.

I saw a peculiar object hovering over the water with lights shining down and what appeared to be some sort of &quot;probes&quot; reaching into the water below.  I was stunned and just stood there wondering if my eyes were deceiving me.  I then saw the hovering object pull in the &quot;probes&quot; and ascend back up to what appeared to be a larger hovering object up above, higher in the air.

I believe it was a Sunday afternoon.I was in between sets weight lifting sets and I staring out the window.  As I looked up, I noticed saw a small airplane (propeller) crossing the sky.  I was facing south west and the sun was going behind some buildings.  It was a clear day.  Few clouds.  As I was watching the small plane fly over (it was headed NW), I noticed what looked like one of those small mylar balloons pass between my view and the low flying plane.  I got up from my weight machine and walked over to the window to get a better look.  What was strange was that it was difficult to focus in on.  They seemed out of focus to me.  I could see that there was something there but I had a hard time keeping my eye on it.  But I kept staring at it expecting it to move with whatever way the wind was blowing.  But it didn&apos;t move in any particular direction.  It simply seemed to float around a very small area in the sky.  I don&apos;t think one of those silver mylar baloons would do that.  They would probably float away.  But this &quot;orb&quot; did not. I thought it was reflecting light but I think it was somewhat &quot;bright&quot;.  Here is the weird part.  Once I got used to looking at it, all of a sudden other orbs &quot;popped&quot; out at me.  They all seemed to be floating around each other.  They didn&apos;t cross paths or move over each other, but they did seem to waver around a bit.  They were all shiny and somewhat &quot;bright&quot;.  I&apos;ve since thought about it and realized that the setting sun might have had something to do with why they &quot;popped&quot; out into my view.  I think increased infrared light from the lowering sun has something to do with being able to &quot;see&quot; them.

I wish I remembered more about how old I was and the year, but my guess is I was between 8 and 12 years old, which would make it between 1958 and 1962. What makes it different is that my sighting was during the day and the craft was on the ground. I was climbing a tree in a neighbor&apos;s yard. The land sloped downhill from where I was. From that high vantage point, I could see across a forest that was intersected by a meandering power line that was probably 1/4 to 1/3 mi away from me as the crow flies. There were two sets of lines, and there on the ground was a saucer-shaped disk with a dome on top. The craft appeared to span most of the distance between the stantions so I would guess it might have been 50 feet across. It was a sunny afternoon and the sun reflected off the craft, but it was not polished and shiny-I would describe it as looking like brushed aluminum. I could not tell--or I don&apos;t remember--whether it had windows or portholes. The object was not moving at all. After looking at it in amazement for several minutes, I ran home to get my mother. I tried to convince her to come and see what I had seen, but once she learned it involved climbing a tree, she would not come with me. I returned to the tree on my own and sure enough the object was still there. I do not know why I didn&apos;t try to get someone else to pay attention or to see it.  The site would not have been visible from the road and we would have had to hike the power line. The line ran roughly parallel to the road I was on and bisected a road at a right angle to ours. My mother did not drive and it would have been a long walk for me, and a scary one. That argues that perhaps I was closer to age 8 than 12. Later at dinner, I told the entire family about it. My father said it was probably a utility truck working on the lines. I remember feeling very hurt that nobody would believe me, and insistant about what I had seen. My grandmother was there, probably to baby-sit that evening, and I asked her if we could go to the library and get some books. I do not recall ever seeing any movies or comic books about UFO&apos;s before that, but I must have been vaguely aware they were being talked about. From that point on, I devoured everything I could find on the subject. This has haunted me my entire life. This was not a mysterious light in the sky, but a solid object seen in broad daylight.

PD))  EXPLANATION:   All the many refineries surrounding the area have these enormous &quot;flares&quot; that rise as high as sky scrapers.  Unfortunately, the oil refineries like to burn off  or &quot;flare&quot; various gases (some very noxious) at night when there is less chance of them being reported for doing so.  Many of the flares run steady all day/night long but can increase or decrease in volume of flame emitted.  Under certain atmospheric conditions, i.e., low lying clouds on somewhat still and foggy nights, MANY people report seeing orange pillar shaped UFOs. Our local news stations have run these stories several times in the past to try to educate people, especially those who live to the southeast side of the city.  The orange flame colored light from the flare is seen to be projected in pillar like fashion vertically and can even look as though it is going up and through the low lying clouds that hang along this coastal region.  Many times people will report seeing this some distance away from the refineries.", "No sound, Two search lights spotting the ground, moved slowly 10 ft. above the ground.A friend and I were snowmobiling at night in the national forest when our old Snow King stalled out. While trying to pull start it we observed a star in the sky which would become very bright and then dim again. After about a minute of watching this odd star it dimmed out and dissappeared.I got the machine started and we rode back towards home through the forest. As we reached the opposite side of the ballbark that we were crossing our machine quit again, no surprise.From the other side of the field which was about 300 yards away the saucer shaped craft came up over the trees and proceeded to cross the field at an angle about 10 feet above the ground. It was silent, about the size of a large truck and had a ring of lights around the bottom. It also had two search lights which were also on the bottom spotting the ground independent of each other in the direction it was headed.  I would say that we were about 40 yards away at the closeest point. My friend kept repeating that she was  about to faint. I could not beleive I was actually witnessing a flying object.The object proceeded to the opposite tree line and went up and over and it was gone.  Of course when we got back to the house since we were taking turns on the snowmobile everyone just laughed at us, but we knew what we saw.The next day we ran to the library and checked out some books with photos of UFO&apos;s.

I also realize that estimating altitude is unlikely to be very accurate, when you get past a few hundred feet because of the given unknown size involved-even with tall trees for a background. However because I have a further reference to a similar object much closer at around 200 feet, using the length of my side yard as a close comparison. the first sighting would be close to 1000 feet because it was five times smaller in relative size.

In comparison to most obervations of spacecraft in orbit, which I have observed, much faster say within 2-3 seconds it was gone from sight.The size of the light was about the same as most earth objects in orbit which I have seen over the years.

It had almost a dull greyish-white neon appearance to it, and at the very bottom was a brighter white light.  I would have to guesstimate that this shaft was approximately 1 block long. The shaft of light appeared to not have a large circumference to it. I thought at first it must have been some sort of hose with this light on the end of it. I thought is this thing a Stealth and these pilots are just jacking around? But from the way the lights appeared, the V was much wider then the Stealth appears. I was a few miles away from it.

I saw what I saw as clear as the laptop i am looking at right now. Absolutely no mystery to me. I could care less if people believe me but after seeing you i thought a valid sighting was worth recording with someone. I don&apos;t tell anyone about it because they would think me odd. My name is       . I am a 41 yr old business owner now living in Santa Barbara, CA. In October of 1993 Orange Couty CA was ravaged by fires.Hundreds of homes in Laguna Beach CA burned to the ground. 400 approx. Hundreds of other homes burned in the area as well. Orange County was on fire. I mention this because it seems a rather significant event that may have caused some interest to something. We owned a wonderful oceanview home in the exclusive gated community of Emerald Bay. Our home burned down that month, October 23rd I recall. With all we had left being a lot full of ash we would come from our rented home to walk on the beautiful private beach of Emerald Bay. On approx Dec 15, 1993 there had been light rains that day and the clouds were light, and very high, but mostly it was clear. We were walking down the beach for about 15 minutes towards the north. The bay is about one mile long from end to end. When we walked to the North end we turned around and walked back to the center to watch the sun go down. The visibility was fantastic, we could clearly see the Island of Catalina and beyond. After the sun actually set over the horizon we got up and started to walk back towards our car when I looked strait out, over the ocean, to the south of Catalina perhaps 15-20 degrees up from the ocean horizon. We witnessed an object in the air that had the sun still reflecting off it. No blinking light. It looked round or oval, i think metalic in it&apos;s reflection.  At first it just stayed there, for about 3 or 4 seconds.  We both thought, plane, and were about to look away. It seemed like a far away plane was having the sun reflecting off it. Just before looking away the darn thing shot off at an extreme angle and stopped! This thing moved so fast all we saw was a blur. It stayed in that position for maybe 2 seconds and shot off again at an extreme angle to another position. OK, now it had our ATTENTION. I looked at my wife and said &quot;Does anything we have move like that?&quot;. We watched this thing for about 40 seconds or so. It did about 7 angled moves before shooting off again at an extreme angle only to not be seen again. It appeared to be farther out than Catalina, more than 20 miles out at least. I am an extremely skeptical person. Nothing I know of could move like that, take the g forces. That is my story for what it is worth. I will say this. I absolutely believe that object was not of this earth, I saw it, would swear by it, take a polygraph, etc. I also definately believe in what I saw. I only wish I could have filmed it. Can anyone tell me what can move like that? Since this time I have become an amateur astronomer and though I know I will probably never see something like this again I have become very interested in all subjects having to do with our universe.

They looked like a satellite one would see on clear stary night, but a bit brighter. They would probably be mistaken for satellites, except they moved in exact formation. We spotted them to the North and they moved South, SouthEast. They moved a bit faster than a satellite would. We saw them for about 20 seconds. Some personal observations:  They certainly could have been satellites, but I know of no satellites that fly in formation (again, both my wife and I notice specifically that they moved together without the slightest separation, at least that can be seen with the nake eye.)  Though its hard to explain, you could see that the objects were a great distance just by the look of the lights. The only thing I wish I would have taken note of at the time was whether any stars were visible inbetween the lights, thus indicating some sort of solid object. More than anything, I would like to know if there is a reasonable explanation. If there is someone who knows what this might be, or if this a common occurance. Of course the other interesting thing was that it was on the fourth of July.((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of the U. S. Navy &quot;NOSS&quot; satellites, which orbit in formation?

It usually changes colors and flickers; however it was more blinking that night.  Vivid shades of green, blue, red, amber and yellow were quite visible.  It was about 20-25 degrees above the horizon and very bright that night.At around 7:30pm PST, we were standing on our front porch (facing North) looking at the night sky when we first noticed something strange.  It appeared two red orbs, very small and very far away, almost &quot;spewed&quot; from the Sirius star. (This isn&rsquo;t actually what prompted me to file this report.) We watched them move very similar to a plane at first, slowly making their way across the sky. The biggest difference was that the lights weren&rsquo;t blinking and there was only that red glowing light. It was a bright magenta, though it appeared very far away.We first witnessed one shoot off to the left (West) and take about 45 seconds to move what seemed like a mile or so. It then suddenly appeared to stop in the air, then disappear seconds later. We weren&rsquo;t sure what to think of it and decided to get a 2nd opinion. We called my wife&rsquo;s mother who happened to be out driving on Cook Road (country road about 5 miles away to the Northeast) and asked if she had seen anything. She said no. At this time, we started to witness another red orb that looked exactly like the first, but this time it shot off to the right (East). We asked if she could see it as well and she confirmed it.  It acted very similar to the first one, moving a mile or away from Sirius, then stopping and disappearing. Somewhat stunned and excited, we decided to grab my camera and be ready for the next time. About 10 minutes later my wife&rsquo;s mother arrived at our house. We talked about what we had seen and decided to keep an eye on it through the front bay window. (It was a cold night so being outside for hours at a time was difficult.) Over the next 45min I ventured in and out; keeping an eye to the sky whenever we weren&rsquo;t talking. What happened next is what not only prompted me too make this report, but turned my previously skeptical wife into a believer.I had also called my father since he&rsquo;s always been interested in UFOs and the paranormal. (He&rsquo;s also a very smart man. PhD in Psychology licensed Shiatsu therapist, LMT, etc.) While standing just off our front porch in the front walkway and talking to him about the night&rsquo;s events, I noticed two very clear amber/orange lights moving rather quickly towards us from the North-Northeast; also seeming originating from Sirus. I had been watching the sky the whole time and didn&rsquo;t see it come up over the foothill. It appeared from nowhere. At first I dismissed it as a plane, but as it came rapidly closer, I realized there were no wings. I yelled for my wife and mother-in-law to come look. By the time they arrived at my side, the object had moved drastically closer. It now appeared to be maybe a mile away from us at the most. It had only been maybe 10 seconds since I first saw it from what seemed like 20-30 miles away. All three of us just stared up in awe. Within 2-3 seconds, it passed almost above our heads (maybe a few blocks away) at a surprisingly low altitude (couple hundred feet). We got a pretty good look at it&hellip; it was cigar shaped with no wings or tailfin or anything. We couldn&rsquo;t make out the surface, although it looked very dark. There were two lights on it (the amber/orange ones I had seen) that appeared to be on the bottom, plus a dimmer and smaller red light, similar to the orbs we had seen earlier. They lit up the area directly underneath them; apparent by the treetops. The surface of the object didn&rsquo;t appear to be reflecting the light back at all &ndash; it reminded me of a street light color and beam. A kind of floodlight, but controlled. There were two very distinct things that stuck out in all of our minds. This object was moving *FAST* at first (appearing to travel 20 miles or so in 10-15 seconds), but then slowed down when closer to us, then speeding up again as it went away. The other thing that really surprised us was the lack of sound. It was dead silent. No wind noise, no motor, nothing. It was shooting across the sky at easily 80-90 miles an hour without making a peep! The fact that it appeared so close to us added to the confusion.. We watched it as it flew overhead and eventually out of sight (to the South-Southeast). The time frame from when I first saw it appear to when we couldn&rsquo;t see the lights anymore was about 30 seconds. We started trying to rationalize what it was. Plane? Nope &ndash; no wings or sound. Helicopter? Looked like it *could* of been, though again it was completely silent, plus we never saw the blades or tail light. It was a night we&rsquo;ll remember for years to come if not for the rest of our lives!

After visiting the town of Rachel, we proceeded to the famous mailbox, I forget which farm it is at. We were at least hoping to enjoy a desert sunset and evening and perhaps were hoping to maybe see something unusual. Between 2100 and 2200 local time we witnessed an amazing display of agility by a light maneouvering over the first ridge between the mailbox and Groom Lake. It was about as bright as the planet Venus is in the night sky. It would shoot up above the peaks and then flutter down like a feather. We were impressed when it then starting moving extremely rapidly and stopping from one end of the ridge to the other. It appeared to be covering a few miles in a matter of seconds. What was striking was the agility of this object. Perhaps moving several hundreds of miles per hour and then reversing direction in literally the blink of an eye. The craft would disappear behind the ridge often, for several minutes at a time and then reappear.

It was slightly (5 degrees maybe?) to the right of straight ahead of the car and maybe a few degrees above horizontal, meaning that I could easily look at it with only a tiny eye movement from where my eyes would be normally while driving. I dont know how to estimate the distance because I dont know the size of the object but if it had been a commercial jet I would have guessed that it was several miles away. If I held my arm straight out this object would have looked the size of, or smaller than my thumbnail. It was silver in color. The shape was indeterminate and I could not make out wings, a tail section or any features for that matter.What first caused me to be particularly curious about it was that it didnt seem to be moving. Everytime I glanced up at it it appeared to be in the same place. Had it been a plane it would have been slowly making its way across the sky but it didnt seem to be doing that. So I continued to look at it for another minute or two while driving. Then, it began to change color, to darken to a grey and then a dark grey. This took about 3 seconds. Then, right as I was looking at it, I could no longer see it at all. It had kind of faded away quickly. I pulled my car over and got out so that I could see clearly and there was nothing there but blue sky. I looked carefully around the area of the sky where I had seen it thinking that perhaps it had moved and I&apos;d lost track of it but I could never re-aquire it. Peter, I dont know why I didnt report this nearer the time it happened. Maybe it was just too vague an experience. Anyway, there it is. I hope it can add to your data.

They had no markings, perfectly metallic with a parting line on the center circumference, purplish color on the bottom and silver on the top, about the length of a 727.  We quickly ruled out earthly origin.  They stopped above the platform, then without turning, went southeast about 1/4 mile, hovered, reversed and came back to a stationary position above the platform.   During this time, Navy frogmen in wetsuits were attempting to enter a rubber raft at the base of the platform but after seeing the craft, they climbed back up the ladder of the platform and re-entered.  In about two seconds, the craft &apos;bulleted&apos; away at about a 45 degree angle back toward the same southerly approach direction and were invisible.   A few seconds later, two phantom jets, apparently from Tyndal AFB in Panama City, roared at about 100&apos; over our boat and &quot;chased&quot; the craft at the direction and angle of ascent as the craft had departed.

I was sitting in the very last row, right hand side, window seat. We had entered USA airspace, and according to the monitors mounted in the passenger section we were between 11000-12000 feet altitude, descending towards DC. I was looking down, taking in the view (I&apos;ve loved the window seat since a child). There were broken clouds below, perhaps 8000-10000 feet in altitude. I could see water and patches of land between the clouds. Suddenly, below the airplane, appeared a white disk. I was looking right down on it. It was travelling perpendicular to our direction of flight. It was clearly between the plane and the clouds. I would estimate that it was less than 500 feet below my vantage point. It was chalky white and had the appearance of an Alka-seltzer tablet. There were no markings that I could see, but I did notice two dark lines that came in from its outer edge to about a quarter of the way towards its center. The central portion was raised. It was moving very fast and did not appear interested in our plane. It&apos;s difficult to say how large it was, but as I&apos;ve flown hundreds of times and have seen many other aircraft while in the air, I&apos;d have to say that it was no more than fifty feet in diameter, and perhaps less. It was unlike anything I&apos;ve ever seen before. Quite remarkable. No wings, exhaust, windows, markings, or lights.

My parents were taking me to a basketball game approx, 4 miles from home, 4 of us in vehicle...me I am not sure whom was sitting where anymore, other than father driving....I think I was sitting in the backseat with my brother, and my mother on passenger side front? Well anyhow about a mile and 1/2 into drive a &quot;star&quot; caught my eye....at first I thought it was only that, as sun just barely beginning to set, and we were heading east....this road we were on is called &quot;V-Highway&quot; and within sight from the hill we had just crested, and this vantage point, you can see the turn off to George Washington Carver Natioanl Monument. WELL I noticed that the first &quot;star&quot; of the evening was moving. I watched more, and at that time saw 3 other lights. One was on the left hand side of the road from my viewpoint, the other 3 were on the right hand side of the road...and seemed to be quite some distance off, I felt beyond the little town of Diamond which would have been 2 1/2 miles at beginning of sighting, and 1 1/2 miles when sighting over. Well as I was studying this group of lights and could tell that they were all moving, my second thought was airplanes or helicopters....UNTIL they began to do things, that were just not earthly possible, by any known aircraft made by man NOW let along then. The &quot;light&quot; on left moving oddly....but very slowly compared to the 3 on the right....I am not sure how to describe their movement? Like tadpoles in a pond?...or maybe sperm under a microscope?  Very abrupt movement....very darting, very fast, but as well would stop, and not appear to be moving at all....then even more quickly than they appeared &quot;they disappeared&quot; in the blink of an eye. It was as if you snapped your fingers, and before you even hear the sound....they &quot;the lights&quot; were gone.  I recall seeing a slight tracer, for a brief instant, heading away from the earth, not towards it. Whole thing I doubted lasted much more than 3 mins, maybe even less...probably so, as distance of sighting only about a mile. I know there were 4 other eyewitnesses that I know of....one was my Mom, but unfortunately she does not recollect it. Well when I got to ballgame, of course I told all my good buddies about it as soon as I got there...well as I was telling them about it, one of them piped up and said &quot;Me and my Mom saw those lights too!&quot; They very respected family at the time in Diamond (have since moved), and loved by all....so was happy to hear him say that...so no one thought I was making it up or anything. I have been telling people about this for over 20 years now....I am beginning to think &quot;now&quot; I am the only one that remembers the lights.  My friend, the last time I talked to him...seemed to have forgotten.  I sent him an e-mail after the &quot;Seeing is Believing&quot; episode...and asked him again, if could remember that....and as well to ask his mother if she remembered seeing them still yet today.  To me it was AMAZING, and I will never forget it so long as I live. I have another tale to tale, although &quot;not my own&quot; ....it is my mothers. When my Grandmother died....my Mom woke up and looked at the clock, it was the exact time of my Grandmothers passing. My mother has described to me a dream she had that night many times, before he waking, and looking at the clock. She said she was in a white room, with Grandma.....and others around but she could only sense them,  but not see them,  only my Grandma.  She still describes yet today, what sounds to me like some sort of &quot;time travel&quot; or &quot;travel into another dimension?&quot; and travelling at a high rate of speed, when all of a sudden a voice came to her....and told her it was her time to go, and she said he final good-bye to her Mom...and she woke up, and looked at the clock.  She can tell you about that dream yet today....as if it happened yesterday. That would have been 1980  I have had other strange things happen in my life....but not sure if UFO related  I had what I understand to be a &quot;night-terror&quot; at maybe age of 13?   Woke up scared to death...screaming, but unable to scream...in a cold sweat, and unable to move. Years later I was only one at home in family&apos;s house...and woke up feeling as if &quot;someone is watching me&quot;  Like woke up for whatever reason, and trying to go back to sleep, and 1/2 asleep....then it &quot;hit me&quot; , that feeling...&quot;I am being watched&quot;  I rolled on my back, and made myself open my eyes....what I saw scared the Hell out of me!!!!  I would call it an &quot;apparition&quot; ...was no one I knew?  It seemed to be the Grim Reaper, without the sythe....was very shadowy, and appeared to be hooded...but very short, like alien descriptions.  I yelled at it, swang at it, and tried to get away from it....then in a brief second &quot;it&quot; was gone.  Well as it was there was a tree near the window, and I dismissed &quot;it&quot; as a shadow, or at least tried to. But honestly I have never seen a shadow make a figure standing above you, nor ever again, or before has a shadow woken me up...with the feeling as if I was being watched? As well in order to calm myself down after the incident, I got our faithful frind and Rottweiler to come in my room and sleep there with me. She was very hesitant to enter the room, and entered with head bowed down...very unlike her   I would be interested in having a paranormal investigator contacting me.....too many weird unexplainable things I have seen and experienced....and I know others in same time frame that had weird encounters as well.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that dates of sightings are approximate.

Being a Commercial Pilot I am always drawn to watch them fly over. As I was watching the jet a object to the jets left caught my eye.  By the way I have 20/15 in one eye and 20/20 in the other.  This object was circular in shape and appeared to be at least 500 ft to 2000 ft AGL depending on its size, which was hard to to determine. If it was 500ft it was around the size of a washing machine, if it was 2000 ft it was around the size of a truck or van.  It was a color between orange and gold in color.  This single object was hovering above the hill behind my house.  It would move side to side, no more than three or four times its width to each side.  I thought, Ok, I am seeing a hawk at a high altitude flying around in a tight circle but it wasn&apos;t a circle it was side to side.  I thought to myself a hawk isn&apos;t round or gold nore can it fly side to side so what is that?  About that time T-0 to T+20 sec. at T-20 it stopped and was completely still and remained frozen hovering there from T-20 until T-40 in between that time I rubbed my eyes to make sure there wasn&apos;t something in them.  There wasn&apos;t because I noticed it was still there frozen in the sky.  It seemed to glisten once.  I had a tree and a hill as a reference point as I am aware of the fact that without them objects can appear to move.  Anyway from around T-40 to T-60sec it started moving back and forth again.  Then from T-60 to T-80 it stopped and was frozen hovering there again in the same spot as the previous times.  Sometime around T-80 it accelerated from velocity V-0mph to its full observed speed of what I later estimate conservatively 180mph within one second V-180mph.  So T-80 to T-81 and V-0 to V-180.  OK?  I watched it move and pass behind the tall tree behind the house that doesn&apos;t have any leaves so I could still see it and it went at the same speed and altitude over to another hill that is over a half a mile away and stop/hover.  When it stopped it seemed to slow from V-180 to V-0 at a slower rate than it accelerated not by much though but it was a noticeable difference, my guess is 2 or 3 seconds V 180 to V-0.  It flew from point A to point B in less than ten seconds which are the basis for my speed estimates.  T-80 through T-90.  If the object was higher than I estimate, then the distance and speed would be much more than I estimated.  Anyway it stopped over the second hill and hovered there for another 20 seconds T-90 to T-110.  Then it moved back and forth again ,T-110 to T-130sec, and stopped frozen hovering there for about ten seconds T-130 to T-140.  Around this time it flew pretty much dew south from point B with the same type of velocity as before V-0 to V whatever speed ( fast ! )in one second and went out of my sight over the horizon of hills to the south which took around 5 seconds so T-140 to T-145sec. The next day I called KBNA ATC and talked to the controler on duty the day before.  He was interested in my sighting but said that he hadn&apos;t noticed anything strange on radar that day.

I said to my co-workers, &quot;lets go over there and view the area were the event happened.&quot;  I was told you could not get in there because the millitary had closed the area off.  I thought it would make interresting reading in the local paper that evening but nothing was ever said about it.  So as a result folks kind of put it out of thier minds. However, later that spring, there were reports of a small strange being in the local paper dubbed &quot;the creature&quot; sighted and reported to the Millis and I think Dover Police by some High School students.  the drawings looked very much like our little friends that everybody sketches today. It has been a long time since this incident but I bet you could get more info from the town locals there. I would be more than happy to speak with any investigatore of this sort of thing.((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))", "The two objects left two vapor trails with 90 degree turns in them before they simply vanished.Around mid April, 1967, Myself, Father, Brother, Uncle, Brother In-Law, Cousin and his Wife were on a week long fishing trip to Lake Seminole, where we made camp about 300 yards below Chattahoochee Dam. The Apalachicola River runs free from the dam to the Gulf of Mexico. We were mainly fishing for bass. They lay their eggs in the rock bed below the dam in early summer and are easy to catch when they are on the bed. One particular day a storm was passing through in the afternoon and it was not until after dark when the storm began to break. Because most of the day had been wasted, we decided to do some night fishing. All of us loaded into two boats and we set anchor about 50 yards below the dam. We had been there about an hour, catching fish and having a good time. We were not under the influence of any drugs or alcohol. My cousin got everyone&apos;s attention and instructed us to look to the sky. We all thought it was lighting and turned our attention back to fishing when my cousin said &quot;no, keep looking&quot;. The following 5 or 10 minutes, I really was not aware of how long it lasted, was to be forever etched in my mind. I will tell you what I saw only  Even though everyone&apos;s account is basically the same, what I saw will be a first hand account, not what I heard from someone else. This is what I experienced. What appeared to be lighting was the glow of at least 2 objects very high in the night sky, partly obscured by clouds that remain from the storm. A few minutes later the sky was clear and the objects could be seen clearly. They would appear and disappear, stop and start instantly. Accelerate quickly to speeds unknown. Not knowing the altitudes makes it difficult to guess at the speeds. Near the end of the sighting there were just 2 objects moving in formation, precise formation. What appeared to be at about a 45 degree angle, they began to move downward in our direction. They looked like 2 meteors in slow motion, moving much slower than before. They were round, glowing bluish white with tails like meteors have. Very bright! Then simultaneously they began leaving vapor trails. Very large vapor trails, 4 times as large as known aircraft would make. Then, the unbelievable...a 90 degree turn, then another, taking the 2 objects back and away from us at which point they vanished, leaving the 2 identical vapor trails for the winds to disperse. The vapor trails remain visible for about 15 or 20 minutes. I would like very much to know if any other sightings were reported at that time. Others had to have seen what we saw that night in the month of April, 1967. Until someone can explain to me what we experienced, I will consider it a &quot;UFO Sighting&quot;. PS: I would appreciate you letting me know if anyone else saw these objects.", "Comet sighting PLUS!I&apos;m not sure of the date,  I went outside to watch the passing comet that was visible for over a week.  I forgot the name.  Anyway, I just finished dinner. There was a real brief thunderstorm that had just cleared up as the sun was going down.  I looked at the comet and was amazed at something more interesting! J Jst below the comet was this spectaculsr cloud formation that caught my eye! It was a huge cumulus cloud rising up like a cylinder! The colors were stunning! It was illuminated by the sun, there was a gold and red look to the whole sky! Just then I spotted about Five Gold Discs passing directly in front of the cloud! I was shocked as they moved in line formation from left to right! They were avoiding the large cloud1 The most curious thing was that as they circled the cloud the left flank end disc relocated from his position to the right wing! All the others stayed in formation! It was incredible! The went behind the cloud, but I never saw them again. I waited, but no sign. I called a site for reporting such events from the phone book, but no one was there.  It was a weekend. I never received any response from the message i left.I never saw anything like this before!

I never did submit it, but I&apos;m sending it to you now.  Editor:  Waterline  The article in last months Waterline about the Lake Michigan Triangle and UFO sightings along the lakefront caught my attention.  It brought to mind a boat ride I had taken years ago. It was 1968 and at that time I was working for a company called Tech Center in Morton Grove, Illinois.  Tech Center was a research and development house for the Armed Forces, the aerospace industry and NASA.  There was Tech Center equipment aboard the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo capsules, we had even designed and built our own satellites, O.A.O. II is still in orbit and operational to this day.  The people who worked at Tech Center would be considered geeks by today&rsquo;s standards, we all wore plastic pocket protectors and had slide rules (pre-calculator days) strapped to our belts.  But geeks or not, one thing we did know at Tech Center, was what the military did and didn&rsquo;t have in the nineteen sixty&rsquo;s. Back then I had a small Thompson cabin cruiser (remember the wooden boats with the lap strake hulls) and once every year I&rsquo;d take the guys from work out fishing.  That morning in 1968 we got an early start.  We pulled out of Diversey Harbor around 3:30 a.m. and started heading north.  It was still dark. An hour before sunrise we were trolling north, paralleling the shoreline, six miles out and twenty miles north of Chicago when the most extraordinary thing happened.  A craft flew directly over our heads.  I mean - RIGHT OVER OUR HEADS!  What first caught our attention was a mechanical humming sound behind us. All four of us in the boat simultaneously turned and looked above and behind to see what was causing it.  What we saw, was a craft in the air, 150 yards behind and slightly to port, perhaps 400 feet off the water and coming straight at us.  The craft was rapidly overtaking us, but at a very leisurely pace for an aircraft.  It was quiet, but loud enough to be heard (or perhaps felt) above the boats motor.  The craft didn&rsquo;t sound like an airplane.  It didn&rsquo;t whine like a jet, didn&rsquo;t thump like a helicopter and it sure didn&rsquo;t have propellers. What we saw had no wings, tail or struts.  It&rsquo;s fuselage was elliptical in shape with a blunted nose and tail.  It was large (but not huge), perhaps 150 feet long, 75 feet wide and 30 feet thick (like a skinny football which had been flattened out).  There were no windows or anything that resembled a cockpit.  The craft which appeared to be gray in color did not have any lights or visible markings.  It seemed to be dimly illuminated, or at least it was not as dark as the surrounding sky.  This may have been moonlight reflecting off the water. I remember feeling the great mass of the craft as it passed above us.  Although the craft was not large in dimensions, it just felt a lot bigger than it was.  I&rsquo;ve stood next to B52&rsquo;s, 747&rsquo;s and large Air Force cargo plans, all bigger aircraft, but without the same feeling of massiveness.  This thing above us felt as if it weighed hundreds of tons.  Although Spartan in appearance one sensed that this was some very serious machinery. This craft had come up behind us from the south-south-west and passed directly overhead at a height of no more than 400 feet.  Without pausing, changing speed or making any correction in course it just continued on a leisurely northward heading at a speed of about fifty miles per hour until it disappeared.  And that, was that. The four of us were just dumbfounded.  We watched it slowly disappear into the night sky, and then it was gone and we were just left staring at each other in silence.  The entire incident had lasted less than four minutes.  There wasn&rsquo;t one of us who could explain what we had just seen.  Remember, we were the four geeks from Tech Center.  My friend ((name deleted)) was the first to speak what we had all been thinking,  &quot;If there is such a thing as flying saucers, I think we just saw one.&quot;  No one argued with ((name deleted)).  Then we went back to fishing. Surprisingly, we never spoke afterwards about what happened that night. You would think that we would have, but we didn&rsquo;t.  I believe each of us had our own thoughts about what we had seen and we were all keeping those thoughts to ourselves.  To this day I&rsquo;ve only told the story to a very few people.  Believe what you will, or call me a nut job, I know what I saw that night.  It&rsquo;s been thirty five years now and even with all of our great modern technology I&rsquo;ve never seen anything like it before or since.", "A white ball of light being followed by something that took off at a speed I never knew existed.Im guessing on the time and date here.I felt I had to report this.I was at work taking my lunch break.I left the building and walked up the hill to the river which is right to our plant(missouri river).It was dark and the skies were clear as I stood on the top of the hill next to the river bank.I looked up at the sky and saw a roundish bright white ball traveling verticaly west at a speed faster then Ive ever seen anything move Ive seen shooting stars and this exceeded that by tenfold.It looked like something maybe was trying to follow it.Couldnt tell if it was an airplane or not.This went on for Id say 10 seconds when all of the sudden the white fire ball in front just went whoooooosh and moved forward so fast it just disappeared and left a trail of light behind it that disappeared a couple of seconds after it took off.I couldnt tell you what happened to the object that was following it.Ive never ever seen anything like it.After ward I was in shock there was an old man that was our security gaurd I asked him if he saw it and he was in shock also he could barely speak.The next day the omaha world herald printed some ((deleted)) story which I cant remember.However I do remember it not matching up to what WE saw.I apoligise if my dates are off I just didnt have the resources to report this at the time.This is were the missouri river devides Nebraska and Iowa.((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.

At about 4:30pm, I was lying on my bed, just looking up through my bedroom window (which has no blinds or shades), at the clear blue sky and a few puffy white clouds.  All of a sudden, I noticed TWO PINK TRIANGLES way up in the clouds.  I could not judge the distance, but it was very high...high enough for airplanes to fly, as I have seen many times before...but I knew these were not airplanes!  Continuing to watch the TWO PINK TRIANGLES as they moved in close proximity to each other...I was trying to figure out what they were.  I knew that they were not balloons...as they did not move with the wind...nor were they kites...which could easily be blown about as well.  These either stayed stationary, or they moved in unison to the left, then right, and then up.  Finally, they disappeared into the clouds.Immediately phoning my cousin in Darlington, PA to report what I had just witnessed, a short time later while still on the phone, I was astonished to see the TWO PINK TRIANGLES reappear in the sky.  I observed them again, for about 5 or 10 minutes, and then they disappeared into the clouds, never to be seen again.Having seen many programs on TV about UFO&apos;s, I knew that what I observed were very unusual.  Never before had I heard of a UFO described as a PINK TRIANGLE.  But I knew what I had seen was NOT an airplane, balloon, kite, or anything else I have ever seen before.  I felt in my gut that what I had seen was very definitely a UFO!  I am a Doctor of Chiropractic and I live and practice in Marietta, GA.  I have no history of hallucinations, nor of seeing UFO&apos;s.  My professional education has taught me to make objective observations of scientific evidence, and not to jump to conclusions until all the facts are in.  However, I am quite convinced that what I observed on April 24, 2004 were, in fact, TWO PINK TRIANGLES THAT COULD ONLY HAVE BEEN UFO&apos;s.", "Large fireball object passes quickly over Biscayne Bay, Miami, FloridaIt was nearly 11:00pm.

There were many UFO phenomena ocurring at the time there. This one night I stayed at an aunt&apos;s house and I remember just like it was now, it was ten-thirty p.m. my cousin and I were almost asleep  when we heard a humming sound.  My aunt yelled out for us to look, my bed was next to a window and when I looked out I saw this disc right on top of the windows location it was only aproximately three stories above the ground from us.  I saw it from underneath, it had many lights that made up a circle only not on the edge of the disc but in the center.  The lights were of different colors (red,green,and yellow but I can&apos;t say for sure which colors) some of the lights blinked in a timely fashion others wouldn&apos;t blink staying lit all the while.  We immeadiately went outside to get a better look but as soon as we got outside it immeadiately but slowly drifted away.My aunt and uncle tried photographing it as it was drifting away but solely I noticed that as they were photographing it there were invisible beams of light that were aiming at the camera.  These lights weren&apos;t visible, I noticed because I saw the lights reflect on the inside of the house (going through the windows and showing on walls of the inside of the house).

It was pre-dusk. I was about a mile away from the intersection when I noticed a strange looking cloud hanging low over the overpass. It was a grey, cloudy day but the cloud that caught my attention stood out from the background. It didn&rsquo;t look right, it looked too dense. Suddenly five strobe-like lights flashed from the cloud in a 1-2-3-4-5-5-4-3-2-1 horizontal pattern. It was over in a second. I immediately flashed my headlights five times and kept driving. I exited at the overpass and drove under the cloud and stopped. I looked up but couldn&apos;t see anything. Weeks later my husband said he was on his way home less than a mile from the overpass. It was just past sunset, a clear night. He said he saw what at first looked like a brightly lit semi trailer-truck cross Highway 24 in front of him. Except, it was about 30 feet up in the air.

I woke up to alot of commotion, voices. I could hear my mother and brother speaking very animatedly. I walked out to our kitchen, and they were standing out on the porch. I looked out of the porch door, which faces west. I saw a family we were friendly with (they lived one town north of us) standing on the porch with my mom and brother, they were all talking to each other in an excited manner. I was surprised to see this family on our porch so late at night. They were all looking up into the sky. I walked out of the door and noticed as I was looking west, towards Route 32, that there were cars all stopped along the road, including police cars, ambulances and firetrucks. Everyone was outside of their cars and looking up in the sky. As I stepped onto the porch and turned to look southward, towards the Rondout Creek, I saw a large object in the sky above us. It is difficult for me to remember now, as this happened 21 years ago, but I recall lights, and black space between the lights, and an edge that wasn&apos;t distinct. I thought &quot;That&apos;s got way more lights than a plane.&quot; The lights were colorful and &quot;pulse-ey&quot; ( not entirely pulsating, but with a pulsating quality )   Also, The size of it was enormous. It didn&apos;t make any noise, and it moved excrutiatingly slowly until it seemed to hover over the intersection of the Rondout Creek and Route 32. I could hear the family of friends that were with us telling my mom and brother that they had followed it, but I don&apos;t know from what direction they had followed it. The object began to move slowly northwards. Many people, including police and emergency personnel, jumped into their cars to follow it. My mom was eager for me to return to bed. The next day was a school day. That part always strikes me funny, because although I was very agitated about what I had seen, I didn&apos;t have any trouble going to sleep. The next day, at school I remember talking about it in class a few times, asking if other kids had seen or heard about it. Some had. I know that the next day The Kingston Daily Freeman reported a story about the sightings, because apparently they had started quite a bit south of us and continued up to the north, and alot of people were involved. Lots of policemen had made reports, along with other reputable citizens. However, the day after that The Kingston Daily Freeman reported that they had been told by military officials down in Newburgh that it had only been helicopters flying in formation. I remember thinking that that many helicopters would have made a huge amount of noise and wind. Everyone who was on my porch remarked about how quiet it was at the time we were watching it. A few years ago, we were at a gathering with the same family of friends who had stood out on our porch watching with us that evening. I said &quot; Hey, do you guys remember the UFO that everyone saw that time?&quot; They nodded, but no one remarked further and my mom seemed embarassed by my candor, so I didn&apos;t push the issue. Sometimes I wonder if it was a dream, but I know that the newspaper wrote about it twice after the fact, so I couldn&apos;t have just dreamt it.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

The system would not let me enter it.  This happened at 8:35 p.m. above a Hotel swimming pool, in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida.  I was there attending a NAMES Project seminar (AIDS memorial quilt) and the last class of the day had ended prior.  Everyone else in my group went out for the night, I opted to stay at the hotel, swim and eat.  It was evening and I was alone in the pool.  At the far end of the pool, was a bar with bartender and a man and woman having drinks.  They were the length of the pool plus some away from me, they were on stools, laughing and talking with their backs turned from me slightly.  They were under a canope and could not see the sky from where they sat.  I had done a few laps and was leaning up against the shallow end of the pool, looking up at the sky.  There were other hotels on either side of me.  If I looked directly up and a little to either side I could sky..until seeing the next tall hotel building.  Perhaps you are familiar with this strip of hotels along the beach. Anyway, I was leaning back against the back of the pool, relaxing and looking up.  Mind you, I don&apos;t drink and see well at night.  I need glasses for seeing up close at night, but I could see the stars just fine.  I noticed, suddenly, to my right (the direction of the beach)  there was were 3 &quot;stars&quot; moving in an exact triangle shape above my head.  TO describe their pattern it would be two on the left and one on the right... so that it made a triange shape.  I hope that makes sense.  I watched them move across above my head, slowly until the shape was directly over my head above.  I remember thinking &quot;my gosh, look at that.. and I looked down at the people at the end of the pool and looked back up again thinking.. if I stop and call them, I may miss this.  I want to see what this is...  Anyway, the triangle formation (the star looking objects) stopped then (it was almost as if I knew it was going to do this before it happened) the two stars on the left came together and touched briefly, made a slight spark and then went back into the original triangle shape.  Then slowly moved back off the right, the direction it originally came in.. until it disappeared over the hotel roof tops.  It was not a solid craft, but three distinct &quot;stars&quot; for want of a better word, that were travelling, slowly, in a triangle shape.  There was no sound associated with this at all. When I told my friends of this the next morning, they say &quot;ya, right ((name deleted)), were you wearing your glasses?&quot;. What I am wondering, is was there any other report of this being seen, in March in 1999 in that area?  I can&apos;t have been the only one looking up in the sky that night and seeing this..  What I didn&apos;t realize is how close Fort Lauderdale is to the Bermuda Triangle.  I hear things like this happen a lot in that area.

I had just gotten home from working the night shift as a security alarm monitoring station shift supervisor and was preparing to go to bed to rest up for my next shift when I heard the sound of a helicopter flying by at some distance from my building. As a lifelong aviation enthusiast who takes notice when any aircraft flies close by, I got out of my bed and went to the window to see if I could see the helicopter, which I did. It was a Bell Huey, flying from east to west along the north shore of Lake Ontario &ndash; which was approximately 2 kilometers from my location &ndash; at an altitude of roughly 800 to 1,000 meters at a speed I estimate to have been 80 to 100 knots. From what I could see, the helicopter was predominantly light, possibly white in colour, but I could not tell what subtype of Huey it was from my distance (eg., a UH-1D, UH-1H, UH-1N or Twin Huey). The weather conditions at the time were overcast (approximately 9-10ths to 10-10ths cloud cover) but reasonably bright, with the cloud ceiling at roughly 2,000 to 3,000 meters, and there was a brisk wind at ground level. As I watched the Huey fly along the lake, I caught some motion out of the corner of my left eye and looked up. There, just below the cloud deck, was a small, round, metallic-looking, &ldquo;discoid&rdquo; shape that very much resembled the head, or nub, straight pin, moving in a stable, straight line course almost directly south towards the lake. It was moving a good deal faster (speed roughly 200 - 300 knots) than the helicopter and looked to be about the size of a head of a pin when held ten or twelve centimeters in front of your face, so I&rsquo;d estimate it&rsquo;s size to have been eight to ten meters in diameter at the altitude it was flying at. It showed no irregular motion or changes in altitude or direction. But what was remarkable was the fact that the brisk wind &ndash; which I think was from the northwest &ndash; didn&rsquo;t seem to affect it&rsquo;s flightpath at all; it maintained a straight and steady bearing south to the lake without exhibiting any drift. At one point, it passed through a slightly lower bank of clouds and produced a straight line wake in the clouds that lasted no more than two seconds. When I looked away to the Huey for a second, which was continuing on it&apos;s own course, then looked back to the object, it was gone. The sighting lasted less than 10 seconds and it was absolutely astonishing. As I mentioned before, I have a lifelong interest in aviation and flying, and am fairly expert at identifying a wide variety of aircraft of all types from military to civilian, antique to modern. I am also an amateur astronomer and also have an interest in meteorology, so I am very familiar with what&rsquo;s in the sky on a daily basis. I cannot speculate on what it was because I could not identify it, but I can say that it was no conventional aircraft, helicopter, or balloon in any way, shape, or form, nor was it any celestial object such as a meteor or a weather-induced optical effect such as a &ldquo;sundog&rdquo; simply because the conditions did not exist to observe sundogs or anything similar. I don&rsquo;t know what it was, but I&rsquo;ve never seen anything like it.((initials deleted))  Whitby, Ontario((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

I travel HWY 84 every day to work and back and am very familiar with our night sky.  We have very few light sources and can see quite well on any given clear night.  A typical night&apos;s lights usually consist of lots of airplanes, cell and other various towers and scattered utility lights.  We also have some helicopter traffic from Ft. Knox.  They do maneuvers in the valley where my house is located.  They hover and will seemingly shoot straight up into the air.  The sound is sometimes ear shattering if they fly too low.  On the night of Feb. 15 I was returning from Louisville.  The night sky was relatively clear, but very black as it can get down this way.  I noticed a large bright light just over the canopy of the trees.  At first I thought it was a very bright star, again not unusual down this way.  The light became larger the closer I drove.  It was not distant like a star or the moon.  I came to the point of emission just past Union Band Church.  The light was bright white, a lozenge shape, and fixed, seemingly about a 1/4 mile in the air.  There was no noise, the wind was blowing, I felt my large vehile move.  The light had various spots of yellow and red on the outside edge.  I continued travelling and the light receeded out of my vision and became obstructed by the canopy of trees as I descended into the valley.  This may very well be a helicopter, of some sort.  I have never experienced one able to maneuver quite like this.  When a helicopter flies at night with a light that bright the viewer usually sees a beam the light creates.  This light was not a beam.  It seemed to have movement within the light.  Not pulses but movement like the way light moves within a static globe.  I just wanted to record this event before I lost part of the memory of its appearance in my mind.  Time does strange things to the way things look.  By the way,  I have searched the daytime area where this occured.  There are no cell towers on any of the ridges nearby.  I simply saw something I cannot rationally explain.", "I was cruisin south  on I45 between Conroe and Houston when i noticed two lights hovering near  the freeway.I was cruisin on I45 between conroe and houston around 8:30 when i noticed two lights hovering about 250 yards up over the freeway.At first i thought they were small aircrafts flying kinda low .then i started thinkin that after 911  there would be tighter restrictions with airplanes flying low in populated areas. The lights were moving  northeast  at a slow pace . first there were two lights  hovering around each other about 500 ft apart.They would move in close to each other and rotate in circles slowly.They did not make noise .The lights flashed and pulsed . It also had flashing colors on the sides.I could see the silohouete of the crafts. they were square in shape.As I rode down the interstate I was trying to register what  was seeing. As i came to Cypress Springs exit, the radio station i was listening to reported strange lights in Pasadena  and Galveston on 288 . They seemed pretty excited about it. I pulled over at a gas station off the exit and noticed other people looking up at the lights. I got off and was talking to some observers when three more lights started coming across the sky heading the same direction as the others . They were about 3 to 4 hundred yards from each other moving at the exact same speed. They wouuld seem to form  a sporadic formation. As I drove to my destination i noticed two more lights heading the same directions. They did the same thing just hovered near each other and moved slowly towards the others. They were the last lights that i saw that night.  all i can say is that i&apos;m not the only on that saw these lights, and i would like for next time to be able to share this experience with my family and friends.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We stopped the car to drop off our friend on 42nd and I street, across from the old Shortstop Cafe.  It was dusk. My brother and I looked up and saw a saucer-shaped object with a dome on top, about 100 feet in diameter, lights around the edges. It was probably 200 feet above the maple tree in our friend&apos;s yard.  My brother told my dad, who proceeded to yell to everyone in the neighborhood.  This was in the early 60&apos;s before air conditioning was prevalent, so many people had the solid exterior doors open and heard him through their screen doors. Most of the neighborhood reacted to my dad&apos;s yelling about seeing a flying saucer by coming out and seeing for themselves.  It made no sound.  All we heard was the rustling of the leaves in the tree, and the oh-my-god&apos;s of the people.  It hovered quietly for seemed like an eternity - probably 5 minutes or so.  It then dashed southeast probably a half-mile or so within a couple of seconds max, then zig-zagged out of view.  Dad had a camera in the glove compartment of the car, but chose not to take pictures of the UFO, in fears that the police force would not look favorably on it (I guess there had been reports that had been refuted and reputations consequently questioned). No one can convince me that I did not see a UFO that evening.  It was not an airplane,  helicopter or weather balloon.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

She pointed it out to me and we watched it together. Again, it looked like a bright red star that was stationary in the sky. Then something fell from it and slowly disintegrated. Whatever was falling was illuminated and looked like it was on fire. We could see the trail of the falling objects. To me it looked like what you see when a meteor enters our atmosphere and is burning up with pieeces breaking off of it. The main differnce was the primary object remained stationanry in the sky while pieces dropped straight down from it. Within a minute or two the last peice dropped off and &quot;burnt&quot; up and the main obect just dissapeared. Weird.

This prompted me to perform an internet Google search (&lsquo;Triangular UFO Napa&rsquo;) which led me to a website in which she had previously posted her recollection of the event in 2002 as per the link below:http://www.scifi.com/ufo/encounters/laura_enc.html  My account differs slightly and given the years since, this is probably to be expected. I am writing to corroborate our story and acknowledge that this experience was a true incident. (If for some reason you need to corroborate this sighting with another&rsquo;s from that area and year, you may contact me via telephone collect. In fact, if you have such information, I would like to read about it)  My personal recollection of the incident follows below:  As I recall it was a dark moonless night, but clear as the stars were visible. We had stopped briefly for some KFC takeout in St. Helena and were heading up 128 on our way to Lake Berryessa to meet some friends for a weekend boating trip. At the crest of a small incline in the road which gave us a southwest view of the valley which was then about 20-30&rsquo; below us, Laura first noticed a bright light low on the horizon and pointed it out to me. (To my recollection, it was probably about 11:30pm when we made the initial sighting. When we arrived at the lake it was more like 1:30am as per her account). My quick assessment was that the object (then perhaps 3/4+ mile away) was just a helicopter perhaps spraying the vineyards, but she remained skeptical. As we proceeded along the grade, it was evident watching the light that the craft was coming slowly in our direction moving perhaps at 10-20mph. Laura was not given easily to fear, and her apprehension made me nervous as I recall.  All that was visible was a very bright circular light which hid the details of the object except for perhaps a hint of a horizontal wing form. The surrounding vegetation in front/below of where the object was flying was illuminated by the intense white light emanating from the craft. The object appeared then to be about 15-20&rsquo; off the ground. As we proceeded a bit further up the grade with the object creeping ever closer and higher, we came upon a bend in the road which had a turn out and was surrounded by a grove of eucalyptus(?) trees. I instructed her to pull over and stop the engine so we could hear the motor and determine what the object was. We watched the object come towards us for a few minutes more. It continued to ascend and it wasn&rsquo;t long before it came directly overhead. Now directly overhead, the bright light centered on the craft was now facing forward and above us per my recollection. With the light shining away, it was easy to distinguish the triangular shape of the craft against the black sky and stars. Using the height of the 25&rsquo; trees as a gauge and having watched the ascent of the object, it appeared then that it was approximately 50&rsquo; overhead and perhaps 35&rsquo; wide. I would guess it was perhaps 5&rsquo; tall in height, but because of the light in front, it was very hard to gauge the shape/size of the object until it was immediately overhead. My recollection differs here in that I do not recall the object making any sound nor do I remember any colored lights underneath. It was dead quiet as it passed overhead moving at perhaps 15mph and proceeded to climb still higher until it disappeared over the hill behind us. I believe that I saw what appeared to be some sort of metal support system underneath, but it was so dark it is impossible to say with any certainty. Now rather anxious about what we had just witnessed, we didn&rsquo;t wait but a minute to start the engine and get out of there. As we were heading around a corner shortly afterwards, two sets of glowing eyes were seen in the bushes alongside of the road. I guessed it was just a pair of deer given the height, but neither of were willing to stop the car and find out what it was, although in hindsight I&rsquo;m relatively certain it was in fact just a pair of deer or other wildlife as it was a wooded and secluded area. Now nearing our destination, we came upon a rest area which had a public telephone and stopped. With the hopes that someone could corroborate what we had witnessed, Laura got connected with the Air Force (likely Travis AFB). As I recall from her discussion, the AF indicated that they hadn&apos;t spotted any objects on radar nor were any test flights scheduled for the area that evening that might account for the mysterious object we had just seen. We arrived at our final destination, thankfully, meeting our friends, but late, about 45 minutes by my recollection (which differs from her account of 1 &frac12; hours). We excitedly told our friends of our experience and they stared at us in utter disbelief and had a great time poking fun at us. Later as we were all sitting around outside gazing at the night sky and talking, we simultaneously witnessed 3 (?) bright objects which came shooting out of nowhere and stop in about a 10 o&apos;clock position on the northwestern horizon, very similar to what we had seen in Yosemite Valley the summer before together along with a different group of friends. The objects hesitated for a brief moment hovering perhaps at 2000&rsquo;, and then darted in and out like a game of cat and mouse and with one final push, shot upwards and were gone in the blink of an eye passing through the thin cirrus cloud layer above. That incident lasted but a few seconds in all, but it was enough to convince our friends that perhaps we had seen something after all. I personally don&apos;t recall any jets going after the objects neither before nor after as Laura recounts, but it has been many years and I may have just forgotten. With Travis AFB fairly close by, it wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me if there were jets in the area at the time.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))", "Vertical oval-shaped object seen in skies over Goulburn, Australia, disappeared in orange sparks, before becoming a star.A white, vertical oval-shaped object was seen in the sky over Goulburn, NSW, Australia. It had a faint vertical line down the middle, and was not uniformly smooth on the left-hand side. My mother and I were travelling in a car, and observed the object while travelling south from the highway until we were well into the city. It appeared to move irrespective of the wind (clouds went past it without it deviating from its course). It seemed to be moving up, and it got bigger as we got closer to Goulburn, not leaving a trail of any kind. My mother and I tried to identify what it was (going through rocket/ ultralight/ gyrocopter/ helicopter/ airplane), but could find no rational explanation other than that it could be a blimp/zeppelin/derigibal. However, the most convincing part of the experience was the way it disappeared. The object seemed to dissolve in orange-red sparkling lights (almost like glitter - like in those old-ish movies where someone disappears by magic into a bunch of sparkles. This took about 3-5 seconds), before completely disappearing, leaving only a relatively bright star-like light in the sky, which I watched for another 2 minutes or so, before losing sight of it.The reason we thought it was a blimp was because it was dusk, and it could have been reflecting the sun off its side, then turn around and stop reflecting in our direction. But why, then, did it sparkle orange lights and turn effectively into a star?", "Red light in treeIn August, 1966 I was a 17 year old high school girl. Me, my younger sister and Mother and Father had gotten up early on this August day (1:00 am) to pack up our car to start a week&apos;s long vacation trip out West through seven states.  As we were packing up the trunk of our 1963 Chevy something caught my eye in the yard next to ours.   Back then the yard to the left of our house had a large apple tree growing in it.  Now I never would have even glanced at the blackened yard or tree.  But what caught my attention immediately was a small red orb just sitting there half way up in the tree facing our driveway.  The red light did not reflect on the leaves.  It was a dull red color.  Well, when I saw that light the hairs went up on the back of neck and I was immediately spooked.  And I think everyone knows when they are seeing something that is unnatural and shouldn&apos;t be there.  And because I was a kid and my father was packing up the car with military precision I didn&apos;t say anything about it while we were finishing up loading  the car.  As we were backing up the darkened driveway I was so frightened I didn&apos;t look at the light but I knew it was still there. After about 20 minutes of driving we got out on the highway and I said to my Mom, &quot;did you see that light in the tree&apos;?   She said, yeah I saw that what was it?? She added that maybe it was the light up on top of the telephone pole.  Back then the poles had glass transformers on top and when they had an overload they would turn red.  Well I thought maybe that was it and forgot about it. When we returned from our trip a week later I looked at the tree and the spot where the light had been was just about 5 feet above my head.  The transformer is about 20 feet away from the tree and 25 feet above it.  So that could not have been the explanation. Since this happened I have read that sometimes UFO&apos;s send down small red balls or orbs and maybe they are observation things.  It sure did look like it was watching us and we interrupted whatever it was up to.  And I know this light did not belong in that tree.

It was almost like flares that were lighting and then extinguishing or perhaps mirrors reflecting the sunsrays.  One thought that I had was that somebody had done a balloon releases and used those silver reflective balloons.

At the time we were both amateur astronomers (built our own 6&quot; telescopes) and spent a lot of time star gazing.  The night we saw the UFOs was clear and moonless.  I was in the process of moving the telescope from one sky object to the next when I caught sight of a v-shaped formation of about 8 circular shaped objects crossing the sky almost directly overhead.  I immediately shouted to my friend and he saw them as well. Each object was about the apparent size of a full moon, were circular in shape and had a dull, light grey metallic color to them.  I&apos;m not sure whether they were visible as a result of reflected light from the ground or whether they were semi-transparent and lit from within.  I am sure that they seemed metallic and definitely gave the feeling of being &quot;hardware.&quot;  Also, the fact that they made absolutely no sound left a strong impression on me.  We watched them as they flew across the sky at uniform speed and finally disappeared behind a building.  We saw them for about 5-10 seconds.  They remained in formation throughout the sighting and there was no individual movement by a disk within the formation.  I believe as they receded you could see that they were disk shaped and that the direction of flight was north to south but I can&apos;t swear to these things due to the length of time that has lapsed since my sighting. At that point we were both confident we had seen something not made on earth.  Being amateur astronomers, we were familiar with observing high flying aircraft, satellites, comets, meteor showers, Aurora, etc. and I know that what we saw that night can not be explained as some natural or man made phenomenon.

It was an extremely clear evening and cool out. As I watched the jets, a closer and brighter object caught the corner of my eye as it moved in place. I&apos;d say it was approximately 1000 feet up and tumbled in place. I say tumbled because the object appeared pare shaped only if you took a knife and cut the very top of the pair off giving it a flat top. The bottom half of the object was an extremely bright reddish orange glow. I only saw this glow as its (what I call) bottom end being the wider end of this object, came into view with its stationary position in the sky tumbling. I pulled the car over and watched this object as it tumbled. When the wider more bright part of the object left my view, the object seemed to almost disappear except for a faint visual of the object in its position until its wider brighter part rotated into view. This object wasn&apos;t traveling left or right or toward or away, as I said, it was stationary in the sky as it tumbled.

In the northwest I could see the constellation Cassiopeia and underneath it, approximately 10 degrees above the horizon was a amber colored spherical light. It was larger than a star and wasn&apos;t moving so I assumed it was probably Mars. The light was slowly fading and getting brighter like thin clouds were passing in front of it, but I could not see any clouds in that direction. As we drove along it became obscured by trees, and I lost sight of it. I didn&apos;t really think it was unusual until I checked 2 separate sky maps and there were no planets in that area on the maps. The object was somewhere between the constellations Andromeda and Lacerta.

The tones were witnessed by another person of similar age in the same room.  Both of us dismissed the tones as a dog whistle at the time.  The tone started in one pitch and many moments later appeared to change pitch to a second tone.  We were actually in a bedroom when we heard the tones.  It is difficult for me to remember the exact date, time, and month because this was something that happened a very long time ago.  I do recall that it was raining at the time this was going on and for that reason I listed November as the most probable month of the event. A number of years later I attended a support session for abductees that was held in Seattle on Aurora.  Although I have never been abducted, I learned from the group that high pitch tones are one of the signs associated with contact with a UFO.  For that reason I have decided to file a report.

I then noticed in the SW direction that a fairly bright and large &apos;1/4 moon&apos; was visible, but was kind of &apos;odd-looking&apos; in that it was featureless and had a bright orange-red &apos;glow&apos; in a very overcast sky with no stars visible at all that night.   It just didn&apos;t look right at all;   so I pulled my car off the road along the road&apos;s shoulder to look at the object further.  We even got out of the car and crossed the road near a field to look at it further. Then all of a sudden, the &apos;1/4 moon&apos; began to rotate itself slowly so that its flat part was then completely aligned up with the horizon.   The object then started to move slowly across the sky from the SW to SE, and in complete silence.   At this point my wife and I truly began to feel scared and at risk and decided that we ought to return to our car.  Furthermore we agreed that if it looked like the object was about to head in our direction, that we would quickly get out of there and make a run for it!!!   However, the object completely stopped in the sky and then began to retreat from us, faster, and faster and faster, until it reduced its size to a pinpoint of light and then eventually disappeared.   I contacted the local police, the state police, and the local airport to report the incident but they had no corroborating evidence.  Finally I contacted Mr. Hyneck (who was the Air Force Blue Book director at that time) who gave us forms to fill out and mail in to him.   My wife and I indepedently filled out the forms and then compared our observations.  We both,  as common eye-witnesses of this same event, described the event independently and found that our descriptions, regarding the facts and details,  were also in perfect agreement with each other. Interestingly enough, a check on the position of the moon on the next night showed that the moon was located in the NW,  NOT in the original SW location of the object when first observed.  And this time also the moon looked its normal self. We never again ever saw such a sighting as the above.  In the past, as a Ph.D. scientist, I had always treated news on UFO sightings as mere illusions, mistakened observations, overly eager people, or plain hysteria, or combination of all of the above.   After this eye-witness sighting above, seen together with my wife right by my side (which also remains fresh in our memories after all of these years),  I am now NOT so skeptical or cynical about ufos&apos;s;  and also have no logical explanation whatsoever regarding the event .....  other then that it occurred exactly as related above.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

It was after dark. The tide was low. I looked out to sea where the breakers were visible in the moon. Suddenly I saw three large fire balls, lined up in a row parallel to the breakers. They were the size of a house each, moving very slow along the beach. As the first fireball reached a point, it suddently accelerated rapidly, left to right, and moved 90 degrees up, into the night sky. As each of the other two fireballs reached this approximate location, they, too, accelerated rapidly and moved 90 degrees up into the night sky and disappeared (growing smaller and smaller until I couldn&apos;t see them)  Hard to judge speed, but I would guess hundreds of miles per hour once they started to move up into the night sky. I was frightened and turned to head back to my house and litteraly bumped into a strange man standing on the beach. He didn&apos;t look at me. Stared at the fireballs.

The color was changing, but basically a very light gray and covered with a (seemingly partly frozen mist of smokey, foggy white), very much like frozen carbon dioxide clinging to the surface all over, except in certain areas.The areas would change covering, and I could see and witness the change and the exposure of a very detailed mechanical system or device. There was a matrix or grid pattern of vent holes, which were about two feet in diameter each and two feet apart. These were checkerboarding (although round and not aquare)an area of about twenty feet or 40 feet in diameter and basically round, but not perfectly round due to the shifting nature of the fog covering.The grid pattern of holes had a thick brownish, mixed with blackish, smokey substance flowing at the rate of approximately two gallons per second streaming from each port (hole, exhaust port) into each adjacent hole, and also the same substance was streaming from each adjacent port into each other adjacent port, so that all ports had the substance streaming both in and also out and from each adjacent port in the same manner. I can draw a picture or series of pictures dipicting these events in great detail.And, later, a minute, another area would be exposed on the skin (surface of the ship) and repeat the same event. I watched this series happen two times very clearly, and on the third time, the ship was being partly hidden among sirrus clouds partly and was crossing over Broad Rock Road four to six city blocks high in the sky, about the same distance high as when I first spotted the ship. It was difficult to stare at the ship without blinking my eyes. I was not comfortable with the thought of not having a camera or of not being able to continue learning and watching. As I stared more and more, the ship was slipping into the sirrus clouds almost as if the ship were to some extent creating the clouds or some of the clouds. I did not want to loose sight of it. I was riding my bicycle and had stopped at the corner of Broad Rock Road, one block south of Orlando Street. In seconds, the ship sped away. I looked and stared and searched the sky in the direction it was travelling, and I was disappointed that it had vanished or gone out of my sight. I have never gotten this off of my mind at any time since then, except for a few days at a time. I think about it veru often, every few days or weeks. I tell people about it, draw pictures and make estimations regarding the activities of the mechanical parts. Maybe this was a cover, maybe a propelling factor, a disguise, or a cooling system. This was on a late summer day. This could have been engines, exhausts, or gas exchange for changing the dimensional atomic makup of the density factor in apparent spacial configuration. I have developed a series of (plans), which depict the apparent configuration of the atomic and subatomic properties. It is theory and hypothetical, but it explains the phenominum in this way. When I speak of emmiting lights, I am speaking of the fact that I saw light from it or light reflecting from it. I did not see any things that would be defined as headlights or metallic fixtures. But, I do seem to possess amazing clarity as to the possible makup of the ship.

The object had a slight purple color to it.  I would not have paid much attention to it, except that it was so bright and seemed to be falling/moving.  Perhaps more accurately, it appeared to be moving towards me. This naturally made me think that it was an airplane.  However, I saw no red lights and the movement of the object was unlike that of any airplane.  The object would move a bit, then stop, and then would seem to move a bit more.

These identical observations were made by me(about age 9),my then best friend,age 11,and his mother,then about age 45. She is the one who found the newspaper article the next day,which I have never taken the time to attempt to relocate since then,but which forever impressed this sighting in my memory,since independently confirmed and shared by many other complete strangers in the area written up in the Baltimore Sunpapers(or News American). The date and time is approximate,but was approximately the height of summer,l958. I have never had any other sighing before nor since,and did not connect it to UFOs per se because back then they were described as&quot;flying saucers&quot;,and I had never heard of triagular UFOs,only discs or alleged cigar shapes, until the l990s,when photos of the triagular objects over Belgium and elsewhere first came to my attention. Unlike some other reports of triangular sightings,however,there was no central light,but instead merely one small white lite at each apex of each triangle. Other than the absence of a central(fourth)light,what we saw appeared identical to the Belgian triangles caught on film in the l990s. No other detail could be made out with respect to the objects. I&apos;ve decided to report this after all these years in the hope that if enough people make enough reports,then the scientific community and the appropriate authorities will study these phenomenon seriously. Also,someone should check the archives of the local newspapers for the summer of l958 which should substantiate that many persons reported the same observations at the same time,totally independently of one another. Our group of three had not made any report of what we saw that night to anyone,but were genuinely puzzled at the time,and surprised the next day that so many other unknown  persons reported similar phenomena the previous night at the same time in the same area,over northern and northwestern Baltimore County. In those days Randallstown,where our sighing occurred,was semi-rural and therefore relatively free of City light pollution. It was a warm,clear,dry,starry,moonless night,which may help pin down the time of month,and will remain vivid in my recollection forever,since what we saw was nothing like I&apos;ve ever seen before nor since,except for the Belgian photos from the early l990 sightings,and was definitely not manmade aircraft due to their flight characteristics:apparent large size,lack of sound,low slow coordinated,level,uniform straightline motion, and other appearance as described above. These two objects continued north not changing speed nor direction until over the horizon.This is all I recall observing,and would have thought no more of it but for the aforesaid newspaper reports by so many others the next day,on the theory that all of us could not be mistaken nor confused at what we saw,i.e.controlled silent low flying triangles in formation,maintaining equal distance from one another,inconsistent with any known technology,nor any natural phenomena whatsoever.The lights did not flash like a plane,nor change color, nor intensity,nor their positions relative to one another while continuing a uniform motion northward of our backyard vantage point.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

My friend had binoculars in the car so I retrieved them to look at the light and was shocked at what I saw. It was a huge round jet blacl object with huge lights similar to traffic lights in that they had a sort of roof over each light. There were many lights but only two were on. I could see a sort of fog swirling around the light. I remember saying &quot;Oh my God - pull over.&quot; All I could say was &quot;Oh my God, Oh my God&quot;.

When I took the binoculars from my eyes all I could see was the light but with the binoculars the entire object was visible. It was silent and huge.  Of course I could not tell how close to me it was but it appeared bigger than a football field as it blackened out the whole sky. When I turned away for a moment and then looked again the lights that were facing me were off and the lights on the back of the object were now on and looking in the opposite direction. By the time I handed the binoculars to my friend the object was gone.

Nov. 05, 1999 I was playing with my dog in the backyard of my home in Santa Clara, CA. which is directly behind Paramounts Great America Theme Park.  There were light partial clouds that day and no fog, so any aircraft was clearly visible.  Seeing aircraft on a continuous basis to and from San Jose International Airport and Moffett Field was common at that locale.  This evening I noticed the incoming flight patterns of the P3 Orion naval aircraft from Moffett Field.  The planes appeared to approach from the north, then turned west toward the air field (from my perspective).  They would first appear to be small twinkling lights, then as they got closer, of course, they would finally take the shape of an airplane.  Then, suddenly, I noticed one of them appeared to be tumbling from the sky?!   I ran to the fence and thought to myself, Jesus that plane is going to crash!  I&apos;m actually going to witness a plane crash!  But as it got closer it looked like it was diamond shaped?  Then it shape shifted into what appeared to be a slow moving metalic colored dominoe moving southbound in the north sky!  What...in...the...hell...?!  I lost sight of it as it passed behind my neighbors roof. I rubbed my eyes in disbelief and shook my head violently!  I thought to myself, okay I am not crazy, when this thing reappears from the other side of the roof it&apos;s going to be a Boing passenger liner on it&apos;s way to San Jose Airport.  Much to my surprise, when it reappeared it was, in fact, a gigantic wingless craft cruising as slow as you please right over the Bay Area!!  AAAAAh, it&apos;s happening, we&apos;re being invaded by aliens!!!!!  I ran frantically screaming into my front yard trying to direct anyone&apos;s attention to this craft.  My mother, niece, grand-nephew, friend (a former nuclear powered submarine pilot), and four of my neighbor&apos;s (one of which was a retired senior engineer from Lockeed Martin) came outside to see what I was yelling about.  Then, in disbelief, we all watched this UFO perform some of the most amazing arial maneuvers I&apos;ve ever seen with my own eyes!  First, as it was moving in a southernly direction, it made an immediate 90 degree turn west.  No banking, no arch, I mean on a dime!  Then, it suddenly ascended, glowing orange as it rose!  I thought aloud, &quot;look a plasma, it&apos;s striking a plasma!&quot;  My neighbor, Mr. C replied, &quot;no, it&apos;s catching the tangent rays of the sun.&quot;  I asked, &quot;How big is this thing, a couple, or a few football stadiums maybe?&quot;  Wild eyed, Mr. C replied, &quot;No, much much bigger...like maybe half the size of the Bay Area?!...I don&apos;t know?!&quot;  Then it made a series of zig-zag and square moves which took our breath away, but the most spectacular move was it&apos;s northernly directional shot accross the sky!  It flew so fast that visually it seemed to elongate, or stretch like a rubber band accross the sky to an abrupt stop!  Then, from it&apos;s north easternly point in the sky it ascended at a very fast rate until it appeared to be a star in the early evening sky.  It stayed at that point in the heavens for several hours until it just disappeared (~03:00 a.m.).  Unfortunately, we were all so shocked we didn&apos;t have the presence of mind to get a camera or camcorder.  No calls to the authorities were made either.

It amazes me that something like that over such a heavily concentrated population center never made it to the media.

We felt the saucers themselves must have been going around in circles[rotating] at great speed because we could see a faint halo towards the middle, fatter part of the saucer. We did not see any windows or flashing lights. They were huge and perfectly formed, not like clouds in any way.Suddenly, they moved/shifted upwards then, at what must have been an incredible speed,  in a direction away from Earth or at least away from us or from our view...they moved so fast as to disappear from our view within seconds of shifting upwards. We both looked at each in disbelief! During this episode, the objects always remained in a perfect pattern of 4 even as they disappeared from view. We told our mother the next day [we stayed quiet as to not wake baby sister and be told off] she told us we were imagining things. Back then, we told very few people as it was weird that no one seemed to believe us or just said nothing.?? So, we just accepted that we must have seen &apos;flying saucers&apos;[UFO&apos;s] from outspace because we heard stories about such things. And, no other explanation fits.My sister and I still agree on this sighting. Had we been older and had a more curious mother, we may have discovered others who witnessed a similar siting at the time. The exact date and time I am not sure of, but I will never forget seeing something moving profoundly fast and in formation with an intelligence unlike that of anything on Earth up in the skies of Ohio.I have had 2 other experience since then. I think once something like this happens to you, you have an altered perception of reality and begin to think more laterally.One was a falling star which split in two as it fell. My husband and I witnessed that in England back in 1986. A rare sighting, I think, but explained.The other was a bright pulsating light I witnessed in the Andes at Macchu Piccu in 1974. This light was again a white-yellowish color. It pulsated light [rhythmic like a heartbeat]. Somehow it woke me up that night. I think it could have been the odd low-level noise it made.  I can only describe the sound as a &apos;low-pitched&apos; single sound of a gyrating quality. That, and the pulsating light filling up my rear hotel bedroom window had me frozen with fear.  Though I could look out the back window, only light was coming in. I could not &apos;see&apos; anything. Strangely, after watching this for what seemed a long time, I must have fallen asleep. Next morning when I looked out the back window, there was nothing to see but a steep wall of rock behind the hotel.Very early in the evening the hotel shuts off its electricity. There is nothing above the hotel except a small mountain path. I hiked up the mountain/cliff behind the hotel to see if I could discover where the light source was coming from. Nothing.  The path cast a view across to the temple of the Sun at MP. Make your own conclusions. The only other view is the mountain tops of the Andes and huge butterflies.I heard the mountains produce their own eeries lights. I met another person who also saw what I did that night. He was from Austrialia-doing oil exploration down in the Amazon Basin. We just could not figure it out, as nothing was up there [too high for helicopters in the night, moonless night?] but the hotel and us. The hoteliers saw nothing and said nothing is up there, could be no light, no electricity.It is so dark up there at night that when the electricity is turned off that I could not see my hand even when I placed flat against my nose. That is dark! But, something lit up MP that night. I will never know what it was.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

We lived in Dumas, 47 miles north of Amarillo.  We heard jets flying overhead and went outside to see them as this was not normal to have any air traffic over our community with the exception of large military aircraft that flew over at very high altitudes during the day.  We were delighted as youngsters to see the lights of the jets as they chased some odd looking lights overhead.  The lights appeared to be about the same size as the jets and they would let the jets get close then they would change course immediately.  My mother and sister were also witnesses.  My brother-in-law was stationed at AFB and told us that after the jets returned that night, the base was locked down for 24 hours.

It was about 30 degrees above the horizon when I first saw it, and at about 70 - 80 degrees when I lost track of it. It was about 3-5 times brighter than the planet Venus (also visible at the time) and deep blue (almost purple) in colour. It was bright for about 3 seconds, then went dim (almost to a pin point) for another 5-7 seconds before I lost track of it. I could not tell if the object became dim from a loss of size/mass or increased distance.  The entire time I observed the object it was accending on a straight trajectory.

I went to get binoculars from my pickup and as I pulled them out of the case the pulsating lights became exceedingly bright and left the horizon faster than a &quot;shooting star&quot; The exit speed was phenomenal. I remember that the lights followed the spectrum except that a few of the visible wavelengths were absent. The lights pulsated as opposed to the blinking lights of an air craft. It was as if the light expanded and contracted with the visible frequency.

My aunt yelled out for us to look, my bed was next to a window and when I looked out I saw this disc right on of the windows location it was only aproximately three stories above the ground from us.  I saw it from underneath, it had many lights that made up a circle only not on the edge of the disc but in the center.  the lights were of different colors(red,green,and yellow but I can&apos;t say for sure which colors) some of the lights blinked in a timely fashion others wouldn&apos;t blink staying lit all the while.  We immeadiately went outside to get a better look but as soon as we got outside it immeadiately but slowly drifted away.My aunt and uncle tried photographing it as it was drifting away but solely I noticed that as they were photographing it there were invisible beams of light that were aiming at the camera.  These lights were&apos;nt visible, I noticed because I saw the lights reflect on the inside of the house(going through the windows and showing on walls of the inside of the house).

We just arrived about 12 miles up the beach from the beach entrance to camp at around midnight so we could meet friends in the morning at our favorite spot and avoid morning beach traffic from Houston where we lived at the time. A flashing light was in the rear view mirror just as we parked. The area behind us was swamp so it couldn&apos;t be a land vehicle that was approaching us and it seemed to be blinking at that distance. I scrambled for my camera when it became clear that it was something tumbling toward us but I only had daytime 100 ASA film in my 35mm Nikon. As I looked up from the van, I saw what was an oblong, still silent craft covered entirely with triangular windows and thin black frames around them as it slowly tumbled with no visable means of propulsion or wings, it never made a sound and always maintained the same distance from the ground. It was about two telephone poles off the ground and stood about two telephone polls in height which was easy to determine since there were telephone poles to compare to. Roughly football shaped, each window was back lit with a different soft pastel color. As it came over the power lines nearly directly above us it took a sharp 90 degree turn, tumbling only in the direction it was traveling and followed the power lines up the beach northward and disappeared into the distance. It was literally a stones throw from me. We scrambled out to see what would happen next and nothing further took place. BUT! The next morning when it was about to become noon after our friends arrived, we were to go to 7-11. I joked about the UFO sucking the battery dry when the van wouldn&apos;t start. My friend said there was a flashlight with new batteries in the glove box and sure enough the flash light batteries were drained too!  Really creeped us out but it was awesome at the same time. Over the years I&apos;ve shared my experience with friends and received awe, and at times skepticism, but it&apos;s always been important to me to come forward. One friend who was a UFO buff said that my description only represented about ten percent of all sightings he had read about and that never had anyone been that close to this particular type of craft. Cigar and saucer shapes were far more common. I still have a sketch of it I made the following day after I returned home.

I had he watch it while I got the 2 sets of binoculars out of my car and handed one to him. We both watched it as is droped small orange lights down out of the bottom of it at least twice.

This is among many many sightings I&apos;ve had as a kid. This is the most memorable. Coming home from church on a, probably, Sunday night, I was riding in the back of the car with my sister. My mother and father were in front of car. I was about eight years old. I was watching the night sky, looking for more of what I saw alot of, bright lights that would chase each other through the sky and come together again in a huddle. Now, I did not see these bright lights every night, but on occasion along with the very frequent meteorites, I would see these bright objects. I&apos;d often ask my father what they were. I asked him if jets or helicopters in the military could do that. He&apos;d tell me, no... and that he had no idea what they were. This night it was a full moon out. I was looking out my window and my sister was gazing out of hers. I was looking at the moon when I noticed a light off to the right of the moon blinking. It was more than one light, in fact it was a few rows of lights that were of varying color. Then, I noticed that I could see the lights reflecting off of a metallic surface. I also noticed the entire shape of the craft was cylindrical. A flat cylinder much like the same proportion of a tin can of cookies. It was hovering over the tree tops. It was, I noticed, above the trees as high as the trees were tall. The strange part was yet to come. I was excited to finally see one up close! The craft moved to where it was slowly moving along side the car over the tree line. In my point of view it was getting closer to the full moon. When it got just in front of the moon two beams of light lit from it, much like a car&apos;s headlights. The craft slowed to a stop. The wierd thing I remember about the lights is that they stopped as if hitting some invisible object. I cold actually see the ends of the light beams. Then, the two beams crossed over forming an elongated &quot;X&quot;. The craft then slowly moved back the other way and finally out of sight as our car got further and further away. My sister to this day remembers it. My parents only remember the strange lights we&apos;d see, I don&apos;t think they actually saw this event, but they remember me continually talking about it. I know that strange craft fly the skies, folks. Over the years I&apos;ve talked with many people who have told me what they&apos;ve seen. Sightings in Charlottesville... Waynesboro (one I saw on here, I swear that I&apos;ve talked to a lady about.. the one that talks of the spinning rod and ring over a person&apos;s house)  I can&apos;t claim that &quot;aliens&quot; as we think of them, exist. I think it&apos;s very possible, but what I do know for sure is that there are things in the skies that are not usually seen during the day that fly. Crafts of some sort, no doubt, that someone does not want us knowing too much about. Hey, keep up the information, the research, too many people know all of these things are true. Never stop your pursuit of the truth. I often wonder why there are alot more science fiction movies and shows coming out in the past 10 years?

I was assigned to MMS Preload which was on the east side of the base, just south of the bomb dump. We were surrounded by revetments which we used to climb up to smoke and take a break. One night, I don&apos;t recall now the date but it was in the summer of 1968 around 1:00 a.m. while on one of these breaks someone spotted a series of lights off to the NNW. At first we thought it was returning B-52&apos;s but then someone reminded us that our returning aircraft normally came out of the North. Incoming aircraft are easily identified and this was not aircraft. It was common to see aircraft stacked one behind the other and you could normally see the landing lights. In fact, you could distinguish between a B-52 or a KC-135 by the lights. On this occasion, the lights were lined up horizontally. As I recall there were 5 to 7 lights and they held a steady position for several minutes. Then, several would not be there, only to reappear at a different location. Then several others would disappear and join the others. The lights appeared stationary other than when they would go off only to reappear. This pattern continued for about 20 minutes. We had a base telephone mounted on a tree and one of the guys ran to the phone and asked the operator to connect him to the tower which was done. The person in the tower said they had no incoming aircraft, did not have anything on radar, and thought we might be seeing things. We were seeing things, these strange lights. Others on base saw them and several inquiries were made but no explanation was ever provided.

In the car was my mother; we were on our way to visit my grandparents for the holidays. Looking due east down the highway I spotted a large white light about 45-60 degrees above the horizon. I was pointing out to my mother that it sure seemed awfully bright for a star. It wasn&apos;t much bigger than a star but it was much brighter. At first I thought it might be a hovering helicopter with a searchlight (although no other lights were flashing). Soon after I pointed it out to her it streaked towards the ground like a shooting star. It left a streak as it fell. My fears of a helicopter crashing suddenly evaporated when the light stopped at the horizon.  I have no clue how high it was due to its distance away from us. We were continually closing on it but we never got close enough to see anything other than lights. Miffed at the speed of the fall and the sudden stop, I still was trying to figure out how a plane or a helicopter could have recovered from such a quick descent. Suddenly it streaked horizontally from in front of us to 90 degrees from the front of the car on the drivers side door. It seemed to hover over a tree line across a field off the highway. Suddenly the bright white light went out and a smaller red and blue light alternated on and off for a few seconds. Then the white light came back on brighter than before. This whole time I was trying to watch and drive at the same time as my mother watched from my right. I eventually had to stop watching as I was having to look back at this point. It was still there the last time I looked. Never moving but just hovering over the trees. I&apos;m a CAD/CAM Administrator and have never seen a UFO before (although I believe in them).

It was around 9:00pm and the sky was pretty clear. From the corner of my right eye up on the sky I spotted some lights. At first because the lights were so bright, I thought it was some kind of fireworks, but the lights never disolved. Instead the object moved silently from north to south. My building where I lived is 14 stories tall, and the object seemed it was about triple the height of the building. The large object had about 9 lights, 5 in the front almost in a octigon shape and the about 4 lights tailing it.  All the lights moved as if the object was one. I got the impression it was one object. I was amazed, something that large, that close didn&apos;t make any noise what so ever.I have seen blimps in the past, and you could hear them.  This was no blimp. Also, a few months later, I saw on TV a home video that someone took showing  the same craft I witnessed.

Others present were a neighbor aprox 20 yrs old, also my mother and grandparents were present.we observed a very bright light as bright and large as a 747 landing light would be if the plane was maybe 2000 feet up. (no airports within 200 miles of that location) brighter than any star in the sky and made no sound. the strangest part of this sighting was the flight pattern. it started in the south west coming from what would have been new mexico and flew in perfect uniform stair steps making sharp 90 degree angles  as it flew diagonally across the sky from southwest to north east in the direction of main and vermont. if you held your arm out full length and measured the distance each stair step covered, it would appear about the length of a finger. Of course how far in miles that would be depends on how high it really was flying above the earth. To my knowledge there was no flying machine on earth at that time that could make 90 degree turns repeatedly in mid flight other than a helicopter, and if it WAS a helicopter with a light as bright as the one we saw, we would have heard the sound AND seen more than one light. the same goes for a plane, if it was a 747 or other jumbo jet with that bright of a light we would have heard sound, and no normal airplane jet or otherwise could turn a perfect square corner let alone do it repeatedly in short succession. we watched as it went all the way across the entire sky diagonally and dissappeared in the far north east.

There was an article in the paper the next day saying that there were similar sighting across the united states the same night, in the corresponding states to the ones that would have been covered by the flight pattern that I observed.

My family and I had just driven to a nearby community, called Engelberg, to look at the Christmas light display that this area is known for.  The road that leads to Engelberg is a rural road without much traffic.  On our way back to town, while on this road, my younger brother, who was about 6 at the time, said &quot;Hey, look, its two Haley&apos;s comets.&quot;  Haley&apos;s comet had already come and gone earlier that year, so I said, before I even looked, &quot;No, stupid, Haley&apos;s comet has already gone!&quot;  But about that time, we all looked over out the passenger&apos;s side of our van and saw what appeared to be two comets (complete with tails) in the distance.  No sooner had we fixed our eyes on them, they &quot;shot&quot; directly over our van.  My dad stopped the van because we didn&apos;t know WHAT the heck it was.  It was probably no more than 50 feet above the vehicle and it no longer resembled comets, but appeared to be random red glowing lights.  It was a clear night out, but the lights were hazy.  We could not distinguish a craft shape, although whatever it was was hovering.  We just stared at it for about 2-3 minutes.  (although it seemed like time had stopped.)  As we were watching it, my parents rolled down the windows to see if we could hear anything.  We heard NOTHING!  Only the wind.  We all commented on the fact that this was just &quot;weird.&quot;  My dad, trying to remain calm, came up with the idea that it must be some sort of special military plane that has special &quot;silencers&quot; on it.  My mom said, &quot;Yeah, but wouldn&apos;t we SEE a plane? It is DIRECTLY over our heads.  Dad: &quot;I have NO idea&quot;  Brother: &quot;I&apos;m scared&quot;.At this point, the lights &quot;shot off&quot; to our left, in a blur and then disappeared.  We sat there with our van in the middle of the road for a while after that just trying to absorb what we had just seen.  When we got back home, we were watching the local news out of Jonesboro, Arkansas (KAIT) and the weatherman said that they had gotten lots of calls from the Pocahontas area about this phenomenon, and the weatherman said it was a meteor shower.  However, later in the broadcast, the weatherman said they had just received a report that it was NOT a meteor shower after all, but was reported by the FAA to be a Russian Missle that had gone off course.  I would have believed the whole &quot;meteor shower&quot; story had they not come back and &quot;blamed the Russians.&quot;  I can still recall the exact date, even though it was almost 20 years ago because I wrote about it in my diary that night (which I still have) and my family still discusses it frequently.  I am not sure what it was, but I DO know that meteors don&apos;t hover and the story about the Russian missle is just too lame.  I think no one knows what it was....sure wish I knew, though!", "I was outside on our deck with my wife looking for satellite&apos;s , sometimes we do this on really clear nights. after about 10 or 15 minutes she saw what appeared to be a pretty bright satellite then she noticed a second one behind it and to the left, almost at the same time i saw one directly beside it.The three objects were moving north to south.I spend enough time looking at planes and satellites to know the difference between the two,and all i know is these were not aircraft such as civilian or military jets.They were totally silent and it was hard to judge altitude, but i would say they were not in our atmosphere.If i had seen just one i would have thought it was just a satellite, but the three were moving in a PERFECT elongated triangle at EXACTALY the same speed.If satellites move in groups of 3 would someone post the info.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))", "1970&apos;s sighting of small UFO that hovered, maneuvered, split into two objects, then rejoined and flew off.This happened in 1974 or &apos;75, when I was about 15 years old. It occured on a winter weekend, in January, in my home town of Pipestone, Minnesota; a small (5000 pop.) rural town in the southwestern part of the state.  I was home alone as my parents were away for the weekend.  Two school friends, brothers, who lived across the street had a couple of snowmobiles, and we spent the latter part of the afternoon riding their sleds in an undeveloped area on the south edge of town, a few blocks from where we lived.  Late afternoon, almost dusk, we went back home.  I wandered out into the street between our houses while I was waiting for them to put their sleds away in their garage. I was just sort of looking around, and noticed a lighted object in the sky approaching from the southwest, roughly from the direction of the field in which we had been snowmobiling.  It appeared to be a single object with two lights, one red and one white.  I believe one of the lights was blinking, but I can&apos;t remember now which color it was.  I assumed at this point that it was a small private plane, as the town had a small municipal airport and it wasn&apos;t unusual to see small single-prop planes in the area. The object continued to approach until it was directly overhead, then turned east flying directly over the street I was standing on.  It moved a short distance straight east, maybe a block or two, then stopped and hovered. The object appeared to me only as two glowing globes of light, red and white, stuck together like two beads or marbles that are touching (they did appear to have dimension, i.e. the glowing lights were definitely spherical, not just point sources of light).  I saw no other structure, so I don&apos;t have a good reference for determining the size of the object - however I should note that although it was right about dusk, there was still some daylight, and had it been a small plane or helicopter I would surely have seen the structure (there were no helicopters in town anyway).  As to height, based on how it later flew away (below), it seems the height was modest as the object disappeared below a nearby tree line before travelling very far, so I would guess it was roughly a few hundred feet - no more than 1000 - off the ground.  If this is true, then the object was not very large - perhaps the size of a car or truck. Anyway, after hovering for perhaps 10 - 20 seconds, the object moved directly back along the way it had come, straight back west over the street until it was directly overhead, and then it stopped &amp; hovered again.  It did not turn or maneuver like an airplane would have to, it had simply moved straight backward along its original line of flight after hovering.  At this point I was almost in shock at what I was seeing, and just stood there staring at it.  If one of the lights had been blinking earlier as it approached, neither one was now - both lights were glowing steadily.   It hovered directly overhead for another 10-20 seconds, then the two lights separated and moved apart.  One light moved north a short distance, the other moved south a short distance, and it seemed that there was a thin glowing filament connecting the two.  The filament seemed to gradually fade away until I could no longer see anything connecting the lights.  (I suppose the filament could have been an afterimage in my eyes created by the movement of the lights, but it didn&apos;t seem to me that the lights were so bright as to have had that effect - but maybe...  The lights were not bright like a spotlight, more of a strong but soft glow.)  The apparent separation between them was probably not much more than the apparent distance between my hands if I hold my arms straight up overhead.  The lights stopped &amp; hovered in this position,  separated from each other, for another 10-20 second interval, then moved back together and  &quot;rejoined&quot;.  After another short interval just hanging there hovering straight above me, the recombined object moved slowly away to the southeast.   At no time during all of this did the object make any noise at all - it was totally silent. Once it started moving away I kind of &quot;snapped out&quot; of the almost-trance I had been in while watching it, realized that someone else should see this too, and yelled for my friends to come see.  (I don&apos;t mean to imply that the object had directly affected me by using the word &quot;trance&quot;, but while watching it I was completely focused-in on what I was seeing &amp; oblivious to all else, could hardly believe what I was seeing, and it did not occur to me to call to my friends until it started moving away.)  One of my friends came to see what the fuss was about, but by the time he got there the object was some distance away and all he saw was a moving light in the sky, which he took to be a small plane.  The object continued to move away until it drifted below the tops of the trees on the next city block in the line of sight, and we lost sight of it - I would guess it might have been a half mile away at that point.  As far as I know, no one else in town reported anything strange that day.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

My nephew was on my roof cleaning out the gutters, that is the only reason I was looking up, I was watching him on the roof (he is 21). I saw it first, really moving FAST, coming from the south-east and heading north-west. It was huge, it appeared to be silver, and very bright, as if light was being shined on it, it had no lights, nothing flashing, no sound, and no tail or jetstream. It was huge and we could see it very well, as the sky was clear. It had no front or rear, and no windows, it&apos;s entire shape was the same. As soon as I saw it, I asked my nephew what it was, he looked and we both watched it. As it started to get out of our vision, a jet was coming toward us from the north (it had a fuel trail as a jet does), these two objects were going to cross paths and were nearly side by side at one point. The jet was high in the sky and tiny (although you could tell that it had wings), and this thing was four or five times longer than the jet. I am stunned to say the least, we really have no clue what it is we saw.", "Dark rectangle moved slowly across sky with swaying motion, possible telepathy with 2nd observerWalking down an alleyway between two-story warehouses with a friend, had an urge to stop and  look directly above me. As I looked up an object slowly floated into view. It was rectangular, dark and moving VERY slowly. I thought at first it must be a plane but could see no blinking lights or light of any kind, then of course nothing where a fuselage would be, and what would be wings weren&apos;t swept back and were squared off and not tapered like wings. There was no sound. It was only visible because of the city light vaguely illuminating it&apos;s underside. My friend had continued on several yards still talking to me, noticed that I had stopped and was looking up at something. So he looked up to see what i was looking at. By the time he saw the thing it had moved about a third of the way across the piece of sky that we could see.  I was starting to notice all kinds of unusual detail on the thing, like rods protruding and lines underneath.And there was really something strange about the way it was moving. And another REALLY odd thing was... I seemed to be able to hear the thoughts in my friends head.It seemed that once he noticed the strange motion, that it seemed to move a liitle and then stop, move and stop, like it was swaying, but not side to side but up and down, I thought I heard him think to himself &quot;Is it a Bird?&quot; Then I said out loud to his unvoiced question &quot;No, it&apos;s not a bird&quot; We stood there transfixed, watching as it moved out of view behind a building. I ran to the end of the alley to try and spot it again but there was a bright street light in my eyes. My friend stood there transfixed, he said more because of me reading his mind than what we had seen.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

The flat platform type craft moved directly over our heads and we stood in complete amazement.  There was absolutely no sound coming from above and a pin point light was at the tips of each corner. The size of the Dark craft blocked out the stars on a very large scale.  The craft seemed very large but as we were watching we couldn&apos;t determine how high off the ground it was.  We watched the mysterious craft continue on over the small city and disapear in the distance.  We discussed our experience and due to the fact that we were one hour south of Dover Air Force Base and in the middle of a war we reluctantly decided that it was some sort of very large experimental aircraft. We researched what we saw to some extent and have never been able to get the image out of our minds.

The night was clear - no cloud cover at all.

Sputnik was expected to be seen after dark in the southwest sky (going just over our fig tree in the S.W. corner of our yard.  The house was on the north side of the yard so we had no fear of any obstruction of our view.As we lay watching, we saw [no less than 5 nor more than 8 - I&apos;m thinking it was 6]what we initially thought to be our subject sighting.  The two problems were: a) there was more than just one object and, b)they were traveling from the wrong direction - coming from the east, traveling west!  Their time to go from the eastern horizon (which was the roof of the one story house of our neighbor to the east) to the western horizon (trees - quite a ways away) was about 1.5 minutes - possibly 2 minutes but not more.The objects were quite bright but looked like Sputnik did when we finally DID see it - it was just where we expected to see it, too.  The objects had no specific formation but their flight pattern was direct: east/west.  No side trips at all BUT one ship or the other would race out in front of the group then slow and wait for the others to catch up.  This happened about 3 or 4 times while we watched them traverse our field of vision.  We called it the &quot;Dragrace in the Sky.&quot; We did talk about whether or not it HAD been the Sputnik, discussing the direction and number of vehicles, or had INDEED been &apos;flying saucers&apos; and decided we had been treated to a very special show before getting to see our (meaning earth&apos;s) Sputnik.

After looking at Orion for 1/2 an hour I started looking NNE. I was just staring into the dark night and a few faint starts when I saw a small red light moving. I tracked it for about 10 seconds then I noticed it another red light just like it moving in the same direction but slower, like the first one caught up with it. Then after passing it the first object came almost to a stop made a small maneuver then zoomed past the second slower object it just passed. Then it slowed down while moving back across the sky a little then doing the same thing, turning around. This went on for a while back and forth, also the little red lights would seem to hover or stand still periodically, and get super fast for a few seconds before returning to that same path they were on. It was like they were on a patrol. After about 30 minutes of this a third red light appeared, but only moving faster in one direction (west) then disappearing, not flying so far I couldn&rsquo;t see, but completely vanishing! After 40 minutes the two original objects disappeared. While staring into my binoculars at the same area and slowing scanning back and forth I noticed a small bluish-white light moving west. I track the object that was moving faster than the 2 red objects earlier. Then it started getting dimmer and vanished. It took about 2 or 3 seconds for it to fade away. I stood there staring at the same area with goose bumps all over my body. All I could see was dark night and a few faint stars. No with my lenses glued to that area nothing was moving. Then what looked like three stars in a triangular pattern in the night sky suddenly started moving... south and fast! I tracked the 3 bluish white lights for about 20 seconds then 1 by 1 each dot/object disappeared, faded, vanished.I then threw my binoculars in my car, got it and took off.((NUFORC Note:  If the witness was not observing satellites in the night sky, then we have no idea what he was seeing.

I was alerted to the activity by a man who had taken hundreds of hours of video of multiple objects and activity was continuing during our many meetings.    At one time the TV show &quot;Encounters&quot; was interested in showing one specific video but two weeks later, mysteriously pulled out the story with no explanation.    4 months into the investigation, the primary subject was killed in a one-car accident on a country road.    The video footage is largely of a surveilance nature with many hours of nothing followed by some very interesting items in the sky.  I personally witnessed one sighting and shock wave of something which affected all of the homes in the immediate area.    Also I interviewed multiple witnesses, who confirmed the strange activity.((NUFORC Note:  We will invite the witness to submit individual reports.

We were leaving to come back to Pennsylvania the next and my mother&apos;s whole family was there that night. As everybody was talking and saying goodby I started watching the western sky and saw what I thought was a plane moving north along the western horizon. At first I didn&apos;t think much about and watch it move slowly along. I had moved away from where my family was at the time and kept watching this so called plane. The it did something very strange. It stop dead, right in the middle of the sky. Then it started to move high but straight toward our house. It was very high in the sky. Like the hight of a jet. Then it just stop again and started moving in another direction. It kept stoping and moving and I knew that it wasn&apos;t a plane or a satelite. Then it just blink out of site. For a moment I look around the sky and there it was again. To describe how far it had moved in less then 10-15 seconds would be like looking at the hands of a clock and watch the big hand move from 9:00 t0 3:00 in a blink of an eye. It did this several times and when I went to tell my family it was gone. I had to have watching this object at least 10 mins or more.Some time in the seventies I heard or read in the paper someone describe seeing an object in the sky moving just like I saw.

I was 10 years old at the time. We lived in the 9xx unit on Olson Highway, in Minneapolis MN. My mother had sent me out to find my younger brother because it was getting dark. I remember that I had a jacket on, it was cool (and dry) but not cold, late September or early October. I was gone about 1/2 hour, and by the time I returned it was almost dark, and there was no one else in our front yard area. I had just entered edge of our front lawn, and was about 30 feet from the front door of our unit/apartment. As I entered the front lawn, I do no know why, but for some reason I had weird feeling, that something was above me. As I looked up, traveling due north at a slow rate of speed, I saw two round disks. They were left of me at about 10-15 degrees from vertical and in front of me by about the same amount. I could therefore not have seen the objects out of the corner of my eye. One distinguishing characteristic was that their bottoms, which is all I saw, appeared to be on fire. This did not appear to be a form of propulsion. It was almost exactly like the appearance of the bottoms of the saucers in the movie Independence Day.  However, they were much higher, with the appearance of about the size of a silver dollar held at arms length. They did not seem very high, possibly about a mile high. I&apos;ll just add that the fiery bottoms are what one might expect as a result of friction with the atmosphere if such an object entered the atmosphere at a high rate of speed. I immediately looked towards my front door and tried to yell to get the attention of someone inside, but I could not yell. I looked back up and the disks were moving at the same speed. I then ran into our apartment and tried to speak, but still could not speak, and after about 5 seconds, I headed out the back door with the family behind me. However, the two disks were no longer overhead. I still could not speak, and we went back inside our apartment. It was about another 10 seconds after I was inside before I was able to speak. I &quot;blurted&quot; out, &quot;I saw a flying saucer&quot;. I was unable to speak for a total of about 2 minutes, and the only way to describe it is, it was as if my brain had a mind of its own. In my mind/brain, it was like someone had pressed a &apos;fast rewind&apos; button. When I tried to speak, I could not interrupt what was going on in my brain. I had to close my eyes and concentrate real hard, and was eventually able to regain control and speak. I never saw anything like it before or since the above event. I also never (before or since), had a problem where I was unable to speak like that. At the time, I was above average in intelligence, especially in math. Before the above event, as opposed to being someone who was fascinated with outer space, I don&apos;t recall having any interest in it at all, which changed after the above event.

A well-known preacher in Fort Smith was praying about it, and the radio station had everyone gather at the Pepsi or Coca Cola bottling plant and there were at least 1000 people gathered there who had seen the object/objects all over the city.  The preacher also was there and it was quite an event.  It was in the news for a couple of days, and then some hokey story about a weather balloon was released and suddenly the story was cold.

We were even more amazed and clueless and we looked again to west and the last 2 were coming and did the same trajectory without light or sound.We were very excited at the end, but frustrated for not having a photo or video camera.I don&rsquo;t know how to describe the size of them. They were very big to see, but not huge like others descriptions that I heard of black triangles. The were probably huge, but due to the distant, they seamed to be just very big to us. Maybe it could cover 8 to 10 full moons lined up.There is a small not-military and not very busy airport 10km north from here, so I know how to identify planes and I know that they are noisy. And the city&rsquo;s Goodyear Blimp, lands in the same airport almost everyday (sometimes passing south to north over my house), so I know blimps too. Gliders, well I can see all kind of them when I go to the beach here. Theses black triangles we saw are not like anything I ever saw.I don&rsquo;t know if there were others in Rio that saw, but nothing were reported on the local or national TV or newspaper. If you need, I can take a panoramic photo from the place and draw the size and trajectory of them.

At first I couldn&apos;t figure out which &apos;planets&apos; these were being so bright and below the orbital plane of the planetary solar system. These objects were much brighter than the apparent magnitude of Venus and of course a different color. I then located ice-blue Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and maybe either Uranus or Mercury - they were all where they should have been. Then I thought they must be 2 hovering helicopters but being that bright they would have to be very close and I should be able to hear them.  These lights never made a sound the whole time. My son, unbeknownst to me at the time, had been standing in the street in front of my house to get better reception from the cell phone as he was calling his aunt and uncle in Richland, WA. He saw these same 2 lights climb out of the southwestern horizon (which I had not) and then stop and hover. He too was puzzled and described the phenomenon to his aunt while still on the phone.  He then walked through the house and into the back patio to tell me but as I have said, I was already watching them at that point. As we looked, the left light only receded back down toward the southwest to approximately 20 degrees above the horizon, stopped, and hovered there for about 2-3 minutes. Then, on its way back up to join the other light, it emitted what looked like 3-4 streams of sparkling lights or projectiles that reminded me of tracer bullets or Roman candles. For an instant, it scared me so my heart stopped as I truly thought we were under some sort of attack. (Too many war and space movies I guess!)   Now the left light had rejoined the other one and they both just hung there.  I went inside the house and got my binoculars which revealed the big, bright, amber lights, both left and right, to be actually 4 steady, separate lights on the corners of a perfect square.   These two bright amber lights, continued to hang there for about 4 more minutes then the left light began climbing up the sky until it was directly overhead (12 o&rsquo;clock position).  It moved at about the apparent speed of a satellite but it was obviously no satellite as it was a hell of a lot closer, bigger, and brighter.  When it got to the 1 o&rsquo;clock position on its northeasterly course, the lights instantly disappeared as if being turned of by a switch.  When I went back to look for the right light, it was gone.  My son said he had watched it depart on a course 90 degrees to the other light, in a northwesterly direction.  He said it appeared to drop a couple of tiny red dots vertically downward and then it too suddenly disappeared.  Neither my son, who is a college graduate, nor I was able to explain this phenomenon to each other.In the ensuing days, I scoured the newspapers and watched the TV news but not a peep mentioning anything about this.   I asked several fellow pilots in my flying club, and after some joking at my expense of course, none had observed anything as they were inside their houses that night.  I also called the Traffic Control Tower at Buchanan Field in Concord, CA several days later and no one had observed it.  What really boggles my mind is the fact that in a large metropolitan area of several million people,  you&rsquo;d think at least a few people would be outside their houses looking up at the night sky to see this phenomenon, and knowing this could not be explained as &lsquo;conventional aircraft, satellites, or planetary behavior&rsquo;, would therefore report it to someone.  Of course, neither did I, officially, until now.  This has been on my mind for almost a year now, and it wasn&rsquo;t until I saw the Peter Jennings Special on UFOs a few days ago that I learned of your site for reporting this sort of phenomenon.  So here I am and now you have it.", "Four large white lights surrounded by a luminus edgeMy partner and I were observing the night sky through a velux window above our bed. A satelight started to pass over in a north easterly direction which I pionted out to my partner. Moments later a craft which appeared to be at the same height started to pass over in an easterly direction. This craft was immense in size compared to the satelight and consisted of four white lights surrounded by a cigar shaped luminus edge. Later that evening we noticed the satelight again and the craft also both travelling at the same speed and in the same directions. I do know that satelights travel at 18000 mph. The craft was travelling at the same speed and appeared to have circumnavigated the earth as the satelight had. I ask myself - did ((name deleted)) see it as it must have passed directly over their heads!!", "Two bright fast-moving star-like objects with one traveling in a zig-zag motion.I observed two bright star-like objects (about as bright as the star Sirius) moving from the eastern sky in a west-north-west direction almost directly overhead. These two objects were moving very fast. They were fairly close to each other and traveling at the same speed.  One was moving in a linear path and the other was traveling in a zig-zagging motion (Now what on earth can move like that?). I&rsquo;d say that they covered about 90 degrees of sky in approximately 5 seconds.

We finally decided to pack up and leave and see if we could get some sanity back into our lives by going to Acadia anyhow. We arrived late in the day a couple of days later (I don&apos;t remember the exact day). After setting up camp, we drove to the Ocean Drive near Sand Beach and walked the walkway in the dark. After walking awhile we went out on the shoreline rocks to just watch the surf and stars and listen to the ocean. It was a nice clear night without any moon at that time. The planes had been flying for a couple of days again, and there is a path they tend to use over the Bar Harbor area that is directly overhead and runs in a SW to NE direction.  As I was watching the planes, and looking over the stars, I noticed a satellite moving across the sky from W to E in a line that was slightly off perpendicular to the route of the planes - still some distance from the exact route the planes were taking.  Looking further west I saw another satellite.  I pointed them out to my wife.  They were average star brightness and appeared just as I&apos;ve seen many satellites moving across the sky. I continued watching as the &apos;satellite&apos; moved closer to the path of the planes (no planes nearby at the moment). As some more planes flew overhead (they sometimes flew 3 or 4 at once) from the south and came near to the path of the &apos;satellite&apos;, the first &apos;satellite&apos; stopped dead still in the sky - as still as a star. Once the planes went by, the &apos;satellite&apos; started moving again - at the same speed it had been - without any apparent acceleration time - and then suddenly made a right angle turn moving ahead in the new direction at the same speed it had been using before. There was no apparent loss of speed as it made the right angle turn. It did this several more times - in different directions. Each turn appeared as an exact 90 degree turn - and then it moved in that direction for a few seconds before making another right angle turn again. Anytime a plane came near to the location of the &apos;satellite&apos;, the &apos;satellite&apos; stopped dead still in the sky. The other &apos;satellite&apos; as it came closer did exactly the same thing in relation to the planes!! We were just blown away and I couldn&apos;t imagine any spacecraft or plane that I know of that could manuever and hover so abruptly. Once past the lane the planes used, they continued on until they grew fainter in the sky. Both my wife and I are 50 years old (47 at the time of the &apos;incident&apos;), with college education.

We could see all 6 cabin doors from the bathhouse steps and a wooded hill rose behind the cabins. Off to our left and on a small hill (in the mowed area of the camp) was the camp owner&apos;s ranch house. Suddenly a ham-can shaped flying object came over the hill behind the cabins and flew past us to stop and hover over the owner&apos;s house. It was about the size of the house and it had white-yellow lights running around the side of the &quot;ham can&quot;. We were all shocked and we stood up and grabbed each other, asking what we should do. Two of the female counselors and one of the male counselors started crying and we were all talking at once.

It was much too large.  It was app twice the size of a C5 military plane, maybe alittle smaller.  We could see the object in the distance after zoomed off for app 15 seconds and then we lost sight of it.  It was too dark outside to see if the object left a trail or not.

There were two very bright lights on the end of this object, and one dim light in the middle. As we got closer to the object it appeared to be more triangular in shape. It then veered off to the north and revealed a fourth light, and when the fourth light became visible it looked like a kite the size of a B-52, possibly a little larger.

My brother ((name deleted)) loves Death Valley he came to get me here in Colorado springs and we headed west.  Having spent our first day exploring the vastness of the valley he suggested we go back to Beatty, eat and go to a private spot he found out about to avoid the tourist thing we both love to avoid.  I&apos;m speaking to him about family things from the past seeing as how it&apos;s been years since we were a unit.  When ((name deleted)) says to me ((name deleted)) I hate to interupt you but what the hell is that.  Now the important thing you need to know is its desert,its windy,its cold, its ten in the evening. and there should be no one around just taking a walk in those conditions. So I look out the window of the truck we are trying to stay warm in and there is someone walking pointing a flashlight in our windshield, Well I just lost my business and had been through five years of stress. So I got out of the truck and walked toward the light screaming you punks get the hell out of hear and leave us alone. While out there I realized this doesn&apos;t make sense The wind is howlin it&apos;s freezing cold there isn&apos;t a house for miles and we just got here. What the F#*&amp; is this. We decided the best course of action is to leave them alone. Well it looked just like flashlights. Right in our camp.They would be in front of us and as if on a cable move to our left about thirty yards away disappear and return right in front of us again.Against my brother&apos;s wishes I went to confront them again as they were to the position to our left far from the truck. At that point they looked like headlights the way they lined up. I hollered out. You punks got something to say,say it now! Then it accurred to me these lights were like ten feet off the ground and I couldn&apos;t see anything under them. Well as you can imagine I booked it up the hill looking behind me and these light just lowered right to the ground. That was the condensed version of that evening.

To me, the object looked like a rocket, as it was flying low enough that I was sure it had no wings. However, it was not flying vertically [i.e. flying up]; rather, it was flying horizontally, parallel with the ground, as you would watch an airplane or helicopter flying over. Again, there were no wings and no helicopter blades that I could see. The object was cigar-shaped like a rocket or missile, even though it was flying over land instead of up. Like an airplane, the object simply flew over. Within a half-minute or less, it was gone. I assume the object must have made some type of sound [although I do not remember the sound], that caught my attention so I looked up to see it. I cannot give an exact date, but it was seen sometime between the middle of June and the middle of August in 1966. This is when I was attending a summer camp at the Valley Forge Military Academy in Wayne, Pennsylvania, about fourteen miles west of Philadelphia. The time of day was, as I recall, late afternoon. At that time, I was standing near one of the barracks/dormitories {I believe it may have been Wheeler Hall] of the Valley Forge Military Academy. I believe this was the barracks where my dormitory room was located. At the time, I was ten years old; I would turn eleven in the Autumn. I did not notify anyone of the siting. It went so fast, I had no time to call anyone. And, since the vehicle was gone after a few moments, it did not seem to be of much value to tell anyone. Since the object looked like a rocket or missile, I assumed it was of terrestrial origin. However, I did wonder why a rocket or missile was flying over suburban Philadelphia.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

For some reason while we were walkin I glanced over my shoulder behind me.  I saw something in the sky kind of moving slowly.  I didn&apos;t think anything of it, figured it was an airplane. I turned back and continued walking, only getting a few more steps when what was in the distance behind us was right above us.  It was enormous.  It was disk shaped with diferent colored flashing lights around it.  I remember that it kind of reminded me of the Simon game.  It wasn&apos;t quite either, this thing was so loud it sounded like a whole fleet of airplanes.  It hovered above us at tree height for about 1 minute then it was gone in a blink ok an eye.

On a saturday night my friend and i arrived at another friends house to watch some movies. After knocking on the door i realised i had left my car lights on so i went back to my car which was parked out by the road. It was a very clear night and the sky in Canberra is great for a star gazer because it is a small city thus their is little glow in the night sky from buildings or city lights.As i walked over to my car i looked into the sky and directly north i saw what i initially thought was a satellite. I have seen many satellites before but this one appeared to be a little different. It was moving at a slow pace and in a straight line from right to left in the sky, it was a whitish/yellowish colour and it had no flashing lights apparent. The difference between this satellite to others i have seen before was that instead of maintaining a smooth trajectory the object seemed to be slightly bobbing up and down. I knew this was strange for a satellite so i kept watching. The objects trajectory then changed and it looked like it was moving downwards rather than in its straight line. It did this for about 30 seconds and then the object stopped and was sitting stationary in the sky. My friend then came outside and i called him over to look at the object. We looked at for about 1 minute as it sat still and then to my amazement the object began flying from left to right back which meant it was flying back at a slow pace in the opposite direction as to when i first saw it. My friend and i watched the object fly for about 1 minute until it stopped again. It stayed stationary for about 2 minutes then simply disappered to my friend&apos;s and my own amazement.", "Mysterious sphere darts into cloudsWhile flying back from Denver to Cincinnati I observed what at first looked like another plane flying towards us.

I was 17 and it was the summer of 1975 in Minneapolis Minnesota.  My &apos;friend-boy&apos; (he was 22) was walking me back to my apartment where I lived with my family.  We stopped to talk and were standing in the Phyllis Wheatley elementary school field that separated the school from my apartment building by about an acre.  The street was about a half a block away to my right and his left, facing the apartment building.  Across from the apartment building was another apartment complex.It was about a half an hour before sunset on a very clear evening.  Around the perimeter of the field, there were a lot of tall trees.  We were engrossed in a very good conversation when I notice to my left, something coming through the tops of the trees. It didn&apos;t make a sound but it was as big as a very large house.  It was black and shaped like a very narrow triangle.  It has lights on each point and a big &apos;spotlight&apos; typed light in the middle.  It whoosed over the very tops of the trees, so close that we both ducked, thinking it was going to hit us.  I asked him if he saw what I had just seen and we both definately agreed that what we saw was shaped like nothing we had ever seen before. Now, here is where it gets very, VERY strange.  Not more that one minute later, as we were engrossed in conversation about the object we had just saw, I noticed movement, this time over my right shoulder.  Coming out of the bushes next to one of the apartment buildings across the street was a caveman!!  I stopped in mid sentence and my friend noticed and followed my eyes.  He then asked me if I saw what he was seeing.  I said that yes, I see a caveman!!  We both watched as the caveman parted the bushes holding what looked like a large tree branch in his left hand.  He was not very tall and had on what looked like brown fur around his mid-section.  The color of his skin was light beige.  He didn&apos;t make a sound but stared at us as we stared at him.  What broke the concentration was when I screamed.  The caveman then started coming towards us--but he moved like he was under water or mechanical.  I could NOT move from where I was standing because I could NOT stop staring at this very strange sight!  Finally my friend grabbed my hand and said to me to stop staring and start running!  I had on a pair of yellow Japanese shoes that I had to kick off because my friend was pulling me so fast.  I turned to look behind us and the caveman was so close that I could see that his bared mouth bore yellow teeth.  When he ran, it was in that mechanical, under water way--like he could not control his movements--but that didn&apos;t stop him from moving so fast!  He looked like he was caught in the beams of a strobe light.  As we reached the steps of my building, I looked back again but only saw his hand as it was ready to grab me just under my shoulder.  Thank goodness the building&apos;s main entrance door was always unlocked!!  We got in the building and my apartment door was unlocked as well (because my siblings were home).  I locked the apartment door behind us and we both ran to the front window to see if we could see him anywhere but all we saw were my parents who were just pulling up.  We both looked at each other in puzzlement, then ran right back to the door--he snatched it open only to find an empty entryway.  The caveman was gone just that quick!  We both ran out to help my parents with the groceries--both talking a mile a minute about our experience.  When we got back inside, my mom asked us what the thing in the sky looked like.  We described it to her and my dad.  My mom suddenly had to sit down and they both just stared at each other.  My Mom then told us that that was the same object they saw, along with about 50 others, just the week before.  They had been stopped at a light at a very busy intersection and she said everyone was jumping out of their cars pointing at it.  She said they all got an excellent look at it because it was moving slowly across the sky.  I remember her showing us the newspaper clipping about it.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))", "I saw an object hovering high in the sky above my houseI went to my kitchen sink to wash my hands and felt like I should look up into the sky through my kitchen window above the sink.  I saw an object hovering very high in the sky above my property.  It looked like it could be an airplane but it was not moving.  It had a white light in the middle and two red lights on either side of it. I thought it was odd that it did not move naturally like an airplane as I continued to stare at it, it finally moved over my home and out of my sight.

Did not hover.May or June 1980 (Five Witnesses) Oklahoma City, Oklahoma  Location: N. Portland Avenue, Oklahoma City between 8:00 and 8:30 P.M. We observed two bright objects, parallel to each other some distance away.  The objects were extremely bright and circular in shape.  At first, it didn&apos;t seem to be that unusual, because they were aligned with a transmitting signal tower (radio, television or cable station), the objects blended symmetrically with the tower, that is, until one of the objects shirfted its position.  The circular objects were still positioned on either side of the tower, except one of the objects was higher than the other. Before the sudden movement, I had been ready to head back inside the building, but this definitely caught my attention.  Suddenly, the object on the left side of the signal tower moved diagonally up and out of sight, and the object on the right side re-appeared directly over our heads.  The movements were made simultaneously. The craft over my head was approximatedly 15, possibly 20 feet directly above where I was standing.  If I had had a fire engine ladder I could have touched this thing.  For some reason, I was not scared, I just stood there looking up, saying - &quot;That&apos;s a &apos;blanking&apos; UFO.&quot; I must have said it five or six times, with no real excitement in my voice.  I stayed very calmed.  The craft remained there for about twenty, or thirty seconds.  I remember turning my head slowly, from left to right while looking straight up (head tilted completely back) to see the full scope of this craft. When I regained my senses, I realized I was standing out there alone.  The other four witnesses had scattered, obviously frightened.  I don&apos;t remember how or when, but I must have gone back into the building to retrieve my purse and keys, because all I can remember next, is driving home. While driving, I could see military jes flying in formation, two or three at a time, darting across the sky in all directions.  There was a lot of activity in the skies that night.  I had had the car radio on and the DJ was talking about sightings in Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas and several other states.  It could have been Arizona instead of Kansas, I just can&apos;t remember.  This only reinforced my sense of reality.  Anyway, the next day the radio person announced that the military, or some official agency had issued a statement saying the sightings were merely weather balloons. When I was asked a few days later to describe what I saw, all I could say was it appeared to change shape depending on its angle of observation.  It wasn&apos;t circular as it originally appeared in the sky, or triangular.  It was more...uniquely shaped.  What I assumed to be the front was hexangular in shape, and the angles appeared longer toward the rear, and more so on its right side, forming a rectangle toward the back right.  This object had some unique dimenional geometry.  I remember thinking later that it had extraordinary aerodynamics.  I only saw the bottom and not the top or sides.  Although, I do recall a picture of the craft on the Phil Donahue show that would have aired sometime in &apos;88 or&apos;89.  Someone, I think in Texas had taken the picture of the craft at a higher altitude.  I only caught a few moments of the show on my way out the door. This object did not hover. Hover to me, means slight movement while trying to maintain the exact location and altitude.  This object was stationary, solid matter, a solid mass suspended by some unknowned energy.  It defied gravity.  I do not recall any radiating heat, or hearing any sound.  And, because I could visually see the entire craft, I would guessimate the craft to be 1200 to 1500 sq. ft. in circumference with some type of grid outline on the bottom.  I think I saw lights within the grid, but I&apos;m not certain.  It didn&apos;t appear to be shiny or brightly lit, while suspended above my head.  I seem to recall it was grayish-silver color.  What I cannot explain is the speed of this craft.  It&apos;s like it manipulated, folded or enveloped the air space in dimensions I haven&apos;t... Yeah! I can&apos;t explain it.  Its departure was fractionally subliminal and left no residual effects.  It was beyond my level of intelligence, nothing I could wrap my mind around. This sighting as it unfolded would have had Einstein either scratching his head or beaming with delight.  Either way, I&apos;m no Einstein or Newton.  It definitely wasn&apos;t a figment of my imagination. I am not saying I saw an alien spacecraft from some other galaxy.  I&apos;m simply describing an Unidentified Flying Object.  However, if we do have his type of technology here on this planet, then someone or some organization has developed a way to manipulate gravity and the speed of light.  Moreover, there must be a higher degree of mathematics, way beyond calculus and trigonometry that a secret select group of scientists haven&apos;t shared with the little minds of planet earth, because this definitely defies general physics and gravity, as we know it.  It is a form of energy that is mind-boggling. To this day I believe I had a visual close encounter of some kind.  I have never wavered in what I saw that day.  Trying to explain the encounter is extrememly difficut, or next to impossible due to lack of knowledge and things beyond my comprehension.  I cannot remember who said this, but they captured my frustration in a nutshell:  &quot;For those who understand, no explanation is necessary.  For those who do not understand, no explanation is possible.:((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of event is approximate.

I asked them if they had seen the object that was hovering in the sky to the north of us. They all said no and immediately came over to our front walk to get a better view. The object had been there for about five minutes as I had been watching it during my walk home. What attracted me initially was the fact it was pulsating sort of a cherry red to light mauve or soft purple color. I went into the house and got my binoculars and we watched with the glasses for about ten more minutes, suddenly it sped off to the Northwest, there is a large 1200 meter hill or mountain close by, just as it appeared that it was going to hit the mountain it suddenly made a right angle turn and shot straight up and disappeared. We stood around for another ten or fifteen minutes talking about what we had seen and then dispersed. Two days later there was a report in the Victoria newspaper of a sighting by a gentleman living in an area some 7 miles to the north, he claimed the &quot;object&quot; was over Duncan. The interesting thing is that directly between this gentleman&apos;s locale and Duncan, there is a hydro station that draws DC current from the mainland and converts it back into AC current for distribution to Lake Cowichan areas. This object had to be positioned directly above these transmission line. It is our theory (and it is only a theory) that the &quot;object&quot; required some form of electrical energy for propulsion.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

My mother was in the center front and Dad was driving north on old highway 75 neaar Conroe Tx. headed home to Corsicana, Tx. My clear memory is aided by the many times I heard both parents relate the story to others who voiced simular experiences.  As we traveled up a slight hill with a curve at the top to the right, traveling approximately 60mph, a semi-circle of five or six bright white lights came over the hill following the road, straight at but above our car at what appeared to be less than 100ft. in the air.  There was no sound but our engine.  Immediately in front of our car the object [or objects in formation] made an abrubt, right angle turn to the right, our left, toward the west and quickly disappeared over a row of trees about 200ft. off the highway.  After a moment of stunned silence, my Dad said, &quot;Did you see that damn thing?&quot;, to which both my mother and I responded, &quot;Yes, what was it?&quot;  None of us had a clue.  Desperate for a solution, Mother said, &quot;Maybe it was our car lights on highwires&quot;.  Dad quickly pointed out that there were none.  Even more desperately she said, &quot;Maybe it was birds&quot;. &quot;With bright lights tied on?&quot;, responded Dad.  &quot;Well, she searched, &quot;Maybe they got into flourescent paint&quot;?&quot;.  Frustrated, Dad bluntly said &quot;No.  That was some kind of object or several objects doing something I have never seen before&quot;.

The object was real, it made a manuver impossible for any then [or now] known aircraft, made no noise, and, importantly, we were not &quot;programed&quot; for such an experience. I could add much more about another highly anomolous light performace I observed with one other unknown witness in the mid 1950&apos;s. There are many credible, first hand observations related to me, such as one by an ex-fighter pilot, a geologist, scrambled out of Japan to pursue a clearly visable fire orange craft that played can and mouse with him until altitude forced him to turn back [it was his frightening debriefing that was the real story], a private pilot for and oil company CEO viewing a spinning &quot;top-shaped object&quot; in day light over West Texas, a very conservative Episcopal priest with a daytime viewing of a  circular craft near and slow enough to observe windows along the side, and many other clear, detailed, objective sightings that, like mine, have never been reported.

He said &quot;Come here for a minute.&quot; I got up, annoyed (as only a teenager interrupted from the TV can be), and went the the back of the house. I stood at the screen door and asked what he wanted. I was told to come out of the door. As I came around the door and closed it behind me, my dad inclined his head and pointed toward the western horizon. &quot;What is that?&quot; he asked me.I turned to look, and what I saw were, as I recall, 5 small white lights closely clustered together, slowly moving west-east, toward us.One of the lights was blinking. &quot;I&apos;ve been watching that for about 5 minutes,&quot; he said. &quot;I watched it come over the trees. Is that a plane or helicopter?&quot; I said that no, it sure didn&apos;t look like either a plane or a helicopter.The lights were too close together, for one, and planes (and helicopters) usually have multicolored blinking lights; blue, red, white, etc. Besides, a plane flew past it (of course, it could have been miles away, but from our perspective, it passed close to the object), and we were able to compare the two. It was no plane.We watched it for perhaps another 5 minutes or so, until it was nearly overhead, and as it disappeared behind the village&apos;s water tower that was two lots over from our house. We waited for it to come out from behind the water tower, which would have put it almost directly over our house at perhaps 1 o&apos;clock. It never did.

At 11 p.m., CST, I returned to my then home at ---- N. Emporia, Wichita, KS, parked my car so it was facing east beside my house, turned off my headlights, and in the dark was left with a vision of an object in front of me in the sky like none I had ever seen before or since.  It was huge, cigar-shaped object located about 300 feet in the air above me, about 30 feet east in front of me so that I was not looking straight up, but rather at about an 75 degree angle. It was about a block long and blocked my view of the stars on an otherwise clear night.  It had three flashing lights in a forward-direction-pointing pattern located at its right trailing edge.  It emitted absolutely no sound whatsoever that I could hear, and I have exceptionally good hearing.  How could something that big hover and descend in a fixed direction on a windless, clear night without making any sound? This huge object was moving ever so slowly forward north and descending ever so slowly (just a few feet per minute) towards the massive complex of over 100 Cargill grain elevators on 13th street.I sat in my car for what seemed like at least three minutes scanning my memory for any identifiable object to match what I was seeing and I could find none.  I then got out of my car and moved closer on the ground to watch it.  I stood there for a time as well, but I seemed to lose track of time, maybe another three minutes. However long it was, I still could not come up with any sort of answer as to what I was looking at.  There was nothing in my associative memory to compare it to.  I felt profoundly awed by what I saw and I felt nauseatingly dumbfounded that I could not figure out what it was.Finally, when I could handle my unknowing no longer, I knew I had to take action.  The only traction in terms of evidence and logic my brain had to go on at the time was that there was a very large object moving downwards and in the a northerly direction toward on a path that would soon put it on a direct collision course with one of the world&rsquo;s largest wheat grain elevator complexes run by Cargill, just one block away on 13th street.  I was concerned that it this huge object hit one or more of those 100 plus grain elevators, there could be a massive grain dust explosion causing extensive death and destruction.Once this horrific thought crossed my mind, I knew I had to call the police and warn them of this imminent danger.  I managed to pull myself out of my awestruck paralysis and go inside to make the call.  The Wichita Police were grateful for my call.  They said they had been getting reports of such an object from all over town and asked me if they could send an officer out to interview me, to which I of course agreed.  The police said they even had one of their helicopters aloft trying to locate and identify this mystery object. They also said the local McConnell Air Force Base people claimed it was not one of their activities and they may even have sent out some planes to locate and identify it, though nothing I know of was ever reported by them.After I got off the phone with the police, I raced back outside to see what progress this object had made.  To my complete surprise, the object was altogether gone.  I got in my car and drove around the area to the north and east and back the other way in hopes of seeing some sign of it.  I never saw it again.The police came out and took my detailed report, which the Wichita police records clerk says was filed January 12, 1980 under the heading, &quot;Three Flashing Lights&quot;.Shortly thereafter a reporter from the Wichita Eagle Beacon came out and interviewed me.  I was still in shock and awe from what I had seen, and afraid I would be considered some kind of a nut case.  Therefore, I tried to conceal my fear and defend myself from scorn by trying to appear calm and rational, even to the point of trying to normalize or even minimalize and dismiss what I had seen. I told the reporter words to the effect that it was either a very large blimp, a weather balloon, or a very elaborate little hoax.  I was pretty sure it was none of those things, but I had nothing else to reference it to and to speculate any further was quite frightening.Before he left, the reporter gave me the name of the National UFO Reporting Center in Seattle and the phone number should I want to make a formal report.  I am sorry to say that I did not call that night as I was too shaken up and afraid to do so.  Big things were happening to me, it seemed, and I was already way over my head.  Therefore, lest I go crazy, it seemed best to lie low and see if the rest of the world, or some part of it, had seen what I had seen.  It is only now, 25 years later, that I am able to file this report, thanks mainly to the Peter Jennings ABC program aired here Thursday, 2/24/05, and viewed by me tonight, Friday, 2/25/05, via digital video recorder.  It was a great program and confirmed many of the details of what I saw and the psychological reactions people had to this experience.  Thanks to all who brought this information forward and presented it so well.I am very excited and have much more to say, but I know I don&rsquo;t have the space to do that here.  Suffice it to say that two days later, on 1/13/1980, the Wichita Eagle/Beacon Newspaper printed the story of what I and apparently two dozen other Wichitans saw on Friday, 1/11/1980.  The article is titled &quot;It&rsquo;s a Balloon, It&rsquo;s a UFO, It&rsquo;s a Mystery,&quot; and it appears on page 2E of the Sunday, January 13, 1980 edition of the Wichita Eagle/Beacon newspaper.  Since it does not seem possible to attach a scanned PDF copy of the actual newspaper article to this description, and since I realize you may not have the time or desire to look up the article from the paper&rsquo;s microfiche, I will copy it, (deleting names and contact information to preserve anonymity even though all interviewees openly gave their names and addresses for publication), for you here: ((BEGIN TEXT OF ARTICLE))Headline:  &quot;It&rsquo;s a Balloon, It&rsquo;s a UFO, It&rsquo;s a Mystery.&quot;  Reporter:  Susan Edgerley, Staff Writer Body Copy:  &quot;Midnight Friday, Pharmacist (fist and last name #1) and a friend have been square dancing.

It was a bright, clear and beautiful sunny day. My brother in law had a spool of kite string on his big toe and laying on the ground. All of a sudden he said &quot;look!&quot; We all looked up and saw a formation of saucer like disks in silver color. They were just hovering over the park quietly, no noise. They in a v shape like birds fly. All of a sudden they took off at a high rate of speed. This was a mass sighting. I tried to look up sightings over the enternet but haven&apos;t found any around that time. If anyone saw this they could draw a picture without mentioning it to them, I&apos;m sure. That would prove it really happened. There were to many witnesses.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

The belt was clearly visible as were all other stars, not even a wisp of cloud. Surmised there were 4 objects, large, dark and very high, obstructing my view of just those 4 stars! This caused me great anxiety, finally after 15 minutes went into the house to gather my wits.

I  suddenly saw a craft hovering over the tree tops right above the road just ahead of my car.  It was just getting dark and trees still lined both sides of the road in those days, so the outline of the craft was very prominent. I remember screeming out loud: &quot;Oh, my God.  It&apos;s a blimp...no it&apos;s not a blimp&quot; as I was trying to rationalize what the object might be.  At the same time these thoughts were racing through my mind, I was slamming on my brakes and backing out from under the craft as fast as I could.  I somehow found a driveway to turn around in as I was shaking and crying so hard I could barely drive.  When I got to my friend&apos;s house, I found she and her family were all in bed asleep and it seemed to be much later than it should have been (around 10:30-11 p.m.)  My friend&apos;s family wanted to report my sighting to McChord, but for some reason I felt like I needed to get home right away.  I drove back past the same spot (very cautiously) and made it home okay.  I was still so frightened that I jumped into bed with all my clothes on and went to sleep immediately.  When I awoke the next morning the sun was shining and birds were chirping and it was as if nothing had happened the night before.

I am a very experienced and educated man. with 20/15 eyesight. I understand depth perception, etc. this had the depth of a planetary body. these were not airplanes, they had the depth of planets. planes usually have a flashing light and disappear with depth horizon slowly and systematicly.

I know what a shooting star or meteorite is and what it looks like.....This was not a meteorite!  Meteorites very clearly appear in the stratosphere move downward motion, have tails and burnout....This was not That.Finally, the third sighting was the grandest of all; it did the same as the other two got bright white, and then as it was directly over my head it Burned Bright Amber or orange as if it were acknowledge me, I felt its presents and again completely disappeared right over my head.  Now I&apos;ve heard Scholars refer to Chapter in Bible Ezekiel refer to Amber disks as being heavenly Angels. Do you think that is what this is?  Amber Disks like the ones from Ezekiel?

These were not contrails.  In fact, that is one of the important points I would want to make about this.  There were several other planes in the sky that day, and they ALL made contrails.  This object, or formation of jets, made these white &quot;balls&quot; instead. They would appear the way an image can be &quot;swiped&quot; onto a screen with a special effect.  Each group of rows were confined within in a rectangle-shaped area. Although it is possible to have jets sky-write with a similar teqhnique, the width of the rows and the fact that we could not see any planes at all makes me doubt it.  Even though we could see all the other planes in the sky, including high altitude ones, which you could at least make out the mass of the body, i.e., darker area in the front of it&apos;s contrail, we could never locate the objects that were responsible, with the naked eye.  Also, this didn&apos;t take place in a small corner of the sky, it covered miles in several directions...back and forth several times before they disappeard.

Me and two of my friends were were at the swimming pool in our apartments at approx. 4:00pm. A silver, not shiny, disc/saucer shaped object, very large with what appeared to be some lights flew over head.  It was going slow enough that we could tell what it was - maybe 30 MPH.  It is hard to judge the distance of height in the air - much much lower than a small airplane would fly.  I remember feeling stunned, and not quite believing what just happened.  It went towards Cougar Mountain in Issaquah.  We told my friend&apos;s older brother about it - he and a friend went up on an old dirt logging road the next day and found a spot where the brush/grass had been &quot;flattened&quot; in a large circular area.I have wondered all these years if anyone else experienced this sighting in Issaquah or the Seattle area.  No one really wanted to believe us back then - who believes a 9 year old who says she&apos;s seen a UFO? I have always believed in other life out there because of this sighting and I know it&apos;s just a matter of time before the truth becomes known to this world.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

I was able to view this object for a period of 5 minutes when I was able to grab my digital camera.  I used the max setting for distance and took a picture.  To my surprise and shock I was able to have the camera record detail that my eye was unable to see. The best way to describe what was photogrphed is to picture an egg sunny side up, slightly tilted in the pan.  My camera caught what appears to be a saucer shaped disc with a concentrated black inner circle that appears to be atop the disc.  But the amazing detail is that it is surrounded by a brilliant white &quot;albumen&quot; that engulfs the saucer.  This white albumen was not visible to  my eye.

The other person with me at the time of sighting was the trainer at the same farm.Myself and the other person were transporting a load of 6 horses from a farm in Houston to our base farm in Waco Tx at night.  Around 10:15 pm we pulled over to check the horses, water them ( it was a very warm night)  We opened up the side door of the transport and proceeded to tend to the horses. We were driving a semi tractor trailer type transport A few minutes later we noticed the horse getting agitated, ears flicking back and forth, breathing heavier, stomping their hooves. The other person stepped out of the transport  to see if there was a coyote or something they caught scent of, he saw nothing.  The horses agitation increased At around 10:30  my companion called me to come outside the trailer I did. He pointed up to the sky, northwest direction, I looked. There was a patch of the sky that was darker than the rest, and the stars were blocked out. It appeared to be moving towards us in a southeast direction At that time the semi started to run roughly, the lights started to dim all over it and inside the trailer. The horses were quite agitated at this point.The dark spot in the sky was now almost overhead and we were aware it was a triangle shape, and very large. In my estimation it was over 2 football fields long, or over the length of my outreached hand to the sky, I did that to try to judge the size.As it passed overhead there was no sound. It was definitely a solid object, had a appearence of metal, possibly stone, or another hard surface. And as it passed over  the semi tractor trailer ceased running,like the fuel wasn&apos;t getting to the engine and the lights faded  to going totally off. The horses were very nervous by this time.After approx. 10 minutes ( the object moved slowly) it had passed completely over us and was heading in the southeast direction still.  As it got farther away the semi tractor trailer started back up, the lights came back on, both gradually as if they were filling from being drained off or something. the horses settled as it got farther away as well.Both of us were shaken at this experience, and have never forgotten it to this day  We watched the object until it disappeared from decent view which was around 11pm  then closed up the trailer, and proceeded on our way to Waco.Neither of us have spoken or reported this until this past year. Only to the Coast to Coast radio website, and have told a few close friends.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))", "PEMBROKE PINES FLORIDA. DISC SHAPED ORANGE CRAFT. SILENT AN SLOW MOVINGUFO Sighting Friday July 3rd 1992    On Friday evening, July 3rd 1992 I invited a number of guests to enjoy a Pool-Party with neighbors of mine. We lived in Pembroke Pines Florida near Ft Lauderdale.  At around dusk, which was probably around 7:00 pm, I heard my neighbors who were in my back yard yelling for me to come outside as a UFO was passing directly over my yard.As I came out, I was stunned to see the brightest orange object I have ever seen in my life. The craft was flying several thousand feet in the air. The size of the object was about 50 to 75 feet across. The object was disc-shaped. The color orange was so bright; you could not make out any details of the bottom of the craft. The craft made absolutely no noise and was cruising rather slowly in a north-to south direction. Upon realizing this, I quickly called my brother who lived due south of me in Miami to run outside with his video camera to capture this incredible sight. Unfortunately, when I called, my brother was not home.The local Miami FOX news channel however, did receive video footage of this event and broadcasted it the next day.If you want any further information of this sighting please call me at 206-((number deleted))  Not that this should matter, but I am a certified helicopter pilot with excellent vision and acuity.

The mall was ready to close so the time was about 10pm when we were driving back to our apartment which was located off of progress avenue on the hill above Widener University school of law.  I was riding in the passenger seat and notices a round, yellowish light in the sky.  Then what seemed a few feet to the right of that light another light &quot;turned on&quot;.  Then another and another.  Ultimately, there were six lights in the sky that looked like this:    O   O   O   O   O   O.  I told my roomate to pull the car over.  When he did the lights were gone.  I got out of the car and noticed a very small red dot in the sky.  It was a light.  It was moving very, very fast from right to left, then up and down and all over the place.  Then it would stop.  Once it was stopped, a few seconds later the light formation would start again like I described above.  We drove around the backroads there for about an hour following it.  What scared my the most about this UFO was that someone apparently saw on 9/18/02 (posted on this site on 3/21/03). The strangest part is when we got very close to the lights.  Right by this old farm house that has a big pond on the side of their home.  I was very familiar with this road becuase it was a very beautiful place to walk/run as I would often jog on that road for exercise.  We pulled over into the driveway of the farm house.  We pulled over because there was anohter man who had seen the light and pulled over also. We got out of the car.  At that time there was only one light and it was floating toward us.  It came over a bunch of pine trees and across a field directly toward me and my roomate.  He got scared as it got to about 40 yards from us.  He begged for me to get in the car but I couldn&apos;t move.  I wasn&apos;t scared.  I was amazed.  He got back into his car.  The light came toward me and the stranger that had pulled over.  It was getting closer and closer.  It was a large, warm glowing light.  It was beautiful.  I felt no danger.  It&apos;s weird to say this but I felt very safe, almost like I was being comforted a bit somehow.  It sounds stupid but it&apos;s true.  Well, as the light got closer, now it was about 20 yards away, a car came down the road from our right and the way the road bends the cars headlights blinded me and the stranger.  When the car passed us the light was gone and that&apos;s how the entire incident ended.  The stranger jumped in his car and took off.  My roomate was yelling at me at that point to get in the car.  We went back to our apartment and called all our frineds.  They didn&apos;t believe us becasue it was April fools day.  I called 911 and told them what I saw.Well, the next day in class I drew a picture of the formation of lights for one of my frineds.  One month later that friend called me and told me to turn on the tv.  In May of 1996 there was a similar sighting in Arizona and it was on videotape.  My friend was freaked out becuase of my drawing and how much it looked like the UFO over Arizona.  We wereI was apparently not the only person in Harrisburg to see that UFO that night as it made the local news.  They discounted it as a flare from an f-16 which is used as a decoy from heat seaking missles.  I found it interesting when the Arizona UFO was discounted they same way, saying it was a flare.  If the government has a flare that can float and hover and light up for over an hour then fine.  That&apos;s what I saw.  However, the flare that they showed on the news that the f-16&apos;s drop fall to the ground like a brick.  That&apos;s not what we saw.  I&apos;d love to talk to the girls that saw the similar UFO on 9/18/02.

There was a slight haze (maybe reflected light off of clouds) around the lights. My first impression was fireworks or flares of some kind, however, these lights were hovering, and not falling, (like flares) or extinguishing (like fireworks). The large cluster was visible for about 2 miles (driving at 45mph), then were cut off from view by a shelter belt. After passing said shelter belt, three were still visible. We then drove towards the holyrood area just to gawk. (Hey, it was interesting OK?) The size of the lights never seemed to change, though after six miles, perspective demonstrated the lights to be over 300 feet in the air. Only two were visible at this point, and much higher than the red warning light on Holyrood&apos;s grain elevator, and possibly at great distance, since they seemed to stay in a given area thought the red lights postion changed with distance our vehicle traversed. These two remained until 10 to 15 minutes after we returned home (three more miles). I do not know or claim as what they were, as I just saw hovering lights. However, the color was wrong for any type of aircraft searchlight (second though I had) or aircraft designator or landing lights (third thought).", "07/15/1975  Dover,NJ Apprx 12 boomerang shape disks w/red center light hovering 2 hrs.1 larger than others.02/25/05On a summer evening in mid-July 1975,my boyfriend and I were saying good night in Wharton,NJ.We both observed several boomerang shaped disks with a red light in the center.One was larger than the rest.They were all hovering and the smaller ones would move only if the large one moved first.They would follow it quickly in a haphazard manner, kind of jutting around in the sky until they would stop and hover near the large craft.

We got tired and went to bed.I have been hesitant to tell anyone this story because my family and close friends never did believe me and still tease me about it to this day.I would guess there were about one dozen of these boomerang shaped crafts.All had a red light in the center and although it was dark,appeared to be solid gray or black.They appeared to be hovering over the town of Dover as we faced them and watched intently for so long.Once the police laughed at me,what was I to do?Who else could I call?It feels so good to finally tell my story to someone who doesn&apos;t think I&apos;m crazy.I know what I saw.Thanks for listening.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

I wanted my wife to see them but was fixated on watching and figured she would not have time to get outside before they were gone. My watching time was a couple of minutes or so and I immediately knew I was seeing something not natural/normal. I was watching six or more bright orange lights in a V formation (like a boomerang) moving slowly at a low altitude. There was no sound. The minute it had passed I went in the house and told Mother and wife what I had just seen. I wondered if others had also witnessed the happening. The next morning it was big news and was seen by  hundreds from towns starting  in northern Arizona.....through Phoenix and on down to Tucson. I called the Arizona Republic and told the reporter what I had seen and assured her I was not into UFO happenings and was hopeful of an explanation. To this day a reasonable explanation has never been given.(I am a retired corporate VP living in North Phoenix)", "I WAS AT HOME ON THE DRIVE WAY AWAKE .I HAVE A SMALL UNKNOWN SCAR ON CHEST CENTER BUT I DONT KNOW ANTHING THAY DID.

It was approximately 9:00 PM.  It was a moonlit night, and there were many cumulus clouds in the sky that were bright white from the moonlight.  I was sitting outside my house with 4 of my neighbor friends when I noticed a very large object slowly drifting across the sky.  All of us saw it.  The object was extremely large; much larger than a blimp.  I would estimate the size to be at least 100 yards in length.  At first I could not tell the altitude of the object but then realized that it was very close because it blocked out the clouds as it silently drifted over us.  I listened carefully for an engine noise, but there was none audible.  The object was irregularly shaped.  The best way I can describe it was that it looked like a large rock; appearing at least 4 times larger in diameter than it was in height.  The object was rough and had many craters (resembling the texture of asteroids I&apos;ve seen photos of).  The craters emitted a dull glowing red-orange light.  I could not actually see the source of this light, the light instead seemed to be reflecting off the craters of the object from a source within it.  The object did not vary in speed, direction, or altitude.  The object was visible for at least 5 minutes before it finally drifted out of sight.During the sighting I knocked (no banged) on several neighbors doors to have them also witness what my friends and I were seeing in the sky.  When the neighbors would come outside to find out what was going on they were awestruck with what they saw in the sky.  It was no doubt to any of us that what we saw was not of this world, and was a UFO.The next day I looked in the St. Petersburg Times Newspaper for information about what we saw the previous night.  I was sure that many hundreds of people must have seen the same thing we saw in the sky.  I thought that surely it was reported by many people.  I finally found a very small article in the back of the paper that said (to paraphrase)  &quot;There were numerous reports of an unidentified object in the sky last night.  There is no need to be alarmed, it has been confirmed that this was only space debris&quot;.&quot;Space Debris!!!&quot; I thought...... Well this was no space debris.  I am sure that the object was within our atmosphere because it blocked out the clouds as it drifted overhead.  The object had no wings.  It had no engine or propulsion device that I could see nor hear.  This object should have fallen to the ground if it were space debris, but instead it defied gravity and drifted across the sky.I am sure that this sighting must have been reported to UFO reasearchers by others that also witnessed it.  I did not save a copy of the article that I read so recently I attempted to search the database of the St. Petersburg Times to find an archive of this article but the database online does not go back that far.  I am hoping that there is eveidence on file of this sighting.  Could you please tell me if you have any record of this.  As I mentioned this was a very large UFO and plainly visible in the evening at approximately 21:00 hours.

As the unknown object continued its northeast path, at least two other hight flying jets came into view (separately) but again, this object was higher and much brighter.Under magnified vision, I was unable to ascertain the true shape of this object but, the light was a solid mass (no smaller lights), and the white light had a silver tint to it. What really made it different for me was that it was one large area of light. I kept thinking that this object was much larger and brighter than all the satellites I&apos;ve seen before.For all I know, I was viewing the space station. I just don&apos;t know.After about five minutes, it went out of viewing range, still heading northeast. At one point, when it was passing between the earth and Polaris, I thought I detected a directional change, to the east but, I may be mistaken.The night was the first clear night we&apos;ve had in days and the temperature was around 70 degrees.

I would not have sent this report but another sighting 2 days later from a different individual describing the same type spheres this time as three were seen at 12:00am several miles from the first sighting in the same county.

We had just made a left turn on Boydes Creek Road heading east toward Servierville TN, when I first noticed a strange, very large, little in the sky a mile or so ahead. At first I only glazed at it and did not mention anything to my father. As we got closer to the object I saw the there were three individual lights with no pulse and it was completely motionless.It was at that point that I asked my father what he thought it was. He immediately anwsered, &quot;It&apos;s a plane,&quot; but as he looked closer he too noticed the lack of flashing lights and its stationary position. At this time we could both see that the three lights were in a triangle formation, but could see nothing of a vessel. The light were only about 100 yards to our left and no more than 100 feet in altitude. My father then began to slow down in the middle of the highway, and as we came to an almost complete stop the object began to move away from us in a norhtwest direction almost like it knew we were looking(spooky). As we came to a full stop I already had begun to exit the vehicle when I immediately noticed no sound. My father and I both stood outside the car for about 30 seconds as we watched it fly away and never heard any sound except for those of nature.The objects speed and movment was unlike anything either of us had ever seen. It seemed to go from a dead stop to an estimated 100 mph instantly, and then continued at that same velosity until we had to return to our vehicle. After we began to drive away my father called a co-worker who was in the car ahead of us. He to saw the lights with no flash and not moveing. He did not, however, stop or see it move.", "UFO following Chemtrails in Bridgewater, New JerseyI was sitting in my car watching the daily chemtrail being laid, when I saw a silver, shiny oval shape, silently traveling south over Finderne Ave in the opposite direction of the the trail, but next to it.  Then about 10 seconds later I saw a commercial aircraft following the UFO in same direction. I was able to compare the two and the were distinctly different.((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the &quot;chemtrails&quot; reported above were, in fact, normal contrails behind high-altitude aircraft.

I looked and was shocked. It was quite large, too close for satellite or star, and too big and usual for aircraft. It hovered with no sound. We continued driving, keeping our eyes on this light. When I arrived at my friend&apos;s home, I pulled into her driveway and turned off the headlights. We watched the lit object for about 20 seconds, and then it zipped away with no sound. I do mean &quot;zipped&quot;. No aircraft can hover in the air and take off and away at the speed we witnessed. There was no gradual speed, but instant speed. And then it was gone.

It was almost dark as we turned off the lake into Beaver Creek.  We immediately noticed a large red light blinking about 1/4 mile up the creek that looked similar to a radio tower light only we knew there was no radio tower at that location.  Then we thought it might be a helicopter since it wasn&apos;t moving.  Mr ((name deleted)) cut the engine on the boat but there was no sound coming from that direction.  As we sat there pondering what it might be, the light intensefied and started moving slowly at first coming our way.  It then picked up speed and passed by us at tree top level about 150 feet away, the light turning from red to greenish white and was about the size of a school bus.  As the light moved out over the lake, it suddenly shot almost straight up at a tremendous speed turning solid white and looked like it went up into the stars. As we all sat there completely amazed, the light started moving back our way and when it got back over our location, it started moving in a &quot;box&quot; formation directly overhead.  We sat and watched this thing for several minutes.  Mr. ((name deleted)) then fired up the engine and we started back up the lake to his marina which was about four miles away. When we had gotten about half-way up the lake, the soldier hollered: &quot;The Damn thing is coming back at us&quot;.  We all turned to look and it was coming down about a 45 degree angle and was growing in size.  Mr. ((name deleted)) shoved the throttle to the firewall and we were moving about 70 MPH when suddenly, on a very dark night, a beam or shaft of light suddenly hit our boat, turning night into day and lighting up the lake immensily.  It scared the heck out of all of us.  Mr ((name deleted)) turned off the lake into the creek leading to his marina running flat out and there was a highway bridge that we had to pass under.  As we approached the bridge, the light suddenly went out and he &quot;shot&quot; that bridge (which only had about a ten foot clearance)and barely missed the pilings.  When we got back to the dock, we all discussed what we had seen for several minutes and then decided that none of us would tell what we had seen since we thought no one would surely believe us.  We only had one six-pack of beer between the four of us, so no one was drunk or even high for that matter.  We made a pact to say absolutely nothing about this incident for 20 years and as far as I know, not one of us broke that pact.

Conditions were very bright and clear. We were all out on our roof garden enjoying the great weather and my girlfriend, who was lying on her back sunbathing, suddenly pointed straight up and said &quot;whats that up there?&quot;  At first my friend and I couldnt really see anything obvious and this wasnt helped by the brightness of the sky or the fact that we didnt know what we were looking for.However within a few seconds of scanning the area my partner was indicating, we managed to spot what had captured her attention. It appeared to be a small shiny silvery-white sphere, just hanging there above us - it was impossible really to say if they were very small or very high, but they were probably at least a few thousand feet high. Within a few seconds of spotting this sphere i noticed another one, and then another and then more. They were all in the same area of the sky and i think there were between 7-9 altogether, either just hanging there or moving very slowly. At first we thought they might be birds but their movement was not consistent with this idea, no circling or anything - just stationary or drifting very slowly. As we stood watching them, over a period of 4-5 mins they gradually moved into a &apos;V&apos; formation directly above us and stayed stationary in this position for several minutes - we realised then for sure that they couldnt have been balloons either and this was something out of the ordinary. We became quite excited at this point and i ran indoors to get my camera and our friend dashed of to his car to get his binoculars. However, by the time we got back the spheres had begun to break formation and drift apart. Looking through the binoculars didnt show any further detail,  but we could definitely see that they were solid objects. I put my 70-210mm telephoto lens on my SLR and snapped off a few pictures, one at around 70mm showing 3 of the spheres in the frame and another at 210mm showing just one. I have enclosed scans of the prints. Upon enlarging the scan of the 210mm zoomed picture a little more detail became evident, showing in fact the object is not a sphere but more teardrop or shell shaped. It also seems to show a small trail or maybe a puff of gas venting  ?  Anyway, as we continued watching they all just moved off very slowly in different directions until they were out of sight. I&apos;d say the total duration of the sighting was approx 10-15 mins. Unfortunately after later finishing off the roll of film i mislaid it and it didnt turn up again until a few weeks ago, which is why this report is so overdue.

The sun was slowly setting in the sky and it was a beautiful, but somewhat chilly, early summers evening. We drove past the entrance to baxter state park and continued north on the state road which, at the time, had been closed to vehicular traffic as it was being utilized as a logging tote road due to the logging operations in the area. Having lived out of state for a few years, and home for the fourth of July holiday, I commented to my brother, my surprise that they were havesting timber so close to the park.  About that time my soon to be sister-in-law exclaimed &quot;Did you see that? Did you see that flash of light?&quot;  My brother replied that he did but my wife and I stated that we didn&apos;t see it but intrigued, I stopped the truck and we all looked off towards the right side of the road where they said that it had come from. As we were sitting there talking about what they had seen, the bright flash occurred again and instantaneously the truck died. No lights, no radio, nothing! The ignition key was still turned on but the truck was entirely dead. This time, all of us saw the flash of light. Spooked, I opened the drivers side door and got half-way out of the vehicle, scanned the area and got back in, leaving the drivers side door open.  I turned the key to start the engine, tried the horn, and the headlights, all to no avail for a period of about 2 minutes.  As we sat there talking about what had occured, with my wife sarcastically accusing me of &quot;Using the dead battery trick&quot;, the trucks&apos; dome light and headlights slowly and eerily came back on as if someone was turning a rheostat from dim to bright. The radio came back on with static with its clock reset and counting down from 00:00. Needless to say, we were all a bit spooked by this, but at this time the rational part of me was thinking out loud that the truck had some sort of electrical problem. I quickly turned the ignition key and started the truck. My brother agreeing with my thoughts, stated that maybe we should turn around and head back towards town (25 miles away) before the truck dies again. I agreed and proceeded to perform a quick three-point turn in the middle of the narrow tote road. No sooner had we turned around and started to slowly drive back towards town, my brother, in his usual humorous manner, started to carry on that maybe the truck died because of an unseen UFO or aliens.  We all started laughing and joking about his comments, but as I turned my head to say something to my brother, I was stunned by what I saw and mid-sentence I said &quot;What ((obscenity deleted)) is that!?&quot;  Off to the right-side of the vehicle, approximately 50 feet into the woods and approx 10-15 off the ground, were three alternating red lights in a triangle pattern, that were ever so slowly, gliding silently through the trees. I stopped the truck and everyone stared out the passenger side window as these lights slowly moved through the forest, parallel to the road.  My brother exclaimed &quot;go! go! follow them,&quot; so I put the truck in gear and started to drive down the road at approx. 10 mph in order to keep them within view on our right hand side. We both had our windows down yet the lights made no sound what so ever. Nor did they seem to be impeded by any of the trees, they just floated and blinked silently through the forest as we kept pace with them.  About a half mile down the road they started to pick-up speed and I adjusted the vehicles speed to keep up.  Further on down the road, they increased speed again, staying within the forest at the same elevation as before, but now  visible out the front windshield of the vehicle.  Again my brother prodded me to speed up. By this time I had accelerated the truck to 50 MPH on the rutted old tote road yet the lights were leaving us behind. As we crested a hill we could see the lights approx 100 yard directly in front of us in the middle of the road.  I floored the accelerator hoping to gain on them but in the blink of an eye the lights took off..gone!  As we approached the section of road where the lights dissapeared I stopped the truck and we all scanned the forest, sky and behind us for any sign of them.  Nothing. Just eerie blackness pierced by my vehicles headlights. I put the truck in gear again and continued down the state road towards town.  As we neared Millinocket Lake we decided to pull into the Golden Road gatekeeper&apos;s office to see if anyone else coming out of the Northwoods had reported seeign anything strange. (Note: The golden road runs parallel to the state road for several miles between millinocket lake and abol. Where we witnessed the UFO lights the distance between the golden road and the state road is approx 1/4 mile with a high tension power line (from McKay Station Hydro) running parallel between the two roads.)  After we reported what we had witnessed to the gate tender, we returned to the state road heading towards town (millinocket).  As we rounded a sharp turn in the road, just before the millinocket lake store, I slowed down and pointed up to the power line in front of us to make light of our experience,and I jokingly told my brother that the UFO must have just refueled because the wire was glowing red. (note: this section of line has device on one phase that intentionally glows whenever the line is energized)  My brother started in with his wisecrack comments and then......the truck died!  Same as before, no lights, no nothing!  Totally spooked, and with the hair standing up on the back of my neck, I jumped out of the truck and started looking around in all directions for the lights that we had seen previously. Nothing. Nothing but total blackness. I jumped back in to the truck, and this time the girls were rather upset, again my wife accused me of pretending that the truck died (why I&apos;ll never know?) so to prove it to her I turned the key repeatedly and pushed and pulled the headlights several times all to no avail.  And then..just like the previous time...the headlights and the vehicles dome light slowly and eerily came back on as if someone was turning a rheostat.  Needless to say I wasted no time in starting the truck and headed towards millinocket. That was the end of of our freaky experience in the Northern Maine Woods...or so we thought.  Upon arriving back in town, we headed over to my brothers house to watch a movie that we had rented earlier in the evening.  Still excited by the nights events and good naturedly discussing and jibing one another over what had transpired, the girls and I turned on the TV and sat down on the couch while my brother popped some pop corn.  As we were sitting there watching TV and talking...the TV mysteriously turned off...all by itself, with the remote control to the TV sitting on the coffee table in front of us.  Weird Huh?   With that my brother went into another hysterical episode of how they had followed us and were hovering over our house....but then ...you had to have been there. The next day I took my truck up to the Ford garage where a friend had worked.  My brother and I told him about our experience and they willingly looked the truck over.  The only thing that they found was the positive post of the battery had a dark discoloration as if it had been overheated.  They cleaned the terminals and the truck never died on me again for as long as I owned it.   Maybe it was a coincidence that the truck died, and we saw and followed the flashing lights or, maybe the lights that we did see, did in fact affect the trucks electrical system.  Either way it was not a natural experience seeing those lights, alternating and floating through the forest and out-running my truck. I must add, this was the second time that my younger brother had seen a UFO (1980&apos;s which I didn&apos;t find out until after our mutual incident) and since then, I have witnessed another UFO, years later in 2003 while camping at millinocket lake with my older brother.  But those are for another day.Respectfully submitted  ((name deleted))((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

I stopped at a traffic light and was looking around while waiting for the light to change when I  saw a small cigar-shaped object traveling horizontally across the sky in front of me and towards the south. I nearly dismissed it as a plane until I realized there were no wings. It was very bright silver, vivid against the daylight sky and the sun seemed to be glinting off of a spot on the left (back) end.   I watched for several seconds while it continued traveling in a straight flight path. Then, it shifted, looked like the right (front) end bent in toward the center, the glint of the sun changed position from the left end to about the center, the entire object rippled once and then disappeared completely from the sky. At this particular intersection, there are buildings and billboards, but none of them were high enough to hide the object and the day was clear, the sky without clouds.", "silent luminescent disc shining in the pre-dawn skyIt was a humid night and I awoke in the early morning in my dorm room as I heard the milk truck making noise in the alley below. My hair was still damp as I had washed it the night before and went to bed with it wet.  I was uncomfortable in the room and had the window opened with the curtains drawn back.  It was then that I looked up into the sky and saw a bright saucer type object.  I was very scared as I was alone in the room.  I thought I might have been dreaming so pinched myself.  I walked around the room and then  looked for my camera and snapped a shot even though there was no film in the camera. I was in awe, both excited and scared at the same time.  I felt privledged to be a witness to the sight.  I had always thought people who believed in this type of thing were foolish. All these thoughts crowded my head.  I felt like going next door and waking up the girl who lived there, and telling her to look out the window.  But I was afraid to even go into the hallway.  So I watched the object until it left.  Who knows how long it was there, could have been about 30 seconds to a couple minutes.  My mind was racing so seconds could have been minutes.  I have no idea how far away it was, but it was just over the city.   The saucer was highly luminescent or polished, a silvery color.  It was illuminated, but I never saw lights per se.  When the object left at a fantastic speed, I saw what appeared to be sparkling dust slowly sifting down. I remember thinking how beautiful it looked.  I have never been able to believe it was from a different planet.  Could it have been a hologram or a photo of some type projected onto the sky?   Don&apos;t know.  There was never anything in the paper about it, and my friends, the ones I told, were very skeptical.  Still, I didn&apos;t tell everyone as I didn&apos;t want to be known for seeing it.  And I didn&apos;t want to be mocked, which is what I may have done if it had been someone else. I was glad for the experience, but wish there had been an explanation.  Maybe someone else in Syracuse saw it that night, and like myself, was too shy to come forward. I know it was not a dream or an illusion.  I had not been drinking as it was a school night.  That&apos;s about all I can remember.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

I was standing outside of my vehicle on an unlit area of a local steet in Latham New York.  The location is near Latham Circle, and between Route 9 and interstate 87. The time was almost exactly 8:10 PM, as I was just about to attend an 8:15 meeting. There is a fair amount of light pollution in the area, but the night was very clear and I had good visibility of the stars.  For example, I had full visability of the Big Dipper.  I am an avid sky watcher, and am accustomed to observing airplane traffic. I was facing approximately East NorthEast. From my position, I was facing in the direction of the Hudson river, which was about 4 miles to the east, but out of my line of sight. Out of the corner of my eye I saw movement above and I looked up. At an approximate altitude of between 2,000 and 4,000 feet, I saw a black diamond shape lit at each corner with a dim orange light. Specifically, one each of these four dim lights marked each point of the diamond. I will call these lights &quot;corner lights.&quot; The lkights did not blink or flash. The vehicle blocked the stars behind it as it passed with absolute silence, as best I could hear. Bear in mind that the area was fairly noise polluted. I was lucky to see it, as the entire presentation, while flatly unmistakable, was quite subtle. Neverheless, it was HUGE. I would say that it was a couple of hundred yards long and a hundred yards wide. It was gliding to the North at a constant speed (probably about 100 MPH), and I believe that it was roughly following the Hudson river. This next part is very interesting. There was a fifth, and possibly sixth light of the same size and color weaving between two of the leading corner lights.  This more rapidly moving light spun apparently random circles and figure eights around the leading (northern) corner light and the around the western corner light. I have never seen anything manmade move with such speed and maneuverability in the sky as did this fifth light. All of the lights moved ahead together as a unified group, notwithstanding that there was internal movement within the group.  As I watched, and as the vehicle drew away from my position, all of the lights drew together into a tighter cluster, and then a very tight cluster, and eventually a single point of light that I lost among the stars and the light pollution. This pulling together of the lights was not merely a function of increasing distance from my vantage point. I happened more quicly than that. A truly amazing, and awe inspiring experience.

The object lit up the area as if it were early dawn, tree frogs became earily silent.When the object was directly in front of my tent opening, it stopped for perhaps 4 or 5 seconds and then decended steadily in at a 45 degree angle behind the shale bluff. The light then suddenly went out at about the time one might have expected it to have &quot;landed&quot; on the other side of the bluff. The light did not fade out, but went off as if someone had flipped a switch.The size of the object is difficult to determine, but gauging from the the size of the trees in the area and the short distance to the bluff, I would estimate it as being somewhere between 50 to 75 feet across.

Now, because of the Earth&apos;s rotational pattern, we move NW then SW towards LA. If we go directly SEE, we&apos;ll end up chasing Los Angeles around the globe.

I was heading when control started radioing, &quot;United 17, you are diverting off course. Return to navigational trajectory or we will take defensive action.&quot; I didn&apos;t respond. What would I have said? Would I say, &quot;Hold on control. I&apos;m chasing some UFOs&quot;? No. So after control repeated the phrase, I turned off the radio.

All commercial pilots were told that if an interceptor drops flares in front of you, it means NORAD ordered it to destroy you unless you contact control within one minute and tell them what you&apos;re doing.

I have visual confirmation of seven UFOs.&quot; Air traffic controller comes back on line and says, &quot;I copy that, sierra-tango-one-seven. Keep in visual range of UFOs until NORAD can send interceptors. I repeat, stay in visual range. For now, follow the ICAO signals from the interceptor. We will advise interceptor to not attack.&quot; I reply, &quot;Thank you control.&quot; I&apos;m following and three jets appear. They shoot out after the plane. I go back on the course trajectory.

I looked up for some reason and there was a Disk flying high over head.  It was Dark on the bottom and Silver on the top.  It moved diagonally above Me. I saw no Vapor Trails or heard no sound.  It went North on Ocean Ave. over Sheepshead Bay Brooklyn, NYC.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))", "Approximately 9:00 PM to 9:15 PM EST, in the southern sky, at approximately 60 degrees from the horizon, there was a very fast moving light.  I can place it very accurately on a chart. The speed varied, (ie it was not constant like a satellite), it stopped, it remained motionless for several minutes, it changed direction about 50 degrees from the original path, it then appeared to accelerate away from the earth, (that is, it got fainter so you could barely see it), it &quot;returned&quot;, and was stationary for another period.  It was a constant light, no strobe light, perhaps one or maybe two magnitudes less than the brightest star, &quot;very&quot; noticeable.  It was a very clear night, no cloud, no wind, approximately zero Celsius, with practically no ambient light.  The viewing site was on the north shore of Lake Erie, approximately 8 kms west of Dunnville Ontario, Canada. I have one very impartial objective witness who saw it with me. The viewing area has a very clear 180 degree line of sight East/West, and 90 degrees from the horizon to overhead, so it is clear of interference from other sources. We watched it for about 15 imnutes, before leaving.  It was still fairly visible however.   .", "On this date I was stationed at Charleston AFS, ME and worked in the reciever section of the ((deleted)) located at the site.  ((Sentence deleted, at request of source of report.  Describes position of witness.))We observed aircraft arriving and departing Limestone AFB regularly as this was an active base during the cold war. We had interceptors stationed there and at Bangor International and often these aircraft where deployed to intercept suspicious aircraft that would fly down the Newfoundland and New Brunswick coast off the Eastern seaboard enroute to Cuba. Long range Bear Bombers regularly made the trip and were regularly intercepted and shadowed.This night I watched and object from the North approach Limestone at a very high rate of speed. When a radar sweep moves around it does so at a constant rate of rotation. During the time it paints a target and the next time a slow object moves but centimeters on the screen a fast one might move several. This object moved 10&apos;s of centimeters and just as suddenly topped over Limestone. I watched the object not move for several moments nad then our set did not paint it. Usually that means the object is on the ground and not discernable by radar beam. After a short time maybe 8 to 12 mintes the object reappeared and hovered again. It then made a direct path north and was off the scope in a matter of a few sweeps.I remember this only as I heard of the &quot;sighting&quot; in the ensuing days. I did not discuss what I saw as at the time what we saw on the Radar set often had National Security implications.An example of speed we sometimes tracked very high speed targets that could move from one side of our scope to the other in less than 12 sweeps. These aircraft were used for reconnaisance and very fast. We tracked the Concorde on it&apos;s maiden flight when it landed at Bangor International. It took about 25 or more sweeps to cross the scope. The obejct that night departed Limestone and was out of range in less than 5 sweeps. That would give it a velocity in excess of 4,000 MPH.All of our Radar signals were sent on to NORAD. They were also often recorded for analysis purposes. Whether this incident was I do not know.We tracked objects all the time that seemed faster than what we knew of. This was the only one I recall where a ground sighting coincided with a radar observation.I can say that the raw radar imagery was seldom viewed as most systems used the SIF/IFF transponder data. I may have been the only person watching.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))", "I witnessed a UFO sighting over 30 years ago.  I have told this story for over the years and never knew who to go to until tonight after watching the Peter Jennings broadcast.My friend ((name deleted)) and I witnessed a UFO sighting in Colorado Springs, CO around noon in the summer of 1974.  His family lived a couple of houses down from mine on Northcrest Drive located on the bluffs near the foot of Pikes Peak.I remember it was a crystal clear day without a cloud in the sky.  We were lying on our backs in ((name deleted)) front yard talking about things that eleven and twelve year old boys chat about and then he said to me look up into the sky.  I looked up but didn&rsquo;t see anything.  Then he pointed up with his left arm and I followed his line of sight and saw eight round disks rotating in a circular motion directly above us.  We pondered what they could be and I specifically remember asking him if he thought they were angels.  We watched these objects rotate in an extremely tight motion above us for many minutes.There were a couple of unusual things that immediately caught my attention.  The first was that the eight objects were metallic (silver/whitish) in appearance, circular in shape and were flying and rotating in an extremely tight circular pattern.  We viewed the objects from underneath and I remember the movement seemed extremely unusual since we were used to seeing military aircraft since we lived so close to the Air Force Academy.  Besides both of our fathers worked for a government subcontractor who worked for NORAD and so we were very familiar with all types of military aircraft of that era. What was most shocking is what happened next.  As I stated the eight objects were rotating in a circular motion and then they suddenly stopped moving.  The objects remained motionless without falling from the sky and all were perfectly separated from one another.  Then they suddenly accelerated at an astonishing speed from one another in exactly opposite directions.   I followed one of the objects as it flew over Pikes Peak and when it disappeared behind the mountain I looked back to where the rest were, they were all gone.  My Friend ((name deleted)) followed another one of the objects in different direction and was also amazed.  After witnessing the finally, only then did it occur to us that we did not see angels. I swear to God that what I witnessed is true and will continue to believe it until the day I die. Some facts: Colorado Springs is about 5,000-6,000 feet above sea level.  Pikes Peak is about 14,100 feet above sea level.  The objects we witnessed must have been at least 8,000 - 9,000 feet above us since one of them cleared Pikes Peak((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

It moved silently in a straight line and performed flawless angled turn of direction without change in momentum.  I believe it stayed on the same plane and speed was approximately the speed of a car going down a residential street.  The closest it came to me was perhaps 20 to 50 feet away.  It altitude was approximately 25 to 35 ft above the ground.  A flock of black birds split to fly around it.  When it reached my position it continued in another direction, approximately a 35 to 45 degree angle, until it was out of site.  I was alone, but it traveled over a very populated area and traffic.  Someone else has to have seen it.  I&apos;ve written this today because I just read an entry of 2002 asking someone who may recognize a picture of a sphere found in the red clay in the woods near Huntsville, AL in 1984.  I saw my object in 1980, although I don&apos;t remember the day and exact time of my encounter.  It is similar to that, but with some noticeable differences.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

Said Canyon has an elevation differential of about 5500 feet with steep grades and sheer vertical cliffs. Thru Fossil Creek Canyon exists the Child Electrical Power generating camp consisting of maybe 10 structures. On the return trip to Strawberry, we passed said power station and ascended upon dirt roads that winded on the southerly edge of the Canyon. I would estimate that about half way up this Canyon we noticed that on the northerly edge of the Canyon that an oscillating light that changed colors emanated from a portion of the Canyon that is unaccessible to vehicles.The light was visible to the naked eye, but nothing more.  We stopped the vehicle and I would estimate that at a 1-2 mile range I scoped the light with high power scope on my rifle and was able to see much more detail.  When viewing this light with my scope I was able to make out a disk shaped saucer with &quot;windows&quot; and a &quot;door&quot; with &quot;steps&quot;.  Said object had two &quot;legs&quot; that emanated from either side of the object.  A portion of the object was obstructed by shrubs. These shrubs moved, although there was no wind from the position in which I observer said object. From our position and vantage point we were able to at lenghty time and measure observe the object. Strawberry, Arizona is located about 19 miles north of Payson and about 60 miles west of Heber, Overgaard. The commonality between these three location is the Mogollon Rim, Fossil Creek Canyon is at the root of the rim that has elevation of about 9000 feet in places. The other interesting items that surround this area is the fact that the famous movie &quot;Fire in the Sky&quot; was based upon an incident about 45 miles West of this sighting.  I had at the time told some people in the Town of Payson about this occurence and was surprised by some of the responses I received. Once response was that of one of the Electrical workers at the Child Plant that confided in my Father in law that this was a regular occurence and that has had his vehicle and watch stop due to &quot;craft&quot; flying overhead in this same Canyon. Another response that surprised me was that of a Town of Payson employee that also confided in me that in his youth he worked on a Logging crew and coincidently happened to work that night of the dissapearence of person in the &quot;Fire in the Sky&quot; movie.  He told me that that night the Forest had a green aura and a hum that filled the air.  He also stated that he had heard other stories similar to mine from that area where I had seen this object.My backround is that of a Civil Engineer and Surveyor with approximately 14 years of experience. I served 6 years with the United States Air Force as a Civil Engineering Specialist and have been deyployed worldwide in said capacity.  I currently work as a Survey analyst and Geomatician at a private Civil Engineering Company.  My Father in Law has been a successful Construction Contractor for at least the last 30 years and is still building.I have no clue to the whereabouts of my then brother in law and his backround was in maintenance.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

It was a bit chilly, and as I was trying to fall asleep I was looking out the back window at the stars.  I saw something peculiar, three &apos;stars&apos; that were equi-distant apart in a triangle.  A fourth &apos;star&apos; of the same brightness emerged from the bottom right corner of the triangle and made a slow straight procession to the top &apos;star&apos; of the triangle and disappeared into it.  There was a pause of perhaps 6 seconds, then the star re-emerged and moved to the bottom left star of the triangle.  Nothing further happened, and the whole experience is somewhat unremarkable, but I think in retrospect, if indeed I was looking at a stationary craft, perhaps the fourth star was part of a light array on the trailing edge of the craft.  The formation was stationary, more-or-less directly overhead, and probably a good distance out.  I could not initially make sense of the experience because I was thinking in terms of the moving object being a craft itself, a satellite or plane, but could not reconcile the eccentric stop-and-go movement, or precise relative movement to the other &apos;stars&apos;.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Since I get motion sickness easy, I have to look out the window in order to get a fixed point to look at.  A Cold front had gone through that cold cloudy day and it was rather windy around the time the flight took off.  The takeoff was rather bumpy, and I had my face looking out the window for something to focus on.  But the front had begun to clear the clouds away and as we gained altitude, it plane smoothed off.  After the plane had leveled off, I was looking out the window (right side of the plane) facing eastward.  I was enjoying the lights of the towns below and to the distance wishing I had not packed away the video camera so that I could show my son what it looks like from above.  I could see the tiny lights from the light poles along the roads and suddenly I noticed a light off in the distance that was down and in front of the plane.  My first thought was that it was from an airport tower because it had flashed to white as if it was turned on.  I wandered if I could see a plane take off.  But it went from a dim white light to a very-bright white light. Then all of a sudden, the light changed from white to bright red about the time the plane approached it, and it was then that I remembered that airport towers do not have red beacons.  Although this was away from the plane, (it appeared to be about a mile or so) when we were almost side-by-side (figuratively) it accelerated from what appeared to be a standstill and quickly outran us as if WE were standing still.

The object looked like a bright flashing star that a person would see when looking up at the stars at night, except this object was near the surface above a tower and flew away. At first I tried to pass it off as a helicopter but I couldn&apos;t figure out why a helicopter would sit idle in one spot and not move for a few mins and flash that many colors that rapid with no projected sound.", "A gaint greyish football moving through the skyIt was a bright early morning, I was getting ready for guard mount, I was a Security Policeman in the Air Force, stationed at Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico.

I saw this object the size of a football field, and it was shaped like a football. The object was slowly moving from left to right. the object turned right, and headed toward the ground, and it disappeared. We called the airport to find out if there was Jets landing, and they said, &quot;no&quot;. There was nothing going on.

It was travling north from the Williamsburg area.  I stopped the car along the side of the road east of Short Mountian.  The object was rectangular in shape and had very bright light coming from all sides.  It was black and flew very slow just over the tree tops. We watched it fly over my car. We saw it through the moon roof in my car.  Nobody believes we saw this object.  We were going to see a movie in Altoona and were not drunk or on drugs.  We did not see any beings or space men.  I looked at all of the local news papers and none of them had any thing on this event. We did not hear any noise coming from this object.", "Reddish object produced flashes of light, discharged a gaseous material, dissappeared, reappeared and dissapeared again.I have witnessed at least 15 unidentifiable objects since 2000. All have had similar characteristics but no other definition than they look like stars. What has made these objects unique to other things in the sky is either their sudden appearance and dissappearance, pulsing or flashing light sources and even their movement.  I will however will post my last sighting as I can still remember the details of what happened that night better than other times and wish to not use any more space discussing them on this post. (I promise, I will see more). ;)  It was between 1:00 am and 1:10 am when I was outside of my house staring up at the sky. It was then when I noticed something awkward in the sky south of my visual point.The sky was as clear as it could be in this suburban neighborhood when I noticed an object glowing brighter. This object looked very much like a star, but I caught the fact that it wasn&apos;t there a few seconds or minutes before actually noticing that it was not part of the sky map that I had in my current working memory. What kept my interest in observing it as I mentioned in the paragraph above was that this &quot;thing&quot; was glowing in slightly faster pulses than a regular star. It slightly moved vertically, came to a pause and then for some even odder reason, it looked like it dropped (or spilled) sometype of gaseus or liquid material the same color as this &quot;star&quot;.  I wish I could say it was a trail of its movement, but this stuff came out of it after it was stationed for a few fractions of a second. This thing was reddish in color, in fact it was similar to Mars but much brighter. When this fluid or gaseus like substance spilled, I became slightly nervous thinking that it could have been a supernova.  Immediately as I heard my father coming towards the door, I called him to run out as quickly as possible to witness this thing with me.  He made it on time to see the remaining activity. The gaseous dropping was gone, but the object remained, however the pulses began to accelerate.  As we were watching these flashing pulses, the object either began to drift away or shrink. Nevertheless, I can agree with anyone that it was fading away, and it did until there was no visual of it. We did not remove our eyes for not even five approximate seconds when this object began reappearing in the same position that it dissappeared in. The light from the object began to increase in brightness or size (or both) again. The flashes returned until it reached it&apos;s approximate original size, and seconds later it gradually began to dissappear again. This was not the first sighting I have had. This is also not the first sighting I have had with the company of a witness either.  I cannot draw any conclusions or judgements that this object was any type of spacecraft, however, this and others similar that I have witnessed hold no other place than to be anomolies of some sort, or they can be purely a perceptual construct of something entirely natural. It is very easy to say that compared to any airplanes, helicopters, fireworks, meteors, comets, flare guns, or any other objects I have seen these sightings I&apos;ve had separate themselves from anything else I have seen that&apos;s logically explainable. This last object like the others was much higher and brighter than other areal objects for its distance.  The stationary positions and their slow movement separate them from things I am accustomed to see in the air as well. My background is fairly simple. I am a 32 year old hispanic male. I live in the city of Carson. My hobbies are amateur radio, programming, networking, and Unix operating system hobbyst. I work as System Administrator, and a computer engineering major at Devry University.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

I am not sure of the date, I cannot pinpoint it in my memory.  I do remember that it was near my girlfriend&apos;s birthday, which is in August, and that when I went to see her back then, we stayed up late, as I did not have to work early, so I estimate the time as somewhere between 1 am and 3 am, CST. I was heading west on highway 10, and I was just approaching Prescott, WI when, out of the corner of my eye, over a darkened corn field to my left, I saw something move.  I turned my head and looked.  At first, I thought it was a reflection of my dashboard lights on the window glass, so I decided to roll down my window.  The light was still there, pacing my car, about 1-1.5 miles to the south of me, over the cornfield.  after a few minutes of watching this light and not paying attention to the road, I decided to stop my car on the side of the highway. I looked down for a split second to get my cell phone so that I could call my girlfriend and tell her what I was seeing.  When I looked up, I saw the light streak east and disappear. My cell phone, which is never turned off, and had no mechanical problems, was turned off.  When I turned it back on, the time did not register right away, and I had no signal in an area in which I normally have full signal.  For about five minutes I sat there, my car idling while I tried to get my cell to work properly.  It would not. It would not right itself until I got home that night, some 20 minutes later.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

The others looked up but did not want to believe me that this was a classic and very real ufo!  They tried to explain it away as a balloon or blimp of some kind, even though there was no gondola attached and the object moved purposefully in a very straight line.  The craft was approximately 500 to 1000 ft high and I&apos;m estimating that it was about the size of a standard passenger bus.  It was metallic, shiny and reflected the sun on it&apos;s surface but it was a semi-dull shine, and not of mirror reflecting quality.  On the surface of the object were two lines that seperated it into 3 sections:  pointed nose section, middle and rear.  There were no other distinguising features on the object either; no windows or door apertures could be seen.  When the object passed us overhead we had a clear view of the back which was round, perfectly smooth and also featureless; no exhaust could be seen, No motor or propeller could be seen either and no sound at all - it was completely silent.  An amazing sight, to be sure, and one which I will never forget.", "i saw something skimming the earth,s atmosphere then it disappeared; it was huge.i was outside walking to the store after dark when i saw what at first looked like a meteor, moving from North to south but it seemed to move too slow.

It was as if someone wanted me to see it.", "Fast moving object that would just stop and then dart off and then just stop again.At the time of the sighting I lived right outside Fort Bragg, NC. I thought at first that it was a shooting star or perhapps a military plane, because they flew over my home on a regular basis, but this object was different, so it made me stop and look twice. The object was pretty far up in the sky, it was a bright round looking light. What made me look twice was the fact that the light was sitting still and then it would suddenly dart to a new location and remain still in that spot for a few moments and then dart to a new spot that was a good distance from the last. I just could&apos;nt take my eyes off of it. This went on for about 8-10 minutes and then it just took off in secounds out of sight, what looked to me to be upward.  I had never seen anything that could move so quickly and then just stop and levatate. I have seen lots of military aircraft being so close to Ft. Bragg and Pope AFB, but I had never seen anything move like this before. I never told anyone what I had seen that night. I just wonder if I was the only one that saw it or did it show up on the military radar.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

I was so exhausted when I &quot;fell&quot; into my bed.I told my best friend after this happened.  I truly do not know how much time had passed before telling her. I feel like the time has just gone in my head.  After I told her, I wrote it in my journal on Dec. 26, 2004.  Here is my entry:  I truly believe I was abducted by aliens  a couple of weeks ago.  I don&apos;t remember what day it was but I did have to go to work.  (I work Mon- Fri).  My &quot;dreams&quot; of my house were too vivid to be dreams; something happened.  I remember standing at the patio door looking up.  The ship was huge with 2, 3 or 4 big lights.  I remember a red and a white light.  I knew I was looking at the back.  But, instead of seeing my backyard, there was a field with 2 cars.  I think the one closest to me was a red convertible with the top down.  There was a woman leaning against the car.  I think she had dark curly hair to her shoulder.  Darker than mine and softer curls.  I think there was 1 or 2 men sitting in the car drinking.  These details are too vivid and too memorable to be a dream.  The ship was a very strong material; gunmetal grey in color.  (Here I drew the picture of what I saw).  Backend - what I saw, the house blocked the rest of the ship.  (I was looking up).  The clencher is that I was jolted &quot;awake&quot; (in bed).  I turned over and the clock read 5:26 am.  I felt like I had just gotten in bed and I was exhausted.  I didn&apos;t want to have to get up and go to work.  I turned on to my left side and my first thought was that I&apos;d need to get checked out for any implants.  I tried to find something on the internet to tell my story but didn&apos;t find anything in that short time.  I told [my best friend] last night and she doesn&apos;t think I&apos;m crazy. When I wrote it, I wrote things going on in my life before and after.  There was no break.  Also, I remember when I wrote this how calm I became.  To clarify how I saw the ship, I have two sliding glass doors going outside.  I have to open both of them.  I remember seeing everything in the den as it is right now (not like a dream where everything is distorted or made up) and I was standing in the house, at the first door, with both open, in my, probably, nightgown that night.  I was looking up and if I had stepped out and jumped up, I could have touched the ship it was that close.  I have metal awnings but that night, it was like they were gone.  Because the ship was so close, and the view I had, that&apos;s why I could only see the back.  It was like I was being dropped off.  I didn&apos;t feel strange or funny or have any weird things.  (Supernatural things do happen to me at night but as long as I pray,  it helps.  I now wear a St. Michael the Archangel medal that was blessed by the Pope and pray to him each night also and that has helped tremendously).  To clarify being exhausted.  Have you ever gone out one night and partied and got drunk (not too drunk but enough to know you&apos;re drunk) and you came in at 4 or 5 or 6 am?  Then, you throw yourself in bed and you&apos;re asleep before you&apos;ve stopped moving?  That&apos;s what I felt like. I had gone to bed the night before, as usual, but when I was jolted awake, I looked at the clock (see above) and literally felt like I had been dropped into my bed and that I had not gotten any sleep.  My best friend is the only one I told about this because I&apos;m too scared to talk to anyone else.  Maybe I watch too many tv shows and movies but I have not spoken to anyone about this.  I&apos;ve thought long and hard and I wanted to report this but I don&apos;t want anything bad to happen to me.  I watched the Peter Jennings show tonight on ABC and you were mentioned at the end, with no contact information but I wrote down your name and was able to google it.  I&apos;ve considered being hypnotized to dig deeper but I don&apos;t want to be alone when it happens to avoid any muddying.  I hope in some way that you do take me seriously and can help me to come to terms with what has happened to me.  I will state now that I don&apos;t party, I don&apos;t get drunk, I don&apos;t do drugs, I don&apos;t take any special Rx medications.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

My husband and I had been standing on the beach looking at the stars.  I had walked back up to the truck to do something, leaving my husband by the water about 15 feet away.  Immediately after opening the truck door and sitting down, something caught my eye in the sky.  Immediately I could not rationalize what it was.  I immediately stood up, took of running down the beach screaming my husbands name and to look in the air.  My husband looked in the air and watched in amazement at what he saw.  The object was pretty low and seemed like it floated through the air, not in a straight line.  It was either one triangular shaped craft with 3 circular lights on the bottom of it, or 3 circular crafts flying in a triangular formation. Also, I heard no noise when it was overhead.  My brother was by the campfire about 20 feet away,  my husband ran towards the camp yelling for him.  By the time My brother made it to the beach it had moved across the horizon and dissapeared.  And when I say dissapeared it was moving and then it was just gone.  I have drawn a very rough picture on my paint program on my computer.  I cannot explain what I saw and neither can my husband.

Lights grouped in three&apos;s - red/wht/redBack in high school I got a phone call from a neighborhood friend and he said that his brother while coming home from work and driving down Main St. getting ready to turn on our street saw something in the sky and to get outside and check it out. I went outside and started to look up the street to where my friend lived to see if he was outside and saw him then I saw the craft one block over to the north coming from the West and could&apos;nt bellieve it. It was moving very slowly. As we were watching it I ran to my neighbors house to tell them to come outside and check this out and they witnessed it also. As we were all watching it it began to move sideways while still moving forward; like a crab moves.The lights did not move sideways then straighten back out; everything stayed pointed forward. Then it basically stopped moving sideways once it was over our street and continued moving straight forward. As it approached us it made no noise whats so ever. The configuration of the lights on the bottom of the craft were in the pattern of a parallelogram but not sure of the shape of the craft because it was dark against the dark night sky. The lights were arranged in a straight line, front to back, in groups of three. One samll white light, one larger red light, and one more white light. Then back and off to the side was another grouping and this repeated staggering left to right to the end of the craft. As the craft passed over head you could hear a low, dull humming noise but no sign of an exhuast area you might asscociate with with aircraft we know of. It was very low and by the shape of the lights it was quite large. Exact size is hard to say but guess-timating I&apos;d say it was the lenght of one and a half to two yards(house lots in my neighborhood- approx. 75 to 100&apos; long) It flew in a straight line from that point until it disappeared from sight out toward Long Island Sound to the East. One thing I remember was the neighbors house I went to, his father was was visiting and he worked for Chrysler Corp. and he said that he never heard a &apos;engine&apos; like that before in his life. My father is a single engine aircraft pilot and use to buzz the house from time to time and the lights on his plane were much, much smaller than the lights on this thing. One news report going around was that it was pilots flying ultralights trying to fool people but that was in the Puoghkeepsie, NY area and if you&apos;ve ever heard ultralights engines you&apos;d know these were&apos;nt ultralights(even if somehow muffled). Another thing was that this craft moved as a single entity, not multiple craft trying to be one. Well, that&apos;s it.

I was looking ESE, up aprox. 45 degrees above the horizontal.  A movement of light caught my eye.  There were four dim orange lights in a straight line moving at aprox. 175 kts. in a NNW direction. As the craft passed at aprox. 1200 feet away and at about the same altitude, I noticed three more dim orange lights across the after end of the craft.  The craft was definitely triangular in shape as outlined by the lights on the craft.  There was NO SOUND from the craft what so ever.  There was 4 orange lights from front to back and 3 lights across the rear end, the underbody was grey as iluminated from the reflection from the bridge lights reflecting off the intercoastal waterway.  That is how I was able to determine the distance and height of the craft, and as well the direction and aprox. speed. There were NO STROBE LIGHTS either.

I would estimate this object was 50-60 degrees above the horizon.  It appeared to be a bright star, except that the weather is sunny today.  The sky was blue and bright, so it did not make sense to me that this was a star.  I thought it could be an airplane, except it was not moving.  I watched the object for about 10 minutes to see if it moved (using a nearby pine tree as a gauge), and it did not.  By this time I had attracted the attention of my 8-year-old sons, one of whom also spotted the object once I pointed it out.  While he watched it, I went into the house to get my binoculars.  I found the object through the binoculars and it appeared to be a spherical shape and I could tell it was either white or metallic - it was very reflective.  I could not see any other details.  By this time the object had started to drift to the north or northeast.  We watched it for another 5-10 minutes until it slowly drifted behind some tall trees.

Myself and other witnesses were F4-Phantom Weapons Control Technicians in the USAF.  My eastbound view was of mountains on horizon with first glow of sunrise behind mountains.  Weather calm and completely clear.  1st large oval rises up from directly behind mountians due east from me.  Motion is slow, floating like a blimp or balloon.  At first I thought it was a large blimp with a mirror-like exterior reflecting the sunlight (sun was below the eastern horizon during the entire encounter), object was extremely bright, yet had a distinct oval outline.  After rising a few degrees above mountains object stopped all motion.  Total time to rise up was about 2 minutes.  Second identical object then began to rise just to the left of the first object.  Second object moved identically to first, then stopped next to first at equal altitude.  Third identical looking object then began to rise just to right of first object, at same slow rate, until it was at equal altitude with other 2 objects.  All three objects remained still for about 2 more minutes.  Very curious sight at this time, but all witnesses still thought objects were blimps.  Right-most object then begins to rise slowly above others, stops completely, then moves from a complete stop to a point slightly above the horizon almost directly due south of us (visible out the right side of the car) in about 2 or 3 seconds then comes to a complete stop again.  No acceleration or deceleration was apparent.  Middle object then does exactly the same, stopping next to the other above the southern horizon.  Third object then repeats the same exact manuever.  When all 3 were stopped hovering next to each other then all 3 objects slowly decended torwards the ground until disappearing on the southern horizon.  Objects retained their extreme brightness throughout the entire encounter, even when in a position near the southern horizon where there was no sunlight to reflect in my direction.  All witnesses agreed with each other not to speak of the sighting due both to fear of ridicule, and due to the fact that all of us were under orders to speak of any potential UFO sightings ONLY to our commanding officer (to my knowledge all AF personnel, including myself and the witnesses, at the time were required to sign a statement acknowledging the order upon enlisting in the AF).

To describe it as precisely as I can, At arms length two amber-whitish lights were about the size of a half-dollar on both sides of the craft, about 10 inches apart. My hands are 8 1/2 inches long, so I feel conservatively confident concerning the size. In regards to the structure, I couldn&apos;t see any visible shapes connecting the spheres. It caught me slightly off guard. No sooner than I could look left, this object silently swoops downwards moving south passing directly over me, when I put my eyes into the eyepiece of my camera It was already over my head. Then veering southwestward beyond the trees and over my house before losing sight of it in 5 seconds. Using the same size-scale as in the prior chevron sighting with five lites, I would surmise that it&apos;s very likely that this would be the same object having all three center lights off, and an altitude of within 200 feet. As incredible as it seems;I would further add that it&apos;s far too coincidental of the timing and the speed of direction unless the first chevron during it&apos;s surveying, instructed the second object to come down for a closer cross scanning over me.", "UFO in clear sight of entire town, egg shape(on its side)many colored lights,memory tampering,nose bleed,abduction.I am getting back pieces of my memory as the years go on. Coming home from my job at Pizza H** in Monroe, I was approching Marshville city limits when I saw an object over the trees. People I am almost 35 years old and of sound mind! This object was moving at about a 1/2 mile per hour. I was wandering why the whole town was not at a stand-still. If anyone else noticed it, they sure didnt show interest. I was compelled to check this thing out. I didnt know all of the road names, but I knew how to get around town, so I moved closer, took a right and there it was coming over the trees to my left, directly above at (11:00 sight). Maybe 4 stories above the ground, no sound. O.K. this thing was an egg shape on its side, covered in various colored lights. The lights were like the jumbo christmas lights not the small ones. I found myself 3 streets down the road, about a 1/4 mile out of the town light, still in my car. I looked out my window to find the object and it was high above me to the left and shot out faster than anything my mind could comprehend. Now for the strange part... I put my car in drive(it was still running)recognized the street I was on and made my way home, thinking less and less of what happened. Everyone in my home was asleep so I did not wake them, so I went to bed. Woke up a little while later sitting up turned around with my face looking down at my pillow-blood pouring and I mean pouring out of my nose. My mother came in to help me and I mentioned none of this to her, Fear that she would think I was using drugs, at that time in my life I did smoke mary jane. Now the more time went on the less I would think about this, until about 5 years later when I would connect the dots. I hate Alien abduction stories, people that are made pregnant by Aliens or what have you, but this was real! I live a somewhat normal life, but I know What happened in Marshville N.C. that night, I am a firm believer in the fact that something happened to me, and my memory was tampered with.

I was unloading my car when I turned to go back to the cabin and looked up in the sky to the South and saw the unusual lights. I 1st thought what I was seeing was a flight of hellicopters because planes would not be moving so slowly but then I realized their was no sound. I shouted for my brother in law &quot;Crawford, look&quot; and pointed him to the lights. What we saw was a series of ~5-6 lights lined up in an edge straight row at ~3,500 feet above ground. the lights moved in unison, silent and moving slowly from West to East. I am certain of the altitude because from out vantage point their are a series of ridges, one being mallardy (sic) ridge that show elevations on topographic maps as 3,200 - 3,500 feet above sea level. I have taken a daylight picture of the spot from where I 1st saw the lights pointed at the ridges and can provide that upon request.

The objects came in from the West, until they were over the house across the street at which time they made a leisurely turn to the North. I was at 97.xxxxxW 32.xxxxxN at the time, in fact, my parents still reside there. The objects were not at all impressive, being a gull grey in color and making no strange aerobatics. I have a book by Robert Emenegger called &quot;UFOs, Past, Present and Future,&quot; and it has a sighting survey based upon the Observer&apos;s Data Sheet prepared for the USAF. I filled it out at the time and am using it to provide the data I&apos;m entering here. I still remember it well, and will attempt to properly describe it in words, though my drawing from the time would be of better use. I have scanned the photo and stored it online at;  http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y20/ckirmser/UFOSighting.jpg  My mother and grandparents first called the objects to my attention. I went outside and was joined by my sister, her friend and my brother. We all saw them, and I had all but my grandparents sign the sighting report as witnesses. Now, however, they have nearly, if not totally, forgotten the episode. When I got outside, I saw the objects coming in over the roof of the house to our left, westwards. I lived on a cul-de-sac, with the entrance on the east connecting to a north-south road. Our house is on the south-east corner facing the connecting road with the driveway leading to the entrance to the circle, where we were all standing. When I saw the objects, I rushed inside to get my binoculars only to find that my sister had broken them from when she had last borrowed them; this is why the event is so prominent in my memory. I then got my telescope, a small thing from K-mart, maybe 50x, and dragged it outside. By the time I got back outside, the lead object was over the house across from our driveway, to the north, and had started its turn to the north. I trained my telescope on the lead object and managed to get a lengthy view until it was just too much of a hassle keeping it in focus and trained, so I just used the Mark-1 eyeball until they went out of sight to the north. I had 8 minutes of clear view, except for my trip inside for my binoculars and telescope, before they disappeared into some clouds. There was only one star out at the time, and the moon wasn&rsquo;t up until 9:30pm. The only other traffic I saw was an airplane on the opposite sky when the objects were almost out of view. I live near D/FW Airport, but it had only just opened back then and it&rsquo;s a good bit away. Besides, I know aircraft, and was a member of the Air Force JROTC at my high school. I can&rsquo;t think of any aircraft that would take 8 minutes to travel a mile, give or take. To describe them, I think the best thing to do is to think of a Dorito chip with very rounded corners. Now, take the chip and bend the rounded corners up to form a shallow bowl shape. Put a small raised hump on top of the chip in the center (only just visible past the edge) and a small circular light on the bottom in each corner and that&rsquo;s pretty much it. The view I had was a three-quarter view from the bottom, so all I saw of the seeming hump was just what poked over the edge. The bottom was very round as were the edges. The object was an overall grey, and the lights were pretty much just white spots, they weren&rsquo;t bright at all, in fact, they weren&rsquo;t even visible until I used the telescope and remains of my binoculars. The objects didn&rsquo;t give off any light or sound and made a very slow leisurely trip across the sky; as I had said, nothing impressive at all. I still have the drawings of it, and can forward them in future if you so desire and I can get to a scanner. I reported the sighting to the police that same day, but I have no idea if they kept any record or anything. Well, that&rsquo;s about it.

As we were coming into the town of Greenville we all noticed what appeared to be an airplane flying across the sky from our left to right.  The aircraft suddenly made a 90 turn in our direction.  We realized that it was following a car coming in our direction.  I immediately thought it was a police helicopter chasing a stolen car.   We all watched intently as we kept approaching the car.  We were travelling at about 60 mph as was the car coming in the other direction.  As the car passed us we all looked out the rear window to watch what was happening.  We couldn&apos;t see anything so as I turned back around (seated in the front passenger side)  there was a bright light coming thru my window.  I immediately realized this aircraft had fully reversed and was now hovering over our vehicle.  I knew not even a helicopter could make such an abrupt maneuver and thought immediately it could only be a ufo.  Being a risk taking 19 year old I decided to roll down my window and check it out.  I tried to see what it was but the light was so bright I couldn&apos;t actually see the craft.

My mother and I had just finished using an ATM when my father, who was waiting next in the parking lot, waived us over quickly to point out the unidentified object.The object was hovering at approximately 1000-2000 feet, about 1/2 mile SE of the shopping plaza. The shape of the object was not discernable, however it had, as I recall, three white lights, situated what I assumed to be at its perimeter. The most noticeable thing about this craft was that it made no noise and that it moved so slowly -- very slowly. The object was easily 300 feet long if all the lights observed belonged to the same craft.

I don&apos;t normally write things like this, but I happened upon this site and it sounds like a serious place and I&apos;ve kept this inside me for years. this is what I saw.... Westwood California.  In Summer 1983 the Movie &quot;The Terminator&quot; was just beginning to appear in movie theatres. I was going to the midnight showing. Standing on the corner across the street from the theatre my friends had already crossed the street. As I was standing there waiting for the light to change, an older black man quickly approached me and said: &quot;You see it&quot; with his finger pointing just above the lower buildings surrounding the theatre. I didn&apos;t see him initially so he startled me a bit. I looked at him first and noticed that he had a nail hammer in his hand. I thought... WTF is this guy doing with a hammer in his hand at 11pm (that question was never answered after the siting). I took a few steps away and he was still pointing with this strange little grin on his face. For whatever reason I concluded that he was not a threat and took a glance. Following his finger movement against a black sky with stars visible, I began to focus and noticed the stars in the distance disappearing from view and then reappearing in a right to left horizontal movement. As my eyes finally solved the problem I realized that what was screening them out was only about 400 yards in front and maybe 300 feet altitude. As I focused further I noticed this perfectly square shape was moving slowly, silently across the sky. So Black was it that only the stars and some high clouds in the background were the only thing that gave away it&apos;s silouette initially. But it was close, I could see it was solid and fairly large and absolutely square. As it moved away, I followed it like a hawk and noticed that it had no depth to it!??, like a huge piece of paper, or a giant Window, Mirror?? Whatever, it looked like something that was never meant to be seen and my feeling is that it would never have been seen unless there was some malfunction causing it to get out of position. I had completely forgotten about the old black dude standing there next to me. When it disappeared behind the buildings, the look we gave to each other was one of confirmation that we both just wittnessed something completely real. So sure of what I saw, I laughed to myself for days, knowing it would be silly to even try to tell anyone about it.

Our property was located on the North to North-west shore of Slacks Reservoir. It was the late fall of the year. The time was between 1030 and 1100 (EST). We saw a bright light through the southern facing windows of our living room. We went outside and observed an object in the sky that was either large enough or close enough to obscure approximately 60 to 70% of the sky to the South west. It was at an azmuth of about 70 degrees. The object was shaped like two dinner plates placed top to top; a narrow glowing yellow-green band was separating the two halves, and a red spot, about three times the width of the band was located on the same seam as the band. The object itself was a glowing silvery-white. It slowly rotated on the horizontal axis, until it was almost round in shape. At that time five smaller objects, appearing to be round or spherical, approached from what appeared to be radial directions, and merged with the larger object. At that time, the object continued to rotate on the same axis as before, a yellow-green light was emitted from the lower rimmed area of the double plate in a fan-like beam. In the space of less than ten seconds the object had vanished into the South-West in an increasing angle of azmuth. There was absolutely no sound at all during the entire episode. That evening, several radio stations reported that the object had been picked up on the RADAR at the primary commercial airport. The next day, nothing was on the radio or television, or in the newspaper. I drew a picture of the object and wrote a letter to the Astronomy department at Brown University. My parents and I all signed it. About a week later we heard a droaning of engines in the sky to the South-West, a dark object was approaching over the water. When the object was very close, bilboard lights flashed the message across the blimp &quot;Hello Down There.&quot; Just how gullable did they think we were!!!  About two weeks after I had sent the letter we received a response. Supposedly we had seen the planet Jupiter and five of its moons with the unaided eye, taking up an area the size of a large serving platter, with the &quot;moons&quot; being about the size of a nickel each, in the wrong part of the sky, and at the wrong azmuth. Once again, just how dumb did they think we were!!!  My I.Q. has been tested to between 160 and 180 on various tests. At the time of the incident I had already built an analog computer, radio equipment, and my own telescope. I was already interested in a number of scientific fields. I firmly believe that we wittnessed a UFO mother ship and five scouts, and that rediculous attempts at cover-up were made by or influenced by the government of the United States.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

I had seen unusual looking lights pretty far out to the southwest; they caught my eye, and i sort of kept an eye on them, off/on for a few miles. They had an unusual shape/were sort of a greenish tint. There were a few cars on the road with me for awhile. As I neared home, all the cars I had been traveling with left the road, and I was alone traveling west, about 3-4 min. from home. The area I live in is in the country, but not desolate. There are quite a few homes, separated by fields/large lots. There was almost a full moon.  As i approached an intersection, suddenly the lights seemed to come right toward me,fast,then slowed down and went right across the road, in front of me,about 20 or 30 feet above the road,and then stopped and hovered above a field.There is a section of trees about 30 or 40 feet high running parallel to the field.The trees hid most of the craft;when it went into the field, an incredibly bright light flashed for about a minute or so.The craft seemed to turn around. I could see enough from where i stopped to see that. It was like a greenish white huge, oblong shaped light...as bright as a laser. I didnt know what to do. I was petrified and thought that if i went forward, God knows what would happen to me. So i pulled up into a driveway that was nearby. Two houses were there with their lights out.I turned my lights/radio off and tried to sit very still.

It was really foggy and directly across from us was a light pole, that was in front of a very large clearing between two forests. We were stopped waiting for the light to turn green for our turn to go. My girlfriend and I were in my 1981 RS Camaro. The light finally turned green and I began slowly turning left to go down U.S. 37. About half-way through I noticed the fog behind the light pole beginning to seperate and the crest of the UFO appear. I immidiately stopped and watched. Subsequently everyone else 4 other cars I noticed also stopped. The object emerged through the fog and the light of the light pole shined on it. It was colored like coal, black but shiney. It had alot of contouring, similar to that of the UFOs in the movie Independance Day. At first the nose of it (assuming the nose) was pointing down and it looked like it was about to crash into the ground. Maybe a few feet from the ground, it then began to slow down and pull up. Almost like a computer in slow-motion. After which, It just hung there and didn&apos;t move. It was very very big, from what I could see sticking out of the fog, it had to be as wide as the clearing itself. At this time their is now a Super Wal-Mart in that very same clearing to give you an idea on its size. The object made no sound at all, except for the sound of the air rumbling around it. And their were no lights of any kind that I could observe. It was probably 80-90 ft in front of us, about 20ft from the ground.", "A white dot traveled at amazing speed, followed by a blue light behind it.I work for the new jersey department of transportaion and in the new jersey national guard.

I saw a white dot fly across the sky with amazing speed, much faster then any airplane I have seen in the sky. behind the white dot was a blue line behind it. It went into the clouds and disappeared. I have never witnessed something flying so fast in the sky like that before. I would not have thought much of the object, but the blue line behind it made me think it was a UFO.

Planes fly overhead in this area often as I&apos;m close to a major airport, so I didn&apos;t think much of it, except planes are ussually white lights, and this was more orange, like an open flame. It also flickered slightly and had a slight haze around it. From my standpoint in my vehicle, it looked spherical in shape. I was watching it on and off while driving down the road as trees obscured my view every few seconds, but seemed to stay in the same position in the the horizon, so either it was stationary or it was moving directly perpendicular to me, like when a plane is coming right at you and it seems not to move. Then about 11:28, it just vanished. I searched the sky,but saw nothing but darkness and clouds. It didnt seem to have gone behind the clouds. More like if somone had hit a switch and turned it off suddenly. it looked very similar to something I saw back in 1998 or 99, when I saw a fireball coming down as if a meteor, but then leveled out its descent and cruised paralell to the ground for at least 30 minutes.", "Triangular - 3 lights one red and two white. Night of 2/23/05 in Edgerton, Wisconsin on Hwy I-90 around 7 p.m.I saw two triangle shaped objects on the opposite sides of Interstate 90 heading North by the Edgerton/Newville exit. The object on the right hand side of my car was very far off in the distance so I could not see it very well.  The object on the left side (driver&apos;s side) of my car was hovering at an altitude similiar to the height of a electrical tower although there are no towers in that vicinity.  There were 3 lights one red and two white and it was triangular in shape.  I watched it sit there blinking and it did not make a sound or move.  This is not the first time I&apos;ve seen these objects in this area.  They seem to appear quite often and have been on my drive North on this Interstate in this same area for the last couple of months.  I do not see them every week or every day but I do see them frequently and my children have seen them as well.  It is always around the same time of evening when I see them.

It was a clear evening with a nice blue sky. There was a breeze that was blowing out of the west. The only clouds noted where behind me a little above the south-west horizon. The sun was to the rear left of me at about approximately 7:00 of due south at an elevation of approximately 60 degrees above the horizon. The northwest and northeast sky in front of and above me was totally devoid of any clouds except for, I noticed one solid white slight puffish at the top and whispy on the bottom appearing as lopsided square shaped STATIONERY white cloud approximately the size of a piece of paper 8x11 held at arms length. It was at approximately 1:00 of due north and approimately 45 to 60 degrees overhead above the horizon. I thought this was very strange the cloud being the only cloud in this sector of the sky and stationery. It did not touch the ground. There were some students walking about the parking lot at that busied going to and leaving classes. None seeming to notice the phenomena and I didn&apos;t bother about asking them to note the cloud. I kept watching the cloud for about 5 to 6 minutes and suddenly to my astonishment the cloud began to fade going from a white to a smoky looking brown then total disapperance in less than a minute. It expanded some what in size before disapearing. A few minutes later slightly to the bottom left at slight a distance from where the cloud was a slight glimmer from what looked like a silver BB.  About 30 minutes later a manila colored helicopter with a long rounded fuselage with red and blue stripes maybe on the crew cab, appeared from the east and flew near where the cloud was but lower, then it flew west, then south, then north,  then, east in a circle several times and then flew off southward. First I thought it was a medivac copter that sometimes lands at the hospital located east of campus. Strangely a copter did land there later but it was green and had a shorter fuselage. At approximately  17:50 upon the second circumvention of my walk I noticed further north beyond where the cloud and where the silver shiny looking BB were, against the blue sky, an object appearing as a  silver slim roundish fountain pen held at double arms length was hovering about 45 degrees it apeared above the horizon. This could have been an airliner. There is an airport in that vacinity. Coincidently, in reference to the cloud I observed it seemed to have hovered over where I had read in an earlier report about an observer who said he had seen an object in a field about the size of three football field somewhere around the Palatka Road area here in Louisville. The most outstanding, astonishing and startling obsevation regarding this report though is the sudden diappearance of the cloud completely within a minute. My questions are: has anyone else ever seen an ocurrence such as this and/or is there an explanation for this strange phenmomena that I saw. Then too, every cloud we see may not be JUST an ordinary cloud. Perhaps some type of camouflaging agent for an object or objects???

The acquisition of a detailed county map of nearby Franklin County enabled me to better pinpoint the line-of-sight all the way to the Arkansas River. Right underneath my line drawn on the map is an area south of Altus, Arkansas that is a wildlife refuge that borders the river. A quick drive to that site and some slow cruising along the dirt road just a few dozen yards north of the river resulted in seeing some patches of burnt ground running along next to the road and out into the large open fields north of the road and river. It was while investigating on foot when a local driving up and down the road, and hopping out of his truck to pick up beverage cans and other trash, that I was informed while chatting with him the Army Corp of Engineers had been in the area &quot;a few days ago&quot;{exact time and date uncertain} either doing a controlled burn in the region or fighting the fire. The conversation was hard to follow as his truck was idling noisily and he would not stay in one place to talk with me as he moved back and forth doing his thing, picking up trash from the scorched earth, after I informed him of what was observed from my backyard on Feb. 24th, 2005 between 7 and 8 PM. And then he moved on down the road as I thanked him and left the area to move on to other spots underneath the line drawn on my map. Nothing apparently unusual was noticed in any of the other open fields near county roads between the Arkansas River and my house that intersected the line on my map. If the Corps had been dealing with a large fire on the night of my sighting, then it would all make sense if they had been sweeping high-powered spotlights onto the columns of dense, rising smoke from ground vehicles and maybe one of their boats anchored nearby on the river. They do indeed have powerful searchlights for patrolling the river and its banks which fall under their federal jurisdiction including all tributaries and even mud puddles.

The dog wouldn&apos;t go anywhere near the flat grass or the pond that abutted it.Pond 2 was WEIRD.  The usual mud around the water still held the impressions of the cows that had last drank from the pond. The deep holes where they had pulled their legs out of the mud were completely dry. The mud had dried and cracked...it crumbled easily in our fingers when we picked it up, but on the ground it was solit and hard....sll the way to the water&apos;s edge which was down from about a diameter of about 40 feet to only about 10 feet. We circled the water three or four times, but as far as we could see there were no frogs or even bugs in, on or near cow pond two. We tossed chunks of the dirt into the water to try to stir anything, but nothing was there.  Less than a week before, the pond had been full of frogs and bugs and even crayfish. The only thing we got on our waders was dust. We went into field 3, but once we were past the 5-10 feet of flat, dry grass there were bugs and normal field flora and fauna...no frogs though.We returned home, dragging the german shepherd away from cow pond 1 again.  We told my parents what we had found. I wanted to report it, but my father wouldn&apos;t let me...I think partly because we were new in the area and partly for fear of ridicule.Thgank you for letting me tell my story after all these years.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

The kind of things you would see in cartoons...a saucer shape, with the glass kind of bubble on top, black all the way around it and blinking lights on the sides. The lights blinking though is the thing that confuses us the most because the colors of the lights were red, white and blue....government craft??? We have no clue... Now you wont believe this but it was within I&apos;d say 100 yards away from us on the left side of the road!! And so you get a feeling of what we saw, it wasnt &quot;a light in the sky&quot;.. it was like...imagine standing in your driveway and looking across the street at the house on the other side.. only hovering about 50 yards off the ground. thats the best way i can describe the distance away from us and the size of this thing.

We just drove slowly along, staring at it, and it was going the same speed as us in the same direction, I guess following us in curiosity..or wanted to kill us :P  And so we were in awe, we had no clue what to think or do at the moment,  and I was only 6 so I got out of my seat in the back of the van and crawled in between the two front seats. Then out of nowhere the thing literally was behind the mountains that were way off in the distance in 2 seconds!!

Sequentially, a third light appeared equidistant from the second light, to the right, and then a fourth. As the fourth light came on, the first light went out.

Everything was going great and there were tons of stars in the sky that were all visible because there were no clouds out at the time. We were having a barbecue and while everyone was talking and relaxing I kept noticing and my eyes kept wondering off towards this particular star that seemed to stand out from the rest and it looked like it was moving. I ignored it at first thinking that it was just an illusion but as I looked closer it really was moving. I turned around to tell my friends that there was something moving towards us way off in the sky amongst the stars and when I turned around to point it out to them it had moved much further to us. This thing must have been as far as hell away from us as possible since it looked as if it were sitting up in space with the stars and to move that much of a distance in about 5 seconds is incredible.  I don&apos;t even think any planes, fighter jets, or anyhting that has been made on this planet can travel that fast from that far away. Everyone was excited at this point and we just watched as it got closer and closer to where we were. Now that I recall the whole time that this was happening there was no noise or anything and after it got to where we were at such mind blowing speeds it slowed to about a 10 mile an hour hover right above the trees that were about 20 feet away from us. These trees down at my house are all about 50 feet tall so we had an amazing view of this cigar shaped ship. It did have these 5 intensly bright lights on the bottom of it that were all white except the one in the middle was a less bright yellow color. At one point the craft just completely stopped while above the trees and the middle light yellow light became more intense than the white ones and flickered on and off twice  We do know for a fact though that it was a solid object because the lights on the bottom of it reflected the silver metallic surface that it was made out of. Also when it flew over us it covered up most of the stars in the sky so we knew that it was solid. it was atleast 65 feet long and from the bottom you could easily tell it was about 25 feet wide. We observed it hovering above the trees that were now lit up becuase of the intense lights on the bottom of the craft until the light in the center turned from yellow to light blue and it sped off at amazing speeds over the trees in my back yard to about 1,000 feet away. this whole time there was no noise whatsoever and we were actually kind of spooked. Then off in the distance not to far away two other ships on the left and right sides of the cigar shaped craft rose up from the thick woods and then at that point all five of them sped away in formation within about 2 seconds.I know I will never see anything like this again in my life and it will stay with me forever.

Off to the SE he noticed an aircraft&lsquo;s contrail similar to those he had noticed during the past weekend. He also observed that the aircraft appeared to be lower in altitude than when such vapor trails are normally formed. The metallic aircraft color was readily apparent in the sunlight, and the contrail was white against the blue sky. Suddenly the contrail stopped, and at this point the aircraft appeared to be about the size of a pencil eraser head at arm&lsquo;s length but incredibly, the aircraft seemed to have almost halted in the sky. John watched as the contrail dissipated right up toward the back of the aircraft. He also noticed that the body of the aircraft seemed a little too long as compared to others he had observed. At that point, he realized there were no wings attached to the fuselage. He continued his observation for 6 to 7 minutes until, moving very slow, it was lost from view with no change in it&lsquo;s appearance. Upon receiving the above report from John about 10:00 AM, I noticed that the skies above Fayetteville and the Atlanta area 15 miles to the North, were full of jet aircraft making a very obvious checkerboard pattern of vapor trails (the sky was FULL). Inspection of these via binoculars and video zoom over the next few hours indicated they appeared to be the normal contrail vapor formations, slowly drifting more or less eastwards.

There&apos;s a whole lot of thing&apos;s that have happened, that I have documented but I don&apos;t have the time or the room to go into it right now. To be honest this whole thing has been scary, and I don&apos;t know who to even tell. It&apos;s gotten to the point that I try to stay around people and not by myself which is very unusual for me . Before all this I was alway&apos;s by myself either hunting or fishing.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

That evening I was looking up at a dark starry sky as we walked through Brentwood Park, facing south (toward town). I noticed a circular patch of the heavens which was totally black, devoid of stars. &quot;Isn&apos;t that peculair?&quot; I asked. &quot;Must be a cloud,&quot; she replied.We stood looking up less than a minute, then resumed our walk. After taking several steps, I stopped, too curious not to look again. I was struck by how much larger the black circle appeared, and now it seemed to be moving very slowly(silently) directly overhead -- TOWARD, NOT FROM the direction it had been moments before. This was headed south! I had to hold my head far back to see the whole thing. It looked huge, low as or lower than an airplane.We walked to a bench near the brick building where we lived. The temperature was so pleasant, we decided to sit outside awhile, and talk. A full moon had risen and the night was now very bright. We decided to go inside, but as we stood to leave, I noticed -- about a block&apos;s distance south of us, in the shadow of several large trees (I think magnolias) there sat an unlit, domed saucer, not much larger than a volkswagon bus. It was sitting a couple feet above the ground on what appeared to be slender rods. It didn&apos;t look tall enough for people to stand in.As I pointed this out to my sister, the left edge of the dull metallic gray craft began to move as if a separate portion of the rim was being raised. This was not hinged like a car&apos;s trunk; it moved more like a hydralic awning. My sister grabbed my arm and we crept backward into the building. The private screened porch was inset and we were afraid to go out on it for a look. The landing site was out of view from the windows inside the living room.To my knowledge, neither of us saw the saucer/s again.An afterthought: if I&apos;d &quot;dreamed up&quot; the experience -- logically, the vehicle would have opened with a ramp moving ground-ward. (Of course, we didn&apos;t hang around long enough to watch the complete action, so there could have been more to it.)((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the experience is approximate.  PD))", "Corroborating my friend&apos;s UFO siting - it really happened.It was raining hard that night.  We were driving from Petaluma to Sebastopol and the car was running so bad we didn&apos;t think it would make it home.  It was running rough and kept stalling out.  We were driving west on Hiway 116, and we noticed a bright, bright light above the car.  The light was pointing straight down at the car blinding us.  We thought it was a helicopter at first.  When we turned left onto my street, it turned with us.  We slowed down to a stop, jumped out to look up, and it was so bright we couldn&apos;t see anything.  We got back in the car and drove to my house, and it stayed above the car all the way home. When we pulled into my driveway, it was right above us.  Then it was hovering above my house, and it was as big as my four-bedroom house.  It gave off a friendly aura.  I wasn&apos;t even scared.  I had a warm feeling inside.  It didn&apos;t seem like a threat in any way, but like it wanted to make friends.  It had little bright, bright lights all over it.  The whole thing tilted and the lights started blinking alternately. They were giving us a light show.  The lights would go fast, then slow, as if he was showing off.  He tilted on his side, made all the lights blink really fast, then the lights all stopped and it was gone in a blink of an eye.  Then it appeared again instantly, no sound, and sat above the house again.  It tilted one way, then the other, and it was gone again.  I felt honored that it chose me to show itself to.  Reading this over when I finished writing it, I realize it sounds crazy.  But it really happened.  If someone else told me this story, I never would have believed it.  I&apos;ve never believed in UFO&apos;s until this day.  Now I&apos;m a believer.  I got the feeling that they&apos;ll be back.", "A buzzing sound interupted my piano/singing; 1/2 lit light green slats, white &amp; red lights on other side, 20-30 ft up &amp; from my house.I was singing and working at my piano on some songs I&apos;ve written for about an hour, and heard a loud buzzing sound. I stopped to listen if it was the sump pump. It was coming from my right so I looked to the right and out the window right next to my house but on the other side of the tree next to my driveway was a large craft, 1/2 was lit in what seemed light green lighted slats, and the rest of it had red and white lights flashing on and off, I think some of the white may have stayed on. The green lighted part was the front or the direction it was moving. I couldn&apos;t make out the shape of the entire thing because it was so dark outside. I ran upstairs to call the police on my cell phone but looking out upstairs at it, as it kept moving slowly away, I started shaking so badly I couldn&apos;t function to call the police, couldn&apos;t remember where the phone # was.  I finally called 411 for the police in Green Brook as it seemed to be going in that direction.  The officer laughed at me sarcastically and suggested it may be an advertising gimmick.  This is the 5th siting for me since I was 13 (I&apos;m 55 yrs old now) and the closest ever.  I am very uncomfortable about this as I had earlier left a cell phone message for my brother wishing him a belated happy birthday and ended with &quot;Well, I haven&apos;t seen any UFO&apos;s lately&quot;.  I got a horrible feeling in the pit of my stomach right after I said that.  I knew I would see one again but did not expect it so soon or so close to me.  It may have been about 20-40 feet away from me and about 25-30 feet high.  I could tell it was flying behind and away from my tree as I saw the branches in the light of the craft as it moved.  The green was a beautiful color, but appeared like they were slats laying or placed next to each other at an angle that suggested it to be a wide oval but the rest of it was not visible to determine that.  I would guess it was the size of a small airplane, and a blimp shape.   I do not look forward to another siting but know this will occur.  They are getting closer each time. My sister called me after I told her about it that she heard on the news that there are meteor showers and we may see green lights.  This was NO meteor shower.  This was a vessel, deliberate in its movement low across the sky right next to and perhaps when the buzzing started, right over my house.  Once I reported it to the police in GB it disappeared either from view or the lights just went out.  I could not tell. I intend to buy a good digital camera to keep on me at all times. Since I may not always be able to put my glasses on, I am even considering laser surgery on my eyes for distance. I want to be able to show proof.  I will try to submit a map and drawings (of the bright orange oval craft I saw 10-14-04 as well).", "Bright red light that faded then suddenly then a second later a white streak shot to the east from where the red light was.It was a little after sunset, I looked out my window to the South and saw a bright red light.  At first I thought it was a glare so I moved but it was still there.  So I got up and noticed it was really brighter than any plane so I took my camera and opened the door. When I did I turned my camera on and the light seemed to dim then it was gone but a second later I noticed a streak of light (white) from where it was and it shot to the east it almost looked like a shooting star.", "Dark, squarish non-aerodynamic object floating at high altitude from south to north.I initially saw the object from the driver&apos;s side of my car as I approached my house. After parking my car, I went immediately to our south facing outside deck. The object was dark in apparent color and in my initial view of it seemed to be squarish in shape. It had caught my attention because it definitely was not a powered airplane or helicopter and made no noise. I&apos;ve lived in our house for 17 yrs. and am used to seeing and hearing aircraft flying over from the south towards PDX. There was cloud cover (elevation of which I have not yet been able to confirm) and the object appeared to be at least 2,500 ft. in altitude. As for it being an ultra-light or a powered or unpowered hang-glider, it did not to my naked eye appear to have any sort of aerodynamic shape. It was slowly moving from south to north and it seemed to almost be tumbling or rotating through the air and in so doing presenting different shape and outline profiles.

It was a cloudless night. The object was boomerang shaped or possibly trianglular. A series of dull lights, remimded me of amber bicycle reflectors, between five to seven of them, were arranged in a chevron pattern along the leading edge.  I am unsure if the object was boomerang shaped or triangular since the lights were an a chevron pattern and the training edge of the object was not clearly visible. The motion of the object caught my attention since it was balck but a bit more matte and light than the backgound sky, like a silhoutte.  I initially thought from the size that I was seeing the silhouette of an eagle flying glow overhead when I first caught sight of the object from the corner of my vision, but as soon as I turned my attention to the object, I saw the lights and details.  It clearly occluded the stars in the sky. I cannot estimate the object, but it was about the same size as a bald eagle flying about 50 feet overhead.  The object made no sound.  It traversed the arc of the sky visible to me in about 8 seconds (about 120 degrees).  The speed and direction of the object appeared constant during the time I observed it.

At first I thought that another planet or star was close to Mars, since the color of them both was a vibrant orange.  Then I realized that there were two, and they were much larger than any star in the sky.  All at once they disappeared.  One minute later one appeared, then another.  They were both pretty far away from me by the looks of it 10 - 15 miles away.  Then I started thinking that they were fireworks, but these things didn&apos;t go up or down or fade, they just appeared and disappeared.

I went to pick up my daughter from school around 6:00 P.M.. in Okeechobee and when we were coming back home to Kissimmee prairie it was dark. As I was about 2 miles from my camper trailer I saw a bright light hovering above the trees. I was not alone on this sighting; my three daughters were with me and they saw the light, too.  We were coming into the prairie and when I saw this bright light I slowed down; I wasn&apos;t sure what to make of it.  I did know I had never seen anything like it before. It was dark and the only thing I could see was the bright light flashing down in the trees. I knew it wasn&apos;t an airplane or helicopter because there wasn&apos;t any flashing colored light. This light stayed in one place until I got closer. When I got closer, about two blocks from it, the bright light turned off. This scared me. I knew whatever it was had seen the lights of my car so I hurried up and went home to my trailer which was four blocks north of the light. When I got home I asked my husband if he&apos;d seen the light and he said no, he was watching TV. I asked him to come outside and when he did I told him what I saw. He said it was an airplane; he didn&apos;t believe me.  While I was telling him about this bright light and looking in the same direction, the light came back on in the same place as before. We watched it for about fifteen minutes in one spot but it was not moving or making any noise. It was too dark to see anything except this bright light which just stayed in one place. After about fifteen minutes the lights turned off. I was really curious after this and stayed outside looking into the sky. Then, about five minutes from the time the light went off it reappeared north of my trailer over the trees again. This time it was moving slowly towards our trailer. I&apos;d say it was about three blocks north of us this time. This was getting really scary by now. I could feel the hair on my arms standing up. We turned the lights on our car and the light in the sky went off. When the light reappeared for the third time it was a little further than before. This time it was over a cattle field. I kept an eye on it and couldn&apos;t believe what I saw. I saw lights being shot down from the huge light in the sky. I heard the noise the light beam made. I say &quot;light beam&quot; because that is the only type of noise I&apos;ve ever heard like that.  That was on TV, so I&apos;m not too fond of saying that. If I could describe it any other way I would.  When we saw this we jumped in our car and went closer to where other people lived. In the prairie {Kissimmee} the houses and trailers  are not close to each other and in 2001 there were no street lights and the roads were not paved. I&apos;d say there were about twenty houses in that area at the time. Around the area we were in we only had one neighbor who lived four blocks from us. The next day my three daughters went to school and asked our neighbor&apos;s kids if they&apos;d seen the light and they said no, it was probably the military in the area. I&apos;m from Louisiana and never saw such a thing before. I wouldn&apos;t know if it was military or not but I do know for a fact if wasn&apos;t a helicopter or airplane, for helicopters and airplanes don&apos;t stay in one spot for a long period of time and they have colored flashing lights and this didn&apos;t.

Just a guess.  PD))Well as I just finished meditating, I was looking out side at the full moon on this cold crisp clear night at about 11:30pm U.S. Central time.. I went outside and took in the stars above. They are so majestic and I have been always drawn to them. The are just so mesmerizing to me. I am so fond of them. Well as I look at the sky this one particular object in the distance that seems to be blinking faster than normal and seems to have a distinct color(s) to it. I am like well it could be a plane at first but it was not moving and didnt drift off towards the horizion. It stayed in place. So I ran back inside and got these mini-binoculars. They aren&apos;t very strong at all in clarity but I was able to see a little better. I definitely got to see more color and to see what it was blinking. With a faint feeling for what the object may have been. The colors were Green/Red/Yellow/White and Blue. Now unless a star can produce those colors or a helicopter has those feature than I would have to say I was looking at something literally out of this world. Now it seemed like it has a top and a bottom row of colors. It also seemed to be turning as in rotating from Right to left in a circular motion because the color of the lights seemed to be stronger in one postion while in another position there was a different set of colors. I definitely looked like it was roating just based on the movement of the colors. I also at one time saw a white light perhaps orbish looking thing that was at the top of object. It was just slightly off to the right side of it and then it shortly disappeared soon after I observed it. I went back at looking at the object its about 11:40Pm U.S Central time. I decide that I want to get a closer look at this and see if I can get a better view so I can get more detail of this object. So I put on my coat and hop in my mini-van and I am off and away. I seem to be making ground on this and I am so excited. I pull off to the side of the road about 2-3 miles from my house which is to the North West. I get out and I don&apos;t see much better details, but the colors seem a bit brighter and distinguishable. They are definitely moving from Right to left in a circular motion. Seems to be two set&apos;s of lights. I hop back in after several minutes convinced I will get closer. I go about another 8 miles down the road. I get out and I view the object and it looks like its getting farther away. I am like damn. So i am well I better get as much viewing time as I can. The bulk of my observation is about 10-12 miles from my house and I am just looking at this thing for about another 20mins. Still in the same place in the sky and still there. I am content and I am most satisfied to as what I have seen and experience. It was definitely a ship/craft/object that was not a plane, not a star and not a helicopter. I drive back to my house and get back. The object is still in the sky but just slightly to the right in the sky but not far off from its original position when I first saw it while looking at the moon. I decide to look again with the binoculars and well looky here I can see it pretty good again. It seemed to be back in its original distance from me from when I first saw it. So while I went back home it must have followed me a little bit back to its original postion in the sky or close enough. Anyways I go inside and come back on the computer to check some message boards. I then go outside 5 mins after I first came in. Now the craft has moved much further in the sky to the right even more. I was like ok. I got my binoculars again and looked some more. I was just so fascinated with it. I saw the colors once again and it was still rotating. I was like ok going back in. this was about 1:25Am U.S Central Time. I am back in on the computer for about 30 mins and then got back outside again(around 1:55am/2:00am U.S. Central time) and it is no where to be found in the Night time Sky. I was like well that was quite a show and I was most pleased and it was a fitting end. Why you ask? Because it gives further credence that it was A. Not a Star, B. Not a Plane. And C. Not a helicopter(unless helicopters like to hover for long periods of time which they can&apos;t due to fuel restrictions). So in conclusion, what did I see? Well, in my eyes I saw a craft that was exhibiting a circular motion from right to left(Clockwise) and had multiple colors associated with it(Red/Green/Yellow/Blue/White) It seemed to be moving to and fro. Stayed in the realitive same area for up to 2hrs plus. Then it went out of site not to be seen again, anywhere in the sky. This object was bright.

I observed this cloud rapidly change shape, seperate into two at great distance apart, change back to one with a small satalite typ companion. It seemed to make these changes in breif intsances when I was looking elsewere maybe in a miniute or two. I also expeirenced some ringing in my ears, don&apos;t now if it is related.

I had travelled with the t-tops of my Pontiac TransAm off and was admiring the night sky as I parked the vehicle in my back yard.As I looked toward the constellation Gemini, I did a double take. Two stars appeared to be moving. They were moving slowly from west to east. One was following directly behind the other and and was to the mind&apos;s eye a distance of between two fingers making a &quot;victory&quot; sign. In order to rationalize what I was seeing, I wondered if these were two satellites in a linear orbit. I have seen single satellites in orbit both at night and near dusk, but I have never seen one follow the other. As I continued to watch, the second light moved southward and caught up with the front light. The two lights then continued to proceed eastward directly in formation (seperated by now the distance between the index and little finger) just above Ursa Major and literally faded from view. A northbound commercial airliner at approximately 25,000-35,000 feet agl on a nortwesterly heading was visible in the lower eastern sky. By comparison, these two objects appeared to be much, much higher than the commercial aircraft. What was the most fascinating thing about this sighting was the almost scary ability of the two craft to blend in with the stars. Unless you spotted them and followed their movement, you wouldn&apos;t even think that anything out of the ordinary was occuring in the night sky. I can still not rationalize what these two objects were, nor how to explain their movements. Did any satelite or space station activity occur over central Florida at that time?

I noticed that the big cumulo-nimbus cloud in front of me suddenly lit up. As I looked up, I saw about six or seven circular beams of light decending down through the cloud. They were all in a perfect circle and rotating counter clockwise (from a ground perspective). They fanned out away from each other slightly. They took up most of the whole cloud...very big...it was hard to estimate the size of the source, but it was quite large and the lights would have had to have been very strong to penetrate that far. I know because I have been a Professional Commercial Photographer for over 25 years. The object was behind the cloud because the light source was strongest at the top and disipated as it fell through the cloud....I would guess a couple of hundred feet below the cloud.  During this time the lights continued to rotate at an even moderate rate. After I had viewed this for around 20 seconds, the whole thing, still rotating, did a pitch and yaw manouver and then slowly ascended back vertically, lighting up the whole cloud again as it departed. The size and behaviour of the light source ruled out any aircraft that I know as I have worked in very many aircraft and helicopters. Although at no time did I see the object itself, the combination of vertical movement, rotation and pitch &amp; yaw was most unusual. As a photographer, I know that the light was decending through the cloud and not reflected from the ground or from any other source.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

I have been a regular to your site for some time now and this is my first time posting a report.  However,  what I saw and confirmed on April 12th, 2005 forced me to share this with the center in the hopes it will added to the database as a footnote.  Currently the database has 2 reports of a flying triangle over the Los Angeles and Santa Monica area on April 12th at approx. 13:00  (1 o&apos;clock p.m.)  What our 2 witnesses were observing was the B-2 Stealth Bomber performing a low altitude fly-by of Dodger Stadium for the opening day ceremonies.  I observed the B-2 at approx. 13:07 from my backyard as it headed west towards Santa Monica at very low altitude approx. 700 to 900 ft. , roughly the same altitude as LAPD helicopters, and bank towards the north Santa Monica Mountains.  I tried to get a shot of this amazing airplane with my cell phone camera but I was too slow. What caught my attention was the engine noise.  Nothing like I&apos;ve ever heard before.   My next door neighbor also witnessed the fly-by.  I live in the Mid-City area of Los Angeles, roughly half way between the witness in downtown and the witness to my west  in Santa Monica.Quote from the Los Angeles Times 4/13/05&quot;The largest crowd ever at Dodger Stadium - 55,892 - barely had time to settle after watching the obligatory B-2 stealth bomber roar past when low-flying projectiles began doing damage.

The craft was large and circular, from what I recall.  Lights were very bright and large underneath it and illuminated parts of the ship.  I&apos;m not sure why, but I watched it as I opened the door to the building and stepped inside, dismissing it, almost as if I was forced to think nothing of it.  In fact, once I stepped inside, I nearly forgot about the whole thing completely.  It wasn&apos;t until much later that I even remembered anything at all.

PD))", "Amber-ish burning light shapeshifting into an array of lights moving very in slow motion but fast at the same time.....can&apos;t explain itAt about 11:19 PM, my girlfriend and I were heading back from dinner at a friend&apos;s house moving South on Highway 7.  About a 1/4 mile North of Argo road, I stopped in the middle of a conversation because something amberish color caught my eye about right at my 10&apos;o clock or Southeast from us.  We started to really observe what the hell it was because we thought at first that maybe it was just a tower.  The light seemed to be about the same size one of those tower lights look like....height and everything, but it was flickering like it was burning.  It wasn&apos;t a red light like the towers have.  I mean it was orange like fire.  Then we realized that it wasn&apos;t a tower when we got passed the hills and trees and seen that it was clearly up in the sky a cosiderable height.  It wasn&apos;t a huge thing in the sky at all.  We keep heading South coming up to Pink Hill Road, then all of a sudden it got smaller and smaller.  This was very strange because it got so small it just looked like one of those tiny, tiny white-ish, blue-ish stars in the sky...just a speck.  Then it started to move West accross Blue Springs very slowly and as we got closer to I-70 we could see flashing red and white lights, just like our airplanes and helIcoptors have.  At this point we were really confused because we thought we just saw a plane catch on fire or something, then it goes out and it&apos;s flying like normal.  As we stop at the stop light at I-70.  The flashing lights were flashing one at a time next to each other in a linear motion but around the object.  And it had a larger light underneath.  It seemed like the lights were moving in an oval shape, but as we tried to follow it, it completely did things we have never seen before.  It looked like it completely shifted shape because of the way the lights were positioned before it started moving slowly away from us, but really far at the same time.  It&apos;s kind of hard to explain without speaking with someone directly.  After we were following it West it turned North, but in a matter of about 15 seconds it kept getting smaller and smaller, then it disappeared over the horizen.  The whole weird thing about is that it looked like it wasn&apos;t hardly moving and yet it was coasting along silently and then disappeared.  It seriously felt like when we started talking about what we were seeing and following it, it was like it knew and changed from a fireball and shapeshifted to a somewhat shoddy airplane look a like and then slowly drifted away into the horizen, but like I said over a 15 second period.  It had to been moving really fast.  We also thought that maybe it was something that came back into the atmosphere at a great rate of speed and then proceeded to fly over our airspace, hence the fire at first cutting throught the atmosphere.  I don&apos;t know, it is really strange.  I have never seen anything like this before and my girlfriend and I hope that we can talk to someone who may have watched the whole thing like we did.  I even called my buddy who was at dinner with me to check the sky and see if he could see what I was seeing, but he was already heading South on Lee&apos;s Summit Rd and it was too far North by then.  I checked my cell phone to see what time I called him and it was at 11:26PM.  For the most part we spent about 5 and half minutes driving from Argo Road to Winsteads parking lot trying to figure out what the hell it was, then spending another minute and half or so trying to follow it.  It was moving so strangly like it was on one constant linear path of energy or something and it was moving so freely, I really can&apos;t explain it.  It looked like slow motion, but it moved away from us fairly quickly obviously because it was gone within about 15 seconds after we tried to follow it.  We got to Woods Chapel Rd heading West on South Outer Rd so we could head North to follow it but it was out of sight after we passed the Saturn dealership and that&apos;s when I called my buddy.  Did anyone else see this??????????  Has anyone seen anything similiar before in another experience?   I know for a fact I&apos;m not crazy and neither is my girlfriend and we are simply dumbfounded.  My whole perception just completely changed.  Either our government has some really cool things we don&apos;t know about or we have something going on up there that we either know about and don&apos;t want to tell the public or they simply don&apos;t know about it at all....and that bugs the hell out of me.((ADDENDA FROM WITNESS))Dear Mr. Davenport,Thank you for responding to my report and please, call me ((name deleted) .   I will do what you say and call my local authorities and media agencies to see if I can locate some more witnesses.  We couldn&apos;t have been the only ones.  I can see where if someone glanced at it, they probably just thought it was an airplane after it shape-shifted and thought nothing of it, but someone else just had to see the start of it.  I have always been a believer, but have never experienced anything like this and it has truly left me annoyed by not knowing what it was.  I am a very sincere and credible person with people who know me and this is one of those things that we haven&apos;t told no one else yet because they will probably think we are joking around with them.  They would think it&apos;s one of those &quot;true lies&quot;, where a story is so unbelievably true that it has to be a lie.  We want to try and contact other people in Blue Springs first who saw it before we really go in depth talking about it.  I felt comfortable explaining everything to you of course since your website seems to be the prominent site that appears in search engines for reporting this kind of thing.  If you or anybody that contacts you about it want to call me, that&apos;s absolutely fine with me.  I will definitely keep you informed of my progress.Sincerely,  ((name deleted))((END ADDENDUM))I just wanted to know when my post will be available for others to see or if I could get a copy of it so if I do find other people who saw something, I can use it as a point of reference.

I was parked in a shopping center waiting for my girlfriend to finish cashing her paycheck. That&rsquo;s when I saw a woman standing on the sidewalk in front of the store pointing up. I jumped out of my truck to see what she was pointing at. I saw an object that was rectangle in shape and was only around 50 feet above the light polls in the parking lot. The object was around 2 feet wide 4 feet long and razor thin. It had a transparent texture with holes. In other words it looked like a rectangle frame covered in wax paper and the wax paper had all holes evenly spaced in it and only the outer rim of the hole would stand out. The centers of the holes were also transparent. This object stayed in one spot rotating very slowly. As it rotated the sun would shine off its edges. This is what would keep you from loosing sight of it. The center did not reflect sunlight. I was wondering why it wasn&rsquo;t blowing around in the wind. The wind was around 10 miles and hour and gusty at times yet this object wasn&rsquo;t affected by it. Besides myself looking at this object, there was the lady who got my attention to look at it along with other people around her. Suddenly after 5 minutes of watching this, it suddenly went straight up quite fast. If it wasn&rsquo;t for the sun reflecting off its edges I would have lost it sooner.", "Four Dancing Lights in the CloudsI was walking my dog and it was a rainy, misty night. Ilooked up into the night sky and saw what I first thought to be &quot;Kleig Lights&quot; making dancing patterns in the sky - but only in heavy clouds. As I continued walking I noticed that these four lights were moving a bit too erratically to be ordinary advertising lights. Throughout the night I kept going outside to find that these &quot;dancing lights&quot; had changed positions in the sky many times. Sometimes they were hovering right at tree level and other times they were way up overhead. At one point a low flying aircraft flew overhead and the lights disappeared briefly only to reappear down the roan and below the horizon. As I gazed at them, I almost became mesmerized by the patterns they were making and my eyes were drawn to the meeting point when they would all suddenly dart or dive together. They appeared to change color slightly to light green, pink and blue. I have absolutely no doubt that this was not a normal occurence. I ran in and got my room mate to come out to witness and she agreed that these lights were not from an airport or advertising display. Neither of us have ever seen anything like it in our lives.", "Large object that consisted of a configuration (in a row) of very large orange lights in High Desert.Over High Desert slightly before 9:00 pm, observed 2 large orange lights fly towards each other and converge.

Reappeared a couple of seconds later and then another joined, and then another till there was approximately 10 large lights in a row.

Something made me look out the window across the woods behind our home.  A very large, red light was erratically bobbing up and down above the treetops heading west.  I grew up in an Air Force family all over the world, and have ridden with my father in small aircraft since I was four.  I know what aircraft look like. This incredible red light took its time about flying and I called my husband to come look.  After it had gone, I was just stunned and could not go to sleep.  I kept checking out the windows for anything unusual.  Then, coming down a hill about 500 yards behind my home was a very bright white light. Looked like someone was running down the hill toward my house.  Of course I woke up my husband .....who said...its probably just a hunter.A few days later we hiked to the back of our property to just look around.  We found 3 burned areas in a pasture.Each was exactly the same size and  about 12 feet across with a badly burned little pine tree at the edge of one circle. Two circles were right together with only about 4 feet between, but the other was north and about 10 feet from the two.  The grass did not grow there for many years. We would walk back there from time to time just to stare at the bare circles.About a year after this happened I was reading in the newspaper an account of a UFO sighting and was amazed that it too had bobbed up and down in the sky.

We got about 3 blocks from the house when our friend in the back seat said &quot;you better look up&quot;. We looked up and sitting next to the chemtrail was an object either reflecting sunlight, or it was self-luminous, we are not sure which. We stopped and watched the object which was moving very slowly. It moved into the chemtrail and then slowly drifted out again. We were unable to make out a definite shape but could tell that it had some sort of protrusion jetting out from it. As we sat, the chemtrail began to drift and diffuse somewhat. As it drifted, the object also drifted with it, following it. It continued to move in and out of the chemtrail.  Having no camera with us, we raced back to the house to retrieve a camera. As we drove in, we found our two sons were outside and they were also watching the object. By the time I got the camera the chemtrail had drifted a good ways away from us and the object was almost undiscernable. I put the digital camera on zoom and snapped a shot, which I include with this report. Although Davis Monthan AFB is close by, I dont think it was from out of there.

There was a large object with white lights (non flashing) hovering low in the sky.It was very clear and you could see the image of the craft. The sound seemed to go away as I stepped into my front yard.You could clearly see that one part of the object was spinning. I ran inside to get the digital camera, binoculars and the movie camera.

We thought we saw a Stealth bomber and began trying to see where it went.  We saw another, and after a while we saw several.  I went inside so my son could wake up and see them.  The three of us layed outside watching for over 4 hours.  During this time other types of aircraft appeared, several larger triangular looking aircraft were seen, as well as massive crafts consisting of several smaller crafts joined together.  We watched as they seemed to be moving from one large craft to another.  It seemed as though the smaller ones were launching from the larger ones.  Straight lines of what looked like stars (but were&apos;nt) were appearing, at one point there were at least five consisting of 8 or more moving lights.  During most of the activity in the sky we heard our dogs barking at nothing, cat (not ours) howling, and wild burros schreeching nearby.  Shortly before daylight it appeared as though they began to prepare to depart.  At times it seemed as though they were engaged in combat with each other.  Many falling star type beams observed, they were red and gold in color.  Larger crafts appeared to break down into several smaller ones and depart.  Some of the larger crafts had a blue craft that seemed to be guiding them away.  One large craft in particular split into two separate pieces one of which departed upward and the other downward in the distance.  The one that appeared to land here looked as though it turned over, changing its position as it was descending, towards 29 Palms.  During the entire event, they made no noise.After most of the crafts had departed 4 gold colored, square objects began to ascend after them, they seemed to have been some kind of guide.  It was at this point that my husband called the 29 Palms Marine Corps base.  He was transferred to the correct person who basically told him &quot;he hadn&apos;t seen anything.&quot;  This statement was made after he was asked who he was, where he was, what was seen and how many others had seen it.Then, my husband placed another call to the local Sheriff&apos;s Department and was told an Officer would be sent down.  As he walked outside after this call, he proceeded to call his father and noticed that the 4 gold square objects were landing in a square formation around our house.  At this point we ran into our home and locked the doors and turned off the lights.  It appeared that some sort of door or hatch opened and a male human figure get out and began walking toward our home.  We called the Sheriff&apos;s department back to see what was taking so long and were told the deputy would not be responding.  Husband went back outside and noticed one of the four objects was rising up from the ground again, it hovered at approximately 40-50 feet.  He quickly came back inside.  This was approximately 20 minutes before daylight.  At daylight he went outside and observed them all departing, he called us out so we could see it too.  They were already several hundred feet off the ground.  A little later  we drove down to where they had landed and saw circular imprints in the soil as well as laid over weeds.  Only found two of these.", "Driving north on rt 9g we witnessed a fireball going east to west..... the sun had not yet set.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous, but we received other reports about the event.

There is an airport about one mile from sighting area (Addison). We were driving toward the object yet it appeared to be hovering. As I realized it was not converging as fast as it should I became more curious. The craft was hovering at approximately 300 feet. I would estimate the length to be about 250 feet by about 50 feet and 50 feet tall. There were no strobes as an aircraft would have. There was a big white constant light at each bottom corner of the forward leading edge and one constant white light located on the lower center trailing edge. The driver of the vehicle would not stop (on tollway) so we progressed under the object. I was unable to detect any real detail of the object other than dimensions. After passing the object it appeared to continus to remain motionless.The rear of the trailing edge where you would expect the tail of an airplane to be had a square box shaped area like 20x20 that had multiple small blinking lights (red,white,blue).

It floated on a very smooth, level path about 5 or 6 meters from the ground in the same direction as the train. Speed was probably about 20 mph. It seemed to be about 20 meters from the window. Size and distances were guessable because the object was seen to pass both behind and in front of trees, telegraph poles, etc.  After about 30 seconds or so the object suddenly reversed direction and shot off skywards at extremely high speed and was lost from sight.

It must have been very bright indeed because it was  close to the sun and I was wearing sunglasses, and yet, it was still very visible. It was not moving.

When we lost sight of them in the glow of Kansas City at approximately 30 degrees elevation, they were separated by approximately the width of my little finger held at arms length. No direction changes were observed. No anti-colision lights were seen, and I was able to observe stars between the two lights as they traversed the sky.

It hung there long enough for me to realize it wasn&apos;t a plane or dirigible or balloon.  Then it disappeared.  I may have been momentarily distracted by my baby.  Later that evening we listened to Cedric Adams, a Minneapolis news commentator, who mentioned that he had had calls about a flying object.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We were taking the backroads near a small, local airport. As we were driving, I looked towards the mountains, and for about a second, I saw a bright green light streek from the sky into the trees. It gave off a long, green trail, which lasted for less than a second after the object disapeared. I don&apos;t think it could have been a plane, because I would have seen a fire from where I was when it crashed, it would have been on the news, and planes aren&apos;t glowing green. Plus, the object just dissapeared.  I don&apos;t think it could have been a flair or other object dropped from an aircraft, because It was going to fast and I did not see any other objects in the sky. We do not live by any military installation or research centers. The town we live in is a slightly isolated one in the middle of the redwoods.I will e-mail an illustration of the object with the same subject name as the one I typed in the Summary Description field when I&apos;m done drawing it.If any UFOCenter employees would like to email me any questions, I would be happy to answer them.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

These were to be it&apos;s final appearance nights from my vantage points in Southern Miami along Biscayne Bay. In fact, all shots were taken of the Southern view from my apartment terrace.  Take note that Turkey Nuclear power plant would be also due south of this vantage point. I am not sure what significance that would have on the objects I saw but I just wanted to mention that in this correspondence.  I have compiled a lot of the photos together after viewing them carefully. I didn&apos;t want to be mistaken about this. On that night, of January 7, 2005, I was preparing to take photos of the comet with my two digital cameras. I had also set up my telescope in hopes of getting some real close shots. It was about 8 or 9 pm and I thought of just testing the cameras out before actually viewing with the telescope. Without a flash, I proceeded to take several consecutive shots using all settings of SQ, HQ, and SHQ  to determine what would give me the best clarity of the moment. I also took shots with a flash as to bring in the buildings across the lake. This dark and light exposure would give me a perspective of distance. If the flash proved to be too bright to capture the comet and it&apos;s surrounding stars, I was going to refrain from that usage and just concentrate on keeping the camera as still as possible on the tripod and hope for the best.As the results will show, I got more than I expected to. I downloaded the first set on to my computer to view and possible see if I caught the right detail of the comet. The shots without the flash were scanned and then I got to the pics that used a flash. I saw something odd in the pictures. Some sort of cylindrical shapes were showing up. ODD...........I never saw that before and I have taken thousand of pics at the night sky. I have an Olympus program on my computer that enabled me to magnify, clarify, and view the objects at closer range. They appeared to be circular in shape with a distinct indentation at an angle of the sphere. Now where did I see that before. The memory of the first Star Wars episode came to mind and I was thinking back of that same shape exhibited in the film. DEATHSTAR. Now that was real strange. As I continued to scan the photos, I saw that there was not one object but several, ranging in size from distant to close enough to touch. The flash of the camera must have reflected it&apos;s fast light on these objects and for some reason produced the image or should I say images. All the photos I have included are original and without tampering of except for enhancement of the shots themselves. I needed some answers on this because to me it is just too unexplainable. As I researched further on the net, I found some comaparisons that are just too coincendtal. And then, not too long after these pictures were taken, an event of captured moons of Saturn..........was it Saturn or Jupiter?.......Were shown on several sites and news pages of a moon that looked very similar to the shapes I had captured on that cool night in January.I hope someone can clarify this data I am sending you. Have these objects been around all the time or have they just appeared for my benefit? Is there something going on (not again), that the human public is unaware of? And why are there so many? Usually a person can capture a UFO or whatever, and it&apos;s a single image of one object. Sometimes you might see two, three, or even four. But this many in one area of the sky. My sincere hope is just to get this information out to the people so they can decide for themselves and the experts can debate over what they really were.", "swirling lighted cloadsean strange lights 3:30 am sunday started out like smoke formed into swirling counter clockwise vortex with light-bluish-gray color it lit up a small area behind some trees  but slowly intesified then disapered 1 min later reapered same spot this time moving clockwise with starr type lights in it much brighter it was big 35 feet wide looked like a miniture huricane moved upwards was silent no noise then disapered i never ever sean anything like this before in my life", "I had a small craft fly directly in front of my car ,in broad daylight , black, cigar shaped, only4-6ft. in lenght.WHILE DRIVING EAST ON HWY 150 ON WEDNESDAY ,MARCH 16 @ APPROX. 4:45PM , I SAW DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF MY CAR A OBJECT FLYING APPOROX. 20 -30 FT ABOVE THE GROUND TRAVELING SLOWLEY HEADING SOUTH,(DIRECTLY TOWARDS RICHARDS -GEBAUR , NOW A MILLITARY TRAINING FACILITY.)

As I was looking at it I could see the jet behind it and the jet was about twice the distance as the object from me.  I could see the wings of the jet as well as the tail (it was well defined).  The object was much clearer as it was a lot closer and was a little larger than the jet.  The object was going from the east to the west about at the same pace as the jet.

The expansion was fast and stayed full circle for at least 5 seconds then slowly retracted to the original light.Then a separation occured, and the one light became two.  The second, slightly less bright was also moving in the same direction, but ever so slowly falling further behind (but staying on a flat plane).

We were hugging and I was looking towards the North while she was looking towards the South. When I started to notice a circular bright white light in the North Sky - and it kept getting brighter, thinking it was just an airplane turning towards Palm Springs for its final approach. When I started to notice there were two 45-degree lights emitting from the bright light at the base. Then there were two additional slightly less bright circular lights at the end of the two 45 degrees lights and then a light that was horizontal from those lights, to create a perfect symmetrical upside down triangle.

It was no more then 200 feet in the air, it was silent and snuck up on us. It was a dark silver color and it had white and blue panels all around the edge, that faded from blue to white. We were standing there in amazement, we couldn&apos;t believe what we were witnessing. The u.f.o. wasn&apos;t moving no more than 3-4 mph, the width had to have been some where between 125-150 feet, and traveling east. We watched it until it went out of sight, over some trees. A few minutes later, my mother and my grandmother pulled up in the driveway. My mother asked if we had seen it, because she had already seen it coming along the road. My grandmother got out of the car, and went into the house, while us boys got into the car with our mother, to see if we could catch up with it. We saw it again over a field, on south avenue ext. we pulled into a furniture store parking lot, and watched it. The u.f.o was hovering about 400 feet over the field. Then randomly, another disc that looked the exact same as the other one, appeared over some trees. We watched both of these discs for about thirty minutes. By now it was starting to get dark, and the stars were coming out. The second one that we had seen, always stayed higher than the first u.f.o. The first disc kept shooting down a light, like it was looking for something. The most amazing thing about this, is that these discs were only about 300 yards from the road. Cars had passed, but none had stopped. The lower disc moved up to where the higher disc was, and stayed there for about 3 minutes, and then they just shot off into the sky, at a very fast speed. By this time it was completely dark. The next morning, we looked in the newspaper about this incident, and the had a little write up saying that the u.f.o was a weather balloon.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

It seemed to stop for a second then continue.  I got my binoculars to get a closer look and noticed the object was spinning like a gyroscope.  One moment flat then one moment circular.  The inside looked like spokes from a wheel (maybe 6).  It was at an altitude of under 2000 feet because as I was viewing the object a Southwest Airlines 737 came thru my viewer as it was descending to Burbank Airport.  The pilot should have seen the object.  I called Southwest and a woman was nice enough to take my number while she asked around about the object.  She called back later and said Air Traffic Control had not seen the object.  BUR was about 3 to 4 miles away from the craft.  As I went around to the front of my home to view the object I was not able to locate it again.", "Silvery oval disk hovering for 2 minutes over the cliffs of the dead sea in IsraelI observed 1 oval type craft on the edge of the dead sea hovering over the nearby hills of Ein Gedi, Israel.  I was riding a bus with Israeli tourists when I noticed the object just sitting in the air.  I took a double take and looked around at people on the bus to see if they noticed it.  The sun was shining on the object and it was reflecting.  I thought to myself it was a helicopter at first but it kept sitting still and didn&apos;t have any movable parts like a helicopter blade.  The object had no wings and just seemed to be hovering. I watched the object for 2 minutes and then the bus drove by a cliff that blocked my view.  I was baffled.  Unfortunately my camera was in my bag underneath the bus.  The object seemed to be a silver color.  The object seemed to be observing the dead sea area.  I&apos;m baffled even to this day.", "Circling lights over Lafayette.  Grad from Purdue flight program here and these were NOT airplanes.  Many people witnessed.I would like to confirm a report in Lafayette that somebody else made for this date.  I even called it into the cops and they were receiving calls as well from others.  I was driving in my car on US Hwy 52 between West Lafayette and Lafayette.  To the Northeast, I saw one bright orange light moving through the air... too fast for an airplane and no strobes so I was instantly interested.  Then I saw a second one light up right behind it followed by a 3rd, 4th, and 5th.  They ascended and the light went out, but I could see the dark craft circling around and light up again when it came to the bottom part of the circle.  They did this for about 3 cycles and disappeared. I am a graduate from Purdue University from the flight program, so I know what planes look like.  THIS WAS NOT AN AIRCRAFT FROM THIS WORLD... unless it was some secret government aircraft, but the military operations area is NOT near either city and the bases around here are not known for producing abnormal activity.  I am absolutely convinced it was some kind of alien craft and have reported it to the student newspaper and the local newspaper and am still waiting for a response.  I will write letters to the editors to try to get others to report this. I told all of my friends about this and most did not believe me.  One who didn&apos;t believe me was at work Sunday when a co-worker brought up how she saw UFOs around 10PM on the same night and he was stunned.  I am convinced there were MANY who saw this.  The woman who told him about her sighting said she saw all of the lights merge together and disappear.  The other witnesses listed were in the car behind me and pointing toward the UFO&apos;s.  Please watch the local papers!((ADDENDUM FROM ORIGINAL WITNESS))Supplemental report:  I talked with the Tippecanoe County Police tonight and the officer stated that they have confirmation that the military was dropping flares last night.  The objects I saw were to the Northeast, which is in the direction of the Military Operations Area (MOA) for Grissom AFB.  I do not believe they have fast, highly maneuverable aircraft station at that base. The officer also stated that it was unusual that the AFB did not announce any flares or military operations to the FAA.  The area of the sighting would be in control of Chicago Center, which the officer said did not see anything on radar.  The officer stated that the flight controller in chicago was really mad because he saw nothing on their radar and was not notified.  I believe I estimated that the objects were around 5 or 6 thousand feet.  From my flight experience, I know center will not see objects below about 6,000 feet.  The officer assured me that the AFB had the aircraft on radar and it was their planes.  The bottom line is that nobody knew of any military operations beforehand, which makes the event more interesting. The other problem with the flare excuse is that the lights did not last long.  Also, I would estimate the lights were only lit for 5 seconds at a time and I believe flares should last longer.  The biggest problem with the flare excuse is that all of the lights started at the exact same point in the sky.  The only way the flares could start at the same point is if the airplane is flying directly toward or away from me.  If that was the case, the flares should not have had such lateral movement.  The lights were also at a constant speed and did not descend much or slow down as you would expect.  Assuming the aircraft stayed in the MOA, the speed of the lights should have been much slower.  In my professional opinion as a graduate of the Purdue flight program, the lights originated from an aircraft beyond the capabilities of modern fighter jets that the public is made aware of.  Due to the silence and disappearance of the craft (which I could see when the lights turned off during the circling maneuver), I tend to think it may be extraterrestrial, but then again, I didn&apos;t see it enter orbit. I told all of my friends about what I saw and none of them witnessed the event, however one of my friends who dismissed my claim was at work when a co-worker started talking about UFOs that she saw.  She stated that at the end, the orangish lights all came together and then disappeared.  I will be trying to get more info ASAP.((END ADDENDUM))", "UFO over Westerville, Ohio?My wife and I were sitting on our screened-in porch at our home in Westerville, Ohio, which faces east.  At around 6:00 pm on an October evening, we saw a large bright stationary object in the southeast sky.  I tended to ignore it for awhile.  I thought that perhaps it was a communications satellite.  I went into the house and got by 7 x 50 field glasses to help identify the object.  It was no helicopter, commerical or military aircraft, and certainly not one of those blimps that occasionally make its way down to the Ohio State University to cover a football game.  As far as I could tell, it didn&apos;t move.  There was no noise coming from it.  The object was perhaps 50 to 60 feet in diameter.  The setting sun was reflecting off the object and made it somewhat difficult to see.  As far as I could tell, there were no external lights.  There were 5 large rectangular windows that took up much of the space of this object.  There was a yellow glow in the interior.  I saw a person dressed in a light-colored single piece suit from the neck down.  The person had a head, 2 arms, and a body.  He appeared to move only once and only slightly.  It stood next to what appeared to be a &quot;file cabinet&quot;, which stood as tall as his shoulder.  There was some mass around these windows but nothing that would constitute the body of some aircraft.The next evening, my wife and I saw the same object.  I called a local television station to report what I had seen and if anybody had any idea what it was.  The lady gave me some answer and that was the last that I heard of this object.  As far as I know, nothing was reported on any television news broadcast or, printed in the Columbus Dispatch.  Surely, others in the area must have seen this object.  I know what I saw, but I have no idea what I saw.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))", "Fleet of UFOs over Goshen, Ohio...Summer 1994First off I must say that I wish I had reported this a long time ago, I would have if I knew how to go about it.  I&apos;m reporting it now because I really would like to know if anyone else has seen anything like this in Goshen before or since.  Would love to compare notes.  Anyway... here&apos;s the story.It was about 11:30 at night on a clear starry night in late summer.  My girlfriend at the time and I were driving down ST. RT. 28 heading out of Goshen towards Blanchester.  Just to give you a better image of where we were, Goshen is farmland and out past the town it becomes a long stretch of road with forest and fields pretty much everywhere you look.My girlfriend was asleep in the passenger seat when I noticed a very bright row of white lights in the sky ahead and off to my left.  These lights were bright enough and just about the right height that I at first passed them off as stadium lights until I remembered that we had already passed the high school about 10 minutes before.Not being familiar with the area I woke up my girlfriend and pointed to the lights to see if she knew what it was.  She, like myself, was clueless.  Both of us kept our eyes glued to these lights as we drove further down the road.  At the distance we first noticed it... we didn&rsquo;t notice any deviation in the brightness of the lights or any movement from the object until we got closer.  At that point we could see a sort of oscillating effect to the lights that made it look as if they were rotating around the object.  When we noticed this, honestly I began to get a bit excited.  I had always heard about UFO&apos;s but had never seen one and the thought of seeing one was a rush.  But even then I wasn&rsquo;t planning on tracking this thing down... I was interested but not THAT interested.  That is until I was getting really close to my turn off and realized that my route would take me right by the field this thing was in.  So it looked like we were going to get a closer look at this thing after all.I took a left onto Shiloh road... I think that&apos;s the name of the road.  However after turning left the object was on my right hand side about a football field away and few hundred feet in the air (guessing on the distances).  Just after turning off we saw a little gravel driveway near a broken down barn that went a short distance into the field.  Both our curiosities were really peaked at this time so we pulled in, shut the car and radio off and watched.What we saw was amazing, the object was so dark that all we saw was the lights that ran around its perimeter, we couldn&rsquo;t make out a shape yet, but watching its maneuvers was enough.  It would sit horizontal with its lights seemingly rotating around it, extremely bright but not so much you could look at it.  Then, its lights would dim down and stop &ldquo;rotating&rdquo;, it would shift from horizontal to a roughly 30 degree angle and shoot straight up in the sky and back down again in a matter of seconds but in a different spot within the field.  It would then settle fully horizontal and its lights would return to how we first saw them.  At no time did this craft seem to notice or care we were there, there were times when it would move that it would come close enough that we could hear a pulsating humming sound coming from it.All in all, we stayed and watched this for about 1/2 an hour and never did either one of us have a sense of fear, we felt totally safe (whether we were or weren&rsquo;t).  While we sat there though, we noticed several other object at varying distances all pulling the same kind of maneuvers, bringing the total to about 8 UFO&apos;s in that area.  We really got the impression that they were searching for something or practicing maneuvers? Who knows.Finally we decided to leave before we pushed our luck.  On the drive home my girlfriend noticed that one of the objects was moving in our general direction.  Not so much following as we had a good idea that the direction it was going would take it really close to her home.  Her Dad happened to have a good set of binoculars so when we got there we ran back outside with them and took a look up as it went by.  What we saw was a dark triangle with 4 lights, 3 in the corners and one larger one in the center each having a yellowish/white light underneath.  In fact the picture of the Triangular UFOs from Belgium look almost identical to what we saw.So there&apos;s my story, I would love to hear from anyone that might have seen anything similar.  Granted this was 10 years ago, but I&apos;m betting that if anyone else saw this it would have stuck in your mind as much as it has mine.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))", "I saw a triangular, see through objectAs I was walking to school one morning with my two brothers and a friend, we notice 3 men gazing at the sky. As we walked passed them, I heard one of them say &quot;It&apos;s a ufo&quot;. That was what got my attention. As I looked at where they pointed, i saw in the sky some kind or triangular shaped object in the sky.  Or at least I think it was because it seemed crystalised or see-through. I gazed at the object with disbilief until it disapeared in a blink of an eye. Unlucky was that my brothers didn&apos;t see it, but I know the men did, wich later on just went inside their working factory.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I walked out to my car and went to the trunk. While closing the trunk and facing the east, with a very clear ski and the sun more closely to my back, I caught a glimps of a reflection to the east over the house.  At first, what I didn&apos;t think anything was unusal but at the same time it was out of position.  The meaning here is my home is in the landing and takeout path for Tulsa Int. Airport. In forty years, I have seen nearly every kind of airplane there is.  Plus my dad work on all kinds of airplanes for 30 years included the Boeing 747.  What caught my eye at first was the thing in the sky was a half mile east of the line up point for the runway. It was also way to high. I would say, 5,000 feet maybe more. My first thougth was, this plane was going to have to take a crash dive to the left in order to land.  Also what seem odd was it was going slightly slower than normal landing speeds.  There were also no landing lights of any kind. Then I realized something was wrong...  This thing didn&apos;t have a set of wings, tail, rudders, engines. If it was going to land, the landing gears would have been down by then. There were none of them either...   Then I just stared in amazement... This thing did not have any identifing marks that a normal airplane had. With no tail, no brand name.  It had no windows. The very front was black as well as the very end of it.  There was a black type of band in the middle. The remainder was polished type aluminum.  It was a cylinder in shape. For size, it was, I would say, longer than a 747 fusalog... maybe 30 feet or more. In other words, it was long. Then I started to think for a second... the wind, very slight, was coming from the south maybe 2 to 3mph.  Not a big deal but planes that would be taking off would be going from north to south.  With this monster a half mile to the east at 5,000 feet, it would have been right in the path of any planes taking off and heading east.  This thing continued on a stright north direction.  Did not turn or change speeds.  I could definitly see after a 10 second look that it had no wings or familiar airplane features.  I didn&apos;t hear a sound. Even a 747 at a half mile distance is something I would have heard and I have a hearing problem. After staring at it so long, it was almost memorizing to look at. Then I lost track of it because of the distance it traveled.

They seemed to be playing tag or chase and moved extremely fast from south end of the mountains to the north.

She had been driving one of those old stationwagons that had the back seat facing out the back window.  It was summertime, I remember because the back window was wide open.  We were on our way home and I don&apos;t remember which of us were sitting back there but as Mom made a right turn we were facing the Wanaque reservoir.  All of a sudden, as Mom made that turn, we were staring straight at a silver disc hovering not more than 30 feet above the water, only about 50 feet away from us.  I remember all of the kids screaming at Mom to stop the car.  I just remember all of us screaming, but it wasn&apos;t really fear.  More excitement, I believe.  Well, Mom had to drive up the road a short ways so that she could turn the car around, but by the time we got back there, it was gone.  Mom did see it in the rearview mirror when she heard all the commotion we were making.  The disc was about 50 feet long, shining silver and silent as it hovered.  I nor any of my family reported it.  I&apos;m really not sure why.  For some strange reason, maybe because we were all so young (I&apos;m second youngest of six)none of us discussed the sighting for years. I&apos;ve talked to a couple of my siblings about it when we got older.  We all remember it the same way. I went to the Ringwood library to see if they had any information or old news clippings about that event. As it turns out, many people saw the same thing.  UFO&apos;s seemed to make an appearance for that entire weekend.  People from all around would park there cars around the reservoir day and night and many reported night sightings.  My mother, who has since passed, remembered men in dark suits but she wasn&apos;t sure what they were doing there or how they knew what was going on that weekend.  She was never approached by these men.  A few years ago, I read a book-Above Top Secret-by Mr.Goode and sure enough, he had reports in his book about the Wanaque reservoir sightings. Since then, I have spoken to a few &quot;old&quot; Ringwoodites about whether they had ever had sightings and to my surprise, many had.  But none had seen a daylight sighting. Only the night sightings.(NUFORC Note:  One of several reports from same witness.  We have spoken with the witness, and she sounded quite credible to us.  PD))", "Two bright quickly moving lights.

One on the right moved up and down very quickly. They also moved apart a couple of times. They were very bright lights. They quickly moved across the sky over my house.

I have been a regular to your site for some time now and this is my first time posting a report.  However,  what I saw and confirmed on April 12th, 2005 forced me to share this with the center in the hopes it will added to the database as a footnote.  Currently the database has 2 reports of a flying triangle over the Los Angeles and Santa Monica area on April 12th at approx. 13:00  (1 o&apos;clock p.m.)  What our 2 witnesses were observing was the B-2 Stealth Bomber performing a low altitude fly-by of Dodger Stadium for the opening day ceremonies.  I observed the B-2 at approx. 13:07 from my backyard as it headed west towards Santa Monica at very low altitude approx. 700 to 900 ft. , roughly the same altitude as LAPD helicopters, and bank towards the north Santa Monica Mountains.  I tried to get a shot of this amazing airplane with my cell phone camera but I was too slow. What caught my attention was the engine noise.  Nothing like I&apos;ve ever heard before.   My next door neighbor also witnessed the fly-by.  I live in the Mid-City area of Los Angeles, roughly half way between the witness in downtown and the witness to my west  in Santa Monica.Quote from the Los Angeles Times 4/13/05&quot;The largest crowd ever at Dodger Stadium - 55,892 - barely had time to settle after watching the obligatory B-2 stealth bomber roar past when low-flying projectiles began doing damage. Starter Jeff Weaver gave up 11 hits and eight runs before being pulled after a Pedro Feliz homer.&quot;An airshow  message board also noted the B-2 fly-by for the Dodgers opener, and noted there will be another on Memorial Day May 30th, 2005.

A normal Autumn day had a walk in Highwoods, Colchester with my then girlfriend. The sky was blue and there were no clouds in sight. Looked up as we were walking back to my residence and I saw a cigar shaped aircraft...didn&apos;t think to much about it because of the tregectary it seemed like a silver aircraft carrier and as we were in a &quot;military training zone we saw lots of aircraft so no big deal right? The wings would have been practically equal to my line of sight.When an aircraft that big comes into sight it always appears cumbersome and slow so I did not really pay much attention cause the craft from a distance always seem to move slowly because they are so high. Dinn&apos;t think too much about it because I assumed I couldn&apos;t see the wings as they were equal to my line of sight and therefore I would not be able to see the wings. Anywaywe continued to walk and after about 5 minutes the craft as we observed still appeared stationary. This caught my attention and I therefore paid more attention to it...and then I noticed that the under carriage was brighly lit which could not be possible as it was around 3pm and the sun would illuminate the craft to the far side not the under carriage. On closer inspection we realised it had not moved for 5 minutes and that we were actulley getting closer.

The light appeared to be a round bright green dot with a brighter whitish center. The track it was taking was straight, no arc; however my opportunity of viewing was short. The sky was partly cloudy, temperature about 55F. No other apparent reason for light falling from the sky, no fireworks. The color is was what caught my eye as I was looking directly southeast at the time. I did contact a Philadelphia news channel to find out if this light was seen by anyone else.

I didn&apos;t see it from there, so i shut off the lights, but didn&apos;t see it again.&quot; Elaine said she ran outside and the object was gone, but several jets were flying in different ares of the sky.&quot;I called my dad and told him I thought I just saw a UFO,&quot; said Elaine. &quot;He told me to come over to his house, so I bundled up my son and raced over to their house on East *** Street.

As it did, it morphed into a triangle. As it got closer to us, we could see the belly and notice it was indeed a triangle with little red lights creating the shape.&quot;On the right side was one green light. It flew over our heads flying in circles and turning at sharp angles. It&apos;s flight pattern defied logic. The lights were steady, not blinking once.&quot; The craft flew south towards Likely and then it turned back, appearing to head straight for the family.&quot;Once it was over our heads, it flew back and forth, like a bird flying in all directions. At that time, we noticed a second one to the north. It was white. Once the two triangles met, they started a dance in the sky, gliding here and there,&quot; Elaine recalls. &quot;Then, all of a sudden, out of nowhere, one of the triangles suddenly burst into a bright ball of light. I thought whatever it was, it was going to crash land, but it broke away from the ball of light. The lights hovered over **** Street near the Alturas Cemetery, just sitting there until they slowly disappeared.&quot; Elaine said the triangle then shot off towards the north, followed closely by the second one, hovered a minute or so, then disappeared.&quot;There was no sound at all when the burst of lights appeared and when the triangle appeared,&quot; said Elaine. &quot;It was pretty freaky, but we all saw it.&quot; There was no reports to the police or sheriff&apos;s office and the military has not returned calls.

I had forgotten about the footage and just recently came across some ufo pictures that were remarkably the same as the one shot by my dad so i thought i should inform someone.My parents had gone back home to Pakistan to visit and my dad would video tape everyday to bring back images of our home and everyday life for us to see and one evening before they were about to leave for shopping, my dad saw a very bright object in the sky. Knowing about my facination with UFO&apos;s he thought it would be something interesting for me to see so he turned on his video camera and started shooting the object in the sky.The object is very bright and has the same distinct shape as the Bonsall, Derbyshire - 2000 ufo http://www.freewebs.com/nurmufo/bonsall.html. The interesting thing that i noticed on the footage my dad shot is that on close observation, one can see an object or two leave the bright orb and later come back into it. Also the ufo changes its colour from white to blueish and then electric red and you can hear my dad say on camera that the object is increasing in size and then contracting back to its original form which gives the illusion of camera zooming in and out, when it is not. The footage has many reference points, but is not more then 2 or 3 minutes as my mom forced my dad to get in the car cause she was getting late for shopping.My dad informed me that the object was there for quite some time before he started shooting it and also after he stopped.

We didn&apos;t have to go very far, just to a clearing. There was a dark mass floating in the air. It&apos;s shape was indistinguishable. It was more or less flat and it seemed round but its entire mass did not move in unison. It sort of rippled but not in any coherent pattern (thus not really like a ripple but similar.) On the bottom surface that we could see, there was a constant activity of blue flashes (though not very bright)freckled across the object. We all noticed the air felt very cold and moist and like static. Finally some pieces fell off the object. They sprinkled off and shimmered as they fell to the ground. Then the object left slowly.

I think he would talk to someone about it. I only corrected his grammer. The story is his and I believe him. A True New Brunswick Experience   Time: About 4:15 to 6:30 am  Date: Early in the morning of the first Saturday in October 1955. A point to remember: We were very excited, so the estimated times, and dimensions of the craft, made and mentioned in this article are no doubt inaccurate, especially the vertical height of the craft. My friend and I left home very early in the morning to go hunting for the day. Needless to say, our hunting trip was cancelled. I never hunted again. We parked the car at the edge of a field about four o&apos;clock in the morning and leaned back to get some sleep before daylight arrived. At about four fifteen, directly in front of us, a light appeared. It looked like the cabin of a small two-seater helicopter which was making a very loud noise, not unlike the sounds of engine trouble. The light came over the top of the hill immediately in front of us, perhaps a hundred or so yards away. We were in a long narrow valley, surrounded on our right by woods, behind us slightly to our left by a high wooded hill, to our left by a clear valley and immediately to our front by what appeared to be a steep wooded hill. To our left at about forty-five degrees toward our front, there was a large barn, presumably used by local farmers for hay storage. No other buildings or structures were visible, although on another road was a small community, not more that a half-mile or so away. The lighted, noisy vehicle appeared to be quite small. I realized later that it was because of the time of day. At four fifteen or so in the morning, the sky was very black; and everyone knows that it&apos;s always darker just before the dawn. In any case, the lighted area was all we could see, the rest of the vehicle being hidden by darkness. In a few seconds the noise diminished to nothing; no noise at all! Then, the craft moved very slowly out and over the field to a point just behind the barn; slightly to the right of the barn when looking from our vantage point. To us, it appeared to be about one hundred fifty feet more or less from our car and about fifty to sixty feet from the ground. It seemed to be not very much higher than the peak of the barn but, in appearance it seemed to be at least twice the size of the barn itself. The craft just sat there for a while, appearing suspended in the air; no noise! Nothing! Just sitting there! Imagine our awe!  To the best of our knowledge, no earthlings as yet had such technology. I&apos;m still not convinced that technology like that exists in our world even today. Something to think about!  Anyway, we were so awe-struck that we completely forgot, or abandoned, our hunting trip. We just sat there and watched for something to happen. We were not disappointed. After a period of time, probably fifteen minutes to a half-hour, things started to happen. First, we noticed the ship&apos;s appearance. It was shaped like this: two saucers, the top one being inverted, and the two saucer edges being separated by a vertical external side which appeared to be about four or five feet high; not unlike the appearance of a hamburger. The lower part appeared rounded and sloping with a flat bottom. Above this bottom section, what I would call section two was a straight-sided cylinder with a brushed aluminum or leadish appearance, the same as all the other external sides. On top of this section, and no doubt part of it, a section not more than a foot or two high was visible; looking like one continuous glass. There was still darkness, so perhaps the glass just appeared that way in the dim light. In any case, I was not able to discern whether the glass surface was clear or opaque. It seemed like another fifteen or twenty minutes before this windowed area came to life. There came from behind the windows, a series of lights, changing from red, to pink, to yellow, to blue to green, to blue, to yellow, to pink, to red; all the time rotating around the craft, so that when the colours came around again, we did not get the same sequence each time. Some colour was always visible; that is to say, the colour series was long enough to extend completely around the craft without breaks. These lights continued until just a few seconds before the craft departed. Section three was immediately on top of this rotating coloured area. It was also a windowed area, separated from section two by a vertical side of not more than three or four feet in height, and which appearance has already been described. These windows were wide panels, perhaps four or five feet in height and perhaps six or seven feet long; each of the panels being separated by a single vertical strip; no doubt some kind of support. These windows were definitely opaque, and through which we could discern a lighted area behind the glass panels. The light was what could be described as &apos;bright white&apos;, not unlike that of our own brightest fluorescent lamps, only much brighter; more like halogen light. The top of this section was rounded, ending in a flat top. The fourth, the top section, was much rounded, being topped with a short, round vertical area of perhaps four or five feet in diameter and about a foot and a half to two feet high, topped with a rounded, tapered roof with a flat top of a diameter of about a foot or two at the top. Since we were so amazed at what we were seeing, we decided to attempt a contact. We flashed the car headlights a few times. No reply. Tried again. No reply. Tried again and the lights in the craft&apos;s lighted window panel area dimmed and brightened, so we took that as a response. After a few more trials, we knew they were replying to our efforts because we had changed the number of times our lights were flashed and we counted the number of times their light dimmed. The counts were identical every time. Real beings were inside that thing! Amazing! Not of this world! We don&apos;t have that kind of technology! Maybe Japanese? German? Russian? British? American? Australian? Canadian? Naw! The Cold War is on! Couldn&apos;t be from this earth. We don&apos;t have those capabilities. (Canada had what they called a flying saucer at the time. It was more like a hovercraft without the skirts, driven by fans and only managed to get a few feet off the ground.) Naw! Can&apos;t be from here! No one our earth has technology like that!  Suddenly, silhouettes of three or four beings (I think three), appeared in the opaque windows. We could see their shapes, but because the glass appeared opaque or frosted, we were unable to tell what their hands or faces looked like, but their appearance looked like us! Humans? Don&apos;t know! Can&apos;t see through the glass. Exasperated!  Boy, how I felt! Overjoyed, but very small in a very large universe! Isolated! - Want to make contact and go on board!  Not my friend though. He was too awe-struck and very scared. He just wanted to get out of there; right now!  I finally convinced him that I needed to know more about this craft and see the beings inside, and perhaps even meet them. I so desperately wanted to go inside. He finally agreed to stay until daylight providing no-one came out of the craft. OK. Great!  In regards to the size of the craft, or should I say ship, I would estimate it to have been about fifty to sixty feet in diameter at its widest point across the saucer edge and perhaps twenty-five to thirty feet high, from the very top to the flat bottom. I believe that today, researchers would call that a scout ship. After a few more minutes of flashing headlights and getting responses each time in the same sequence from the lights in the cabin, their replies suddenly stopped. All was very quiet for a time. Suddenly, there was an extremely bright flash which caused us to cover our eyes, which flash appeared to come from the exact center of the flat bottom of the craft. After what seemed like maybe fifteen to twenty seconds of extreme blackness, the whole valley lit up. The light was very bright; much brighter than daylight! We could see extremely well, the whole valley; brightly lit as far as we could see. It was easy to tell that the valley extended beyond our field of vision. This was a pure white light very difficult if not impossible to describe; much better and brighter and more pure than any light we have, even today. Wow! What an experience!  The valley stayed brightly lit for at least five or six minutes or more, and then the light quickly faded into complete darkness in what seemed like only a few seconds. This period of darkness remained for what I would guess to be about five minutes or so, but we could still see the lighting behind those windows. No more of those human-like silhouettes were visible. Guess they were busy doing experiments or some other duties. Soon, a bright shiny globe appeared from the exact center of the bottom of the craft, the same spot where the flash of light appeared. It lowered itself slowly about fifteen or twenty feet and then slowly moved to our left; then rising slightly faster in an arc, to a point above the craft, stopping behind and to the right of the craft as viewed from where we were positioned. It just sat there!  Following over the next few minutes, several more globes appeared in like manner, finally positioning themselves slightly above, and to the side of the craft; each a distance away from craft and from each other, each at different heights. All of these globes were in positions that appeared to us to be some distance behind the craft. These globes remained suspended in the air for well over what seemed to me to be a half-hour or more. There was no further action during that time except the dimming and brightening of the each globes&apos; appearance from time to time; giving us the impression that it was a form of communication. Then, each globe returned to the craft, following each other in what appeared to be reverse order. I don&apos;t remember counting them, but think there must have been ten or twelve of them, each judged to be about two feet in diameter. Then, all was quiet for a while. The area around us was beginning to get brighter. Daylight was coming!  It wasn&apos;t very long before we heard the loud &apos;clank, clank, clank&apos; of what sounded like someone pounding on a steel pipe with a very heavy hammer. That lasted a minute or two. A few seconds after the noise stopped, we heard (or should I say felt?), a very low frequency growling noise which quickly increased in pitch. It was not long going above our hearing range. It was then that we realized what it was that we heard; the sound of a gyro starting up!  Of course, we could no longer hear the high-pitched whine of the gyro, so there was absolutely no sound whatever. The rotating coloured lights went out without warning and the craft immediately moved strait up in a vertical plane, until it appeared as only a bright dot in the morning sky, about the size of the head of a small pin. The dot stayed motionless until after the sun came up and hid it from our view. Boy, sure would be interested in knowing how fast it really did move. Seemed to me to be a thousand miles an hour! Perhaps by knowing these facts, someone with more mathematical skills than I, might discover just how fast that craft really moved during its vertical climb. I cannot forget that sudden upward movement. It was so rapid that we strained our necks in an attempt to follow its path. We did manage to follow the movement, but after all this time, I&apos;m still paying for it. I know it took less than two seconds to reach that height, so the neck strain was very substantial. I still have sore muscles and an almost continuous pain in my neck from that experience, which remain with me almost constantly each and every day. Anyway, it appears to me that no other type of contact was made between us and the occupants of the craft, at least as far as I know, although sometimes I&apos;m not quite so sure. It was while watching that dot high up in the sky, hoping it would come back for me, that I felt very alone and totally abandoned! Left behind! Lonesome! Alone in the expanses of the universe! I felt like I belonged on that ship! Why did they leave me? Even today, I sometimes still feel that same way. Well, it seems that even if no further contact was in fact made with us, they were still somehow able to influence or affect me. It was during this experience that I suddenly realized the I knew for a certainty that other worlds do in fact exist. We are not alone in the universe! I sometimes wonder if they were somehow able to convey to me the truth that other worlds really do exist, something that I have always believed from as far back as I can remember. Another lasting gift also remains in effect. I can tell when these types of crafts are in our vicinity, which crafts I prefer to believe are interstellar spacecraft. Although not always visible to us, I can usually tell when one is nearby because of the tingling of my skin, being accompanied by that high-pitched whine which I can somehow hear. Yes, they are definitely here! They come around mostly at night and seem to have the ability to hide from our sight by means of some device as yet unknown to us. None the less, they are still in our midst, occasionally even in the daytime. Since my friend is no longer living, there are no witnesses left but me. The incident was not reported because UFO reports were very common in the fifties, and were mostly considered to be bunk. Ridicule was just not our cup of tea! As for him, he remained totally afraid until his death as far as I know. He didn&apos;t even tell his own children, and wouldn&apos;t discuss it with anyone; not even me. Unbelievable! Maybe he thought they would come back to get him! I don&apos;t know. Sometimes I wish they had come back. I really would have liked to go with them, at least for a while. Still have that desire and would welcome the opportunity to go on board one of these crafts should an opportunity present itself. On a couple of occasions I related parts of this experience to Mr. Stanton Friedman, a well known UFO investigator and a personal acquaintance of mine. He chose not to investigate. I thought several times that perhaps I should send a report to SETI (Search For Extraterrestrial Intelligence), which has a world wide website on which such reports can be made. But, because of the time lapse, forty eight years already, any technology from that time period would undoubtedly not apply today and would therefore be redundant, so I decided against making that report as well. It doesn&apos;t matter whether this related experience is believed by anyone other than myself or not. The fact is that it did happen, and it happened to me! From that time onward I have known that other worlds do exist, and they have beings shaped like us, and their technology far exceeds our own. These facts are true and I know that they are true! That&apos;s all that matters!((NUFORC Note:  NUFORC is delighted to have this case on file, and we have invited the source of the report to appear on a radio program.  We are grateful to the witness for sharing his sighting.  PD))", "vertical lines of 5-6 crescent moons, some 10+ rows in a night sky over naval base.I was approximatly three years old.

The area were I live is in the foothills area so there several small hills a a two thousand foot high mountain nearby with radio and tv towerslocated on top.  Anyway this object which I had postulated as an errand weather ballooon had decended quite gently toward a cell tower which was about half mile away, I would guess it was about 4000 feet in the airnot so sure about size, but would guess about 50 feet in diameter.  Was now able to get a good look at it was gold in color with a smoke appearance to the surface. The surface had small circular endentions much like a golf ball, the afternoon sun also seem to create shadows in the indentions.  Was considering calling local airpot tower to let them know a balloon was in flight path of small aircraft, also had a concern for larger craft as the area is in partial pattern area for large craft. as I fruther watched the craft a smaller red spheer came out of it , I suppose from the back of it  out of my view anyway it circled the larger spheer in counter clockwise pattern, about five time, increasing speed with each revolution, then left in a easterly direction at the speed of a jet aircraft. At this point I asked some of the kids in the circulr area in front of our house to look at this object with me and tell me what they saw.  At that moment a white spheer came out of the object and circled around the bigger balloon-spheer , in a clockwise direction, and left in westerly direction had to be moving as fast a a F14. At this point a ran inside grabed a pair of weak binocs, came back outside just in time to see 16 small spheers emerge out and circle and leave in a easterly direction. They were dark blue or black. Upon this occurance the kids in front of our house went wow. I inspected the craft with binoculars, no protrusions or anything. Again a short time past then 16 more spheers, they left in westerly direction. following the white sphere,  The Larger spheer then slowly began to gain altitude, and left in the direction from which it came((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

It went silentley through the trees then dissapeared. I thought it was a car so I ignored it. Suddenly 3 gigantic spotlight beams blasted from the treetops and began scanning the ground, they were spinning in huge sweeping search patterns. We were awestruck and wide-jawed and then one of the 10 foot wide beams scanned us passed us and immedeatley swept back on our bodies. Both other search beams then shot on our bodies, we were completley exposed and frightened. We ran, hearts pounding and completley freaking out under a tree, where the lights followed and shone through the folliage for a horrifing breif period of time. I think I was praying by then. The lights shut off with a klunking sound and we each fealt safe that we were not going to be harmed. We walked out from under the tree and saw a large triangular shaped object floating over our heads. We watched it drift off over the glistening water as it made a very low frequency humming sound. There were 5 lights on the back of the ship that blinked in sequence from right to left one at a time, very slowly and methodiclally, amber in color. It drifted ever so slowly over the silent surface of the water for several min. untill it faded into the horizion.

I looked up and sighted a cigar shaped craft directly over the highway. The craft was at a low altitude probably below 500 feet. The sun was just beginning to set and was to our backs, the craft was a little to the east of us and you almost had to luck straight up to see it. We observed port holes and you could see lights inside the windows. The craft did not move. A Hudson police officer who was in the store came out and was about to get in his car and my mother got his attention about the cigar craft. The officer was stating he had not seen anything like it and did not know what it was that we were observing. It was getting darker and the cigar shaped craft was starting to blend with the dark sky and by now all you could see as far as lights was the window lights. I can&apos;t remember how many windows there was but more than 3 windows and they were in a row toward the bottom of the craft. It had no anti collision lights of any kind on this cigar shaped craft.

We were standing out in the cold, looking up at the comet when we noticed a light moving quietly in the clear sky.  We knew it was definitely not a plane when we saw how it was moving.

My parents went outside with my sister and for some reason I was still in the house.  As I was going through the dining room area to get to the back door I passed a window looking toward the East.  Something caught my eye in the sky over some trees.  It appeared to be a egg shaped object that was emitting its own brilliant light source.  Not silver but like an egg shaped light bulb in the sky.  It really stood out against those gray clouds.  It was coming toward where I was watching it out the window and it was really moving.  At first the movement of it really puzzled me because it was going back and forth advancing toward me until I realized that it was in a zig zag motion horizonally while flying.  Then the object streaked out of the window space while making a sharp turn toward the west where I lost sight of it.  I burst out the back door and caught a very quick look at it as it went through the sky at an incredible speed through a break in the trees.This object crossed a large part of the sky in just a blink of an eye and made absolutely no sound.  No plane or jet could do that back then or now and be lit up like this thing was.  Of course I just happened to be passing the window when I saw it but since it made NO sound my family, who were outside at the time, missed it completely because there was no reason to look up.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It was bright yellow with no other lights.  She said it appeared to be on a course from N to S as if some intelligence were guiding it. It was not drifting aimlessly or shooting like a meteor. She said she did not notice any physical effects in her body, but I heard an uncharacteristic agitation in her voice.  The object came from the N at about 30 degrees when she first noticed it.  Mom held a 3&quot; by 5&quot; box in her hand and said that is how large it appeared in the sky with the luminescence as bright as the moon.  The highest elevation observed was approximately 75 degrees.She noted that there was a small plane in the sky and also a jet that seemed to be going in the same direction as the rectangular craft.  She kept saying &quot;that jet must see it.&apos; When the craft disappeared from sight in the N facing window,she went to the southerly kitchen window to see it again and it vanished. She is sure it did not go behind a cloud.  She checked other directions, but it was gone.  Had the object retained the same speed, she should have picked in up again at another window.

I was out with my dad at one of his friends house, located up in &quot;the knobs&quot; outside of New Albany/Clarksville, Indiana. Those from this area will know what I mean. The Knobs are very hilly geographical features that overlook the Louisville metropolitan area... they are where the glaciers stopped advancing in the last ice age..... so basically we were up on these hills (rural area) with a great view of the flat, sprawling metropolis below (could see for miles). Anyway, I remember becoming bored and going out to sit on the picnic table and enjoy the view... just to see what I could see from the vantage point. Only, when I went out, something caught my eye... it looked like an airplane or something at first. But I knew it wasn&apos;t a plane when it started behaving very strange. The object appeared to be just a bright, defined speck of light, that was contantly changing colors very rapidy. The entire object changed colors at once, so that it was one one color at one moment, and another the next. Mind you, this just describes the color of the light. The object was too small (and too far away) to determine a shape. I would estimate it to have been about 2-5 miles out, and about 1,000 to 3,000 feet in altitude. All I remember was looking &quot;out&quot; at it, rather than &quot;up&quot; at it. What was bizarre about the object was how it moved... it would basically just zig-zag back and forth at pretty good speeds. Sometimes it would go slow, sometimes fast, but always in a back and forth, up and down, to and fro motion. I remember calling my dad and his friend outside to see it, and they at first seemed annoyed at my insistence, but once they saw it, they changed their tune. Too bad, it disappeared right after they caught a glimpse of it. It literally looked like it simply just &quot;shut-off&quot;... it didn&apos;t fly away or anything like that. Of note, what persuaded me to submit my memory was my reading another entry on this site. It was such a close description, and they mentioned wanting to know about others who have had a similar experience.

Brighter than stars, almost fire-like in color.   Tonight there was something like a pattern of three fireball lights in a row (like a straight line) and then a fourth fireball appeared...then they faded out.    1st sighting late summer/early fall 2004: The first time I seen these &quot;lights of fire&quot;....I was a mile west of my home coming to a stop sign.   I&apos;m an aviation freak, so I&apos;m always looking for small general aviation planes (day or night).   The lights were so bright, it naturally grabbed my attention.   It didn&apos;t look like airplane lights flying directly toward me...looked like fire.  I seriously started to wonder if there was a mid-air with two planes, a plane with an engine fire....or even a flare from a flare gun.   Totally unexplainable ...it only lasted about 30 seconds to less than a minute.  (thought I would never see it again).   Months later it happened a second time (later 2004).   I was on the same road in my truck heading in the same westerly direction....towards that same stop sign.  After turning north at the stop sign (where I sat a few secs longer this time), I drove slower and tried to keep an eye out to my left.   (nothing else that night).  I couldn&apos;t believe it saw it again.   So this evening, I&apos;m taking the dog out to potty and up in the night-time westerly sky are those very same looking lights or fireballs again.   All times were around 8pm with night sky.  Now I&apos;ve gotta know.....what is it?   I&apos;m get a little crazy sometimes, but seeing this same phenom three separate times on different dates only confirms that I&apos;m really seeing something. I surely cannot be the only person in central Indiana who is seeing this happen.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))", "Flashing light in western sky.

We saw a triagle shaped flying object with lights at every point, I saw them as being pinkish red and my friend saw the lights as being white. I could actually see the shape of this object in the sky as triangular but the points were rounded not sharp. The object was in the west sky heading east, it was flying at very low altitude with no sound and fast! Really weird but kinda cool what it was can only be described as a unidetified flying object!", "Large Carft sighted in Strathmore/Lindsay Calif. in May 2002 with large panel lights.On the night of May 28th 2002, I was sitting outside stargazing and invited my girlfriend of the time to come outside and view the sky.  As we sat and watched the stars we noticed approx. 3 to 4  military jets going from porterville, ca. heading north when reaching hwy l98 and then returning to porterville and continuing this cirle at which time an aircraft like a C140 joined in this picket fence.  Id say they were about 5000 feet up.  This went on for at least a half hour. We were between strathmore and lindsay calif. towards the foothills. At approx l0:05 pm we were gazing to the northeast when my girlfriend noticed exceptional large lights in the sky approx l/4 mile up the the air.  The craft flew within a 1/4 mile from us to the north and was approx still 1/4 mile off the ground.  The craft stopped directly north of us.  It stood still (hovering as some would say) but no movement.  No noise at all.  Again no movement from the ship with the exception, the large panel lights.  I assume the panel lights (rectangle) went all around the bottom of the ship but we observed 3 and l/2 of these.  The size of each panel light would be approx a little larger than a double wide mobile home.  These panels were strobing at a slow strobe.  Their were additional lights on this craft, but because of the exceptional purity of the lights i focused on the panel lights.  These were light red in color and stayed light red untill after a minute the craft started moveing towards the west.  At this time each panel started turning purple from the outside going inwards, towards its center. Again these were still at a slow strobe.  Since this purple didnt appear untill the ship started moving I can only say this must tie in with the flight system it uses.  Again the clarity of these lights would make normal light look dull or muddied.  As it moved to the west I ran to the road west of her house and ran north because of a tree blocking my view.  As it flew at a very slow rate of speed  30mph? I was able to view it much clearer from the horizon of the west.  The craft was boomerang shape in front and as i looked from the ground to the ship about three times I would be able to say it was approx. 3 football fields long.  Very large.  When my girlfriend and I later compared our experience she said it was like a six sided cut ruby shape,  So i can only assume it changed shape, (perhaps the reason it sat still for the minute above us).  Although she was able to make out the shape when it was north of us I was not since she sees better than I.  I am sure of its shape as it flew west but only its front since it was at night l0:05 pm.  I can say that the dogs for miles around barked all nite as we retired at 4:30 in the morning were still barking.  This is in the country so one can hear quite a ways. I have since moved to Three Rivers, CA.  I have found two other witness&apos;s and they were with others.  They said that the center of the ship was clear and that they could make the stars out.  Either a force field, something like glass or clear plastic that one can see through.  I didnt observe this because of the ships position from us. Ive heard that others also seen this craft in our area but have not met these people.  I assume that the military did set up a picket fence to observe it, whether or not they saw it I cant say, since it was low to the ground and they were much higher up.  We did call Lamore Naval Air Station, and they stated they didnd have anytthing up at the time.  We also called National Institute of Discorvery science.  They called back the following morning wanting to know the pattern of the strobe.  That I couldnt give them.  I can only say that each panel strobed slowly and indepentantly of each other. Many people say they have seen a UFO. I can say I saw an Alien Space Ship.  Very close to us for such a large ship. I would be willing to take a lie detectors test.  I stand by what I saw and Im sure the others that ive met and saw it would do the same. Two additional facts to report towards this is that NASA was tracking a an object of unknown size and material that went a third of the ways between the earth and the moon that night and orbited back out to space.  Haveing no where else to log it, it is labled Asteroid 2002 KG4.  I couldnt say if it in any way was related to the craft I saw.  Additionally a friends fiance, spotted a small alien craft near woodlake at about the same time period near a reservoir in woodlake calif.

Moving from my right to left (directly in front of me, but way off in the distance). I could clearly see three dim red lights flying equidistance apart. They weren&apos;t flying directly behind each other, but as if you turned a straight line at maybe a 45 degree angle. After they caught my eye and I quickly realized what I was seeing, I immediately sat up and and said out loud, &quot;Oh my ((deleted)) god.&quot; Shortly after I said this, they disappered. I don&apos;t know if they flew away at an insane speed, or if I just couldn&apos;t see them anymore because of a street light that was then blocking my view.

We were commenting on the low cloud cover and how strange it seemed, and were joking about it being Friday the 13th (though technically the 14th as it was after midnight).  We heard a weird whirring digital sound, followed by the sight of an aircraft free-falling directly towards the lake.  My friend immediately perceived it to be a crashing airplane and instinctually climbing the rocks to dive down into the water (certified lifeguards do these sorts of things without thinking--I, on the other hand, just stood there like a dum-dum).JUST AS IT WAS LITERALLY A FOOT AWAY FROM SPLASHING DOWN into the water, it recovered itself and swooped RIGHT over us....it was NOT a plane.  It was most certainly a UFO.  Its swooping motion was SO smooth, that it looked as though it were not at all recovering from a near-crash, but rather, it was as graceful and digital as possible.  The sound could be be described as a digital piano chord, very pleasing, soothing and attractive.Its shape can best be likened to a fish (picture a generic fish, like a goldfish) with its upper fin and back fin comprised of a yellowish-white glowing fire, which seemed to be propelling it much in the same manner that a fish&apos;s fins would.  The body of the craft was totally visible to me, mostly because the craft was SO SO SO well lit, that it&apos;s lights drowned out the shape. I did, however, get a really good look at the underbelly of the craft, which was an amorphous huge contact-lense shape, and violet in color.  It was quasi-transparent, and if I had logic under my belt at that point, i would have made an effort to peer into the bottom, when it flew RIGHT over me.  Instead, I just started crying, both because I knew that what I was seeing was something to totally behold, and because I was instinctually scared, though it didn&apos;t have an ominous vibe at all.  After recovering from its seeming near-crash by swooping over us, it proceeded to head South--towards downtown, precisely following the scape of the lakefront.  For instance, if there was a part of the beach which jutted out, its flight-path would follow.From my awesome college campus, we could see the Eastern-edge of the downtown skyline, and we sight-followed it almost all the way there, and then lost track.  My friend ran to his dorm to grab the phone, and we began calling 911, 411, 0--&quot;all circuits busy.&quot;  When we finally got through, the lady scoffed at us and hung up.We went to stand out where we originally saw it crash through the clouds, thinking that was it, and then, at the same time, we both saw it--AGAIN!!  It was coming back down North, again following the beachscape.  I thought it was coming towards us, so we began running away, as silly as that may sound.   While I was running, I was still looking back at it, and saw it come to the point where it had crashed through and then move VERTICALLY, very quickly and disappear above the very low cloudline almost exactly where it came through. In addition to the fishlike shape with the fire-crest propulsion system (at least that is how I perceived it), here is more detail: The front of the craft had an upside-down &quot;U&quot; shaped lime-green, sequentially flashing (like chaser Christmas lights) nose, and the body had a number of sporadically placed lights that were hot pink, red, deeper purple...it was like a flying night-club, and obviously not meant to be inconspicuous, which really threw me off. This sounds like a description of someone on acid, I know, but I need to ITERATE that my friend and I had just come back from a coffee shop, where we were studying.  No alcohol or otherwise was at all involved.", "Two faint lights in the daytime sky.On Saturday afternoon my wife and family and I were in our front yard playing ball with our kids. My wife noticed what looked like a faint star or ultra-high altitude craft to the northeast at about 70 degrees up from the horizon. She asked me what I thought it was because I am a former US Marine air traffic controler and aircraft buff. It looked like a sattelite as it would be seen moving slowly across the night sky, except it was broad daylight. I went inside the house and got a low power telescope to get a closer look, but never could locate the object due to the sunlight. The object moved north, turned east, then west in what looked to us like a 3/4 box turn. There it met with a second identical object briefly and they were lost behind a high altitude &quot;whispy&quot; cloud. They were so faint that they were hard to see, and eventually were simply gone.", "Greenish-red, hazy, circular object hangs in sky almost like a &quot;bat signal&quot; in Coxsackie, New York.This site seems legit so here it goes. I am presently 42 years of age and to the best of my recollection, have never seen what would be considered a UFO since this one experience. I still remember the incident vividly. Unfortunately, I can&apos;t recall the year. It was either the summer of 1967 or 1968 with an outside chance of it being 1969. My older siblings were babysitting me one evening. They used to make colored popcorn but on this night, ran out and had to borrow some from a neighbor. When my sister went outside, she started shouting for everyone to come out. I looked out the window at them and they were all looking toward the sky in our backyard. I went out to see what was going on. When I looked up, I saw a circular pattern of red/green - about the size of a small full moon. The object, if it was an object, appeared to just &quot;hang&quot; there. It almost resembled more of a hazy &quot;bat signal&quot; than something solid. It could have been filtered through the clouds. Not certain about that. Anyway, our small neighborhood consisted of about 15 to 20 or so homes. Our parents were out so my siblings called other neighbors. All of whom saw the &quot;thing.&quot;  After a couple of minutes, my sister rushed me back in. I wanted to stay but she wouldn&apos;t let me. My brothers came in shortly after and said the thing was gone. I remember I wasn&apos;t afraid because at either 4 or 5 years old, I had no clue what UFO&apos;s were. To this day, I keep asking my siblings if they remember that night and they said they still do. No one has ever explained what it was that our modestly middle class neighborhood in Scheller Park saw that night. My parents thought they remembered some explanation of what it was however, the explanation didn&apos;t make sense to them and to the rest of us who saw it. I would love to know if anyone else remembers that night and more importantly, if this was a reported incident by other non-government types rather than just our observation.", "&quot;My friend and I seen this pure white ball of light in the sky on the way to his friends house.&quot;To start I am a firm believer of ufos.what I am about to tell you really did happen.My friend and I was driving towards Newport,Tn.one evening to pick up a video taped payper view event at his friends house.He was driving. we were heading northeast ways.I looked up towards the sky and spotted this pure white ballshaped light just suspended in the air. there were no stars out and it was a very clear blue sky evening,no clouds at all.It looked to me that this object was fairly high up in the sky.I looked at it for about 2,3 seconds and then said to my friend,&quot;Hey,look at that ball of light in the sky.&quot; My friend looked up towards where I was pointing and he said,&quot;Aw yea what is that?&quot; We were continuing down the road and I was watching this ball of light all the way.He had to keep his eyes on the road but glanced at it when he could.We then came upon some trees on the side of the road and passed by them.it took about 3 seconds to pass by and when we were back in the clear the ball of light was gone! I looked all around in the sky to see if I could find it but It was no where to be found..I really started to think about what we had just seen.and to me it was not any type of plane or helicopter.I am pretty good at spotting man made aircraft at all times of the day and night. before living in Tn. I grew up near an International Airport. My friend also couldnt see it anywhere around his side of the car.The wierdest thing about this was that to me I got this funny feeling inside that it knew we were looking at it....!and thats why it disappeared.To make things more interesting that about 3,4 weeks later.There was a county police officer who came foward and claimed to have video taped the same object my friend and I had seen.He was on this show at the time called &quot;A current affair&quot; they showed the tape on the show and yes it did look exactly like the ball of light we seen! he also claimed after coming foward with his story. He was ridiculed by his coworkers and that when he was not at home one day. someone ransacked his house,like they were trying to find something.anyhow that is my story about what my friend and I had seen. I believe that it was not anything explainable maybe it was military but I doubt it! I believe that it was extraterrestial....((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I don&apos;t know if the pilot saw the spheres and intended to circle them or was some kind of  ground  traffic  news  plane? I could not identify the plane since I was more interested in the spheres. It circled several times.They were coming from  the  south  just  over the &apos;West Hills&apos; area at an altitude  of about  1000&apos; to 1500&apos;  and traveling at a constant speed and holding a constant altitude.  There was a large cumulus cloud directly over them with a base of about 3000&apos; that should have had enough thermal power to pull them straight up --if balloons.There were 2 to 3 of each color of  red,yellow, black and I think blue.They appeared to be 1foot to no more than 2feet in diameter?  There was some movement  of the spheres in the cluster.Now comes the best part.As they  were at  their closest point to me (I had a strong feeling at this point that they were not balloons) one of the black spheres separated and came straight down at a speed  almost  like a rock falling and came down somewhere close to the Clay Towers appartment building -- one block down from me. At this point they went out of view and I moved  to another location to watch as they continued over the city out of view.I went over to where the black sphere came down but could not see it anywhere.Balloons cannot do this.I am an experienced  sky watcher and pilot. I have seen this phen- omena many times in other locations but I was quite surprised to see it over busy downtown buildings very low.This event proves to me that it is now almost impossible for most viewers to tell the difference  between balloons and real (possibly alien) UFOs.  If seen, you must watch them constantly to be able to catch the impossible--  as we know it.Go to :http://www.hbccufo.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=1756 to download a video of a similar event  to what I saw-  captured in Arizona of a cluster releasing  an orb one month after my sighting.

As I was walking, and there was a break between trees to the left, so I looked, I saw either one big triangle, or three small circles in the shap of a triangle, I am not exactly sure. It was pretty big, each dot was roughly 2 inches apart in the sky, I could not tell how close it was and was shoked to see it. It was three bright white, tinted blue lights, almost the color of those blue colored car headlights. I stoped at first site of it, at first I thought I was crazy and they might just be three bright stars, I looked around and it was a dirty hazy night and barley any stars in sight, so I looked back at them, and they started fading out and completly disapered. Today, before school, my brothers friend (ryan), who is 20, was talking to my dad. I brought up that I saw a UFO last night and they both looked at each other and said that ryan just got done telling my dad that he saw a triangle at about 12:00AM last night also. We talked about it, and we both saw the same thing. When I got home from school, a friend of ryan called him and the radio station she was listening to was talking about strange lights last night at 12AM, and they were wondering if anyone else saw them, so we called in and let them know.

We were near our home of Lewiston, Idaho on Hwy 12 traveling west. It was 1:00 AM on a clear but non-moonlit night.We saw a light that at first appeared to be a house window (opaque orange-ish). Traveling slowly I realized the light was right over the Clearwater River and as close as 100 yds (maybe closer). First sight was one light then we seemed to see another side of this &quot;craft&quot; that had three rectangular lights and a round light (as if an exclamation mark on its side). We rolled our windows down wondering, if it was a helicopter dropping for fire fighting water. No Noise. It slowly started to rise and move toward the Southwest and over the horizon to our due south. When it disappeared over the tree lined horizon the appearance was of a forest fire (behind). Soon (within 10 seconds) a &quot;round light&quot; appeared to just &quot;pop&quot; over the same horizon and droop down and &quot;hold&quot; still for several seconds. It then darted straight up to the &quot;heavens.&quot;  In Mere seconds it appeared to be among the stars and changed from a white light to a blue &quot;cast&quot; light.  We watched it, until seeming to disappear, for many seconds. The speed was beyond all belief! When we looked back at the previous light over the top of the horizon it was gone. We seemed to be Euphoric and hesitated to discuss this for a long time. We waited about a three weeks before discovering your existence. We contacted you by phone and you asked for a hand drawn depiction which we provided. You also suggested contacting MUFON which we did.

It was actually to big to be a hang glider, and the only reason i thought thats what it was at the begining was because it was boomerang shaped.It had a very shiney metalic almost chrome look to it,and while it was hovering in the same spot it was fliping from front to back, and from side to side.While this was happening i was looking at it through the binaculars, and in the middle of the craft the metal was warping and changeing shapes.There were geometrical patterns forming and creases in the metal itself and they were changing.Imagine how the cuts on a daimond looks and while you are looking at them they are shifting and makeing new side apear.Thats what it was like. My freinds and I then watched this craft rise slowly out of the atmosphere, or at least straight up till it disapeared, and the whole time it kept fliping and turning from one side to another while warping its own configuration.I would really say that there were about 15 to 30 people there who all saw this happen, and i got to say its one of the strangest crafts ive ever seen.I grew up near numerouse military instilations and have been on many military bases,and have even been on a veriety of militaray airplains,ships,tanks.You name it ive seen it first hand, so im used to seeing all kinds of things like that but ive never seen anything like this. Now im not claiming that this thing was something from another world or an alien craft or even a military craft.Frankly i dont know what kind of craft it was.What i do know, was that this had some type of intelegant behaivior about it,and i also know it wasnt a baloon or something simple like that.It was pretty complex what ever it was.I found it strange that the entire city didnt seem to see this craft,because it was pretty big and it was in the middle of broad daylight.I didnt hear anything about it in the news.I am not in touch with the people who saw this with me but if i need to get a hold of them to back up my story i could.Frankly i do not care weather people believe i saw something wierd or not,But just in case someone else saw this there will at least be one report on this incadent.I figured that i should report this since it actually happened, and people can take my word for what it is.Sorry i have no picture or video of the incedent,i never even thought to get a camera out the entire time.I was just to into looking at it, because i was facinated by it.

At times the spacecraft would zig then zag, and you could easily see it rising and lowering slightly.

He and his coworker were travelling together, and as soon as I mentioned this weird light in the sky, he claimed that they too had seen it.He said they had even stopped to get a better look.

The caller identified himself by name and address i.e. a middle-age disabled resident of McDonough Georgia (McDonough is about 26 miles SE of Atlanta). He stated that the previous night he, along with his wife and a neighboring couple, had observed a highly unusual object in the sky. He went on to describe the event (duration about one hour), indicating that he was pretty amazed by what they observed. After getting the basic details, this investigator instructed the Primary Witness (PW) to prepare a detailed account, plus a sketch, both to be forwarded to this writer. PW also provided the phone number of the second witness (W2).  This investigator phoned W2 and found him to be a retired firefighter, and afterwards a hospital security officer by profession. He provided basic details of the event and also agreed to forward an account and a sketch to GUFOG.  After receiving all of the above described documents on 18April05, this writer again spoke with the PW and W2 within a few days.The final detailed account summary contains more information than the preliminary recap sent to GUFOG members in the group&apos;s bulletin.  WITNESS ACCOUNTs- SUMMARY   PW stated that at about 10:00PM on 14April05 (and continuing until about 11:00PM) he observed what he thought was a &quot;falling star&quot; out of his bay window. When it did not briefly extinguish as expected, he went outside to observe more closely. Looking to the NW, he continued to watch a brilliant light which began to dart back and forth, up and down, zig-zagging at about 1/2 of the way off of the horizon. PW retrieved his binoculars (10X50) and continued to watch. Under magnification, he at first observed a &quot;pancake-like&quot; object which seemed to have red, blue, and silver lights on the bottom. During subsequent observation, it seemed to get closer and MOVE to give a view of DIFFERENT SHAPES......a triangle, later a shallow &quot;C&quot; shape almost like a boomerang, then a classic lens shape with a protuberance similar to a cupola, each profile displaying the aforementioned lights. PW indicated that the rapid movement reminded him of the electronic indicator on a heart monitor in a hospital, but after he thought on it some more, perhaps looking through the binoculars had caused some of that due to his natural hand and arm tremor.  After steady observation, the PW called his neighbor, W2, who also came out to take a look.  W2 told this investigator that he watched the object both with the naked eye and the binoculars. He estimated that it was about the size of a LARGE MARBLE held out AAL, at about 45 degrees off of the horizon, shaped like a TRIANGLE with blinking blue, green and silver lights. During his observations, he too noticed very rapid movements. PW added that it seemed to him that the object had a SHINY METALLIC-LIKE COLOR ON THE BOTTOM ALONG WITH THE CHANGING LIGHTS. During his observation using the binoculars he also noticed a GRATE-LIKE SURFACE at one point, which resembled &quot;criss-cross&quot; like openings.W2 added that he got the impression that this object was beyond our atmosphere and would be HUGE in order to allow for what they observed.  Local conditions during the observation was a typical mild, clear, Southern spring night, tending to the cool 50&apos;s and 60&apos;s, with little or no wind noticed.  INVESTIGATOR&apos;S COMMENTS   This writer is intrigued by the many shapes attribute to one object over the course of an hour&apos;s observation. However there is a similar recent report on file from the same general area, to wit;   On 3Aug04 at about 5:15AM, a Stockbridge Georgia resident (Stockbridge is about 8.7 miles NW of McDonough) reported to GUFOG via &apos;Hotline&apos; that he was watching an UNUSUAL LIGHT back in the direction of MCDONOUGH. Said light darting up and down, back and forth, and then as the two of us spoke, he stated that it began to change into a BOOMERANG or V SHAPE. (See NUFORC entry: Stockbridge Georgia; Occurred 8/3/2004; Reported 8/10/2004; Posted 8/11/2004; Shape: Changing; Duration: Appx. 30 minutes)   OTHER FACTORS   In considering prosaic causes for this described event, celestial bodies were reviewed as should always be done for most night reports.  The planet Jupiter is brighter than normal during early April05, estimated about -2.5 magnitude, but BY MID-APRIL is actually FARTHER away from the Sun and Earth than normal.  Venus, due to it&apos;s current close proximity to the Sun, is not a factor herein.  GUFOG Special Advisor Mark Ausmus of Atlanta reviewed the sky for 14April05 between 10:00PM and 11:00PM via his &quot;Starry Night&quot; software.  Mark found no dazzling bodies that might be brilliant enough, even if viewed through unusual atmospheric conditions, to produce anything remotely resembling what has been described.  Jupiter is off to the SE.....Saturn to the west, but less than dazzling.....Sirius to the west, up about 30 degrees, but again not a suspect.....Capella to the NW, another non-suspect in this particular circumstance.  Witness descriptions obviously do not fit with any artificial satellites, nor meteors.  Both the PW and W2 were found to easily recognize local commercial air traffic for exactly what it is.  Any citizens of Henry County or the south Metro Atlanta area counties with similar observations during the mid-April time frame can contact Investigator Tom Sheets at the Georgia UFO Group office in Fayetteville at 678-817-4555 or email at &lt;&lt;&lt;georgiaUFOgroup@hotmail.com&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   GUFOG protects the identity of ALL witnesses.
