["The ufo that closely observed college students on campus.Well, I was in high school then working as a counselor for younger students on a college campus in Pennsylvania.  It was approximately five twenty in the afternoon and it was time to get off work. Me and my friends were joking around with the younger students just joking and laughing. I myself just happen to look in the sky because at that time the college campus had rows of trees where bird would gather and fly over people heads.  As I looked up I happen to notice a airplane then my eyes looked a little lower and I seen another airplane nothing out of the ordinary.  Furthermore, as I looked at the second airplane my eyes focused on a object that was in the air with no movement. The first thing I did was stop everyone from talking and get them to look at the object in the air.  I noticed there was nothing attached to it and it was like it was observing the college campus.  My peers all notice the object and I think it noticed us because it started to move. The object was oval and it moved very slowly on the left of the object was a green light flashing from side to side then on the right side was orange light flashing from side to side it was sunny and clear as day outside. The object was a good distance away but it was so clear outside with no buildings blocking our view we could all see the object in clear view. Then the object moved so fast it just disappeared before our eyes. I have never seen anything like that in my life and I just wanted to share my experience.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

He was using an old 110 instamatic camera and taking photos out of the plane window while over the Rockies. He never even noticed the object he captured in one photo. I am e-mailing both the original photo and an enlargement of the object I had &quot;blown up&quot; at a local photo mart back then. I have always wondered what the object might be. A friend of mine at work gave the best &quot;tongue in cheek&quot; answer that it was a flying squid. Hopefully you may have a more scientific answer.Thank you.", "Ok, this one I have trouble writing as it may seem crazy. But I swear this really happened. Back in about 1993-1994 early morning (don&apos;t remember the year exactly) my boyfriend (at that time) and I were wrestly around. At some point our ears touch each other at the head (if that makes any sense). When our ears touch, it was like a quick few seconds where I heard what i can describe like millions of tiny voices. but they weren&apos;t like any language and they were all speaking at once but like no sound i could ever describe without making a fool of myself. We pulled away from each other as i was so blown away. I immediately screamed toward him and asked if he just heard what I heard. and he was so freaked out, that he did not want to discuss it at all. I just pleaded over and over and asked if he heard all those voices of whatever that was. He admitted yes and would NEVER discuss it again. The wierd thing was that after that day, his bedroom window had no curtains and there was a driveway and bushes to the side. Well after that for the next couple of months or so (until we broke up), there was a bush that every night as the night lights outside went on was the most perfect shape of a large head of what we normally see described at what aliens look like. It was a large bush and by day it was just a bush, but by night it was just the side view of a large alien head because of the lights around. Anyway, this was not an actual sighting of an unidentified object, just the most bizarre unexplainable thing that I have EVER encountered in my life, especially since the bush thing appeared that night. I can remember those voices as if it was yesterday. Never heard anything again after that, as believe me i have tried to copy the ear thing again, but never worked.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.

We were moving at about 70 mph-probably 20 miles north of Cocoa Beach, FL exit ramps. All of a sudden the top section of my 19XX ((deleted--vehicle)) windshield was filled by the shape of a rough cylinder object about 75-100 feet over the highway crossing over the highway at a 90 degree angle to it and from my right to my left (headed east).  It was gigantic--being at least two hundred feet long and maybe 60-75  high.  Along the top of the object were a line of blue lights - maybe five or six and along the bottom maybe 8-10 white lights and another 10 along the side-somewhat like halogen lights and constant - no strobe or on or off.  I am positive about these colors. It seemed to rather  &quot;float&quot; across the road at 100-150 mph. There was NO noise nor sounds at all. The most significant feature was a row of about 8-10 rectangular giant white panels along the side with a big  X in each one and some object in the center -like a small dome. The panels were lit with a white light from within. These were giant and not any type of conventional aircraft windows since they were far larger. They had a slight bend to their line or position down the side of the craft-up in the front and back. There may or may not have been a wing.  I had just a second to hit my dosing son and yell...&quot;look at that&quot;.  He did  see it also for a split second.  It was so close and so sudden that I almost lost control of my vehicle but was able to put my window down and steal one 1.5 to 2 second glance to my left.  I could see it from the rear (by this time 3-400 yards away and still hugging the ground - at best 100 feet up) and headed east). It reminded me of a giant vulcan bomber but I cannot be sure. Not sure I saw any vertical stabilizer.  It was emmense and with the window down-- still no sound was audible.I have seen and touched B-52, C5A, B-1, Sr-71 BLACKKBIRD, WARTHOGS,AND PHANTOM AIRCRAFT AND ALSO SEEN JUST ABOUT EVERY OPERATIONAL COMMERCIAL AND MILITARY conventional aircraft in the US--it was NONE of these being far far larger and totally silent.

This had to be 4-5 times the size of a B52. It was not a B-2. The rectanges were at least 10-20 feet high and about 8-15 feet across. They were along the side rather like the guns of an old ship of the line. They were not like any window of any aircraft I have ever seen.Impression was of -maybe- again maybe-a gigantic man made aircraft flying in a very dangerous manner without conventional running lights,no sound and at way under the stall speed for any aircraft of that size.

As they came down to where I could see them better, I changed my mind from meteors, to maybe a large aircraft had broken up in the sky,and was crashing . On the mountain that I was pulling up.  I could see the top of the mountain,and I could see the valley below. When the objects that I seen, I assumed they was going to crash into the earth.

I could not make out any type of shape that may have been attached to the lights. I saw them when I was around one maybe two miles away. They were to the right. As I got closer I realized that they were not towers of any kind. They were too low and oddley shaped to be towers. When I was abreast of them and a little in front of them, I pulled to side of the road and looked at them, trying to figure out what I was looking at. After just a few seconds, the set in the front started to move slowly forward. When I saw movement I pulled back onto the road and continued straight ahead (the same direction I was traveling to begin with) The lights went in the direction in front of them which was opposite to direction I was heading in. After pulling back onto the road, I looked into my rearveiw window, and the lights were gone. No reflection of lights remained,all I saw was darkness.

This is his unadulterated version, in other words.He still won&rsquo;t agree to be interviewed by anyone, and wants to remain anonymous.  So, if you have questions, I guess I&rsquo;m your source.  You can ask me, and I&rsquo;ll ask him.  Sorry, that&rsquo;ll have to do.This occurred in Henry County, Illinois.  Number &quot;6&quot; on the map is where Dad was standing.

It seemed to be low over the field and had to go up to clear the hill and neighbor&rsquo;s barn that was on the hill on the other side of the field.

Three people were present, Uncle (name #1 deleted), Uncle (name #2 deleted), and me.  Uncle (#2) was in the cow section of the barn, and Uncle (#1) was in the horse barn.  (We were later than usual with the duties of doing the farm chores.)  Uncle (#1) suggested that I take a bucket that was nearby and to go to the corn crib for corn for the horses.I exited the barn and started for the corn crib.  The corn crib was at a lower elevation than the barn, so as I started to descend to that level, I stopped to admire the scenery because it was such a &quot;picture-postcard&quot; winter scene, about 15 degrees F, fresh snowfall, clear sky, wind was calm, so I stopped to look around.  The stars were beginning to come out.  In viewing the stars, looking to my left, I noticed two stars, brighter than the others.  This caught my attention, so I studied them a little.It occurred that one of them was moving away from the other.  As I watched this going on, all of a sudden, an object is above me, and the whole area becomes as light as day.  I looked up and looked all around.  I could see the neighbor&rsquo;s building as clear as day.The object above me, the source of the light, this was not like a searchlight, more like daylight, so I could look up at this object, just a short distance above me.  However, all I could see was a dark (not black) space about 10-feet in diameter, enveloped in sort of an aura atmosphere.It remained there for a short time.  The light dimmed, then it glided over the field at about the same level that it was above me, about 25 feet in the air.  It went directly toward the buildings on ranch #2.  It had to ascend in order to clear the cow barn (a huge barn), and sailed off to the northwest, and it faded from view.I returned with the corn.  Uncle (#1) and Uncle (#2) were emerging from the barn.  Someone said, &quot;What was that?&quot;  Also, someone said, &quot;We will read about it in the newspaper when we return home.&quot;  When we got home, Grandpa ((name deleted)), who always read the paper thoroughly, said he saw nothing in the paper of such an occurrence, so that was the end of the event.Place: ((name deleted)) Ranch, about six miles north of Atkinson.  No longer in existence, as such.  Building #6 ((shown on hand-drawn map)) has been completely demolished.  It was in a remote area, about &frac12; mile from public road.Uncle (#2) at last interview remembered nothing of the incident.  He was milking the cows, and did not have much exposure.Uncle (#1) remark was, &quot;Something happened&quot; somewhat bigger object, about as big as a car.  Uncle (#1)((deleted-twenties)); Uncle (#2); ((deleted-teens)); Me ((deleted-11 yrs.))  No women were there.  Neighbors at least one mile away.  I was not frightened.I think the object was either tinted glass, of some kind of fabric.((name deleted)) ranch sold into smaller parcels.Horses were called &quot;oat sniffers,&quot; but draft horses were fed several cups of corn with the oats, plus timothy hay.

I thought it was going to hit the plane, but it made a really sharp turn and shot back into the clouds, the craft was like glass, and you could see the clouds refelicting on it, it look as if you poured hot water on ice, really smooth.  I asked my friends if they saw that they laughed and said no.  So I said to them look at the clouds how did the clouds get that shape then they said they don&apos;t know as it was not like that a moment ago.

He also went to say that he say it again, hovering in the sky for about 1/2 hr, and it shot up into the sky.I must also say that I have see a cly. shaped craft once when I was visiting in FL. and I called my cousin out and said to him, what is that in the shy, he being a non beliver, we noticed that it had no wings and was about 18000 ft in the sky, it made no sound, now I have seen many jet planes, and at even 40000 ft you can hear it and see wings, this was brown in color the shape was like a roll of foil paper.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

Email sighting account in part: &quot;We had a power outage last night and my wife was awakened by the answering machine clicking on and off as the power tried to recover, and then it went out completely. She went to the front door to see if it was raining or windy and saw a very large object hovering over a nearby house about an 1/8 of a mile from our house. It was larger than the house, seemed to be at an angle to her view with the bottom exposed and had lights all around it evenly spaced. When it began to move away, several lightning flashes were seen and then it was gone. The power returned two hours later&quot;. A second email was received the next day stating that he had a chance to talk to his wife about this sighting and he added that it would seem that his wife might have actually observed &quot;balls of lightning&quot;. He also wrote: &quot;what she describes sounds just like a multiple ball lightning display which she says disappeared as she watched it, and then a bolt of lightning went up into the space above the house from the ground to where the lights had appeared to be&quot;. A little more details were obtained during a telephone interview that was conducted March 31st. Sighting took place around 12:30 AM, March 23, during a thunderstorm, as she was facing south, towards Manassas. The length of the appearance lasted just a few seconds, from the &quot;balls of light&quot; formation to the vertical lightning flash. It is my belief that this incident may have been a natural, Rare Atmospheric Phenomena (RAP) involving multiple ball lightning, or Mobile Luminous Spheres. To be a witness of one or two of these lightning balls are rare but witnessing a group of ten or more is phenomenal!

It was much smaller than a commercial airplane.  It was bright, from reflected sunlight.  I assumed that it was metallic, and its color was probably silver.The object moved in a very straight line, with some tilting on its axis from one side to the other.

At 9PM Eastern time, my 14 year old daughter asked me to come out side and look at a strange light in the western sky.  I came out an saw what looked like a bright star, but which clearly included pulsing blue and then red lights.  The blue and red lights were clearly visible.  At first I assumed that it was an aircraft of some type, but the light source seemed not to be moving across the sky like a jet would.  It was holding it&apos;s position.  After observing the light for several minutes, I called my brother who lives approximately 10 miles away and asked him if he was able to see the light as well.  Both he, his wife, and my sister, who lives in the same neighborhood clearly saw the light, and agreed that the light was very clearly pulsing red, blue and white.  We both continued to watch the light for approximately an hour, until it slowly slipped below the tree line, where I was no longer able to watch it.  My brother was able to see the light for approximately another 1/2 hour because his home is not surrounded by trees, as mine is. Relative to Mendon MA, which is south west of Boston MA, the light appeared to be around 10 degrees south of due west, and started off  at approximately 15 degrees above the horizon.  My brother also thought that he saw another similar light source due west at a higher altitude.  I looked there as well to confirm his sighting of a second similar light source, and saw it as well, but it was not nearly as bright, and to be honest, while it looked similar, I could not make it out well enough to say with 100% certainly that it was also pulsing blue and red. My daughter told me that the light was pointed out to her by a friend of hers prior to telling me about it, and her friend stated that she had first noticed it in the same approximate location the night before.  We will be looking for the light again tonight. I can&apos;t help but assume that this light was perhaps either a satellite or maybe even the space station.  I understand that early this morning there was a docking, so perhaps what we were watching was the docking lights of the space station.  I tried to look on the net for a description of space station docking lights, but could not find any.  Also I&apos;m not sure if the space station would stay in on location in the night sky.  Also, unless they were testing the docking lights the night before, docking lights would not explain why my daughter&apos;s friend saw the same  lights the night before. I was quite embarrassed to do this, but after observing the light for approximately 55 minutes, I called a local TV station in the hopes that perhaps they could get a better look at the lights in the sky.  I never hear any mention of the reported lights on the news, I can only assume they thought it was a hoax. I have no idea what I saw, and unfortunately all I really saw were pulsing lights, and I could not make out any form other than the lights themselves.  However I can say with 100% certainty, that the lights were indeed pulsing red, blue and white. I am a 43 year old engineer, as is my brother, and neither of us are the type of people to cry wolf, but this was most definitely the strangest thing I have ever seen in the sky, and I hope to see it again tonight.  I hope others see it as well so that I can get an explanation of what I saw.((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the witnesses are observing the star, Sirius, which is quite prominent in the western sky during winter months, at the time indicated by the witness.

I noticed a black triangular shape flying across the Milky Way and blocking out the stars. I could tell it was triangular shaped because it was crossing the heaviest part of the Milky Way. I pointed this craft out to the rest of the family and they all concurred that they saw it also. There was no way to tell the altitude of the craft but it appeared to be quite high. It appeared to be about the size of my thumbnail at arms length. I don&apos;t know why, but I had an uneasy feeling about this craft, and mentioned out loud that &quot;I don&apos;t think that thing wants to be seen&quot;.  There were NO lights at all and no sound. The only way you could tell that it was there was from the stars being blocked out. If you held a ruler at arms length, the craft went approximately 16 inches to the West and then sharply 90 Degrees to the South for about 12 inches until we could no longer see it because of the roof eave. I ran across the deck and down the driveway to look but could not locate it in the night sky. I had it in sight for about 15 seconds.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))", "In 1955, I lived in Holbrook, Massachusetts.  I lived in a town next to the South Weymouth Naval Air Station.  On the day I saw the UFO, it was a sunny spring day and I was in a ballfield behind my home.  I turned around and over the trees was a large yellow object shaped like a football without the tips on the ends.  It was there a short time - a minute or less and did not move.  It went out like a light but faster.  Then, over my right shoulder, a Navy Constellation radar plane went toward where the object had been.  I have seen many jets and blimps go over the area many times and this object wasn&apos;t like any aircraft I&apos;ve ever seen. At the time, I was seven years old.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))", "Lights north over RenoIt was around 9:30pm last night... I stepped out on my porch to put a mop into the storage area on my balcony, facing roughly west (I live on the second floor in my apt complex on the south side of Reno)and I happened to look towards the right (which would have been roughly northwest (towards Northern NV/Northern CA).  To my amazement, I saw what appeared to be dozens of very small dots of light flying extremely rapidly around each other, left to right, horizontally and vertically and moving at a high rate of speed. In front, and at about the same height as me, was the rental office roof, so I approximated the objects to be flying anywhere from 10 to 20 degrees above the horizon.  They were so low, in fact, that if you weren&apos;t at least on a second story with a clear view in that direction, you would have missed them altogether. Because they were only pinpoints of light it was very difficult for me to judge their distance... I even jumped in my jeep, camera in hand, and drove to the north end of town to see if I could get a better vantage point to view them, but with no success.  With the conditions, they could have been larger but farther away or smaller and closer, it was difficult for me to tell. When I arrived back home, I stepped out on my porch and sure enough, they were still there! By this time, it was around 10:45pm.  These objects were seemingly just west of incoming air traffic to Reno/Tahoe airport (the commercial air traffic pattern brings them on the runway most of the time in a north to south direction).  It seems that Reno/Tahoe Intl. should have picked these objects up on radar or possibly sighting(s) by commercial airline pilots.  I sat there and exhausted myself for a rational explanation... they dove horizontally and vertically and almost seemed to be &quot;playing&quot;, heading toward each other and then dodging at the last minute, like playing chicken or something, if that makes any sense.  I thought they were perhaps birds, but these objects were self luminous and moving extremely fast (depending on the distance it would have been in the hundreds of miles an hour+ range and besides that it was night time!).  I thought of bugs or moths flying around a light source, but there was absolutely no light source that close to me, I even took a short walk to check.  Maybe an atmospheric phenomenon, although there isn&apos;t any type of atmospheric anomaly I could think of... it was partly cloudy out, no rain and a slight breeze but no electrical/lightning activity in the area.  I literally stayed up until these objects finally disappeared, which happened not all at once but over the course over an hour.  By 12:45am, there were only a couple left that I could see and then they also disappeared from view.  There were literally dozens of these objects and reminded me of fireflies buzzing around each other when I lived back east.  I checked the local online paper this morning for any unusual reports but nothing at all... which I was slightly disppointed in finding out.  Is there ANYONE else out there that saw this??  I&apos;d really be interested in knowing.  I&apos;m borrowing some binoculars today in case they reappear this evening.  PS... a couple of days ago I submitted another report about a sighting that I had along with my ex-wife about 10 yrs ago back by Angels Camp, CA.  I also submitted a report from August 23rd of 2003 about objects that myself and a girlfriend had spotted over Reno.

We were simply looking at the stars.  We saw a couple of star-like objects move across the sky and I mentioned to them that they were likely satellites and that I had seen a lot of them in my years.  We were about to go inside when I saw two blurry redish hues (I can&apos;t really call them lights because they were not as clear as that, they gave off the sort of light you would see if you were to look at a black light.) I didn&apos;t think much of it at first as there is an international airport near us.  I told the kids to look at &quot;that plane&quot; and my daughter saw it but my son did not.  Just as I said that, the &quot;lights&quot; separated by about 8 times the distance they were when we first saw them!  This indicated to me that it was not a single object but two seemingly identical objects.  The speed with which they separated was quite quick, and they then proceeded to accelerate in a south-westerly direction far more rapidly than any plane could.  The duration of this observation was approximately 12 seconds and they covered 80% or so of our field of view in that time.  We lost sight of them due to the lights of the city.  I decided that I should call the ufo hotline center as I have NEVER seen anything as obviously unidentifiable as this before and I have watched the skies on and off in the Muskoka&apos;s and elsewhere thousands of times in my life just enjoying the stars and looking for events such as this!  I should include that I contacted the local air traffic control centre in Mississauga at Pearson International Airport.  I got no answer but a woman at Terminal 3 took my name and number and said they would call me back.  An hour has passed and they have not.  I find it a little strange that there are no airplanes in the area at this time - an hour since we saw these objects - and this being Easter Sunday and Pearson being a fairly busy airport, I would expect that there would be several jets in the sky!  Perhaps they did see something and have kept the air space clear because of this??? The phone number for the air traffic control centre is 905-676-3074 if anyone would like to follow this up in a more official manner than I am likely able to.", "Eight lights all different colors traveling accross the sky  in a  uneven V formation with small vapor trails.I never really thought about reporting what we had seen, we were just kids. People don&apos;t believe adults, never mind kids. We were walking down the sidewalk looking for a place to eat. We were staying at a motel in a small town somewhere in southwestern Utah. As we were walking down walked we noticed something on the ground flopping around like a fish. When we got closer we noticed it was a bat fighting a bug.  As the bat flew away our eyes followed it toward the sky.  Upon looking up we observed about eight lights in the sky. They traveled from left to right.  Each was a different color and they were flying in a v formation. One side of the formation was one light longer than the other side. I believe the right side was longer than the left. As they crossed the sky, they left a small vapor like trail behind them. They were far away it seemed and moved in the same direction across the sky for the duration of the sighting. They made no sound but again they were also far away. When all of a sudden they seemed to head in a more upward direction. Then in a split second they were gone and now left a longer trail behind. Each trail was they same color as each light that left it. They seemed to go up at an angle and did not cross the sky. The trails slowly dissipated and nothing more was seen of the objects. I have never heard of another sighting like ours. I have told the story to a few close friends only, due to the fact people look at you like your crazy. I have no oppinion of what is was.  I only know I can&apos;t explain it and have seen nothing since that can.((NUFORC Note:  Date of event may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

At approximately 10pm, I went outside for a cigarette break. It was a particularly clear night with not a breath of wind and the stars were out in force. Whilst studying the night sky to my west, I could not help but notice a fast moving object heading in my direction (east), flying at a guestimated height of 10,000ft. It passed overhead and was gone in a matter of seconds. The observations I made that struck me as being odd (in no particular order) were;  the circular shape of the object the &quot;reddish&quot; colour and glow associated with the object the lack of vapour trails no flashing lights no sound whatsoever the speed at which the object was traveling (it was immense even by a modern jet fighters standards!)

I am a very good student, I&apos;ve never taken drugs or drank, I have no emotional or mental disorders. I do believe in many paranormal things,seen some strange things, but nothing quite like this. Im very into any field involving the Heavens, therefore i am 99% sure it couldn&apos;t be a star, falling star, or comet.((NUFORC Note:  At two o&apos;clock in the morning, object almost certainly was not a satellite, so the event could not have been caused by an Iridium satellite.

You don,t need to put it back on but, I read on Jeff Rense that some else that saw this same thing by mecgregor mn. thought that it had started there. Iseen it where i live and thats right between Fergus Falls and Wadena MN. Also some one in Sissiton S.D. seen it. Well any way it was Labor Day week-end 2003. It was saturday night August 30 2003. I was out with my bonicalers watching Mars, it was close at that time to earth. All of a sudden i seen this other red light in my view. I couldn,t believe what i saw. It was huge, at least a football feild long or maybe a mile long. It was a v shape. It had no tall lights. Just a cluster of white lights in the nose and with my bonicluars it looked like three white lights. It made no sound at all. There were five red lights, these were spaced out, two on one side and three on the other. These red lights were hugh. One of these lights were about the size of a plane. It just glided off to the east. Also if i hadent been looking right at it i would have never seen it. Its the weirdest thing i have ever seen. This other person that put it on Jeff Rense musn,t rellize that it went farther then he thought. I seen it at about 11:15 P.M.I would have e-mailed Rense with this information but have no address for him. hope you let this other guy no that more poeple saw it. Thanks.", "i was on my way home from work on M-59 and i just saw this crazy circle object fly over my head.  i was sitting at a light staring up in the sky and i wouldn&apos;t have noticed it if it wern&apos;t for thoes lights on it.  I also happen to know it wasn&apos;t a plane. There is a airport around but the planes always take off and land coming from the east and west and not the north and south.  I was also too far away from the airport that they could be circling.  The object was also too low to be a plane.", "Disk-shaped object hovering up in the sky and traveling slowly for about 20 minutes with a brief flash of light coming out of it.I was traveling down I-75 last night coming back to Lexington, Kentucky from Richmond, Kentucky where I attend graduate school classes.  It was directly in my line of sight right before the curve towards the Clays Ferry Exit. The sky had a few clouds but it was mostly clear. I saw it straight ahead and I saw a flash of light come from the other side and traveled halfway around the object and stopped.  It did not flash all the way around the object.  It only flashed once.  It was a disk- shaped object that was a dark color like a dark grey or brown, not quite black.  The interstate wound around and the object was no longer in front of me but it was traveling along to my right.  I was straining my eyes to see legs to a water tower, or helicoptor propellers, or wings to an airplane, but there was none of that.  It was not a water tower because for one thing, I found out that it was moving and there was nothing sticking out of the object like wings or propellers.  It was definitely going too slow to be an airplane.  The only other thing I could think of would be a blimp of some kind but it didn&apos;t have any kind of writing or basket and I don&apos;t know if those have lights.  Also, it was 8:00pm on a Monday night and no events going on that would require a blimp that I know of and it simply did not look like a blimp.  However, I am trying to justify this because it goes against everything I believe in or ever thought possible.  This thing was traveling in my line of sight for about 20 minutes.  When i got off on the Man-o-War  exit I turned the wrong way so that i could follow it and take a clear picture with my camera phone.  By the time I could stop it was too far away to see it in the picture.  My camera phone is not very clear at all, anyway.  It just kept traveling away from me and I gave up and turned back around and went home.  I am just a Nutrition grad school student and I do not have any expertise in the aircraft area.  All I know is what I saw.  Can someone please tell me what this thing might have been?  I need some peace of mind.", "It was a disk shaped thing green and zig zaged up and down though the air and a slight humming noise", "Bright light moving steady across the sky from horizon to horizon.I started out seeing it when it was about 1/8th distance across the sky the southern direction.  I was looking east while watching it.  I told my friend who was there to turn around. Then I went in the house and got my mother.  All three of us watched it until it went out of site in the north eastern horizon.  It was a redish, yellowish bright light.  About 5 times bigger and brighter than a star.  It was moving straight and it was not blinking.  You could see airplanes off in different directions.  It looked nothing like them.  When it seemed like it was straight in front of us it looked like it got brighter.  That might have just been an optical illusion though.  I live far out in the country away from city lights.

It was mostly clear, not to cold with just a little snow trying to fall.  A great alaskan night. We were making small talk looking out into the night sky when I noticed the red dot moving accross the sky high up, traveling in a south easterly direction. I pointed it out to randy because the dot seemed to move pretty fast for a high flying Jet.As we watched we noticed it getting bigger. We did not see any other lights. It got bigger,I told ((name deleted)) it must be a plain getting ready to land at the local small air strip and wondered why his landing lights where not on.The last thing ((name deleted)) said was that the air port was of to side of us and not in front of us.And yes I could clearly see what he was talking about, this red ball was now getting huge, coming directly at us, just above the trees.I dont recall him or I saying anything at that time, just looking out the windshield. It stoped above the trees in front of us, it was awesome, at least 25 or 30 feet accross,it felt strange sitting in the cab of the truck looking out at this big red Ball,I could see like a liquid moving from the right to the left on it&apos;s surface wich gave me the sence that it was round.Every thing in front of us was in a red glow but not bright.I remember saying;what the hell is this, randy was silent.I dont know how long we looked at it, then suddenly there was this very loud metalic crashing sound, but not like a car crash, a lot shorter, but load.The red orb was gone. I know we both jumped.The truck was cold, I jumped  out of the truck thinking a tree had fallen on it,but there was nothing.It mast have been snowing because we had 6 or 7 inches of snow, and not a track or sign of what might have made that awfull sound.((name deleted)) started the truck and we got the hell out of there.We tried to figure out what we just seen, but of course didnt come up with anything other then some ufo or something.

I was going from Pomfret to Dayville, CT. At approximately 10:45 p.m., I noticed an extremely bright white light in the northest sky. This white light had a small red light on the left, and a small green light on the right. None of the lights were blinking. This object appeared to be maybe 2,000 feet in the sky, and it was moving very slowly in a southerly direction. I watched it for about 5 minutes. At this time, the white light, which was much brighter that anything else in the sky on this clear evening, faded out. The two colored lights remained lit, and the object continued to move in a southerly direction. At this time, I saw another object pass under it by a few hundred feet. This second object had a series of smaller, duller white lights which formed a semi-circle and strobed. The first object&apos;s remaining lights went out at this point. I continued traveling east on rte. 101 for another 5 minutes, still observing the second object, which was moving in a northeasterly direction rather slowly.I observed this object for a total of 10 minutes, at which time it disappeared behind a treeline.", "Blue Orb Followed By JetWas out back on my porch we just moved here not more than a few weeks ago and I usualy step outside nightly to look at the stars cause the night sky here is really nice to look at compared to where I lived before. I looked up towards the moon and saw 3 objects 2 were not blinking and 1 was one was blue and the other was white as it got closer it turned out to be that the blue object was being followed by a jet, we live just a few miles from Dyess Airforce Base the 2nd object was off to the side of the blue object kinda far away but I focused mainly on the blue object that was being followed until it got out of sight and I could no longer see it. I see jets flying around here quite often and they usualy have some sort of blinking light.

As we were talking we both noticed a slow pulsating red light, about 3.5 miles south and Im not good at judging the height but it was maybe 100 feet higher then a cell phone tower. A few minutes pass and the light moved straight up and slowly started heading toward the hospital.  It was moving so slow that I asked &quot;Is is me, or is that light moving toward us?&quot;  She agreed with me and and it took about 5 minutes for the light to move 3.5 miles. Its movement was a constant speed and the light didn&apos;t change its speed of pulsations. I can&apos;t be sure how fast it was moving, but I can be sure it wasn&apos;t as fast as a helicopter.

I was walley fishing with my grandfather on Malcom Lake Ontario Canada. There was a light breeze which drifted the boat between an island shoel and weed bed. Where we cast our lures hoping to land one. The moon light seemed to dance across the water.  Which soon became like a sheet of glass. The wind stopped and it became eriesomely quiet.  Sounds of water clapping the side of the boat stopped and off in the far distance, I heard sounds of a wiperwill and lune.  This soon faded to be replaced with silence. The only thing heard was each splash of our lures hitting the water followed by the turning sounds of the fishing real gears.  Then suddenly, a gust of wind and off in the distance about 1/4 of a mile away we saw an oval gray shaped object the length of a bus and about 16&apos;-18&apos; in depth huvvering approx 50&apos; above some tree tops along side the lake bank. At first, I didn&apos;t believe what I was seeing. I looked at my grandfather for confirmation and he looked me in the eye straight back. I then said, do you see that?  He said, yeah.  I said, what the hell is that?.  He said, I don&apos;t know? I said, mabey its a cloud. He said, the tree tops are moving underneath it. Sure enough, tree tops were moving beneath the object. They sway and swished back and forth in small circular patterns within a larger oval pattern beneath the object. Wind passed through the tree tops beneath the object. The object was oval in shape, black in color and huvvered motionless. The object was blacker than the night sky with a haze around it. Keep in mind it was a clear star, moon lit night.

I have lived here all my life and I have seen every kinda of plane go in and out of the base . I have never seen anything like this, it also made no sound,  we could not make out any kind of craft.  but we could tell the lights were attached to something.

I am sure it was Saturday because people were taking groceries from their cars.  We were playing a childhood game called wireball that involved throwing a tennis ball at the power line wires.  As I reared back to throw the ball, I saw something flash in the sky and stopped to get a better look.  The object that I saw was round, flat, very shiny (like polished aluminum) and proceeded in a southwesterly direction.  &quot;A flying saucer,&quot; I yelled.&quot;  The other kids all looked up and one of them said, &quot;Where?&quot;  I pointed up and said, &quot;There.&quot; Then he pointed and said, &quot;I see it.&quot;  I said, &quot;Not there...  There!&quot;  But when I looked at where he was pointing, there was another one.  Well, we counted a total of six saucers. All were very high and flying in the same direction with no apparent formation.  As they flew they would turn over slowly so that you would see them edgewise and they would occassionaly shoot off to the right or left but would maintain their southwesterly course. We created such a clamour that people came out of their homes and looked up.  I feel sure that at least twenty people must have seen these craft.

It was a clear night, temperature near 5C or 40F and calm winds. For about 3 seconds, while facing NW I heard a muffled yet steady low-pitched humming noise approach me from the SW. I turned and scanned the sky to identify its source. Unable to see anything I returned my sight to the NW and suddenly saw a single point of pale blue light perhaps 35-40 degrees from the horizon at a distance of what I approximate to be 1/2 a mile. The light moved suddenly and appeared to be ascending in the sky as it retreated. It did not blink, change intensity or change in size. I lost sight of it behind a tree but it did not reappear on the other side. My entire experience lasted less than 10 seconds.

We had both recently received our pilot&apos;s licenses and were avid flyers.  My friend&apos;s father owned a flying school at the airport.  We had just returned from an evening of night flying and had put the airplane in the hangar.  The night sky was very clear with stars showing brightly.  At this time of night air traffic in the Minneapolis area was very light.  During this event there were no aircraft operations at the MIC airport.  My friend and I were talking outside at the airport and noticed some colored lights hovering in a stationary position directly above the MIC airport.  At first we thought these lights may be a helicopter, balloon, or some other type of stationary craft.  As my friend was interested in star gazing and had his telescope at the airport building, we got the telescope out to look at these lights.  We both observed, over a period of at least 10 minutes, three lights, in a tringular configuration, consisting of green and red lights, each of these being in a triangular shape, hovering directly over the airport, altitude unknown.  We believed the lights to be maybe about 10,000 feet MSL because it took the power of the telescope to clearly see them.  The three lights appeared to &quot;wobble&quot; in the triangular configuration and they did not move or change altitude.  We were both very surprised that the lights, which we believed were attached to some type of solid, trianglar object, ommited no sound whatsoever.  Other than the lights, we could not actually see any type of object to which they could have been attached as it was dark night at this time.  The MIC control tower was closed at that time, so we could not contact them for confirmation of what this object may have been.

The location was in south Cypress, Ca.just east of Los Alamitos Airport.I was walking my dog near the Navy golf course. It was sunny out and the sky was mostly clear except for some cirrus clouds overhead. While my dog was sniffing around a gopher hole in the field, I looked up in the sky directly above me to look at the clouds,when I noticed a bright object that looked like a star sitting there among the clouds.  It was in blue, slightly hazy sky.  It actually was a little larger in appearance than a star. More like a small silvery disk. The pecular thing about it was that it was not moving at all.!!  Yet the cirrus clouds were moving to the east, they were drifting past the object while it remained in its exact spot in the sky.As I continued to watch the object,it occurred to me that it was too late in the morning for a star to be visible in the sky. Stars disappear shortly after sunrise. Thi object looked slightly larger than the star Sirius, but more like a metal disk than an actual star.  It looked silver in color.  It would brighten somewhat then dim in a regular pattern, about every few seconds.I observed this object for around 15 to 20 minutes.It did not move that entire time.My dog was getting impatient so I started walking while still looking up to watch the object.  All the time I watched it, it did not move from its location.  An occasional cirrus cloud would drift over it, sometimes obscurring it from view. This gave me the impression that the object was at least 40,000 feet high,since I think that is about how high cirrus clouds occur at.   From where I stood in the field,the object was overhead at about 70-80 degrees elevation  and at a direction of approximately 10-20 degrees east of true north.  Finally, it was obscurred completely by thicker clouds and that was the last that I saw the object.A Baloon would have drifted with the clouds. This object remained in that spot.  It definately looked metalic, though very far away.There was no sound that I could discern.

In May last year I was photographing the moon using an slr mounted on a tripod, cable release, 70mm lens, 400 asa film. The exposure times varied between less than a second to maybe 1 minute, you can tell by the streaks left by the stars. when I took the photographs there was nothing in the sky, when I had got them back, there was a very unmistakeable light near the moon. In the first photo it was directly in line with the moon, then as the moon moved in its orbit the light stayed where it was, which was for something like 15 20 minutes which can be vairifed by the amount of motion of the moon. The photographs were developed at a commerical lab the original preview is included.the next night I did the same, this time the moon rose later and so was in a completely different spot. When I got the photos back there was the light again obviously infra red or similar. Again it was near the moon and therefore had to move their to be in the photo. The next night I did the same but there was no light, then the night after I again photographed the moon and it was back again, and again in a completely different positon but still near the moon. those photographs are in the first album. to give some perspective, I have included a photo of the moon taken with a 400mm lens, it is still samller than the light and nowhere near as bright. You will also notice that in the photo of the moon the background is very dark and there are no stars visible and no trees or clouds visible even though I included trees in the shot to gain some perspective. This means that the light needed to be close enough to light the trees, as well as provide the added light energy to make the stars visible.In the second album the photographs were taken in january this year, there were similar exposure times some shorter some a little longer yet it is much brighter and obviously closer as it clearly lights up the roof and trees, you can see clouds and stars and the background is visible unlike the moon photos that are just black. again I have included the original preview from the photo lab which is a different lab again, I also have the original film.

It appeared at times to turn to the side and when it did, it appeared to be two lights instead of one. The object appeared to pulsate, not blink on and off.  After leaving the house I stopped and lined up my sight with a stationary object (a power line pole) just to be sure that it wasn&apos;t my eyes causing the object to appear to move.  The object continued the erratic movements until I finally lost sight of it about twenty minutes after first sighting it.", "Since witnessing simultaneous unidentified objects last month, I have been watching the night sky whenever I can, wondering if I will ever see them again.  Well, almost exactly a month later, at almost exactly the same time, and from the same location, I witness another strange event.....very different, but again, unexplainable.  I just couldn&apos;t believe it!! A small white light appeared (it moved like a satellite, only much, much closer to Earth) from the northeast sky, travelling towards the southwest.  It was low. I assumed it was an airplane, but as I studied it, there were no blinking lights.  As I watched it, it seemed to slow down or even stop.  It started to get brighter and brighter and it got to the point where it was just as bright as Jupiter, which was in the southeast sky that night.  It reminded me of a plane that is coming in to an airport at night, with all it&apos;s bright landing lights on. The object then seemed to change direction, I thought it was going to go due east, but as I watched, I realized it was changing its altitude as well as it&apos;s direction.  It climbed fast and high, and dimmed quickly. I was able to see it for about 4 seconds before it was too high to see anymore. There was absolutely no sound, and it was definitely close enough that I should have been able to hear something.I have been interested in the night sky since I was young, I go out to find constellations and planets, and like to view meteor showers and comets.  In 20 years of looking at the sky, I&apos;ve never witnessed anything unusual, now I&apos;ve seen two of the strangest happenings all in one month.  What is going on?", "Large wedged shaped object, with two large bright lights, and no noise.I was at work one night and my boss sent me on my hour break. I was driving down the road toward the center of town and noticed what i thought were two extremly bright street lights.As i drove closser I saw that the lights were moving slowly across the road and appeared to get much larger than the surrounding street lights. I immediatly felt allarmed and slowed the van to observe the lights. once I got about 100 yards away from it I saw a very large triangular , almost boomerang shaped object hovering mabee 200 feet off the road at a very low altitude (mabee 250 feet). The bright lights were set out on the points of its &quot;wings&quot; there were no other lights and it made absolutly no noise as i passed it by.About 3 miles down the road I found a spot to turn arround hopping to see it again but it was gone. I told my freinds at work, they didnt belive me, and I went back to work as normal.I couldent have been the only one to see it, the road was fairly busy and other cars were slowwing down to see it.", "Golden triangle of lights in Northern Arizona, 2 min duration, silent and then just disappearedI was walking North between buildings at our ranch 30 miles NE of Flagstaff, AZ, when I saw three bright amber/gold lights in a triangular formation about 10-15 degrees above the horizon.  They were straight ahead of me, and although I couldn&apos;t really estimate their distance I guessed that they were a few miles away.  I first assumed that they belonged to military aircraft flying in formation, since they were in a patch of sky that was too light to see stars, and they were brighter than any stars and an unusual color that I don&apos;t recall ever seeing in the sky before.  I watched the lights for a full minute or two.  They possibly had red or green flickers, and my rational mind was thinking that these could be additional small lights.  I was thinking at the time that the formation moved very slowly, since planes always move, but looking back I&apos;m not sure it moved at all. After this minute or two, as I watched with mild curiousity, the lights just vanished.  I figured.... um.... well, the planes must have turned to an angle where I couldn&apos;t see the lights any more.  I kept watching but they never came back.  The desert was totally silent all this time.", "I noticed in the sky this Triangle  Yellow Light moving slowly around a little forest that we have between our complex (Asten Woods)I left the house 9:32 pm to pick up my 11 y old daughter at a party. I noticed in the sky this Triangle Yellow Light moving slowly around a little forest that we have between our complex (Asten Woods). I stopped the car on Dittest St to look at it. The Triangle also stopped and stayed in place for about 2 minutes. Then,the Triagle light disapear/faded away (leaving a little circle of small lights) but there was still something there - I kept looking around, but now there were cars behind me - so I had to move.  I went and picked up my daughter and in the way back home - when I turned into Erial &amp; Williamstown Rd - I could see the Triangle Light again - I asked my daughter do you see that Triangle in the sky she said &quot;yes&quot;. It moved from the area that I saw before and it crossed the road that you were in and then it disapear again in the open clear sky. The Trianle Light was yellow and when it faded it seemed to had little lights in place of the big Triangle Light.", "Three lights in a triangle dim simultaneouslyMy husband and I were driving north on Lindsey from Baseline in Mesa, AZ when we saw three white lights in perfect formation moving slowly across the sky.  The crafts position made it apparent that it was an equilateral triangle slightly skewed due to its pan/tilt.  The three lights moved across the sky making it obvious that they were joined though the crafts shape was difficult to make out.  The lights dimmed (all in unison), seemed to brighten slightly and then dimmed completely.  By the time we had crossed under the bridge at Highway 60, there was no sign of the craft.  The sighting lasted between 15 and thirty seconds.  Both of us noticed the craft at the same time as it was pretty obvious that these lights were not stars or earth aircraft and the lights were moving slowly west.", "IT was Clearly  A Spacecraft of somesort, It was completely black and  it let off a green shockwave before every rapid burst of speed.i  saw a black triangle in Lincolnshire England  in the late 90&apos;s. Me and my friend were coming back from High school on a bus from the town of spilsby when only a few miles from my house in New Leake We observed a Small Black Triangle Craft. It was moving very quickly all over the sky, interesting before each rapid burst of speed it seemed to emit a greenish heatwave/shockwave of some sort. It constantly moved forwards then backwards so fast we lost track of it several times, but each time appearing in another part of the sky in the same direction. It seemed to be following our bus from a distance i am not sure, At one point it swooped down to tree level and back into the air.  It was travelling in a southernly direction. I have no idea what it was or why it was showing off and flying like it was. either it was trying to get noticed, the pilot was crazy or it was a probe of some sort. This triangle was not giant like the one most people describe i cannot recall seeing any lights but this was in the day time between 3:50 to 4:10pm. I only remember the time as that is the time i normally use to get home, My friend is also a whitness.There is no mistaking this was a triangular spacecraft of some sort as it was there for 10 whole minutes and doing manuvers so fast it was definately no plane, unless planes can travel warp speed,all this in broad Day Light On a clear hot sunny day means there was no mistakeing what so ever of what it was. My older brother and his friend also saw a black triangle at quite close range fly over them coming home from soccer one evening in the early 90&apos;S. They saw this in the east coast Lincolnshire town of Sutton on Sea not too far from Mablethorpe. This object flew in a easterly direction towards Belgium. It had 3 lights on it all yellowy,orange i assumed like the belgium ufo. However my brother has resently told me he only remembers 2 of the lights colours which were green and red. one in each corner and this sighting was at nighttime. Interestingly this object was reported all over the news in belgium the same week so that can narrow down the date better. Thanks for listening :) My email is GangstardannyBoy@hotmail.com if you have can shed any more light on these sightings and ufos similar to them or help me see if anyone else whitnessed green shockwaves coming from these triangles before sudden bursts of speed id like to hear from you.

They looked like lit-up windows one might see in a house from far away. In retrospect, I am pretty sure that they were two separate lights (or lit windows) on a single craft because there was a definite curve in the lights, as if they were curving around the craft.It was not an airplane; it wasn&apos;t moving at all and it certainly was not a star or planet. Believe me, I can tell the difference and this was not something you normally see in the sky. The lights or whatever they were a part of did not move at all; they remained perfectly still.Anyways, I tell my mom, who was driving, &quot;Look. That doesn&apos;t look like a star and it&apos;s not moving. What the heck is that?&quot; So, she looks. Moments later, the light dimmed over the span of about two seconds until it was out.

Solar flares had been in the news starting April 7 and it was soon thereafter. Exactly overhead I noticed an aberation moving across the sky.  A solar flare I thought.  But after watching it I noticed the well defined shape and that it had a couple of distinct characteristics. It was shaped like a long boomerang, but wasn&apos;t quite as angled, and it spanned a substantial section of the sky.  It looked matte black or dark gray. The entire inside edge was very sharp and the center section (perhaps 5-10% of the entire thing) seemed very hazy whereas the rest of the object was well defined. It moved from south to north to the west of Sonoma as if following the I-5 Corridor  ((sic.  See below.  PD))  It continued north moving very fast, it was about 4 seconds until I couldn&apos;t see it anymore as it began to merge with the just-after-dusk sky. It was very high up. I ran into the house to get my sister and she came out and we both looked. Within seconds we saw two planes together coming from the north. When they got to about halfway between where I first and last saw the object, one of the planes split off sharply and headed west. The other plane continued south. The planes appeared to be at the same height as the object and like most planes that high up, they just appeared as spots of light. In contrast the object had spanned an entire section of the sky which is why I thought initially it was a visual aberation from solar flares. (That could have something to do with an aura, but I didn&apos;t specifically see one.) I went inside and figured the size by triangulation. I think it came out to somewhere between a mile or 2 wide. Somehow the size, height and speed had combined to make it feel very heavy and deliberate, like it was doing surveillance. It made me feel as if I had seen it, but it had also seen me. As if I&apos;d inadvertantly and unintentially had a conscious exchange, like when I catch someone&apos;s eye. I didn&apos;t jacuzzi at night for months afterward so I wouldn&apos;t be available for another encounter.

There are a lack of reference points in a clear night sky.Within a 30 seconds all conversation stopped as one by one my fellow travellers noticed said orange sphere.It occured to me that it would overfly our position on the ground and so i attempted to take a photograph with my Canon Eos 300D camera. The camera failed to operete for unexplicable reason. (not done that before or since) As the light passed over us it changed vector by about 5 or six degrees with no discernable change in speed. Not a satellite then i thought.We discussed what it could be amongst ourselves but failed to come up with a rational explanation.Hot air ballon ? ..... that would account for the orange/red aura (flame) But the object was travelling too fast for a ballooon and then of course there was that noticable vector change. Not to mention it would be a very foolish balloonist to fly in total darkness.The orange glow it generated seemed to flicker and change to a slight reddish tinge from time to time. It varied a little in intensity of brightness.The object made no sound at all that we could discern.It kept its speed as it dissapeared into the distance, heading roughly North west. On my return to the UK i researched said object on internet and discovered an article describing several similar sounding objects flying above Chiang Mai on Feb 7th. I have always kept an open mind regarding UFO`s.My mind is that little bit more open following my experience in Thailand.To my mind this was literally a flying object that was unidentified.I would be interested in hearing from anyone else who witnessed this object or similar objects.

I saw something in 1985 that was extremely strange: a small (approximately 30 feet across) round craft, making absolutely NO noise whatsoever; and in the same month, a VERY large triangular shape floating silently in the early morning sky.  At the time, I was staying at a friend&apos;s house, having just moved from San Diego, California, to Concord, California.  The first sighting was at approximately 9 pm (2100 hours), and the people that I was staying with, and myself, were sitting together in a hot-tub spa.  This &quot;vehicle&quot; was blinking red, orange, green, blue and white lights, flying directly over us at approximately 1500 feet altitude, making no noise at all.

She said several other people saw it.  I told her it was probably a frigate bird.  She got rather defensive and said it was NOT a bird, that it didn&apos;t have a head or feet, didn&apos;t flap the wings, didn&apos;t make any sound.  She couldn&apos;t tell how far out to sea it was and couldn&apos;t estimate the size, although she said it did not seem to be very large.  It rapidly disappeared towards Galveston Island.", "Videotaped bright white ball of light travelling at a high speed across the horizon at two separate times, 10 min apart in 2 locations.I live on Fairview Ct. in Auburn. On 03/16 around 6:36pm I was going out to my car to put some dishes in it to take to my grandmother&apos;s house.  Well, I had parked on the side of the road in front of my house so my wife could get out of the driveway earlier and when I was at my car I heard an airplane above me. I looked up to see it, and it was pretty close due to me living not far from the Lew/Aub airport.  I was checking out the lights on the plane and thinking to myself how cool would it be to see a UFO that close with the lights and all. I have a prior interest in the subject.  No sooner than that, I looked to my left (while still gazing up) and I saw a bright white light traveling from left to right far off in the distance but above the horizon. I stared at it for a few seconds trying to make out what it was and when I realized that there were no blinking lights, I went into my house and grabbed my video cam and got about 20 seconds of footage before it disappeared. It didn&apos;t zigzag at all, just a straight path across the horizon.  It moves behind some trees and then disappears.  The sky was clear except for a haze around the horizon so I think it just may have moved into the haze. My plans that night were to go to my grandmothers first and then to church for worship team practice and then to my friend&apos;s house to hang out with some buddies one of who is a huge UFO buff. Since I know he loves this stuff, I brought my cam in the car with me to show him the footage. Well, I get to my grandmothers and pull over to the side of her building on Lincoln Street in Lewiston and before I got out of the car I called my friend on my cell to tell him what I got.  Two seconds later as I&apos;m talking to him, I see the light again! Still going in the same path (left to right). I told my friend that I would call him back and threw my phone down and grabbed the camera again and caught some more footage before it disappeared behind a building.  This time was much quicker but clearer than the first.  I had zoomed in too much on the first and totally distorted part of the footage. I really have no idea what it was but I&apos;m pretty sure it wasn&apos;t an airplane because it was a solid bright white light only, no flashing lights or colored ones.  I called Lifeflight the next day to see if maybe their copter was in the air and they said that it was around 7pm but they said the only lights they use are landing lights and only when they are landing. Lifeflight is an emergency service for our local hospital. Whatever it was did not make a sound as far as I could tell. It was too far away when I shot the vid at my house and when I shot the vid at my grandmother&apos;s there was too much traffic driving by to here much of anything other than the cars. I did some more research in the next few weeks and a friend of mine got me in touch with a local newspaper reporter.  I brought the video to him and he wrote up an article about it and tied it in with a recent visit he took to Nevada and Area 51.  You can read the article by following this link:  http://www.sunjournal.com/search/story.php?ID=102716  He also checked with the local drug enforcement agency and unofficially they stated that they did not have a search copter in the air on that night but officially they would not confirm nor deny that they did.  He also checked with the local airport manager and they said that he checked his flight logs and helped the reporter rule out other possibilities. A friend of mine mentioned the possibility of it being an iridium flare so we checked into that and found out that there was one in the area on the night in question but the altitude was too high and flares do not last as long as the light I videotaped and are of a different shape.  Mine was totally round and white and very bright.  The tape was taken in a Hi-8mm format.  I have made only one copy on VHS and that was given to the reporter.  My video camera is a Sony CCD-TRV68 which has an s-video out so I will try to have a friend of mine transfer the video into a digital format on his PC in the near future.  I would be more than happy to provide the original for analysis if needed, as long as it can be returned to me because it has one of a kind footage of other family events on it as well.((NUFORC Note:  We will contact the witness, and invite him to submit a copy of the tape for our examination.  We will confirm whether the date was March 16, or April 16.  PD))", "((NUFORC Note:  One of two similar reports from same witness.  We believe that the correct date for the dramatic Leonid meteor shower was November 18, 2002, and we have amended the date above.  PD))An erratically moving object was observed during the NASA Channel&apos;s live broadcast of the Leonid meteor shower 11/18/2001.I don&apos;t remember if I reported this to you before -- I recall posting this information to a web site. Early on the morning of the 2001 Leonid meteor shower (11/18/2001), about 1:30 a.m. to 3:15 a.m. or so, I had driven to a ridgeline near my home in Lake Arrowhead CA.  I watched the meteor storm, saw several hundred meteors and a great number of fireballs (some of which buzzed with audible radio waves).  I drove back home and turned on the NASA Channel&apos;s live coverage.  Thinking that my kids, who were at my ex-wife&apos;s house, might not have gone out to watch the meteor shower, I plugged a videotape in to my VCR and taped the coverage. At this point I was more hoping that the droning voices would put me to sleep, but I was also enjoying what was an incredible light show.  At about 4:00 or 4:30 a.m., I was still watching the coverage.  I believe the feed was from Kitt Peak Observatory in Arizona, but I&apos;m not certain of that.  As I watched the coverage, a dot of light moved slowly across the screen.  I remember thinking, &quot;Oh cool, they&apos;ve got a satellite on there!&quot; and it looked very much like a satellite -- a dot of light moving very steadily in one direction. The &quot;dot of light moving in one direction&quot; then veered at a sharp angle and began moving away, then changed course again.  I must&apos;ve had the dumbest look on my face.  My jaw dropped, and I said, &quot;Son of a bitch -- that&apos;s a UFO!&quot;  I kept watching as it moved away from the field of view of the televised telescope. Now, the shot was stationary.  I assume the telescope tracked very slowly to keep the radiant of the shower centered, but the camera/telescope wasn&apos;t moving -- it was this object that was moving.  No satellite can make changes in direction that acutely, nor can any aircraft.  As I mentioned, it gave the apearance of a distant satellite, but its movement was definitely atypical. My videotape, BTW, burned when my home was lost in the October 29, 2003 Old Fire in the San Bernardino Mountains.  I wish I still had it, for on it was incontrovertible proof to me that something odd was in the skies that morning.  I don&apos;t know if anyone else has videotapes of that broadcast, but if they are available, I&apos;d sure love to have a replacement copy!  I have to say I&apos;ve always been a skeptic.  I felt that way about religion, too -- if I saw a burning bush or if God booked a showing on Larry King Live, then I&apos;d be convinced.  I do not know what it was I saw that morning, but I&apos;m certain someone somewhere also recorded that live broadcast by NASA and has this on tape.((NUFORC Note:", "Rare &quot;star&quot;I was watching a sunset with my dog on a chair, and without not cause, i decided to watch the sky, and i saw the transcition of the day, half of sky was day, an the other half was night, some stars began to appear, single only. and one of them, was different if you compare it to the others, this was to much big, and i start to watch it strange star, with attention, and it&apos;s become to drain, ... to a point when this strange &quot;star&quot;, was very small, then this &quot;star&quot; move very fast to the left and then to the right very very fast and dissapiared.

Because the curiosity got the est of me, I went and got the video recorder. I started taping and was amazed at what I was seeing with the camcorder on full zoom. The object would change it&apos;s shape and display what appeared to be multiple colors. My battery needed to be recharged on 2 occassions due to not using the camcorder in several months. I would recharge for about 15 minutes and then head back out. On the third time out, the object had moved to another location. I tried to record what I believe was still the same light, but it was much further away and I wasn&apos;t able to see it doing the same things as before.

One fall morning going to school and waiting in line to get on the school bus, I was looking up at the very blue sky.  It was a very clear day.  I saw six silver discs flying in V-formation and there was one in the following in back of it, like the war planes flew.  They were very high in the sky and about the size of very small peas, heading northeast as if to bypass Chicago and head into Indiana.  They made no noise (as the airplanes were quite noisy) and they were crossing the sky at a very great speed.  There were no jets at that time that I knew of and if there were, they would have made lots of noise and not have gone that fast.  I stood there and watched them and the kids were calling me to get on the bus.

My wife and I saw saw it just above the horizon of the hills, but seems to be around 5 miles away, close to Felix or Copperopolis. It pops up every now and then on certain nights. I would gladly like to dismiss this as a radar helicopter, but it is just too bright and the rapid movements it makes just does not add up.We haven&apos;t video taped this object yet, but we are counting on it. We hope to get some pics or footage of this thing eventually. Generally, the object simply &quot;blinks out&quot; when it disappears. I have now seen this thing a dozen times in the past year.

I of course thought that it was a jet coming in to land at the airport but as I got closer to my house this craft was still pretty much in the same spot. I thought that this waz very weird because it was going so slow I thought that it was going to fall out of the sky. As I approached my street I could see that the railroad crossing gates were all down and flashing. These are a triple set of tracks and I thought that was odd because usually not all of them go down at the same time. And the gates go down just a few minutes before the actual train goes by and no train came through. So I pulled into my driveway and this object was directly behind my house but out over the lake. And for about a minute it stood still and then it started moving again. Still at the speed of a snail. I stood on my back deck watching it creep along ever so slowly.......it was actually painful to stand and watch it it was slow.....like watching paint dry.......anyway, I watched it for 20 minutes before it was out of view and then I went in the house. This craft/object was sort of helicopter shaped. It was fairly low in the sky and it made a sound like a jet only softer more masssive. I appeared to have three very large, (two story size), windows on the front and the light that came from those windows was the brightest I have ever seen in my life. Also it flew with the front down slightly. I definatly know it was not a jet and it was not a helicopter. I was close enough to see the windows and the shape of this thing. Also there were no other lights lit up on it. No flashing lights and no tail section like a jet or helicopter. So that is my sighting as I saw it. This has not been the first encounter I have had with &quot;others&quot;. I do have other stories that started when I was a child.

It could have been between mid 1986 and mid 1987, so I arbitrarily assigned it December 31, 1986. The time of 9pm or 2100 hours local is also approximate. The precise information was recorded in a log book that I used to record astronomical measurements in and was later stolen in a home burglary. And I can only guess the above dates because of other information that was recorded before and after the log book was stolen. Also the Houston area is not much of a seasonal place so that does not help my recollection. The following is the best of my recollection. The formation of lights appeared in my northwest sky at about azimuth 315 and about 30 degrees altitude up from my horizon. The formation was 4 white lights parallel to the horizon appearing as two pairs of lights with about twice the distance separating the pairs as was between each light in the pair. The brightness of these lights were around 4th magnitude star lights and appeared as such - point light source stars. The lights were steady and not twinkling. The angular width of the formation was about 1 degree. This formation of lights changed location in the sky within an area of about 4 degrees. I based the approximate degree measurements using the width of the index finger at arms length to be about 1 degree. The formation moved from its initial location down about 1-1/2 degrees and to the left about 1 degree, and then from that location moved about 2-1/2 degrees to the right and down about 2 degrees. The lights did not move but instead disappeared and reappeared in a different location as noted. These were the only movements I can recall and then they disappeared completely. When the lights changed location it was and instantaneous movement meaning the lights did not disappear for some time then reappear. This was in fact what caught my attention to begin with so I really don&apos;t know how long they were doing this movement before I noticed them. There were no other noticeable objects or lights in this area of the sky. There was no other apparent motion with the lights. There were no sounds. There was no noticeable object associated with the lights. The formation of the 4 lights never changed its shape. I assumed these lights to have been at a very great distance away from my location. There were clouds in that area of the sky and I viewed the event through an opening in the clouds that stayed open during the entire event. This was all viewed using only unaided eye vision - no telescope or binoculars, etc... The event duration was probably about 15-20 seconds.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

When we saw it there was a little breeze out, so we tried to think of earthly explanations for what we saw--pool or hot tub cover, construction debris, tarp, a super-jumbo sized remote-controlled helium toy, but nothing quite worked because the wind wasn&rsquo;t that strong, the thing was at least as big as my van, and the thing seemed to be moving slowly and intelligently, and often against the breeze -- not just getting tossed around by it.When we first spotted it, I had just picked up my mother from her apartment near the east edge of Stanwood.  Sitting in the parking lot, we saw it coming up from behind some big fir trees that were some blocks further east from us (there are fields and woods out that way).  The thing banked, showing us a big dark disk that I thought was at least as wide as my Chevy Venture van was long.  The disk then spiraled up higher and leveled out above the fir trees.  We could now see that while the disk was dark on the bottom, it was a metallic silver on top, and when viewed on edge the disk was thicker in the middle - slightly more pronounced near the center of the silver side.  It banked again, so we moved the car to a different spot where we could watch it, overlooking the east edge of the high school football field.  The disk continued to wobble and rotate along the edge of town, bank and spiral, level out, hover, taking its time working its way along the east edge of the Church Creek housing development and city park as it headed toward Highway 532.  As it got closer to the highway and the grocery store/strip mall there, it went waaaaay high until we could barely see it as a bright silver point against a big cloud bank.  Lost sight of it then.

The noise got louder and finally there was a thing speeding down the road, only it wasn&apos;t touching the ground.

White lights in front, blinking red lights on tail.I was home on the night of April 11, 2005 watching a PBS tv special about the laying of the trans-atlantic telegraph cable. I was sitting in a chair next to a large picture window that faces directly south.  The only lights on inside the house were a small night light in the bathroom and the light from the television set.From the corner of my eye I saw a bright light outside which emerged slowly from behind some trees on the east side of my house.  The time was 9:54pm.  The light appeared to be a cluster of bright (prismatic) white lights which was immediately trailed by a long, very dark space and then there was a small cluster of blinking reddish lights.  My first impression was that the cluster of reddish lights was an airplane chasing the white lights.I ran outside to my porch and watched this object move slowly, perhaps 100-150mph, from east to west.  The sighting was at least a full minute.  It very soon became apparent that this was not two objects  but one.  The white lights in the front were trailed by a long, dark, unlighted structure that blotted out the stars as it passed.  It was a bright, starry night with a crescent moon low on the northwestern horizon; the moon was below the treeline behind the house.The trailing cluster of blinking, reddish lights followed in perfect, attached unison to the white lights and the unlighted structure, never moving closer or further away.  My best estimate of the size of this object (seen from the side) is about 300ft.  The object passed about 1000-1500ft from me and passed over the hill behind my house with about 200ft of clearance.  The hill&apos;s elevation is 1900 ft, my house is about 200ft below that.The object passed directly east to west over the southern portion of my 11 acre, heavily wooded, hillside lot.  The area I live in is sparsely populated with few paved roads and no streetlights.  The lights of the local village are visible in the valley below my home, about four miles away to the northeast.  Only half of the village is visible due to intervening hills.As the object passed my home I heard what I took to be a freight train passing through the village, this is a frequent and familiar sound.  I did not equate this sound with the presence of the object which did not seem to make any sound at all.For the record:  I have ten years of military experience with the US Air Force and US Air Force Reserves.  My service was spent working on and flying in military aircraft (not as a pilot).  I am familiar with military aircraft and helicopters", "Confused and concerned - what is happening to me?

The 5 and 805 freeways split very near the base, just to the north and west of the base. The 805 runs nearest just under the flight path while the 5 runs near the coast and its 5 or 10 miles to the west of the base. On the night of 2/12/05 the 805 freeway was closed for several miles north and south of the base. From the 805 you can see the base, from the 5 you can not see the base.All traffic was diverted to the 5 on Sat. and Sunday nights. I have no idea if there is a connection but my thoughts are that if they were testing something there and didn&apos;t want people from the freeway to see it then they would close it off and divert traffic.They did this on several weekends.What was odd about this is that there is a short section of the 805 that is being repaired near the Mira Mesa exit. There was no reason to have the detour go as far as south as it did. The next connecting freeway was 7 or 8 miles south of the 5 and 805 split. So both the north and south bound sections of the 805 were blocked off for 10 miles, 3 miles north of the base and 7 miles south of the base. It made me think, why?  Now I read what that guy wrote and wonder, maybe?((NUFORC Note:  If anyone can provide more information about this alleged traffic diversion, we would welcome an explanation of what happened there.

I saw a large blue/white streak going parallel to the horizon traveling through the sky from the East to the West at about the 2 o&apos;clock position.  The Nashville report did not state the direction the object was traveling. I have seen many meteor showers before and this was quite different. It didn&apos;t travel in a completely straight path - seemed so sort of &quot;wiggle&quot; slightly up and down and get slightly thinner and fatter along its path. It almost looked like it was an object tumbling slightly along. The width of the streak was quite a bit wider than the width of a normal meteor shower streak. (Maybe about the width of a pencil at arm&apos;s length.)  The object traveled very fast. It was only in the view of my window for approximately 2 to 3 seconds, but was so bright that it left a glowing blue trail behind it. I can remember seeing the entire length of its path, including its slight up and down movements for a second or two after it passed by. Normal meteors fade almost as quickly as they are seen.

It was at this point that I knew for sure what I was seeing was not balloons or birds or planes or helicopters or anything I had ever seen before. OK, now they have my attention. From the straight line one of the dots just vanished. The remaining four spread out across the sky and formed a perfect square and drew the square tighter until they were close to each other again.

Impossible for an aircraft. Besides it had no other lights like the beacons and nav lights. I removed my eye from the telescope, to check if I was just seeing things, and tried to call my cousin. In that moment, the object started to grow amazingly until it reached maybe 10 times its original size, then disappeared. Sadly no one else could see it.

I then realized that it was not just 2 but four objects traveling in a formation with one in front , the 2 in the middle (still traveling together in parallel and the last object about the same distance from the middle two as the first was and all four traveling at an apparently equal speed. All four objects were of the same color light as the first 2 I had noticed and I also realized that the seemed to flicker a little, almost as ember that will sometimes escape from a wood fire will tend to do.   I realized that this was something very unusual so I went inside my home to get my brother and let him see these same objects to see if maybe I was jumping to conclusions to quickly.  He also couldn&apos;t figure out what these objects were but we were quite sure it was not a normal aircraft.  The total amount of time from when I first noticed these objects to when I told my brother and he stepped outside was no more than 10 minutes.  About half-way through the total course of what I could observe of these 4 objects, the 2 middle objects started altering their formation from parallel travel to an in-line formation, which put all 4 objects into one single line but all four still traveling at the same speed.  As soon as the 2 middle objects finished getting in the same line the first object in the front of the formation started to drop or lose something that to me appeared almost like little embers from the bottom of the object. At about the same time the objects light intensity started diminishing rapidly and also the object started to increase its observed speed.  At about the same point at which the first object started to change it&apos;s appearance, the 2nd one started to alter in the same manner and as the 3rd and 4th objects reached the same point the same exact changes occurred.  When these objects would reach their dimmest but still visible appearance is when objects appeared to reach the highest observable speed before dissapearing completely from my sight.  All four objects went through the same process in the same manner from the same points in the sky but only as they reached what was the initial point of the first object in the formation.  The weather coditions were almost clear skys with only some small amounts of hazy patches of clouds at different points of the sky around my area.

Very fast and able to stop in flight, expell a white &apos;flash&apos; of something, looked like plasma.  @ that point I grabed my two dauhters and ran in the house.

Since he is an artist, I asked him to draw me a picture of the UFO, which he did, and which he gave me permission to post, and which is attached here.Here is the story as related to me by him on Sept. 9, 2004. (Bear in mind, this incident occured about 37 years ago!): My friend was living in Whittier, California in early Spring, 1967 (approximate date).  He was with his wife over at a co-worker&apos;s house for dinner, and after dinner he and his co-worker went out on the patio of the house in Whittier, and they were standing there, leaning back slightly, at about 7:00 pm - 7:30 pm, (it was dark out) and they were talking about work.  He and his co-worker were both electricians, and they had been working together that day.  Their wives were in the house at the time.As they were on the patio, the UFO (depicted in the drawing) flew by, going from south to north, approximately as depicted.  It was travelling at approximately 100 mph to 200 mph, at a steady, uniform speed, and was totally silent.  (No engine noise.  No noise at all.)  It was in the view of both of these gentlemen for approximately two seconds.  It was approximately 500 feet long, approximately 100 feet diameter.  There were hundreds of windows, or port holes, approximately as shown, which were approximately 3 feet in diameter and approximatley 10 feet apart (10 feet spacing).  The windows, or port holes, were filled with bright white light.  The UFO was travelling approximately 100 to 125 feet above the ground.  It was approximately 150 feet away from these two observers.It was dark out, but my friend got the impression that the UFO was silver in color, although he is not sure about that.  He was close enough to the UFO that he would have been able to see &quot;passengers&quot; in the windows, or port holes, if there had been any &quot;passengers&quot;.  No &quot;passengers&quot; were observed in the windows or port holes; only bright white light.  Both individual witnesses observed the craft as described.  Immediately they went inside the house to tell their wives what they had just witnessed and to report the UFO to the Air Force, or to the police.  However, when they went in the house they observed on television at the time was a news story about some kids who had released helium balloons with Aluminum-foil attached earlier that morning near Griffith Park, and it created a big traffic jam on the Golden State freeway, and many people had reported this as UFOs.  As a result, my friend and his co-worker decided not to report the UFO because, in view of the news story on television about the kids&apos; balloons and the resultant UFO reports regarding the balloons, because he and his co-worker decided that their report would probably not be taken seriously.He remarked that the general shape of the UFO was that of a blimp, however in every other respect (speed, size, silence, hundreds of brightly lit windows, etc.) it was definitely not a blimp, or any other kind of conventional craft; it was a &quot;UFO&quot;.All of the data above about this incident (size, distance, speed, location, etc.), which occured in 1967, was provided to me by my friend - in response to my questions - on Sept. 9, 2004, (~37 years after the event) and are approximate only, and are &quot;ball-park&quot; estimates given to me by him.  So, if the sketch does not agree exactly with the dimensions provided, this is why.  (Also, I would like to add that -in my opinion - memories of short duration of significant events that happened a long time ago can still be somewhat accurately remembered.  For example, did you ever break a neighbor&apos;s window as a kid with a baseball?  Can you still see the baseball shattering the glass?) **************************** Something bothers me about all of this: I cannot understand &quot;helium balloons with Aluminum-foil attached, released by kids&quot;, causing a major jam-up on the freeway, UFO reports, and major news coverage!!! Here is what I speculate: There was major UFO activity in that general area (southern California) that day.The UFOs were reported, and the UFO sightings caused a major jam-up on the freeways.Disinformation was then released by the government in the form of a fictitious &quot;made-up&quot; story about kids with balloons and Aluminum foil (similar to other fictitious reports released by the government regarding &quot;weather balloons&quot; and &quot;swamp gas&quot;).The UFO seen by by friend and his co-worker may have been related to the other UFOs reported earlier in that same day.And, there may have been others who sighted it who did not report it for similar reasons to my friend and his co-worker not reporting it! (I doubt that this was an experimental military craft; why would it be flying so low over a heavily populated area?!  Experimental military craft are usually tested out over the desert, or ocean, away from people.) (As I have stated, this is just my speculation.) So, I would like to ask these questions: 1. Has anyone ever seen a UFO with characteristics similar to this, anywhere? 2. Does anyone know anything about news stories of UFO reports in 1967 near Griffith Park (in southern California) causing traffic jams on the Golden State freeway? (There have been many thousands of UFO reports throughout the past half-century or more, but this one seems to be a little bit different!)((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

No man made object could fly like this.The object was sighted from our moving car on US HWY 10 E.  The object was sighted in the southern direction against the sky and some sharp hills (or mountains).  It was dusk so the light was dissapating.At first we noticed a black spec in the sky miles away that seemed to be moving.  The object would seem to hover, then accelerate at abnormal speed, slow down and would rapidly change direction at high speed. At times it would dissapear, then we would see it again in a different spot, at a different height.  The object then appeared to be silver and more football shaped. The object was literally shape shifting as we watched. We saw tear drop shape, diamond shape, flat shape.  At one point the object faded from view and near its previous location we saw small white orbs dashing away from where it was hovering. I saw approx 3 to 4 orbs shoot out.  They kind of fish-tailed around really fast and then faded.  Then the object re-appeared, silver again and blimp shaped.  It was on one side of these sharp hills in the distance and seemed to be dancing around in all directions, like it was teasing us.  For a while it seemed really close to the hills almost like it was teathered. The hills had to be miles away.  We travelled far enough that we could no longer see the side of the hills that it could have been teathered to and it appeared at the opposite side of these hills.  If this were some sort of blimp teathered to the ground somewhere, it would have been impossible for us to see it from both angles. We video taped the object but because of the color of the sky mixed with us being in a moving car it is almost impossible to see.  We did pull over at a truck stop and I got a picture of it with my digital camera.  At that point the object was fish shaped and did not move. If it were something floating or teathered that high up, surely the wind would have been blowing it around, but it was still, as if posing for us but too far away to see it clearly. After leaving truckstop it did dissapear from view completely as if it stayed near that area. ((NUFORC Note:  Helium-filled heliostat.  The photo shows the object quite clearly.

Also, the tight cirecle that was made could not have been done by any aircraft that I know except a helicopter or small ultralight which would have made noise considering the night was still with a slight breeze coming in from teh ocean, meaning any sound from the craft would have been audible. Also, the craft had the same appearnce of light from as it approached and flew away.

My husband was in the Navy on a aircraft carrier and he could not say that it looked like any known craft that he had ever saw.  It was pulsing with a shifting orange red light.  It made no noise what so ever, and moved very gracefully and slow, at the exact level in the sky, and what really was the clincher was that it seemed every dog in the neighborhood from all around us what barking. I mean we heard echo&apos;s of dog&apos;s barking near and far.  This all took place in at least a 5 min period.  I mean I had enough time to wake my husband after first seeing it and run back out onto the deck and we both watched it for at least another min. and a half until it went out of sight.", "It moved to slow. Like it was going to land.While I was sitting on the couch at work I heard a horrible loud humming noise. It got louder. As I went outside I noticed the lights started to flicker.

There was a white in the middle. Looked like the shape of a backwards C. I was black or dark gray. After about 8 minutes I couldn&apos;t see it anymore. I called my boyfriend and woke him up. He ran outside with me still on the phone. I saw it. I could hear that horrible noise over the phone. We were and are both in shock.About 7 to 10 minutes later I heard another humming noise. Sounded like a airplane, but just to be sure I went outside again. I believe it was a C-5.

My 65 year old mother lived just down the road from the hospital.  This particular night I finished my shift and left work at the usual time of 11:25 pm.  I drove the few minutes from the hospital to my mothers home.  I lived in the bordering state and she had babysat for my five month old son.  My mom and I had made plans to have her spend the night at my home so we could go shopping the next day.  I arrived at her home around 11:30 that night, collected my son and my mom and we headed out to my home.  It was a 15 minute drive from her home to my home.  The night was extremely clear, the sky filled with bright shinning stars.  We chatted as I drove, thinking of nothing more then the shopping trip we would be making the next day.  My normal route was a &quot;short cut&quot; driving on mostly secondary roads with very few houses, just open fields and a beautiful view of the night sky.  As I drove along, I noticed right in front of me, very high in the sky, it appeared to be up there with the stars in altitude, a multi colored lighted object.  It was flashing blue, red, green and bright white lights.  My mother, sitting in the front passenger seat also noticed it.  One could not help but notice it with all the flashing lights, it was so obvious in the night sky.  We both thought it was a airplane.  Then, quite suddenly, it was dropping from the sky right in front of us.  I abrupty stopped the car and we both looked and watched in horror as it dropped from the sky! We both still thought it was a plane, about to crash!  I sat watching with my hands over my ears.  I didnt want to hear the impact that I was sure was about to happen.  Maybe dropping is the wrong word to use, because this object was desending at a tremendous rate of speed. Then, as we watched, abruptly, just like on a dime, it stopped, hovering above two trees directly in front of us, on the right side of the road. One second, it was &quot;up with the stars&quot; and just a small object with lights, and withing 30 seconds, it was at tree top level right in front of us not more then 100 feet away.  The colored lights appeared to implode back into the object itself and now just brilliant white lights flashed.  It made a very soft, quite humming sound as it hovered just above the trees.  There were no other sounds of an engine or of any kind, except for this humming.  I was terrified, my hands shaking as I clenched the steering wheel, I was so afraid for all of us in the car, especially my infant son, asleep in his car seat in the back.  This object was absolutly huge!  Just tremendous in size!  It was saucer shaped, with some sort of dome.  Around the entire dome, we both could clearly see a panel of windows.  What we saw through those windows gave me nightmares for many years.  There were &quot;beings&quot; looking out at us!  They were not human in appearance.  I counted 5, my mother, until her death five years ago, swore she counted 6.  I do not know &quot;what&quot; they were, but they were not human beings.  From our view, we could see large oval black eyes, with big bug like heads attached to what appeared to be very thin necks with long thin arms.  My mother and I both thought they appeared to be grey in color.  The object hovered there in front of us and we sat frozen, watching it for about 5 or 6 minutes, then, suddenly from somewhere on the underbelly of this object, a bright, blue white light beam shot out at us, lighting the inside of my car like it was daylight!  This light was so bright, so brilliant, that it hurt our eyes and we both had to cover our eyes with our hands to avoid it!  It was so bright that the best way to describe it is to say it was just like the &quot;blue white light&quot; that one sees in a lightening bolt!  This beam kept the car lit up for a minute or two, then just as suddenly, it imploded back to the craft.  We took our hands away from our eyes and watched as it abruptly started to very, very slowly move, again, with no sound other then the quiet humming.  It moved above the car.  In terror, I started to drive, anxious to get the heck off of that secondary road and onto the highway to get home!  I was only about a quarter of a mile away from the main roadway.  As I drove toward the highway, the object flew just a slight distance ahead of my car and it was again, within our view.  It was almost like it was leading me to the main route.  I continued driving until I reached the highway.  The object was still directly ahead of us, and it had remained at the same altitued of tree top level.  I made a right turn onto the highway, it did the same.  It continued traveling just ahead of me, following the main highway.  We continued on for approximatly a mile and a half.  At that point, I had reached the left turn to go on the road to my home.  I turned, the craft continued, following the main route.  My home was just a few minutes away.  I got to my home and shut the car off and both my mom and I could still hear, faintly, in the distance the humming as the craft continued on.  I don&apos;t think either one of us actually slept that night, I was still shaking the next morning it was such a tramatic experience for us!  I felt compelled to notify someone about what we had seen.  The very next morning, I phoned the civil defense in a neighborring city.  I expected to be laughed at, I was not.  When I gave them my full statement of what had happened they informed me, that they had recieved thousands of phone calls from people that had witnessed the same sighting.  Some they informed me, had merely seen it high in the night sky but there had been many others, like me and my mother, that had seen it at a very close distance.  This event happened to me many years ago, but it is one that I will never forget! I have told hundreds of people about that evening, and I will continue to tell everyone that asks until I am no longer able to. There is life outside our little world, I don&apos;t understand the  why&apos;s and how&apos;s, but I know there is, I have seen it! I hope in your lifetime, you will see it also.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  We will attempt to establish a precise date for the event.

There may still be a windmill on the east side of the road that marks the place where this sighting occured.  We were on our way to a get-together out in the &quot;boonies&quot; at a friend&apos;s parents&apos; ranch.  It was very cold &amp; there were clouds of an impending snowstorm in the area. As we drove south, we saw a very bright light moving at a very rapid pace from south east toward the west. At first we thought it might be a low flying jet, (under the level of the clouds)but then noted there weren&apos;t any blinking &quot;airplane lights&quot;.  I pulled the car over on the side of the road to watch. In an instant the craft stopped in the sky (west of highway) &amp; remained stationary for maybe 10 seconds.  It then streaked eastward, moving faster than when we originally spotted it, hovered momentarily again &amp; then streaked back to the general area it first hovered in. After again hovering for maybe 10 seconds, a bright and wide beam of light shot down from the object toward the ground.  We could not see where the beam hit the ground because there are hills toward that direction at that point of the highway. We were pretty alarmed.  Then the beam shut off and just a few seconds later the object disappeared, reducing in size until gone, as if it had accelerated toward space (didn&apos;t move left or right/up or down). My reaction as driver was to get the H out of there.  I looked down as I put the car in gear &amp; the instrument panel on the dash indicated my car was overheated.  I turned the engine off &amp; popped the hood to check the radiator, with intentions of going to the windmill&apos;s stock tank for water. Upon inspection, there was no indication the radiator was overheating; I loosened the radiator cap to check.  Got back in the car &amp; the gauge was reading normal.  The entire event was very disconcerting.  By the way, it may be unrelated but the stretch of road between Gering &amp; Kimball had a number of underground nuclear missle silos located there.

We noticed that when it spun long ways slowy, it would also stop at once parrallel to the Earth&apos;s ground again. That&apos;s how we knew it was a controlled object and that the wind was not just moving it wherever. Not ever hearing about any UFO&apos;s that were cigar shaped, this took us completely off guard.

I was about 2 miles from stadium, standing outside listening to the music.  An object appeared coming toward me from the west at a level of about 3 telephone poles. It stopped directly over my head. The form was muted from city lights.  It flashed in sequence 3 different colored lights (can&apos;t remember colors) forming a triangle. It then proceeded 90 degrees from where it had came at light speed. It never made a sound! I have tried to pinpoint the date, one would think it easy to find out when the concert took place.  If you are interested and can find out when it was, please let me know.

I was on Fanshaw Park Road, heading west. I saw to the left of me, off the main road and in a sub-division known in London as Richmond Hill, a strange object. I saw a series of 3 lights in a triangular formation. I thought at the time, it was the lights from a radio tower but I never remembered seeing one there before. (I drove by this area for many years.)   What struck me as rather odd was how low this formation was and the absence of sound.  It seemed to be about 40 feet above the road (over double the height of a hydro pole).  Then I thought maybe it was a helicopter hovering over this area...but again, no sound.  Plus it was very steady, whereas a helicopter tends to hover and shift.  I remember nearly getting into a car accident because I slowed down and was trying to get a better look. Unfortunately the traffic was too heavy for me to turn around to check it out more thoroughly. The next day, I drove by the area and there was no radio tower...so I realized that this must have been an ufo sighting. The fact that it was low to the ground, the light was white and rather bright at the bottom of the ship caught my attention.  Also, it was dark above so I couldn&apos;t see the top of it, but I believe there were 3 lights coming from the bottom.  I think there may have been a fourth light but it was red, which is why I must have assumed it was a radio tower.  Unfortunately, I was traveling a good speed at the time so that detail was a bit hazy.  Plus it happened 2 1/2 years ago. I&apos;m sure I wrote this down in my journal.  But I&apos;m currently not living in Canada so I can&apos;t verify the details or the exact date.  I do remember the month because it was still warm enough to drive with the window down, which is why I found it so odd that there wasn&apos;t any sound.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

It was a sunny day at about 3:00 in the middle February.  Looking east through large picture windows, I saw what I at first thought was a helicopter at a distance of about 5 miles. What intrigued me was that for an object that I thought was the size of a common traffic helicopter, it was moving incredibly fast. After comprehending that a common helicopter could not move to quickly, I began to think it was something else.I observed it for about 5 minutes or more. It seemed to move forwards and backwards and up and down rather erratically, not with the motion that one would expect from a helicopter, certainly not that of an airplane. It appeared to be hovering in that it had no specific direction. Assuming that it was about 5 miles away, which would have put it over southern Bellevue, I estimate that its movements were limited to about 200 yards, but without any pattern to the movement. It moved sort of like an insect would.The object appeared to be black, with no discerbable shape. As mentioned, I observed it for about 5 minutes, perhpas more, then turned away.

I kept looking at it and as we got closer to it I could see it was flashing lights so I figured it was a plane. Then I thought it couldn&rsquo;t be a plane either because it was moving to slow. I rolled the window down and looked up at it as it was flying over us. I saw 3 distinct lights in a row that were brighter than any other flashing lights I&rsquo;ve seen. They were flashing from the right to the left one at a time but very fast. It reminded me of a police car lights on the top of the car.

However, the written report gives us a significantly different impression about the sightings than the telephoned report did.  During the telephoned report, we understood the witness to say that the object filled the vehicle with bright light, but she does not indicate that fact here. The object to the west that the witness alludes to we suspect may have been the star, Sirius.

I almost made my wife pull over on the off ramp to observe, but we continued until we found a safe place, but the view was obscured so we moved to another area all the times with the lights flashing.  We have never seen anything like this before also my car radar detector was going haywire, I reset it only to have it freak out again.

There is an airport nearby, but the only thing that could rise straight up and then over like that is a helicopter.

I am currently a U.S. civilian mechanic hired to do work on military craft in Texas. I will not go into any other details right now, but I have very interesting news for all of you. The sightings of triangular vehicles flying silently and slowly are real. They are not of alien origin, but rather U.S.A. made craft that must have some form of alien technology. These &quot;planes&quot; are truely remarkable, and they will be known publicly very soon. I had to sign a document (non-disclosure agreement) and can be terminated (and in the words of the agreement, &quot;removed&quot;)  I was shown 7 of the 16 currently in Texas, and was told there were MANY more, some in Northern California, Nevada and some in New Mexico. I witnessed them in flight, and was taught how to remove and replace a part that I had never seen before. I have been working on aircraft since I was 16, (roughly 30 years ago) and know many of the components used in most modern aircraft. This was NOT normal. It contained a blue fluid and must have weighed 600 lbs, yet was only 3 feet X 4 feet and about 16 to 18&quot; deep. It had a clear window about an inch sqare that you could see blue fluid inside of it, and the part had three progs on both ends. This part went into what was described as the Stellar Ignition Feed, and they called the part a Fuel Rod. The crafts themselves are BLACK. Not just black, but blacker than black. It&apos;s wierd I know, but you have never seen any black like this. Not only were there visible tiling around the craft, much like the space shuttle, but these were not tiles. It appeared to have a SKIN. A lifelike skin. I know this all sounds crazy, trust me I thought I was going crazy when I witnessed what these aircraft can do, but I will provide more detailed information later. I am currently off dute for three days, and need to contact some friends about this. I&apos;ll be back. PS: I am so glad I found your site.

I tool a picture of the Flatiron building.  The picture is normal, except for the huge ufo positioned in front of the sun, next to the building.

I live in a rural area and the house is used as a summer residence so my first concern was that the house might be on fire.  Since I knew no one was there I became somewhat amused that the orange glow grew brighter while a shaft of light seemed to emanate upward from the origin of the glow. I was home alone with my two year old son and I&apos;m also a member of the local volunteer fire department.  Since I was already situated so close to the scene I thought I would jump into my vehicle after checking on my son.  He was in a &quot;jumper saucer&quot; and could safely be left alone for a few minutes so I grabbed a fire extinguisher and headed outside for my vehicle. For whatever reason I did not feel that I should call in and report a possible fire. When I got back outside, the orange glow seemed to decrease however, the shaft of orange light intensified.  I honestly started to attribute this to the house being on fire and the main fuel source starting to concentrate the burn in the middle of the structure. As I headed to my vehicle to drive over the property, I looked over and saw that that the shaft of light had intensified and reached up to what I could best describe as a large rotating circular spoke similar to a wagon wheel as if I was viewing it on an edge which would make it somewhat of an ecclipse or oval shape.I entered and started my vehicle and drove down my driveway for a distance of approximately 300 feet. I stopped and the orange glow was still present.   At this point I was very aprehensive given that my son was alone in the house but I drove toward the neighbouring property where I could still see the light.

I expected to look up and see an airliner as I&apos;m not that far from John Wayne Airport. Shading my eyes from the sun (which naturally would have caused the shadow) I saw nothing North of the sun.

It was still there and still moving Nrth. But this time I noticed the shadow was circular/oval and huge. The freeway moves pretty much due North. The shadow was moving in a North/NorthEast direction and I noticed that the edges of the shadow were overlapping both side of the freeway. That meant that it was wider than eight lanes and a center divider of the freeway. Being in the printing industry, I know something about screen density and know enough about shadow to know the closer the ground is to the subject, the more dense the shadow. I would say the shadow was what would be called in the printing industry an 80% screen which means it was at a fairly low altitude. At that time, at the point on the freeway, the traffic was moving at approximately seventy and I would the shadow was doing a hundred and thirty to a hundred and fifty.

I then saw an object shaped like an egg but, slightly flatter, not really a saucer shape.  It had no sound, no lights, left no trail and could have been missed if not for the light from the moon.  It came from the north east, over the neighbors house, and headed to the south west.  It was barely above the power lines. It appeared to have a brushed aluminum appearance, with no seams. We both stopped and I said to my dad, &quot;Do you see that?&quot;.  He said, &quot;Uhh huh.&quot;  After the object passed over the house and was not in sight anymore, we went inside.  The strange thing about this incident is that we never spoke about it for five years, and my father does not remember the incident.  He does not deny the incident, he just doesn&apos;t remember, which is very strange.  In addition, I have no idea how long the incident lasted.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

We were dropping off our friend when the driver noticed this thing in the sky.  It was like a fireball only it was white with hints of blue, which indicate that Magnesium or Aluminum was being burned with possible traces of Copper.  The burning thing was huge and traveled very fast towards the ground.  It was far away, we couldn&apos;t tell how far, but we couldn&apos;t hear it.  The size of it would be the size of a pea held about 18&quot; from the face. We watched it disappear behind the treeline (trees were primarily spruce and birch).  Once it went behind the treeline, there was a quick flash of light.  No sound, no physical effects from it hitting the ground. We drove around, thinking that someone had shot a flare from a flare gun.  But, no one was up.  The temperature outside was about -10F or so, perhaps colder, so it&apos;s no surprise that no one was outside. The next day the radio news broadcast reported that a meteor had fallen somewhere outside of Anchorage and had been cleaned up by the military.  Anchorage is a little over 400 miles south of North Pole. This seems like a poor coverup for whatever really happened.", "Lites over head cut car lights and motor off.First, my dad was working nites at Edwards on our first guided missles, as was our neighbor.

When it got over us the lites on our car went out, the motor shut off. I got out and saw a light directly over head. After it passed the lites came on and mom started the car.

First thing i saw was a blueish ball of pulseing light trailing acroos the night sky very fast and high, this lasted for a few seconds, the sky was very clear no moonlight it was not a shooting star and it shot from south to north.My father did not see it so we just sat and talked for awhile then the next one came over, it was triangled in shape three bright lights one on each corner and a large one in the centre which was a warm orange color.I could not say what colour the ufo was ,but you could outline the shape clearly against the night sky and stars may be it was black. It made no sound and moved slow south to north like the other one, i think it must have been low because if high it would have been massive, we got up and watched this for about 10 minutes.My dad does not belive in any ufo`s but we allways speak about this, both of us have a good judgement in size from the space it took up from where we were standing may be 4 acres .Thats it and i`ll never no what it was but i keep looking.((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the wintess does not indicate that fact.

Well, last Friday, I began a trip across 6 states with my destination Moberly Missouri to see my beloved boyfriend.  As you can imagine, I was really anxious to check out the night skies as I travled across miles and miles of unpopulated, unpolluted, natural land........ and sky!!!!!!!!!  I had plenty of time to watch the sky day and night because I wasn&quot;t driving.  I spotted shadows behind clouds in the day that were a disk shape, dark in hue at least twice.  I saw one cloud that was moving the opposite direction than the other clouds, and this was definately not normal.  When we got into Missouri, we stopped in a small city by the name of Sarcosie, and I saw a dark bouish disc shadow moving around behind the clouds at a very low altitude.  I cannot explain any of the things I see...yet...but I swear that my accounts of what I see are ALL true.

The third light would flash then the others would flash in unison, over and over. Then the two middle ones flashed at the same time and the other two would follow in the same pattern.  Did not hear any engine until it had passed over and was still above us.  The sound was low, quite and did not sound like more than one vehicle.  The vehicle was pretty low.  The lights were very bright and big.  We all agree that it looked like a check mark shape.  The right side was longer than the left.", "LOW LIGHTS AND STRANGE OBJECT(S)  IN RURAL AREA AGAIN!  UNMISTAKEABLY STRANGE.We all saw white and green lights and an orange light.  My son&apos;s girlfriend was being picked up by her father.  We were all talking when I noticed lights to the south of our home in the dark, hilly area we live in rural NC.  It is the same area and direction we have seen two other unidentified sightings.  This time 5 of us saw it.  These lights appeared about 3/4 of a mile from our home.  Our home is up on a hill and down below is one other home with only a yard light.  These lights were beyond that home but in front of the next ridgeline.  There are no roads leading to that area, only timber land.  These white lights seemed to be coming closer towards us, still from a distance and then the lights appeared to be coming on up and down vertically, two sets side by side, very tall seeming, when we then saw green ones and then an orange one.  Then they started to fade into the west.  I went for my camera and tried to take a digital photo but it only shows a white light in the distance before it was comletely out of sight.  We have a yard light in the same direction, to the left, but this light was lower than that.  That tells us how low this thing was.  None of us can describe what it might have been but something definitely was there, AGAIN!

Great work you&rsquo;re doing! The reason I&rsquo;m writing is that I would like to report a UFO sighting, although I&rsquo;m not sure if you&rsquo;re the right person to receive it, as this incident happened in Germany several years ago. If you know of someone who is more interested in international sightings, feel free to pass this along.  I apologize in advance for all of the important information that will be lacking in this report, but I think you&rsquo;ll agree that every little piece of information contributes to the overall picture.I am completely at a loss as to the timing of this sighting.  I was in Germany from June of 1995 until the summer of 2001.  This happened sometime between &rsquo;96 and &rsquo;98.  That&apos;s as close as I can get to giving you the timing.I was a soldier stationed in Wuerzburg, Germany from June &rsquo;95 until August &rsquo;97.  I remained in Germany until 2001.  My friend and I often visited the Caf&eacute; Haupelshofer, a popular caf&eacute; downtown. One night, my friend was driving us to the caf&eacute; when he noticed an object in the sky.  He asked me &quot;Dude, what the hell is that?&quot;   I looked toward where he was pointing and saw a bright light in the sky.  I told him I didn&apos;t know what it was.  He asked me to keep an eye on it while he drove.  I was able to keep it in view continuously until we parked the car.  Stepping out of the car, it was still in view, about 75-80 degrees above us.  We walked the short distance to the caf&eacute;, keeping it in view the whole time.  It never seemed to move at all. We got to the Haupelshofer and stood outside in the alley to the left of the caf&eacute; watching this hovering light for approximately ten minutes.  As we stood there, several German pedestrians would pause for a moment as they walked by us, looked up and wondered aloud, &quot;Was ist das?&quot; (What is that?) before continuing on. It was a clear night with plenty of stars in the background.  The whole time, the light never moved in the sky.  By contrast, there were airplanes crossing the rather narrow field of vision. We were in the alley close to the corner of Sanderstrasse, so the streetcar tracks were right behind us, looking up at the strip of sky between the buildings.  The light was basically centered in this narrow piece of sky, and planes flying much higher than this object were crossing in the background.  It was obviously not a plane, nor a blimp or balloon.  It COULD have been a helicopter, only it was low enough that had it been a helicopter, I&apos;m sure there would have been sound, but there was none. All I could see of it was a single, bright, white light - I couldn&apos;t see any hardware. It wasn&apos;t very high up, but higher than the altitude of the average hot air balloon.  If I held an object up at arm&apos;s length to hide it from view, I could probably hide it with a dime. We could not positively identify the object, so by definition, it remains a UFO. Eventually we got tired of staring at this light, just hovering in place, and we entered the caf&eacute;.  When we left, we paused in the alley and looked up, but the light was gone. Unfortunately, I don&apos;t have more specific details to give you.  Interestingly, I found a picture of some folks eating breakfast at the caf&eacute;.  If you look at the picture, you&apos;ll see four windows behind the people.  My friend and I were standing just outside of the two windows on the right hand side when we watched the UFO.  I&apos;ve also included a rough sketch of the view looking up at it. I hope this is something you can use.

We were less then 1/2 mile from our house when I noticed two glowing orbs of light near the telephone pole.  One was red and one was blue.  I screamed for my mom to stop the car.  She slowed down and pulled off to the side of the road.  We watched as the lights bounced around in the air and floated beyond the tops of the trees to where we couldn&apos;t see them.

I called my friend out to see what I was seeing. This person thought it was a plastic bag, but I pointed out it was up to high. After watching it for a few minutes my friend decided it wasn&apos;t a plastic bag, that maybe it was a weather balloon. I didn&apos;t agree with that either. We kept watching it and we noticed it was changing shapes and the speed varied, at some points it even seemed like it was staying in one place. It was going towards the sun. We got some binoculars and noticed it had something orange in the middle of it. It got closer to the sun and then disappered into the sun but about a minute later returned on the other side of the sun and stayed in one place. I went to get a camera to take a picture and my friend stayed outside to keep watching, when I came back out in less then 30 seconds it was gone.It never reappeared. I don&apos;t know if it was an ufo but don&apos;t know what else it could have been. We called the weather station to see if any weather balloons or anything else was in that area. The answer was no.

While we were still in the Cleveland area around 9:10 p.m. when we saw a quick green flash in the sky,like bright green lightning, we assumed it was a light from the airport nearby and didn&apos;t think too much of it. As we were continuing home, around 10:30 p.m., north of Akron on the highway with fields all around us, there was another flash, but this one was much brighter, like we were closer to what had happened before. The bright flash of green light lit up the whole sky like a green sun. My one friend and I both had our eyes closed in the back-seat when we were both startled by a bright green flash that shined through our eyelids like a flashlight. When we opened our eyes we saw the green sky and we both saw a white floating ball (light?) cross the road several hundred feet in front our car.  The other 3 passengers (including the driver) saw the bright green light. The light lit up the inside of the car so much that the driver couldn&apos;t even see his dash lights. The passengers that had their eyes open the entire time didn&apos;t see the white object moving across the road because they were all temperally moon-blinded from it going from the bright green to the black sky.

We lived on a small farm that was a quarter mile from the nearest neighbor and almost a mile outside of the closest town.  I was ten years old and was outside at the end of our driveway waiting for the school bus to pick me up.  My only sibling, an older sister, was ill that day so I was alone.  That morning was notable because it was the first school day after the &quot;Spring Forward&quot; adjustment of the clocks and it was therefore darker than I was accustomed to.  Although it was &quot;twilight&quot; there was still enough light to see the barn, the cars and the fields around me.  I was oriented to the east and was facing the road.  I was watching the sunrise as I waited.  I then had a feeling that &quot;I was not alone&quot; and looked over my shoulder to the north.  Hovering maybe fifteen to twenty feet off the ground was a sphere with a number of lights on it.  It was bigger than a basketball but smaller than a beachball.  It seemed metalic and orange, white and lavender lights seemed to eminate from it although there didn&apos;t seem to be any bulbs or lenses.  When I first saw it it was still and maybe twenty five yards away.  It began, slowly, to move toward me until it was only ten feet away and ten feet off the ground.  I was not afraid.  I don&apos;t remember feeling anything, not even curiosity.  It stopped moving but seemed to turn or roll but not on an axis.  It seems that I looked at it for ten or fifteen minutes but I have no recollection of its departure, nor do I have any recollection of getting on the bus.  The next memory that I have is of sitting on the bus and being several miles from my house.  Over the years I have thought about this incident many times.  The facts that I have given here are directly from my memories.  There are other &quot;memories&quot; that include me being aware of a larger ship hovering in the distance beyond our barn, but I can&apos;t be sure that this isn&apos;t embellishment that occured over time.  I did tell my family about this but it was received with a &quot;Oh, okay.&quot; reaction.  I didn&apos;t tell my friends or anyone else until I was in my twenties.  The first time I talked of it, probably fifteen years after it happened, I experienced a strangely powerful emotional reaction that had me shaking and close to tears.  I have never had such a reaction since when either thinking of or talking about that day.

It swung the back around but it stayed keeping the light focused. It was light in fog not solid beam or anything. Then the 2 front lights dissappeared and left the back 1. I didnt hear any sound which is strange for how close it was. Then after 30 sec. it looked like it exploded in mid air. Around this time I kept hearing like distant gunshots and I though damn its a car chase and shootout. But the circle. It was round red with a yellow smaller circle inside of it I mean perfectly round. It looked like is stretched out fast not appeared. It stretched from nowhere. It stayed for like 20 seconds or so and I stared at it. And it was almost behing a big tree in my neighbor across the streets yard. But i could see it well. I looked away or blinked or something. it was gone but a light slowly drifted behind the tree. I had seen 4 military jets earlier in the day. MacDilll is south of us or something maybe north. not super far or anything. and it was odd. After the circle I saw jets really high up blinking red and orange. going back and forth 3 or 4 times.

However, there was a craft hovering over the road at about the level of the tree tops.  I saw a blue light on the left and a red one on the right.

A white light on each end and a red light in between and slightly above the other two.  The craft glided off.  I believe it realized that I was watching because it had been completely motionless as I approached and drove underneath it.  It did not appear to be a large craft.  Perhaps only about ten to fifteen feet across.  I did not hear an engine but my windows were up and the radio and heater were on in my car.

It flew &quot;down&quot; our radar beam (descended towards our ship), overflew us and then exited on a reverse profile, disappearing at about 300 miles again.

I also read the book about the incident at Bentwaters, and many others on the subject.   I experienced one other sighting which I believe is worth mentioning.

I got my 10X binoculars from the truck and steadied my view of the lights by leaning against the cabin. Under magnification, I could see a disk shaped object in the western sky. It reminded me of watching the tail lights of a distant car, because I was able to see an object amidst the lights. As I watched, it seemed that the lights weren&apos;t just flashing, but where actually rotating around the exterior of the object. There also seemed to be a haze or gas around it.

I could just make out circular patterns on the underside of the craft, one large ring or circle in the middle and smaller circles at each corner.  I estimate each of the  three equal sides were around 100 feet in length. The black craft was very low, just over the trees, making no noise that I could hear. The first thing that occured to me when I saw the black triangle was that it was man made, some sort of top secret black stealth.  There are air bases, NASA, Lockheed Martin and government agencies dotted around the Northern Virginia and Washington DC area.I can understand why a black stealth would fly low, to evade radar, but why would a top secret aircraft fly or hover over a city so early in the evening while people are out and about?  This black triangle looks more advanced than any man made aircraft I&apos;ve seen before, perhaps the fact that it looks alien provides a cover in itself.  How many witnesses of the black triangle would risk telling others about their sighting?  The risk of losing credibility from a black triangle sighting will keep many quiet, others may get labeled as UFO weirdos, perhaps the government is counting on this as part of the Black Stealth&apos;s cover.

We got out of the van and started walking the trail hand in hand,it was about 5 mins into the walk i wanted to return to the van, My husband jokingly asked &quot; why are you scared a bear&apos;s gonna get us?&quot;  I said &quot;No, but , I really want to go to the van now okay&quot;{for some reason i was feeling uneasy, and not knowing why untill what was to come}We headed back to the van, sat inside and lite a cigerette, just sitting and visting and looking at the stars,i bent down looking for my cell phone to check the time when my husband said &quot; oh my god what is that!&quot;  I said, oh knock it off your not funny.&quot;Thinking that he was tring to scare me. But why I looked up to the direction he was looking I felt my heart racing and i started shaking.In front of our van, was this big light, it seamed to be bright white with color coming from the top and bottom the color seamed to be changing red, blue ,then yellow. the shape is hard to decribe but i&apos;ll do my best..  it looked like a ball with the top and bottom cut off and the top and bottom had a jagged appearence that is where the color was coming from this thig was a huge it seemed to be coming closer i got scared telling my husband, &quot;I want to go now&quot; he agreed i nervously turned our van around and speed out of the trails parking lot . my husband then said oh my god it&apos;s following us. I looked up and it was following us but it seemed to be a little ahead of us .Now when we first saw this thing it was facing northeast when we got home it stopped above our home and was facing south west. We ran into our home ,then after about 10 seconds we went out side and it was still there we starred at it and talking to each other about what the heck is it . Then it dawned on me i said &quot;honey our video camera&quot;. We taped it, we have it on tape 6 mins and 23 secs. long it changes shapes, turns transparent,and it turns into a full clear triangle before it disappears.  and our camera kept dying in the minute of taping i had to go in and charge the battery a few times we that that was odd as well on the sighting . the next morning we woke up with unexplained cuts and bruises on our face and feet.We have our tape in a safe place no copies where ever made,We are just waiting for the right oppertunity to share it with the world. signed , still amazed.", "I was on the 5th floor of the hospital in the room with my grandmother who was dying. She died at approx 4 pm. Other family members were also at the bedside. I turned to the window sobbing and was looking to the southwest. There were large cummulus white clouds in the sky.  While I was looking out the window to the sky I saw a pewter gray round object flying through the air. I almost turned to say , &quot;Look, look!&quot; but the object entered a cloud and I decided not to. Then I saw it exit the cloud and and cross the sky and enter another cloud and I no longer saw it. It came from my left and was about the size of a half dollar and got smaller as it climbed into the clouds. It was completely smooth, round like a ball bearing and had no markings.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

After about 10 seconds of traveling north, a shooting star streaked in the northbound objects path.  When we looked back at the east bound object, we could not see it.  The northbound object went behind some trees at which time we were no longer able to see it. Neither of these objects had any flashing lights and were easily distinguishable from planes that were in the sky last night.

It was flying staight across the sky and was at about a 30 degree angle . It was a clear day with no clouds in the sky . It was flying faster than anything I&apos;ve ever seen . It was also larger than anything I&apos;ve ever seen in the sky .", "My daughter and I were in the hottub, looking at the sky. There were 2 objects gray in color flying west to east pretty fast. They had very very dim lights. They were squareish ovalish.", "Trianglular object with blue lights seen with binoculars and telescopeI first saw what I thoguht was a plane comming up from the treeline--almost exactly southwest, maybe 3 degrees more south.  It first caught my attention moving backward down too the treeline again.  I started looking, following it with my unaided eye it came back up to the same spot about 10 degrees over the treeline.  It then moved left to me, a southwardly direction, 10-15 degrees.  This was the point where I started wondering and got binoculars (16x32 power).  It was triangular with blue lights, my hands were not steady enough to tell then where the lights would be on the object.  It looked like a stealth bomber the best I could tell at this point. By this time I really wanted to know what it was out there.  I had my telescope by the door because I had planned on using it tonight.  It is a 130mm reflector, with a 25mm eyepiece in when I grabbed it.  I got it out and on the object.  It was an isosceles triangle with blue lights on what would be the sides of the wings if it was a plane.  After I got the scope on it, I had to follow it back to the tree line.  The scope was set at 2 arch seconds at first, and that was not fast enough.  I had to change the speed of the scope, but I had lost it below the treeline before I changed the speed on the scopes mount.", "Small sphere, moving very fast to the west, directly under my aircraft, 3,500 feetFlying alone in a private aircraft, I was inbound to Phoenix, approaching from the southwest, just south of South Mountain, at the eastern tip of the mountain range.  I was at 3500 feet.  Something approached the plane -- I got a sense of speed before a sense of it&apos;s shape -- from the right front quarter.  It darted right under the plane, I would say at about 15 to twenty feet below me.  At first I thought it might be a bird, and was alarmed.  A bird strike, even in a small plane, could do some serious damage.  I quickly looked to my left and saw the object.  It was a sphere, about the size of a large softball, or maybe a bit smaller than a basketball.  It was pale yellow in color, and it was moving very fast, in a horizontal path, not diving, or climbing.  It disappeared to the west very quickly.  I lost it on the horizon.  I told myself it had to have been a bird, but no bird moves that fast.  Even with combined closing speed (I was only doing 90 knots indicated -- about 103mph) a bird would not have looked like it was going that fast.  I had to collect myself and fly the plane, I was about to enter busy airspace, so I had to think about other things.  Very strange.", "large triangular craft with 16 glowing round disks from belowEvening in the city - though I was amazed to see stars when I looked up.  I saw a large triangular shape glide effortlessly across the sky. It appeared to be extremely high -- as though it were a plane and not a bird, and had several (16 or so) lights/circular shapes underneath. No aircraft I know has so many or so large and round shapes glowing from beneath. There was no flashing light like on regular planes. It glided quickly, from west to east and disappeared.", "Cigar-shaped  craft flew slowing and at a low level directly over the back road I was traveling and right over my me.It was just before 7:00 pm as I was headed for a library board meeting in my town.  I turned out of my driveway onto our dirt road and saw what I thought was a low-flying plane flying directly over our road which is straight.  I thought this strange and when it continued toward my flying low over the road, I got out of my car to watch it ffly over me.  I still thought it was an aircraft of some sort.  When it was pretty much directly overhead, I saw that it was not a plane at all, but an oval shaped craft with lights on the bottom.  I felt I was seeing something out of the ordinary and had a horrible thought that I might be somehow beamed up.  I jumped back in my car sped to the library.  The craft continued flying low but made a 90 degree angle, which I am sorry to say I did not see, but the craft was headed in a perpendicular direction when I finally looked.  I cannot remember if I heard any sound coming from the craft or not. I am a primary school teacher and not prone to flights of fancy.  When I got to the library, I told them that I thought I had almost been abducted by aliens and they good-naturedly laughed.  The story came up at a family party this weekend with people who were encouraging.  This is the reason it has taken so long for me to report.", "Star sized object was spotted in the night sky.At around 4:33 in the morning, my dad and i saw  a spherical object about the size of a star in the night sky.The object passed over us from West to East.The object was moving at a medium speed pace.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))", "English words identified on black triangular craft.On 04-09-2005 I saw what I believe to be a UFO in Comanche County Texas at 9:12 local time.  I offer some unique observations. That evening, I was walking back to my motor home after wildboar hunting in an unpopulated area that I lease for hunting.  The sky was clear; wind calm and the sun had just set.  The sky was growing darker and darker blue straight above and stars were beginning to show.  The sky was becoming black in the east.  The setting sun was still keeping the western horizon illuminated and indirect lighting from the west made it possible to see my way without a flashlight. I had my .243 Win. Remington 700 varmint rifle of which I am a quite an accomplished shooter.  It is considered a &quot;high-powered&quot; rifle.  I do quite a bit of bench rest competitive shooting with it as well as hunting.  The rifle is set up with a high-tech &quot;Leupold&quot; optical sight, (scope) which is extremely accurate and highly specialized for great light gathering ability and performs best in low light conditions.  It is not what is called a &quot;night vision&quot; sight.  The scope magnifies the target image with great sharpness and definition and the magnification is adjustable from 4.5 to 14 times that of the natural image.Upon my return to the motor home, I was tired after a long walk.  I had carried quite a bit of equipment with me.  I sat on a chair, took my eyeglasses off and toweled my face as it is already becoming hot in Texas.  While I rested, without my glasses on, I noticed three very &quot;unfocused&quot; lights to my south and these lights were moving toward me.  Immediately I put my glasses back on and saw what I believe was a UFO.   (SEE ATTACHED ANIMATIONS) (a)  Is the appearance of the vehicle without my glasses on and (b) is the view I had with my glasses on.)  (I drew the images on my pc)  The object approached from the south-southwest and while moving north-north east, passed almost directly overhead making no sound whatsoever.  I estimate its altitude to be somewhere about 800 feet and its airspeed speed approximately 30 mph.  It &quot;floated&quot; and did not fly as it obviously had insufficient airspeed to fly.  (I am a Physicist &amp; an FAA Licensed Pilot)  While the sky was almost entirely black behind it, I could clearly see its underside as it was illuminated from the fading sunlight to the west.  I estimate that the machine was about 60 feet wide and 80 feet long and 10 feet thick at the rear.  Under its belly, there was a straight line going from its leading tip toward the center of the aft edge of the fuselage, which was perpendicular to its travel.  This straight edge clearly showed its shape to be three-dimensional.  The straight line showed that its belly was V-shaped, much like the hull of a speedboat.  It was similar to the space shuttle as when viewed from in front and below the shuttle. This machine was directly over me and I was alone in the middle of nowhere, therefore, I felt quite &quot;uneasy.&quot;  It made no threatening moves whatsoever, but I aimed my rifle at it and through the riflescope, which was set on 8.5 power, I could clearly see surface detail in explicit detail.  The machine&rsquo;s surface detail appeared to be covered with well-fitted tiles, much like the ceramic tiles used on the United States Space Shuttle.  Then in the fading light, I noticed a distinct marking. This marking was absolutely shocking, as I could actually read it!   It was white print outlined in black on a red arrow pointing toward a rectangle of sorts.  The arrow pointed at a something rectangular that I cannot define, but I clearly could read these three words, &ldquo;EMERGENCY RELEASE and RESCUE.&rdquo;  In the same place were other words that appeared too fuzzy to read.  I suspect that these words were &ldquo;PULL FOR...&rdquo;  Instantly I realized that this was a military machine and no &ldquo;flying saucer.&rdquo;  I felt much better as I knew that these were surface details that were intended to help rescue people access and then be able to remove the pilots on board in the event of a crash. I kept the crosshairs on the center of the aircraft as it disappeared into the darkness but as I realized it was &ldquo;one of ours&rdquo; and it was not a threat to my own personal safety (I think) I put the rifle safety back on.  I can see however that others may have &ldquo;defensively&rdquo; shot at it --- and that may have resulted in a crash of the vehicle. I am somewhat &ldquo;pissed off&rdquo; at the military as while this area is directly under the Ft. Hood, Texas MOPA and practice flights are flown daily, really - they should not be taking chances like this where someone on the ground could actually be shooting the damned things down!  I am sure that the military pilots (if it even had a crew&hellip;) were aware of my presence but they NEVER expected possible &ldquo;offensive action&rdquo; to be taken against them on this low level flight.  The last thing I would have ever have wanted would have taken a &ldquo;defensive&rdquo; shot and then find American military pilots onboard in the wreckage.((COMMENT FROM ONE OF OUR READERS))RE: your front page article on a &quot;Peculiar Military Craft&quot;FULL ARTICLE:  http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/043/S43465.html You (or the author of the incident ) probably mean &quot;Sidney&quot;, Texas.

As I reached 43rd I turned east towards 8th avenue. I live between 7th and 8th. Halfway down the block, I looked up into the sky, it was clear and I noticed a bright object making circles in the sky.  The light was a bright steady white.  I stopped and continued to watch as the circles that the object made tightened and at a speed that no air-craft I know of could make, not even a helicopter. Let me say that it appeared that the object as far as I can tell was at an altitude of several thousand feet, so that the circles it was making encompassed at the beginning, I would say aproximately a mile or so in diameter and doing this in just a few seconds, as the circles it made became smaller perhaps several hundred feet were being covered.  And this is what convinced me that this was no ordinary plane.  As I stood watching a man was walking towards me and I said out loud purposely to catch his attention &quot;Yes, no doubt about it, that is a U.F.O.&quot;  and I pointed.  But at that very   moment, before the man could turn around to look, it winked out!  And that was very strange.  Is it possible that this craft was aware of my observation of it from a relatively dark street below and did not want to be pointed out to others?  Have been interested in the subject of UFO&apos;s since childhood and this made me since that time a keen observer of the sky and what usually is in it.  This was like nothing  ever observed before and the nature of it&apos;s movement convinced me beyond a doubt that this was indeed an Unidentified Flying Object, since nothing I have ever seen or heard of when it comes to aircraft could have possibly duplicated what this object did.  That it was under intelligent control I have no doubt either.  Have seen balloons and other objects subject to wind currents many times in the sky, this was like neither of those.Remarkable that far from being in a remote rural location this happened right over mid-town Manhattan!   Will submit a graphic image of the observation soon. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible landing light on an airliner approaching local airport?

The first one was around 10.20PM and it was a pattern like a large swept-back wing, without a fuselage. The pattern was symetrical and I thought it looked like an advertising plane with lights on the wing. Only problem was that it was too large and silent. Only the single points of light in formation were visible. Then around 10.30-10.35 there was a skalene triangle formation of 3 lights flying across the sky in a southward direction. They looked like fighter jets in formation from the apparent speed and distance. The span of the formation was about 1 inch at arms lenth.  There was some other normal air traffic, but on the aircraft you could make out multiple lights as well as the body of the plane. The light formations observed were white and single points. I then saw a linear formation of 3 lights head north. A little while later a single light head south. That was the last one I saw. All the lights were too far apart to be a single airplane, although they kept perfect formation. Straight line travel,  no turns that I saw. From the way they faded when heading toward the horizon I would guess they were quite high. Too fast for a satelite, plus this was downtown and a satelite would be too dim. I estimate they were traveling 30 degrees of arc in 5 second when overhead.((NUFORC Note:  Source elects to remain totally anonymous.

PD))", "Flying Saucer: August 1967-A Teen&apos;s ObservationI realized recently that I have never written about this event or an in depth report anywhere.  A few years ago, I went to a site about UFO sightings and left a very brief version of it, but nothing more than a few paragraphs and it was incomplete. It seemed that everytime I began writing about it in full detail, it sounded like a bad screen play for a &quot;B&quot; sci-fi movie. Now, I have decided to recall and record as much detail and as many of the impressions that I can remember.The Summer before I entered High School was when the experience occurred, it was a week or so before school would start again. It was late in August 1967. I would 15 in a couple of weeks,  The closest I can calculate to the day would be August 24th, or 25th. There were only a couple of kids my age in my neighborhood. One was a cousin; the other was a friend who lived just down the street, two houses down and across the street. He was one year behind me in school, but we were close to the same age. I liked hanging around with with him but he had a mischievous side that my Mom did not trust and our time together was always limited.  One summer afternoon he asked if I could camp out in his yard and followed up by his Mom providing the assurance to my Mom that it was alright. Curiously, and in a very unaccustomed flexibility, my Mother said &quot;Yes&quot;.  So, after dinner I ran down the street a few houses, crossed the street and starting hanging around with my friend and his younger brothers in their back yard.  I found out the plans had changed and we were going to sleep in his tree house instead of a tent. His brothers were going to use the tent, a small detail my Mom could be spared.An uneventful evening began to unfold. Earlier in the evening I went back to my house. My parents were gone someplace. I went into their bedroom and removed my Dad&apos;s pocket watch from his bureau. One I&apos;d given him for Father&apos;s day once. It had a radium dial which would glow in the dark. Then, went back to the treehouse. At one point his Mom came out with some snacks. It was shaping up to be a good night, Steve was being unaccustomedly polite to his Mom, a detail that gave me a sense of confidence that nothing was going to go wrong. As fun as Steve could be, I also had a bit of suspicion about him. He had a knack for practical jokes and doing unpredictable or dangerous things. We each had a flash light, enough light for us to play game after game of &quot;Fish&quot; or &quot;Rummy&quot; or &quot;Poker&quot; for pennies. As it got darker his brothers went inside at the behest of their Mom when it seemed they could no longer get along nicely. This was about 10pm.  Our goal then was to stay up as long as possible.  Since we never got the chance to hang out a lot we did a lot of talking. There were questions about my extended family...mostly the girls...an inventory of how I was related to this person or another, and  the same questions from me about him.Staying awake past 1 AM was not difficult.  Another two hours passed of playing cards and snacking. About three AM we were both getting sleepy. ((name deleted)) had to use the bathroom and went into his house and was out in a few minutes. In the mean time, I snuggled down into some light bedding and I was ready to sleep. When ((name deleted)) returned, he was as full of energy as ever and was standing up in the tree house looking out over the wall commenting on how many stars he could see.  It was a safe structure, the walls came up to our chests but there was no roof and the old tree it was in just had some major branches. No leaves grew on this tree, it was mostly dead and we had an unobstructed view of the sky above us at all times.After just a minute, ((name deleted)) thought he saw something while looking at the stars.  From him...&quot;Gah! What is THAT?&quot;  &quot;Get up and look at this..there&apos;s is something FLYING around out here.&quot; ..  I was ready to sleep and didn&apos;t want to get up. I was reminded of ((name deleted))&apos;s penchant for practical jokes and could imagine his riducule if I had jumped up in amazement, I could imagine the story that would be told. I was stubbornly not taking the bait...&quot;I&apos;m asleep.&quot; I said.From him: &quot;No, no...you&apos;ve got to SEE this, it looks like a flying saucer or something!&quot; with a hushed but very excited tone.Me: &quot;Uh-Huh&quot;...&quot;You know jets fly around here all the time&quot;.True enough, Seymor Johnson Air Force Base in Goldsboro, N.C. was only 12 miles away, and my Dad worked there as a Civil Servant. Low flying jets were not uncommon night or day.From him: &quot;No, no!&quot;  &quot;Get up..Get up...this is really weird!&quot;  By now, I was getting curious...he said he saw something flying, but I heard no noise. How could this be? I knew he might be doing another one of his practical jokes. If I jumped up in alarm...he could tell the story for the next two weeks of how he&apos;d tricked me. Slowly, I got up and pretended to not be interested.&quot;What?&quot;...from me in a calm tone.Him: &quot;Look it&apos;s over there!&quot; And he pointed in the direction of the end of the street. Directly to the east.Me: &quot;I thought you said it was flying around&quot; (At first I didn&apos;t see anything.)  Him: &quot;It was...it&apos;s over there now.&quot; pointing low, not high in the air but down the street in a low trajectory just over the trees. We could see the houses and trees and other things not darkened into shadows by a few of street lights and it was not a completely pitch black night either. The moon was out. I noted it was about 3:15am by looking down at my Dad&apos;s glowing pocket watch. Down the street and across the road was another street, not exactly a continuation of our street, but a slight jog over. At the end of that street and not very high over the trees was a craft I could see but I wasn&apos;t certain of the distance or scale. It was ovoid in shape with only a few lights that didn&apos;t seem spectacular or unusual for any flying air craft. It wasn&apos;t moving but hovering in the same way a helicopter would hover.  I thought I was looking at the body of a helicopter head on without the benefit of being able to see the side or rear. The shape was like a bubble that was flattened on the bottom.I said: &quot;It&apos;s a helicopter&quot;...Then, as soon as I got the words out of my mouth, I realized I was wrong. The object was closer than I had thought and a helicopter would be making noise, a lot of noise at that distance. The familiar &quot;beating&quot; of the air sound was not present and at this distance, it would have been a very noticeable sound, instead, there was no sound. It was only two &quot;short&quot; blocks away.  This is when I really started looking to see what it was.  It continued to float without motion or sound but only for a few seconds. Then, it started moving in a straight line parallel to the street it was over and in our direction. We were mesmerized, mostly I think, because we didn&apos;t know what it was or wasn&apos;t. We didn&apos;t think to be scared and it held our attention out of curiosity, We watched it wondering what it was going to do next. The shape and size of became more clear as it approached our area.It crossed the road at the end of our street, then it continued moving slowly until it was over an empty lot beyond the first house on our street. Then it slowed down seeming to drift. By now, the shape was distinct, and very much like a saucer or shallow bowl turned upside down with another saucer under it for a bottom.  The path it was taking was directly in line above the houses across the street from us. It drifted over the first house.  It drifted over the next house, the house that belonged to an Aunt and Uncle. It continued and drifted over my house the third on the street. It slowed down and stopped right over my house. It was amazingly low. Only 75-100 ft. overhead. Then it moved forward again to the next house, the fourth house on that side of the street. I don&apos;t remember Steve and I saying a word by now, somehow thinking that if we breathed wrong it would give away our position. By now it was almost directly across the street from us, diagonal by only the width of one lot.  I could begin seeing some of the details more clearly. It was not the flashing light show many people report, just a couple of small lights in the front and the same near the back. It was about the size of two small houses. I&apos;d say 80 ft. end to end. There was some sort of structure that zigzagged across a segment of the upper domed portion, like a system of trapezoids, alternating in inverted shapes. This structure appeared to suggest windows, but there were no windows, just more of a segmented ovoid panel outlined in trapezoids in spaces where windows should be.After a few seconds, the object floated backwards over my Aunt &amp; Uncle&apos;s house again and came to rest. It was high enough that I could see some of the under structure but low enough I could see the profile also. While floating there, a hatch slid open on the bottom which was evident by the light was visibly appearing from inside and projecting toward the ground. (The light was already on when the hatch opened.) The hatch was squarish and off center from the the bottom of the craft and this light from the inside appeared to create a shaft of light onto my Aunt &amp; Uncles&apos; house. Then the craft moved forward and became stationary again over my house with the shaft of light illuminating our roof. After a few seconds, the light appeared to flicker and the squarish shaft of light went out. A few seconds passed and another light flickered back on except this time, it was a different shape, not the  shaft of a light formed from the hatch opening, but a tighter and more &quot;focused&quot; light and it seemed to have movement, not the stationary light as before. From the hatch the source of the light then began a small sweeping and circular motion around my house, lighting up the back yard and it&apos;s immediate vicinity. Then the source of the light protruded from the hatch. It reminded me very much of the kind of search light that people used to mount on their cars. It began to pivot. It behaved as though it was on an articulating mechanical arm. The light started making circles around my yard and house and then in deliberate swinging arcs.  The light began swinging outward toward the neighboring houses and then across the street. It arced back and forth, sweeping it&apos;s light further and further away from it&apos;s location with each pass. ((name deleted)) and I stared silently and dumfounded.  In a couple of arcs, it was swinging it&apos;s light into the parking lot across from where we were, which co-incidentally was the parking lot for the municipal swimming pool.  We watched as the light continued to swing and then the light hit the fence for the swimming pool and the arcs continued sweeping wider and further out.  I could tell that soon the sweeps would extend to reach our location, and right after that the light began to swing near the edge of ((name deleted))&apos;s yard. I was beginning to feel a little frightened. On the next sweep the light made it&apos;s way toward us but before it arrived I ducked behind the wall of the tree house with my back against it. My friend however continued to stand there with his usual insensibility to danger. I remember looking up and seeing the tree we were in being lit up and my friend stood there squinting into the light, his hands still holding the top edge of the wooden tree house wall. The light did not appear to be of unusual brightness, but it had a bluish cast. By now, it was no longer swinging back and forth but fixed on our location. My friend appeared slack jawed above me and he was not looking away.I said: &quot;Get down!,&quot; but he continued to stand there almost frozen and he began mumbling something I couldn&apos;t understand. Not wanting to desert him, I decided I would stand up. I looked at my father&apos;s glowing pocket watch again. It was 3:20 AM.I stood up and looked over the wall that came up to my rib cage. In the time that I was below the wall, the source of the light had changed. Rather than being the sweeping spot light from under the craft, it was coming from a smaller light that was emanating from the edge about one third of the way from the front.  I remember thinking thinking it could be some kind of bizarre craft from Seymour Johnson with Air Force personnel in it. I was a little worried that word of the event might get back to my father, but then I thought, &quot;We haven&apos;t done anything wrong&quot;... we never even left my friend&apos;s yard that night. So I stood there confident that what was going to follow was not going to result in my getting into trouble. There was no sound from the craft, it was continuing to hover.Then, another light came on near the other one and it began to point more directly at me. This light had a quick flickering quality as with some kind of semaphore or a pattern. I remember thinking, &quot;I will NEVER forget this.&quot;  Then the lights flickered off.The next thing I recall clearly was sitting down in the tree house and again looking at the glow of the pocket watch. It was 3:45am. Twenty five minutes had passed. Then we stood up again to see the vessel continuing to float. I could then hear a low whining sound, it sounded as though some kind of momentum was building but it was very quiet.Then the vessel began to pivot. Still parallel to the ground it just turned away and it began to move off directly to the north with a slight gain in altitude. There was a purplish discharge of light around the entire vessel at this point.  It moved slowly at first then instead of speeding away with a steady increase in speed...it made a sudden leap and it was only slightly higher in the sky and about 500 hundred yards away.  Then moved off faster for a second or so, then it made another leap in speed and distance which would have placed it at the altitude of a low aircraft.  It appeared to be bright object in the sky at this point moving off quickly. Then it made another leap. This time, it made a long bright arc away from where it was. The bright arc went high and to the west and then it was gone. In all, this took about ten seconds for this sequence to pass. All of this without any sound other the low whining sound during it&apos;s initial ascent. There was no sonic boom, no sound of turbines, or an engine of any kind. An ordinary jet would have created a heavy sonic boom and this thing was flying faster than any jet I had ever seen.My friend and I stood there in astonished silence. I remember ((name deleted))&apos;s hair literally standing up on end and every time he touched it, it crackled with static. He said mine was the same way and my hair crackled as I ran my hand through it. This went away after a minute or so. Incredibly, we went to sleep after that.The next day, both of us remember feeling powerless to relate what we had seen, but this didn&apos;t stop my friend.  He thought we should be telling everybody we saw. I didn&apos;t. He began telling everybody about the siting which brought the predicable disbelief, which was also projected onto me now. He also had a reputation for exaggeration and now, the more detail we related was followed by an equally heightened disbelief by the listeners. He would have been the epitome of an unreliable witness by all past accounts, but this time...he was right.We didn&apos;t talk about the event very much.  About a week later, school began. When he would see me he would begin telling the story and asking me to verify it. My verification amounted to little. I was going in to the 9th grade, he was going in to the 8th and I thought the best thing I could to maintain any credibility as a 9th grader was not to talk about it. The event then served to separate us, rather than creating a bond.I fell silent about the event. I might occasionally mention I had seen a UFO when television began to popularize the topic during the 70&apos;s, but I never related any details. Even saying I had seen a UFO brought the usual scorn and disbelief. I did nothing to convince anyone of what I had experienced.I kept the experience to myself for a long time. Never talked about it. I would see so called pictures of UFO&apos;s in newspapers and discounted them as valid because they did not look like the one we saw. At that time I was not prepared to believe that anything other than the type of vessel we had seen was authentic. My senior year of High School, I did see and article in a newspaper with a photograph of an object much like the one we saw. The photo was taken in Norway. I have seen footage of a UFO shot in Mexico that seemed remarkably similar in the past few years. By some accounts, the craft I saw was not sensation. It didn&apos;t blink, or spin, or bounce and weave. It floated and flew off at great speed, sometime reports would have similar details.About 25 years after the event, I made it a point to find my friend who is still living near our home town. Something was drawing me toward the idea that if I could write about it effectively, perhaps some of the scorn might have waned since there was growing number of reports in the media.  When he and I talked, the details matched just as we had lived them years ago. We never talked about the missing time, he seemed uncomfortable to go any further.  So was I.I did find moon data on that night to verify how much ambient light there would have been since the object was not initially emitting any light until it left.

I saw several (could have been up to 15) large lights in the skies driving in an area of about 5 miles; I saw these lights everywhere in the sky all of them spaced out evenly. Some were more lit than the others, and their lights appeared to be twinkling/flashing/pulsating, they seemed to be more or less stationary with slight movement.

I noticed that the larger light was either going round in small circles, it was definitely moving of some sort but I couldn&rsquo;t make out the formation of it&apos;s movement, as I was too far away. As I watched them for 10 minutes or so they all dimmed a little but they were still visible. The next day I told a few trusted people and they say they didn&apos;t see anything of the sort. I have never reported a UFO before and felt a bit confused that I was the only one who saw these lights; my only thought about this is did anyone else in my area see any of these lights?

I haven&apos;t seen a shooting star since I was really young and my memory was them appearing much smaller and obvious that they were far away. Anyway, I was smoking a cigarette leaning against the trunk of my car in the parking lot of my apartment complex about 10 miles south of downtown Nashville, TN at about 4am.  I was sort of looking up and relaxing (getting my mind off my work, as I work from home on my computer.)  I noticed the normal few stars you can see here with the naked eye (nothing like you can in rural areas, like Vermont where I&apos;m from.)  So I noticed the couple brighter ones, but not knowing much about them I can&apos;t tell you if the particularly bright one is Mars or the North Star or whatever. Anyway, I glanced down as I flicked ashes but at that moment a flash in my peripheral or something caused me to look up to my left...  But it was sort of in a way that you might look at a lower flying plane (we see them all the time because the airport is kind of close.  They aren&apos;t low enough to be really loud, just enough to spot their lights if you&apos;re out driving in the area, etc.)  Anyway, I sort of casually looked over.  And focused on a light which may or may not have been stationary when I first saw it (hard to remember this all happend in a matter of less than 5 seconds.)  Anyway, I realized in like a milisecond that it wasn&apos;t a plane because it was to far off, but at the same time didn&apos;t see to be &quot;in space.&quot;  It was sort of like a star&apos;s light, only softer if that makes sense.  Anyway, by the time I focused on it it shot acrossed a good percentage of the sky ridiculously fast parallel to the ground (from my vantage point.)  It&apos;s still hard to picture it moving that fast again, but I do recall somewhat of a &quot;streak.&quot;  Then all in those same couple seconds it disappeard.  But didn&apos;t fissle out, it looked as if it dissappeard behind a wall.  I also don&apos;t know if it was my imagination but the light seemd to be almost a soft white/blue color.  Not where you&apos;d be like &quot;wow that&apos;s flourescent blue&quot;, but I think you know what I mean. Anyway, my thought was, for it to have moved acrossed that much sky, as far out as space, it would have to have been moving ridiculously fast.  Obviously the closer an object would be, it move acrossed a &quot;chunk&quot; of sky more quickly.

I didn&apos;t have a car yet, so my mother would pick me up from night school around 9:00 pm. On this night, we were chatting as we took the back route home from my school. We were driving down Williamson Blvd, which is a long and twisting road that is rather undeveloped for the area, but the occasional apartment complex or convenience store can be found. Thick trees are on both sides of the road. I live in Ormond Beach, so Williamson was a straight shot to Hand Ave without having to stop at so many lights. It is a very well known street, and there were quite a few other cars on the road in both directions. As we were driving home, I looked out the passenger window to see these giant triangular air crafts flying low. I squinted and said, &quot;Mom, look at these planes. They are shaped funny.&quot; She couldn&apos;t look up until she came around the bend. When she glanced up at them, she slowed a little. &quot;Oh my god, they&apos;re black triangles. Is the government testing something new?&quot; She asked me. I shook my head, but didn&apos;t take my eyes off them. I counted four. I remarked, &quot;Look at how low they are flying. You&apos;d think that if they were testing something new they wouldn&apos;t do it here.&quot; My mom commented on the time of night, and the thick forestation on both sides. As I watched them, I noticed that they had a weird way of moving. Focusing on just one of them, it flew straight...then stopped....went backwards....then stopped...then to the side and stopped, all without changing the direction of the &quot;nose&quot;. At the blink of an eye they could go from being completely motionless to down the street. Going 45 mph. with only my window half down, there was no audible sound coming from the four planes. I thought that was extremely odd, considering how close we were to them. I saw one do a slow nose dive into the woods until I couldn&apos;t see it anymore. I was prepared to hear a blast, as I thought it was surely doomed. As far as I&apos;ve ever known, those woods are completely blanketed with trees, but I&apos;ve also heard there are also small retention ponds somewhere in there too. Apparently, there must have been a clearing back there for the plane to go down like that, only to emerge a few seconds later unscathed. To the best of my recollection, there were no lights on the planes whatsoever. Being at night, and the planes painted pitch black with no lights, they were obviously meant to go unseen. If it weren&apos;t for the moon, light pollution, and the scattered lights of homes and businesses, we would not have seen them at all, and we certainly would not have heard them. My mother weaved slightly as she tried to drive and gaze up at the same time. We watched them play in the sky. They came so close to us at one point, that I had to crane my neck up to see the whole craft. There was no particular formation, and they didn&apos;t seem to have any real destination, until they all turned and sort of drifted in the opposite direction than we were heading. My mother returned to her normal driving as I twisted in my seat to try to get one last peek at them. The last thing I remember was that even though they were shaped like triangles, the sides were flat and the edges looked like they were sanded down a little more round. The &quot;nose&quot; looked rounded too.

As we drove south on FM779 about half a mile north of our turn off on Rains County Road 2230, we looked off to our left (toward the east) and saw what looked like a cellphone radio tower.  It was lite up on top.  I remarked to my wife that I wasn&apos;t aware they were building another tower so close to the one near our home.  She said that it looked like it was lighted different for the one near us.  It looked like the top of the tower had three horizontal rows of white lights on it.  There were two red, flasing lights just below the white lights and a white strobe light above the horizontal rows of white lights.  It appeared to be taller than the tower near us so I remarked that possibly there were different lighting requirements for taller towers.  I again said to her that I wondered why they would build another tower so close to the one near us.We were looking across an open pasture of a dairy farm.  The lights looked to be, maybe, a quarter mile away. It was hard to judge distance because it was very near dark. My estimate of the distance between us and it is based on how large I would expect the platform on a radio tower to appear.  We were not alarmed and thought no more about it until the next day when we drove down the same road and there was no tower there or anything of any height anywhere near that area. We drive down that road sometimes five times a day.  If there was a tower being erected anywhere around there we would have seen it.

PD))((CORRESPONDENCE #1 WITH WITNESS))Dear ((name deleted)),Thank you very much for the interesting report!  Given your experience in the field of ufology, I suspect that you are not predisposed to flights of fancy, when it comes to reporting a sighting, the likes of which you describe.I am processing newly received reports now, and we will have your report posted to our site very soon.Thanks, again, for sharing the information with NUFORC!Regards,  Peter((RESPONSE FROM WITNESS))Hi Peter,Thanks.  Really, I&apos;m rather puzzeled.  It was all so matter-of-fact on the part of me and my wife.  We were not thinking about anything like a UFO and it did not even occur to us to stop or to question what we saw.I&apos;m working on a map of the location where we saw whatever it was.  I also have a picture or two of the open area where we saw it and I&apos;ll try to come up with some kind of drawing of what we saw.  I&apos;m not much of a computer artist but I think I can come up with something.((name deleted))((END CORRESPONDENCE #2))Hi Peter,Attached are some maps of where the sighting took place, a very rought sketch of what the object looked like to us, and a photo made the following day of the area where the sighting took place.  As you can see, there ain&apos;t no tower there!!Peter, please feel free to use the attachments as you see fit.  I apologize for the poor quality of the drawing of the object.  I don&apos;t have even a little bit of drawing talent.If you would like, you are free to use our names associated with this sighting.  My wife of 43+ years is named ((name deleted)).I suspect that you are correct in your suspicion show below.  When I began telling my friends of my interest in UFOs, friends that I had had for years and years suddenly began telling me about sightings that they had had.  Some of their stories were VERY interesting and unusual.  They had never said anything to anyone before about their sightings.  Certainly does make you wonder how many strange things are actually going on out there and are never reported.If you have questions about what the wife and I saw, please ask.  I don&apos;t feel like I covered it very well.Thanks,  ((name deleted))((END CORRESPONDENCE))", "It just all of a sudden came across the sky.   It was bright blue with a yellow to orange color tail.

It moved slowly above the clouds and had a slight wobble as it movedI was on my way home from work, Thursday, March 17, 2005. I noticed in the sky @ 1/2 mile from my car a black triangular looking craft coming towards my car. I was on Westheimer close to the Highway 6 intersection in Houston, Texas. I continued to watch it from my car but as it passed my car, I decided to turn my car around and find a nearby parking lot to park at so that I could get out of my car and continue to observe this object. It was a little cloudy but only a little. This object didn&apos;t seem to be going very fast, though. What was strange to me besides the triangular shape is that it seemed to have a slight wobble to it as it flew towards my car. Also, while other planes and helicopters in the air had lights on, this craft did not have lights. It almost looked as though it was hiding in the clouds because it seemed to stay in the clouds as it moved and would occasionally come out of the clouds.

She said she then saw another light blue object. She said they formed 2 shapes, a diamond then what she called a peace sign.

My mother, son and I were traveling Southbound on I-5 on our way to pick up my brother to go fishing. I was driving and felt a very strong vibration traveling up my arms from holding the steering wheel. This vibration was so strong that I could feel it in my chest as well. There was no sound. We were passing Boeings, which is a small, private airport for private and smaller commercial planes. I leaned forward to look up through the windsheild (I was driving an Oldsmomile that had a deep, slanted windshield and it was necessary to lean forward to view the sky). I witnessed a large (about 1/2 the size of a football field) saucer shaped UFO. I remember it being a pewter color,a dull silver, rather than the shiny description I have since read about. There were &quot;running lights&quot; flashing on the underside of the craft - much like the &quot;chasing lights&quot; now available for Christmas Tree lights. I remember them being blue in color. The UFO was a little higher than the freeway street lights (VERY close) and almost directly above our vehichle. I remember yelling out in shock and excitement, &quot;Mom, it&apos;s a UFO...Oh My God, it&apos;s a UFO!&quot;. I remember making the decision to pull over to the shoulder of the road. As I navigated over, I remember seeing 6 - 7 other cars parked on the shoulder of the opposite side of the freeway - they would be heading Northbound. I do not recall seeing anyone in or near-by their vehichles. I do not remember seeing any cars on either the freeway or on the shoulder of our side of the freeway - Southbound. This memory was lost for 3 years!  One day, I was doing a mindless task - dusting furniture - and recalled the sighting. It was in Technocolor and VERY clear...only 3 years later! I called my mother, who was living in Alaska and asked &quot;When we were going to pick up my brother to go fishing 3 years previous...what did we see?&quot; Her answer was instantanious, &quot;A UFO.&quot; I asked if she&apos;d recalled this or had told anyone about it previous to my call. Her answer was &quot;No.&quot;  Neither my mother nor I are the type of people to keep this memory a secret. we would have told close friends and family members. We didn&apos;t. We couldn&apos;t! We had had our memories blocked somehow. When I recalled the sighting, my memorie goes from seeing the UFO to being in a rented rowboat at in Point Defiance Sound (located in Tacoma, Washington), our fishing destination. We were caught in a rip-tide and I recall all 4 of us having to lay flat in the boat to avoid being tossed into the sound by the extreme bobbing of the boat encountered in this rip-tide. After my mother and I discussed this incident, I called my brother and asked him if he could remember if my mother, son and myself were late in arriving for our fishing date. He couldn&apos;t recall, as it had been 3 full years after this trip. Neither my mother nor I recall seeing anything other than the UFO. I am filing this report in the hope that one of passengers of the other 6-7 cars may have a clearer memory of the encounter and wish to report this for the record.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

It looked like a big sewer pipe with rounded caps on each end  and it moved slowly from West to East and it was probaly in a line about 50 miles west of the shuttle.It looked like a Propane tank and it was painted a Barn red color and it was about 20 Ft. in diameter and about 40 or 50 Ft. long .Afterwards , just as the thing was going out of sight over the trees, my wife came out and i tryed to get her to see the thing but it was too far away , but then the shuttle was going up in an arc toward the east and I didn&apos;t see the boosters drop off because it was too far away from my location in the old six gun plaza in Ocala.I guess you didn&apos;t see what I did and ((name deleted)) didn,t see it either until it was way East of us but I seen it when it was almost overhead and watched it untill it was almost out of site going in a strait line and at the same altitude at about 40 or 50 miles an hour.SSSSooo , What was it ?((FOLLOW-UP CORRESPONDENCE WITH SOURCE OF REPORT))Peter DavenportSorry bout the delay , but being my age (70) , or near that when it happened , it just faded from my mind for some reson , i guess there just wasn&apos;t  anybody around that cared at that time so it just faded from my memory .The only reason i got re-interested and sent my sighting in to you was because i was looking thu some of the mail i had sent to my daughter, and it just poped up  , so there it is .It realy upset me about nobody being anywhere around because while this thing was going over , i looked all around and there wasn&apos;t a sole in that parking lot and any  other time there was people going back and forth to there cars . Then after the thing was out of sight then my wife came out and THEN i started to see other people but telling them about it would just turn them into &apos;doughters&quot; so i just drove on home and forgot it !I was wondering if the people at the Cape would have seen that on there Radar or something , , , Oh , well , probaly not since the shuttle thing was gong up , all eyes were probaly on that .I know the Cape is a few miles down the road from route 40 that ends at I95 When I was at 6 Gun Plaza that thing was going over my head about a 1/2 mile away from straight up . And it was headed right towards the Cape.

As I got onto the highway heading South to Tecumseh, I noticed a bright light coming from the direction of where Tecumseh sits. I at first thought the light to be the town&apos;s baseball stadium lights, and that maybe they were accidentally left on. Thinking nothing more about it, I continued home.I finally got off the highway when I reached Tecumseh, and took Rangeline Road back to my house (which also neared the baseball stadium there). As I got closer to the Walnut &amp; Rangeline intersection (right about where the baseball park would be), I noticed that the lights had disappeared. It was at the moment when I reached the intersection did something catch my attention. Something was hovering above the intersection.Startled and bewildered, I turned off my car and jumped out to get a better look. It hovered roughly 40 feet above the ground and looked no bigger than an average car. It gave off no bright glow or luminous light, but was definitely metallic in color. Whatever street lights around had given enough light for me to see this object properly. The object made absolutely NO noise.The only way I have ever been able to describe the look of this craft was that it looked rectangular but with slanted sides, the same way a shoebox would look if you squished it down and the sides were to &quot;slant out&quot;, like this &lt; &gt;. There were two bulbous objects attached underneath this craft.I stared at the object for nearly two minutes when it started to turn its&apos; direction North, and silently it began moving at what I guess to be 40 miles per hour. I figured the object would be heading towards Highway 177, so I jumped in my car and did a u-turn to follow this thing. I chased it for one mile to the Highway 177 entrance and by the time I got on the highway, the object had taken off like a jet. I pulled off the side of the road and sat there for 15 minutes trying to take in what I had just saw.I&apos;ve never reported this incident fully, just to my wife and a few friends. I still remember it like it was yesterday. Since then, I have had 5 more occassions where I have spotted these objects (not the same ones however). I suppose I just look up the skies more often since that occurence in Oklahoma.

The object appeared to be moving at a very high altitude.  You couldn&apos;t make out any physical detail, but it was clearly not moving or behaving like an aircraft at high altitude.  I grabbed a 10x42 pair of Nikon binoculars and we placed them on one of the staircase posts on my back porch.  We could get a pefectly still view of what appeared to be a bizarre disk-shaped cloud moving obviously at a great rate of speed and height.  But the truly bizarre aspect of this oject was the waves a thermal energy surrounding the thin, disk shaped moving contrail.  Both my roomate and his lady friend also viewed the object through the binoculars, and both were mystified, if not blown away at what they saw.  My roomate is an experienced pilot, who at one time was going to get a commercial airline pilot&apos;s license. He stated that he had never seen anything like what he witnessed tonight.  He will contact you shortly to give his version.", "Ball of light traveling at a high rate of speed over Keflavik Iceland, circa late summer 1998.I was walking with a friend down a side street in Keflavik Iceland in late August 1998 to go to the movies. The street was very wide, so I had an almost completely unobstructed view of the sky. As is my habit, I looked up at the sky because the sky is very beautiful there, especially in the late summer. Although it was about 7:00 PM, it was still completely light out with no stars or planets visible, the sky still a brilliant azure. There were a few scattered clouds. Suddenly, I saw a ball of light, but it was moving. It seemed to alternate between yellow and white in color, and it seemed to be quite high in altitude. I want to guess about 20 to 30 thousand feet (?). Because of the altitude, it looked to be about double the size of Venus, but not as brilliant, though it was bright. I could not see the actual shape, or if it was an actual craft, but it did appear circular. The shape remained constant, though the colors seemed to change. The main reason for this submission, though, is the rate of speed with which the object traveled.  I first noticed the light when it was a little less than halfway across the horizon, almost directly overhead.  It was completely out of sight in about 6 to 8 seconds.  It also had a very flat, straight flight pattern, totally different from what you would see if you were watching a jumbo jet flying overhead, which tend to appear as if they are dragging across lazily the sky, hardly moving, and at an angle to the horizon. Speaking of jumbo jets flying at about 20 to 30 thousand feet, they seem to take forever before you lose sight of them, and they travel at about 650 MPH. Though I do not possess the mathematical expertise to calculate it accurately, I am pretty certain that whatever can race halfway across the horizon in less than 10 seconds at that altitude must be able to move at an alarming rate of speed.  If it was something man made, I hope it is in the American inventory. As with my one other sighting, I was in a state of what I like to refer to as a calm astonishment, unable to speak out to my friend about it. I believe I mentioned it aterwards, but the response was pretty lackluster, as is often the case.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

The thing that made me question whether it was an airplane or not is that the craft had no blinking lights, was a very odd dark bright blue color that seemed unatural, it was almost blending in with the sky.  It came from the distance first moving like an airplane, then it moved uncharacteristically of an airplane, it changed directions very fast and erractically.

It lit up the river enough to see the people fishing on the shore. This caused the three of us to look skyward and saw what looked similar to a falling star. It was very obvious that it wasnt a star due to the Huge size of it. It started to leave a trail of several colors. Blue, red yellow and white.

I have enjoyed sky gazing since I was a youngster and have seen hundreds of Shooting stars in my life This wasnt one.

Last night (3/21), there were very strange orange lights in the sky near the south end of town.  I currently live just south of 350 off of 18th street and am aware of the flight patterns of the Purdue students and the airport...and this had NO affiliation with that.  These orange lights were much farther away and too high to be a Purdue training plane.  These orange lights would appear for 3 or 4 seconds and then fade out to nothing.  I first noticed 1 around 8:30pm.  1 quickly turned into 2, then 3 and finally 4.  These lights would appear in a row and fade in and out at different times.  Once they would fade out, it would be around 5 or 10 minutes before they would appear again...usually in the same spots, but sometimes in different spots as well.  It was completely random...as sometimes only 2 would appear, other times just 1 would appear and again 4 would appear.  It was VERY odd and strange to see.  I tried to take pictures of this event...but was unable to capture any good evidence.  I am fully aware how strange this sounds.  I wanted to try to think of a logical explanation....and...I have come to the conclusion that I have no explanation (couldnt be a shooting star or meteor shower because there was no visual movement of these object, etc).  I would like to know if others have reported seeing this event?  Also, is there any other possible explanation related to meterology that I am not thinking of?

When I was 5 or 6 years old I was in our front yard just after sunset when I saw a round red glowing object that was traveling from east to west in the Northern sky. My Dad had an orchard across the road and the trees were about 15 ft. tall in rows about 40 feet apart. I was about 75 feet from the orchard. The object was a little lower then the tops of the trees. It took about 10 seconds to travel between the rows. The object appeared to be about the size of a softball and had a red glow like it was on fire. It didn&apos;t have a tail.

There had just been a comet in the news not too far before that (Hale-Bopp) but we didn&apos;t remember seeing anything about another one.  Then as we got closer to the stoplight, it started to move.  It went in all directions, kind of slowly, like it was watching us.  We kept our eye on it, and continued to the store.  There is a mall on the way to the store (Northtwone Mall) with a street that goes around it, so we turned to drive around the mall, that way we could drive slowly and keep an eye on it.  It followed us of course, and seemed to get closer.  There were people at the mall, about to go to the movies, so we asked them if they saw it and 2 guys said yes.  This is the first time that you could see the shape of it because it was getting close.  It was kind of a saucer, but there seemed to be some kind of gear hanging out of the bottom, like landing gear, and lights.  We stopped at the corner of Detroit and Alexis and it turned slowly and hovered down Alexis Road.

In an instant I see what at first I think is a firework explosion: a fuzzy ring of yellow-white light around the rightmost light, which expands to about 2 moon diameters in about 5 seconds, then fades out. The two lights move along a line northward, more or less parallel to the horizon, through the eastern sky. The rightmost (trailing) light is &quot;fuzzier&quot; that than the front (leftmost) one. Over the span of about 90 seconds they move about 25-30 degrees to the northeast, before they seem to fade out behind the clouds. During this time the leading light increased its distance from the trailing one to about 5 moon diameters. The trailing light grew less fuzzy over the period of time that I followed it. The velocity of the objects was consistent with either high-altitude airplanes or satellites. The speed, color, and brighness was not consistent with any meteor I&apos;ve ever seen.((NUFORC Note:  We assume that the witness describes above the launch of a Titan IV missile out of Cape Canaveral, which occurred at 20:55 hrs.

At some point my mother spotted an unusal light moving from her left (east) field of vision to her right (west) field of vision very close to the tree tops.  She asked my father what type of plane that it was.  My father had been a military pilot his whole life and noted that it did not look like a plane.  The object moved across their field of vision until it was right in front of them across the lake at tree top level and stopped (about 1/4 mile away). It looked cigar shaped and small port holes of different colors could be seen along it&apos;s sides.  It made a continuse humming sound. After serveral minutes it moved off.  My parents related this story to us kids the next morning at breakfast.

It had the brightest white lights I have ever seen at the top and on the bottom was extremely bright red lights.  It would come on like a light bulb for a few seconds, and light the sky and the ocean up.  It did this for about 15 minutes.

I asked ((name deleted)) if he could see the plane as I did not readily observe it, as there were scatterd clouds in the sky. These clouds were not rain clouds as they were cirrus clouds. The craft then suddenly appeared out from behind the high cloud cover and I realized that there was absolutley no contrail being emitted from the craft.  The sound immediately indicated to me that the craft was extremely solid and well built as I looked and realized that this craft had to be in excess of well over 1500 or 2000 feet in length.  It was well above the cirrus clouds which I estimate to have been at 40 to 50 thousand feet.  This had a very long needle like appearance and was at about what I estimate to be 60 or 70 thousand feet.  It was very light bright white in color, no lights, and no apparent wings or tail.  In refernce to the direction of Route 340 which generally travels North to South, the craft was traveling due East.  My estimation of the speed at which the craft was traveling, can be arrived at by how long the time transpired from when I first heard the craft to the time when I located it and then perceiving its rate of speed as it traveled East towards Washington, D.C.

It was a split second reversal and continued passing the other direction until I lost it behind a tree stand. We took the event lightly but I have never forgotten it.

First impression was of 2 helicopters coming in to land at the airport.There were no flashing lights, just a reddish light common to both with no apparent difference in intensity nor quality.Followed the lights, measured the distance between then when above (as high as an uparm salute {80 degree arc?}as the distance of 3/4 of my index finger.The flight path came from the east deviating in a northerly direction.When at their highest but to my left both lights stopped. The lead light then turned north (and at this time a small meteor came from the east) and within a short distance faded altogether.The other light then continued on its flight path - easterly/northerly - and I had to step off the stoop to go to the edge of my deck {16&apos;} as the roof of the {2 storey} housebegan to obscure the light. The light then continued for a short while until it too faded.I am assuming that perhaps this was a satellite insertion of some sort. However the colour of the lights and slow speed were not something I have seen before in reference to satellites nor the direction. Other satellite insertions have been from the south to north - where rocket/satellite separate at relatively high speeds/altitudes and with a colour of usual satellite observation - ie white.I have no idea of the altitude of the reddish lights. Difficult to judge without knowing the size of the lights.There was no sound involved.Incidentally at 11.45pm there were 2 meteors coming from the north - the first with quite a &quot;head&quot; to be followed seconds later by a smaller one.&quot; I live in Wolf Creek Rural Residential Subdivision which is located 1 mile west of the Mary Lake Subdivision mentioned in one of the reports on this incident and my property is on the eastern boundary.This area is on one of the flight paths into Whitehorse airport and on the flight path of Anchorage flights to the east and reverse.There are numerous satellites traversing overhead and dependent upon reflection can be very bright or quite dim.", "An oval shaped ship with a metallic color shot away from our plane with speed not seen before.I Was in an Airplane and I was on my way to Hawaii for vacation.

I strained to hear anything and could not, but sensed great power or energy.  I was amazed at the razor sharp edges of the triangle and was struck by the clarity of the salmon colored lights that ran up one side of the triangle leading edge and up the other side but not on the part of the triangle which was on the back.I saw that the craft was leveling off and as soon as it did it completely disappeared.

I was fascinated by the night sky and the beautiful stars even then, so I was constantly looking up at them. I may have been the first to notice this thing. As I looked at it, it was self illuminated- sort of a harvest moon orange color- no lights visable. It did the most incredible thing. As it drew closer and enlarged in size it flipped or sort of rolled over, I saw this whole thing very clearly, when it sort of turned over or revolved horizontally it appeared as a disk and approached us very quickly and stopped in the sky about 45 degrees up from the south horizon. There was no sound at all, but the machine appeared solid, and had a series of windows (?) or port holes (?) around the middle.

This phenomenon occurred several times, until eventually the light was obscured by clouds and I could no longer see it.

They were driving me to an extracurricular evening activity. While going down Route 5 we observed a huge bright white sphere that appeared to hover silently in front of our vehicle. It appeared to be very, very close.  I remebered being very frightened.The light vanished as suddenly as it appeared. When we arrived at our destination (Nike base in Hamburg, NY) another person attending the activity had witnessed this spherical ball also. We looked out of a window facing Northeast and saw the light again... it was moving erractically and then disappeared.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

All of my interior lights were on so this light was very, very bright.  Airplanes and stars never grab my attention like this object did.  The light was north of my home and approximately 20 degrees above the horizon.  The wind was gusting to around 25 mph at the time and it was overcast.  I stood up from the computer, dimmed the lights and went to the window to watch a tightly grouped collection of fast blinking lights that surrounded a very bright orangish light that would extinguish and re-light every two or three seconds.  The fast blinking lights were orange, red, blue, green, yellow and white.  They blinked so fast that it almost appeared like a giant scintillating star.  This object was low enough over the horizon to gauge it&apos;s movements in reference to trees which were backlit by Jackson, Michigan&apos;s orangish glow.  This weird collection of lights would rock back and forth in the air and seemed to rise and fall dramatically.  After approximately five minutes swinging, ascending and descending in the air it lurched upward and disappeared into a cloudbank almost directly overhead. This is the second sighting I&apos;ve had in the area over the past three weeks.  On Sunday February 27th, at approximately 7:45 pm I observed two brightly lit triangular formations of lights sitting above the eastern horizon while driving south on M50 between Napoleon and Jackson, Michigan.  The two formations of lights each consisted of three bright orangish white lights.  Two lights formed the triangular base and a single light at each apex.  They sat just a few degrees above the horizon from my position and were in view for about a minute before I lost sight of them behind trees.  I turned my car around to see if I could locate them but had vanished.", "4 bright orange flashes in a line4 bright, yellow/orange flashes, fairly spaced apart, appear in the eastern horizon.  Each flash lasted 3-5 sec.  There were about 1/2 sec intervals between each flash.  Flashes appeared 2-4 times larger and brighter than the planet Venus in the sky.  While lit, the flashes made no appearent movement.  Flashes would start out dim and grow brighter then, fade off. Flashes seemed to follow a line in the sky.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  We wonder whether the witness might have been observing a tumbling rocket booster in orbit.

It was moving fast and flashing on and off.  When it was directly in front of me it changed directions and came down toward me straight through the trees with no sign of movement to avoid the trees or their branches. I was absolutely fascinated and with no fear. Within a minute or two I stood approaching the large window, cupped my hands around my eyes to get a better look into the dark night.  The light hovered directly over a low retainer wall separating the front lawn from the mesquite grove and continued its steady flashing. Suddenly apprehensive I started walking past a wall of windows toward the bedroom and watching as the light followed my path.  The bedroom drapes were closed so I carefully peaked through the opening only to find the light hovering outside the bedroom window.  While watching another few seconds it suddenly disappeared. I felt the light (or whatever it was) saw me sitting in the dark in the house and came to investigate or document my being on film.((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

I was travelling home with a friend who was in the Air Force and we saw a bright yellow fireball behind some trees in the Tunstall Forest, east of the base.  Thinking a plane had crashed we drove around for about 15 minutes on forest roads and nver located anything.  Nothing was published on the fireball we saw and no planes reported missing.  This might just have been one of those unexplained mysteries, except that there were always those kind of mysteries around this area and this was 7 years before the now infamous Bentwaters incident. I was born and grew up in this area and as child in the 60s regularly saw things that I realise could not be explained away now, as they were then.  If I asked an adult then, it was always explained away as &quot;they must be testing something at the base&quot; but never as the Orford Ness Lighthouse as some have tried to explain the 1980 incident.  Anyone living there knew those lights and what they were. Bentwaters closed abruptly in the mid 80s and local speculation is that it was to do with the incidences that occurred there during the 70s and  especially in 1980 and 1981. There has always been local talk of tunnels from Bentwaters to Woodbridge and other talk of secret testing that went on at the base and at nearby Martlesheam Heath  (an English base during WWII and now a Governement run installation). Another writer on this site proclaims the military never messes around when it comes to nukes.  Not really true, when one considers that in the 60s and 70s, Bentwaters was proclaimed as not having nukes and all the while kept a very low profile, while Greenham Common was busy with anti nuke protestors. Lakenheath was considered the headquarters USAF base in England and yet had no real &quot;mission&quot; at least at that time, yet their security was very tight. Meanwhile on Bentwaters, I as a civilian had my father drive me to the flight line to meet a friend who worked out there surrounded by nukes.  He pointed them out to us.  We could have easily have been someone other than who we were, which is a frightening thought in retrospect.  The security in and around Bentwaters was lacking and lots of people did come and go, virtually unchallenged, unless an &quot;alert&quot; was in force. What really happened there, we may never know but I suspect there are lot of people who have come and gone from service at Bentwaters who have small bits of the puzzle and one day all those bits may just slot together and produce the finished jigsaw.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

It was making a loud engine noise.  It was not going very fast, kind of cruising.  I thought it looked strange, but not so strange that it was beyond human technology.  It was my impression that it was some sort of plane created by man. Another person was walking toward me, and he had seen it too, and joked to me that it must have been a stealth plane.  If I held a baseball at arm&apos;s length, that is about the size of what I saw. Even though I thought it was strange, I wouldn&apos;t assume it was a UFO.  But then I heard this object mentioned on the Jeff Rense show, and Peter Davenport and Jeff requested witnesses to describe it, so I have done so.((COMMENT FROM VISITOR TO THE NUFORC SITE))Dear Mr. Davenport,Thank you so very much for all that you do to help our global community.  I have been a regular to your site for some time now and this is my first time posting a report.  However,  what I saw and confirmed on April 12th, 2005 forced me to share this with the center in the hopes it will added to the database as a footnote.  Currently the database has 2 reports of a flying triangle over the Los Angeles and Santa Monica area on April 12th at approx. 13:00  (1 o&apos;clock p.m.)  What our 2 witnesses were observing was the B-2 Stealth Bomber performing a low altitude fly-by of Dodger Stadium for the opening day ceremonies.  I observed the B-2 at approx. 13:07 from my backyard as it headed west towards Santa Monica at very low altitude approx. 700 to 900 ft. , roughly the same altitude as LAPD helicopters, and bank towards the north Santa Monica Mountains.  I tried to get a shot of this amazing airplane with my cell phone camera but I was too slow. What caught my attention was the engine noise.  Nothing like I&apos;ve ever heard before.   My next door neighbor also witnessed the fly-by.  I live in the Mid-City area of Los Angeles, roughly half way between the witness in downtown and the witness to my west  in Santa Monica.Quote from the Los Angeles Times 4/13/05&quot;The largest crowd ever at Dodger Stadium - 55,892 - barely had time to settle after watching the obligatory B-2 stealth bomber roar past when low-flying projectiles began doing damage. Starter Jeff Weaver gave up 11 hits and eight runs before being pulled after a Pedro Feliz homer.&quot;An airshow  message board also noted the B-2 fly-by for the Dodgers opener, and noted there will be another on Memorial Day May 30th, 2005.

I turned on the light of the garden door and looked out of my living room window which is one floor above the garden room where my dog was.  I did not turn on the light in the room I was in, so I could see out quite clearly. At first when I saw a red flash I thought it was an intruder throwing away a ligthed cigarette butt. But then I was amazed to see the &apos;cigarette light&apos; and 2 other bright red lights moving between my neighbours side of the garden fence and mine. The movement was similar to that of a butterfly - a fluttery dance movement. One of the lights then moved off at a very rapid speed to the end of my garden passing up over bushes and trees and up over the roof top of the house opposite (approx 120 yards in distance). The other two lights then followed after a few seconds.  The lights were a very deep red colour and approx. 2 - 3 inches in circumference.I have eliminated the possibility of it being someone using laser lights because of the angle of the movements.

I heard an prop driven aircraft and began to look for it (as I am an aviation buff). I spotted the plane heading south to north at about 3000 feet above ground level. We are about 4100 feet above sea level. As the aircraft passed overhead, I noticed another object moving north to south. I called my wife&apos;s attention to the object as well. The object looked metalic (silver and reflective)and resembled the shape of the early flying wings. My best estimation is that the object was 30 - 40 ft across and traveling at an altitude of 15,000 - 20,000 feet. There were no visible lights or strobes. It was higher than the aircraft we spotted, But lower than a jet that left a contrail a few moments before. The object was moving much faster than the jet and made no sound. It continued in a staight line until out of sight (about 30 seconds). We continued looking up while discussing what the object may have been. After about one and a half minutes we noticed two more objects of the same shape and configuration flying in the same direction as the first. They were at about the same altitude and speed. They flew parallel to each other about 800 ft apart. Again no sound and were visible for the same duration. We continued to look in the direction that the objects came from. After about another minute or so another object was spotted. It continued overhead as the others had done. However, at about 30 degrees past directly overhead the object appeared to perform a single roll or steep bank which showed a distict reflective property. The object continued on for a short distance then veered off to the left then veered back to it&apos;s original path until out of sight. The prevailing wind at the surface was from the south west.

Not thinking much of it at first, I spotted a dark orange, possibly red set of lights running almost perpendicular to the airplane.  It started out looking like a meteorite but then began to flash in a pulsing fashion as it moved to the north.  In the time that I observed it, it actually seemed to go out completely a few times allowing a non-illuminated object to be seen, barely visible but still there.  Finally it disappeared just as the plane that I was originally watching changed course in its direction.Both the plane and the object were unusual.  The plane because it did not follow the normal flight path of the commercial airliners that move in and out of the local internation airport and it appeared to be higher than normal for the distance that it was away from the airport.

While driving on I-65 going south through Alabama/Tennessee and it was late at night probably around 11 pm as well, I truly had a close encounter with whatever, which is all I can say. At the time my now ex-wife was sleeping beside me in the car so she new nothing about it as it was happening and when I woke her up after this event was over she shrugged it off as a figment of my imagination even though she noticed that I was flushed and sweaty.What occurred was that I saw a very large and extremely bright light that reminded me of a locomotive train light just behind me about 50yds or so just appear suddenly and it followed me at the same pace but its movement was so strange to me as I noticed because it didn&apos;t fluxuate with the contour of the road as I was moving or was I and there was no sound as if a helicopter. I wanted to alert my wife but I felt controlled as if in a trance or some hypnotic mind control and the only thing I felt that I could do was to only use my eyes to just look in the forward direction which caused me to keep glancing in the rear view mirror from time to time and as well, I noticed my palms were sweaty but for sure this was all I was allowed to do, I felt controlled to only be able to keep my hands on the wheel. It seemed like for ages even though in this report I say maybe a half hour and just as it appeared so did it suddenly disappear but to tell you the truth, I don&apos;t really remimber how long that this occurrence was happening or maybe time was standing still or whatever, I don&apos;t really know. The other thing that I keep going over and over in my mind besides the light is that I noticed there were no cars in either direction all the time this occurrence was happening up until it was gone which also seemed strange for an interstate highway But anyway the years have passed and the other day I was watching the history channel on ufo&apos;s and strange sightings so I was compelled to go on the net and do a little surfing and your site came up and well, now you know mine.

As I approached the building where I work, I noticed an object that looked as though it were hovering in the sky. At first it looked like how a planet might look if it were too close to the earth. Then I noticed it was kind of trianglular in shape with the edges rounded off. Also, it had a greenish-white glow to it. It seemed to get bigger and that made it look like it was getting closer.

It left green streaks accross the air as it fell then shot off. My coworker didn&apos;t even see it, because it wasn&apos;t directly above us. It was at a distance that would have put it over the freeway of where route 2 and route 140 meet (1/4 mile away) in Gardner. It was also a few hundred feet in the air.

This was one of MANY occassions when myself and family members and neighbours saw similar objects, always heading in the same direction, always &quot;landing&quot; at the same sight. The variances were that on some occassions:- the craft would appear and travel at an extremely fast speed and then halt suddenly (but smoothly) and descend slowly; other occassions the craft would &apos;drop&apos; suddenly, and the craft would be dark; on other occassions the craft would hover and eminate a bright light and &apos;land&apos;  Some sightings lasted a matter of 10 seconds, others for several minutes. The crafts were the shape of two saucers placed on top of each other; and were a mid-grey/greenish colour, a matt finish.  A dull yellowish light formed a tail when the crafts were travelling, however whenever the crafts hovered the yellowish light emited from beneath. Our house was approx. 1 mile from the landing site, and from this distance, it looked as though the craft were 12&apos; in diametre and 10&apos; high and 40&apos; round.  The &quot;saucer&quot; had a spinning motion.  I did not see any windows on any of the craft. Why &quot;we&quot; have believed these were UFO is because of the movement/action of the craft - the sudden &quot;take off&quot;, the hovering etc were not possible by helicopters, aeroplanes, or &apos;falling stars&apos; or meteorites. The craft always descended in the same area. We wonder whether they landed in the tip on the large, flat-ish surface; or whether they landed in the mountain.    Interestingly, we have later learned that there a series of markings in caves similar to heiroglyphs.  And there are two other areas with similar markings and when plotted on a map, form the shape of a pyramid.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incidents are approximate.

My first reaction was that it was on fire. It did not appear to be a plane since we could see planes in the vicinity and the features on this seemed very different to airplane lights. This supposedly flaming light kept moving towards us for about a minute when suddenly it split into two. Both of the lights were as large and brilliant as the first one had been but now we could see smoke trails coming from them. This lasted for about 10 or 20 seconds when suddenly a third light appeared, this one was very dim and we only saw it because it seemed to be illuminated by the two other lights. At this point we began thinking it was only one object since with the appearance of the 3rd light, it formed a triangular pattern. This triangle suddenly stopped moving towards us and seemed to take a 45-degree path upwards. The Triangle was clearly visible for about 30 seconds when the two bright lights at the bottom disappeared. The smoke that had been emitted from these two bottom lights also stopped. The smaller dimmer one didn&rsquo;t seem affected by this and kept rising for maybe a minute or 2 minutes longer. It was passing next to a star when suddenly it exploded. This explosion was not as an airplane&rsquo;s is supposed to be, there was no fire visible but debris seemed to go in every direction and maybe a second after the original explosion a shockwave appeared. The shockwave was bright blue and it moved very quickly, shortly after this we were able to see debris from the explosion falling, very slowly. We were left speechless and wondering what it was. We checked the news outlets but there seemed to be nothing on this. Surely someone else had to see it.((NUFORC Note:  We assume that the witness describes above the launch of a Titan IV missile out of Cape Canaveral, which occurred at 20:55 hrs.

As the three lights travelled across the sky, they suddenly broke up and the one on the bottom crossed over at a right angle and suddenly sped off between the two others at tremendous speed.

Several miles down the road, the lights continued the pattern of reappearing and disappearing at different places in the sky and at one point looked as if they were heading our way. The last sighting of the formations was when the sky lit up and the objects took off from the ground into the sky and disappeared.

I noticed about three flashes of light in West Texas and New Mexico, which I ignored until I got to AZ. I was very tired as I left Tucson. About 25 miles South of South Mountain in Phoenix I had the sighting. I was driving on I-10, which goes North from Tucson to Phoenix. I saw a very bright white light on an aircraft to the east of I-10. The craft has a flashing blue light like in a tail area so I assumed a light plane or helicopter. I heard no noise though. Then the tail light started to whip around in a fashion suggesting it was not attached to the craft. The craft was also moving erractically and very quickly. So I though wow, I&acute;m really tired. Then on the west side of I-10, I saw 4 very bright white lights that lit up very quickly and flew at I-10 at a very high speed and zoomed up in a parabolic way and disappeared. This was very odd. Finally I saw a very bright light in front of me in the sky. The light got very bright and then dimmed revealing the bottom of a craft shaped like an old fashioned keyhole. The base of the craft had blue and pinkish red lights. I know this sounds weird, but I did see it, as described. I don&acute;t know what this was, but it is the strangest thing I have ever seen.

Southpoint Road leads to the Duke Power Allen steam plant and the main portion(s) of Lake Wylie. CLT International Airport is very close by but we were nowhere close to the flight path or paths that the airplanes ascend and descend. When my wife observed this, she literally  snatched my arm and pointed the object to me (she was driving). When I viewed the object, I was in total awe. The object was a half mile from us and was flying over the lake. I figure that the object was 1000 feet (probably less) from the ground. The object from flying west as we were heading east. We slowed down and were moving at a snails pace on the road to observe this phenomena. The object stopped, appeared to hover and then performed a swift 90 degree turn and was heading in our direction (towards the steam plant). We kept driving (slowly) and then noticed the object had changed course (back to the west). We then turned our vehicle around and went back to the original spot of where we viewed the object. When we arrived, the object was back in it&apos;s original position. We pulled into the high school parking lot and sat there viewing the object. Then the craft took a southerly course and flew over Gaither Road (towards the other side of Lake Wylie). The craft had NO SOUND and a dull yellow glow on the bottom.

I could not see the top or bottom and it had no obvious lights, but it was luminated. The strange feeling I got was whomever was inside wanted to make sure I saw it, reason for it being so close. I didn&apos;t see it arrive and it was gone in a flash. I still wonder why I looked up at that moment. Two nights latter I had a dream or maybe it was an experience, I&apos;m not sure.

As they traveled, they formed a straight line. Their flight trajectory was from the NNE to the SSW. This formation appeared to be flying at high altitude, but as it was a clear day, thus difficult to distinguish the relationship between size and altitude. (I estimate they were at above 9000m and appeared to be 2-3mm in diameter when seen from the ground). They made no contrails. They were visible until I got into my house, and when I went to find them a few seconds later in the sky again in the location I would presume they would be in (off to the SSW) they had disappeared. I am a high school student with honours in all my courses, and have been an aviation enthusiast since I was 5.

Much to my amazement from 2034p-2038p through the binoculars I noted a silver object (elv. 30 degrees at 285 degrees, i.e. close to the horizon to the WNW) of undetermined shape far in the distance moving VERY slowly (one twentieth the speed of a plane) and either slowing its motion or stopping every few seconds.  It was going so slowly that I really could not tell its intended direction, if any, perhaps N to S.  It was so far away that I could not make out its shape with ordinary 7X binoculars.  It was metallic silver and shiny and would have irritated the eyes if it had been closer.  Note: It was SO SMALL that I would NOT have detected it if I had not already been looking through binoculars at the time. At 2038, a large black balloon-like object probably closer to me began moving upwards with the prevailing surface winds towards the object! (SW to NE under weak surficial high pressure).  The two objects never came in contact.  Then at 2038p I stopped to take notes thinking the silver object would just stay there and cooperate.  Well, of course, UFO&rsquo;s never do, and by 2039p I could not find either object. Conclusion:  While the silver object is a UFO since it has no explanation, the black object that was clearly below 5,000&rsquo; may have been a balloon escaping from the wealthy citizens who hold summer parties down the hill. Anyway, I&rsquo;m sure there are thousands of distant shiny silver objects reported to you that really have no significance.  Many are probably airplanes with the rising or setting sun.  However, in this instance the object was more or less stationary for 4 minutes.  But it is certainly possible that it was an airplane departing to the WNW at 285 degrees and catching the setting sun.  Yet four minutes is a long time (2034-2038).  I have some experience in meteorology yet none in aviation...and I certainly know that atmospheric illusions occur at sunset and sunrise.  I would hope to think of an alternative explanation for this yet for now it remains a UFO.  The black balloon adds interest, but I can&rsquo;t say for sure if it really was a balloon from a party or not.

Silently, coming right over the roof of my house this dark, almost black looking rectangle shaped object, resembling a chinese box kite about 15 feet across and maybe 4 feet thick, passed directly over my head.  It was hard to see if you didn&apos;t know it was there. It was very low just above the power lines and trees.  It made no sound what so ever.  I was trying to figure out what it was.  I had never seen anything like it.  When it was about 40 ft passed me, it turned down the street next to mine keeping one corner fixed then just turned the corner kind of the way a marching band makes a turn.  I watched it as it went away and then the weirdest thing happened.  I saw a very dark, deep, blood red, hard to see light seemed to glow from the back.  It appeared to change shape because the red glow went from being across the whole back to being like on the two ends of the top of a &quot;T&quot; or &quot;V&quot; and one being at about the base of a &quot;T&quot; or &quot;V&quot;.  I could not tell if it changed shape or split in three seperate things.  Weird.  It then went behind some tall trees and I never saw it or anything like it again.I have just read some reports online that were similar and it blew me away.  I have asked people for 5 years if they ever saw anything like it and they think I am nuts.  It was the same color as the night sky and was so close to my house.  I can&apos;t help but think it is some sort of spy plane.  It did not look like something from out of this world, just weird and like nothing I have ever encountered in my life.  I would love to see a photo or drawing of what others have seen and see if it is the same thing.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

The saucer was flying fairly slow and low to where it was clear of view. The saucer span in circles while moving forward. For example, like if somebody is holding a spinning basketball on their fingure, and walking forward while the ball is spinning. The saucer flew out of my view.", "A 16 year old girl sights saucer in Tuttle ND.I am a 16 year old girl, and me and my 17 year old male friend were driving around our small town approximently 2:00 A.M. on May 28, 2005 and we saw what looked like a staight line of red lights.  We were curious what they were so we turned South on the next rode and preceded to follow the lights that were southwest of us.  We were pretty close to the lights and they began to look like a circular object and the red lights appeared to have little bars across them.  When it was close to us at this point and you could see it was very big.  Then, for about ten seconds I looked down inside the pickup and looked back up and it wasn&apos;t there anymore, so I asked my friend where it went and he pointed to the other side of the rode, so I looked over and it was way on the other side of the rode towards the east.  So, we turned on the next gravel road going east towards the object, but we decided we would stop it see if it was moving.  We watched it go right over my friends farm and it was hovering over it for at least a minute and then there appeared a smaller saucer right below the big one. As we watched them hovering over his farm it began moving very fast at an angle into the sky and it just disapeared into a little ball of light and it was gone.  We followed it for at least 5 minutes before it disappeared, the whole time it seemed like it was running away from us when we would move towards it and when we would stop, it would stop with us.  I&apos;ve never been a believer in these sorts of things, but what I saw last night made me question myself.", "The lights kept disappering and reappering.My family and I went riding around at night when we saw three lights.We stopped the car to look.It was 15 feet away and 10 feet above the ground.

They were headed in a southeasterly direction, towards the rising Moon. I watched them, in total, for at least 7 minutes.When I first noticed them, they were moving at a typical satelight speed, and after returning from grabbing the binoculars from my car, they had slowed to the point where they hung almost stationary in the sky. I was very surprised that they hadn&apos;t moved out of my range while getting the binoculars. They slowed so much that there was only minimal movement against the stars. I watched them, with the binoculars until I lost them in the Moon&apos;s glow.

The objects moved slowly at first, almost seeming to hover, and after about 20 seconds they exited to the west in a burst of speed that I can only describe as almost instantaneous. The objects then stopped again and were only visible as 2 pulsing lights at that point. The objects again moved to the West and dissapeared completely.

There were other people pulled over to the side of the road looking at the sky.  We saw a light in the sky that looked like a low flying plane except the light was bigger than a plane&apos;s lights and it was flying in a scallopped pattern over an undeveloped wooded area on the east side of Rideout just north of Sherwood Park.  I drove around to the east side of the area where Bradford Drive deadended, got out of the car, and walked down the footpath into the woods, while my friend stayed with the car.  I remember seeing lights through the woods, standing there a few minutes, and then walking back to the car.  My friend said he was aware of crickets/bugs/birds being very loud, and then everything went quiet.  He lost sight of me in the dark and waited a couple of hours before I came back.  I thought it was minutes.  He said the crickets/birds started up again a few minutes before I came back.  He questioned me about what had happened, and I told him all I remembered was the lights through the trees and a voice saying, &quot;Are you afraid of your own mud?&quot;  We got back in the car and drove back to his house where we discovered that, even though the path and my shoes weren&apos;t particularly muddy, my jeans were covered with strange patterns of mud that looked like brush/finger strokes.  I also discovered I had a rash on both of my upper arms.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and she sounded quite credible to us.  She indicates that the date is approximate.

The Odenwald was right outside our fence, and our barracks was 20 feet from the fence. Our unit was &quot;in the field&quot;, so there was no &quot;lights out&quot;, and we were playing pool. Between 22:00 and 00:00 we noticed small white Christmas tree-like lights flickering in the tree tops and started watching them, curious (not constantly).  We then noticed the balls wouldn&apos;t go in the pockets right. They sort of veered away a little. We all thought something peculiar was going on but had no idea what. I started getting the feeling of being watched and mentioned it.  At least one other person had a similar feeling. It was really bothering us and we had a new guy, just seventeen, that it was really freaking out. I can&apos;t remember exactly, and the date and time of day are estimates. I imagined whatever it was could read our minds and I must have been thinking UFO because I thought telepathically to whatever it was to leave before that guy freaked out completely and contact me after I got back home. The odd feeling subsided and I went to bed. A little after laying down I had the sensation of being sucked out of my body. The legs part of me felt like they were at a right angle to how my physical body was laying in the bed and my shoulders and head were still in. I had learned before to fight fear by concentrating on something else, and that&apos;s what I did. I&apos;m not saying I wasn&apos;t afraid that much. I was overwhelmed and consumed by raw fear. But I noticed it made me weaker in the fight against whatever it was, so I conentrated on a girl I knew and the feeling subsided and I was able to get up. I was afraid to try to sleep then, so I went back up to the pool table and wanted to wait until daylight to try to sleep. A while later I went up to the fourth floor to a friend of mine&apos;s room and looked out the window just in time to see an oval shaped object take off out of the top of the trees. It was a fiery orange in color. I had been in that woods many times and there is no swamp or water within miles. There is a large clearing a few hundred yards from our fence so it might have been sitting there. I never told anyone about seeing the UFO until I got home out of the Army. I talked to a guy that was there a few months ago and he still remembers the lights in the trees and the rest of it, but he says he didn&apos;t see anything take off. I never saw another one, but I had many bad experiences for a few years after that that I think were related to it. And I heard one landed about two miles from where I lived about a week after I got home. About two or three years ago my mother told me that my brother would see two guys sitting in a car parked at the end of our driveway when he got up for school in the morning. What&apos;s funny is she doesn&apos;t remember that at all now. I wouldn&apos;t suggest anyone asking them to contact you later. I never thought of myself as being psychic at all before that, but that really changed. Incidentally, I saw the same thing in Indianapolis that was reported on your site under Indiana - Lafayette - on 4/16/05, but it was around December &apos;05, and it kept splitting and going back to one over and over. I&apos;ve had the sense from time to time that some of &quot;them&quot; are actually very friendly but I&apos;m not interested.", "UFO flashing color changing lights over Eugene ORThe object would hover in one spot for a few seconds, and move in cirlces unlike any known aircraft, the whole time flashing combinations of light patterns ranging from blue green red yellow, it even made a triangle of very bright white lights, the lights would change color rapidly, and sometimes the reds would get dim, and then suddenly shift to a very bright green, it was spectacular. It fell out of sight into the horizon a couple times, and I saw the light turn yellow as it streaked away faster than any aircraft could move. This object would appear one one side of the horizon to another very fast, the most amazing thing was the lights, this object was TRYING to put on a light show for us, towards the beggining I did see two airplanes flying near it, not sure if they were just flying by or trying to observe it.This object was definately not fireworks helicopter, or anything explainable by my current knowledge.", "White ball of multicolored lights left 2 foot circle burned in grassAt the age of 5 or 6, while lying in my bed (near the meeting of highway 41 and state route 96) a star appeared to be coming closer. It was at first white, but upon arriving outside my bedroom window different colored lights were visible. It was a perfect sphere with a window and two heads visible (albeit slightly obscured by the bright light in the middle of the night - they did have eyes, but I don&apos;t remember anything else) looking out the window at me. They proceeded to &quot;speak&quot; to me, though there was no way I should logically have been able to hear them. They were calming and reassuring. I was not nervous at all. I wanted to go outside and see them, but before I could think that far they jetted into the starry sky and disappeared. At that young age I thought they must be angels and was afraid to tell anyone about my experience. The next morning I awoke and assumed it was all a dream. However, while playing outside I found a circular burn mark about 2 feet wide next to my window. The grass was burned in a perfect circle that oddly lasted for several years. I returned there about 5 years ago and the circle was gone. Thank you for listening.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.

When it got to the northeast another point of light appeared to travel straight up and meet it.  It seemed like 10-15 seconds passed, then the one i originally saw went straight up as the other one went straight down.  I lost the second one in the trees, but the first one went up a short ways and then appeared to just stop again.  At that point i went in to get my husband who was watching tv and he came out and we both looked at where it was, but it was gone, nothing else was moving.

Arrow Highway was heavy with traffic and we looked over at other cars to see if other people were witnessing the same event in the sky. My friend asked me to pull over; but with traffic so heavy we didn&apos;t get the chance to do so. In less than 2 minutes the object regressed in a westbound direction out of view.

First South and then another one two hours later traveling North.At 4pm on April 20th 2005 I was in my back yard with my kids enjoying the weather. There was not a cloud in the sky and I&apos;ve been watching planes and their contrails. I was following one jet that was directly above me and heading West. Watching the plane a circular object crossed its path heading South. The object reminded me of watching satellite at night. It was traveling at a similar speed as the plane I was watching before. It appeared brighter than the satellite I&apos;ve seen at night and if it was night it would of been as bright as the brightest star.Seeing the object got me excited so I ran upstairs to my bead room to get my camera. I grabbed it and ran back down and managed to take 3 pictures before the batteries died in the camera. I watched the object continue to move south until it came too close to where the Sun was in the sky. After that I couldn&apos;t see it anymore.

I was facing south looking towards the side of the K-Mart store a few houses down at the end of my street wishing to myself that there were not so many lights on that street when, off in the distance, I (barely) noticed this orb-like object.  My first idea was that it was a planet, though that did not make rational sense because it appeared much closer than a planet would to the naked eye.  Suddenly, this object moved sideways to the right, then the left, then upwards a bit and again erratically sideways, sometimes hovering for a second or two but then always resuming its path in moving up.  By this point, my heart began racing because I realized that what I was seeing did not make any sense.  I stood there and watched the object as it continued this erratic pattern across the sky until my view was obscured by the roof over my porch.  I ran outside to the other side of the house so that I was facing east and again found the object continuing its path.  Some people on the beach (I live 2 blocks from the beach) set off some fireworks (the low-grade kind that can be bought at any store around here).  The fireworks shot into the sky a distance roughly equal to 4 or 5 two-story houses.  The orb, by this point, had moved north/northeast past the fireworks and--even with the extra light in the sky, the object did not appear to reflect the light.  For a moment after the fireworks, the object seemed to move a little fast and within seconds of that it disappeared into the clouds.  I stood there in awe for a few seconds waiting for any possible reappearance, but nothing.  Immediately afterwards, I called my family to share what I had just seen. I am still unable to make rational sense of this.  The object made no sound and moved steadily as if on a path, but erratically.  Additionally, the object did not seem to give off any colors as an airplane or helicopter would.  The object was perfectly round, which is why I describe it as an orb.  Because it was night, it was hard to tell if the object itself was colored, the only way I can describe it is that it seemed to blend in with the night sky.  The only reason I noticed the shape is because it had a faint, but distinct outline which seemed to give off a soft glow.  By glow, I do not mean that the object itself was glowing.  I mean the only glow was in the outline.  Beyond that, the only other description I can offer is that the object appeared to have been a dark or matte metallic.", "UFO, most likely a space probe of some typei witnessed an object move from east to west at about 70 to 80 degrees across the sky. the skyline is covered by trees from about 0 degrees to 40 degrees or so. the craft itself was either a diamond or pyramid shaped craft. i am not sure if it had three sides top and bottom or four sides top and bottom. I know that it was very much darker than the star lit sky in the background. I could make out its shape against the background. A red light on each point also helped me to determine its shape and movement. As it moved across the sky, it rotated from point to point, i should say it flipped. It flew as if it was tumbling across the sky, but in a regular fassion, meaning that you could set your watch by its flip. It would flip, a second or two would go by and then it would flip again. It did this continuously as it moved across the sky.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.

At the first stoplight (the one before the train tracks), I could see a VERY bright light about two miles away, near Reagan National Airport. My first thought was that a plane coming in for landing had turned in a way that created a beam which was brighter than usual. As I drove closer I realized the light was stationary--it was not moving. As I rounded the second entrance to the airport I saw a HUGE silver circle with beams of light directed toward the airport or to Andrews Air Force Base visible just across the Potomac. The &quot;disc&quot; was motionless and only about 100 feet off the ground. It was at a slight tilt and the lights were only coming out of the half closest to the ground. I slowed down to a crawl, watching the &quot;ship&quot; and all of a sudden it moved to above the 14th Street Bridge. It did this effortlessly, and I remember thinking that I had not really seen it move--it re-appeared above the 14th Street Bridge, and I got the feeling &quot;it&quot; knew I would be taking that exit. As I moved into the middle lane going into DC I could see it in my rear view mirror. There were other cars around me--I think I saw two on the Parkway, and maybe two or three behind me on the bridge. All of them should have seen this. Additionally, the ship was near the Boeing comples across from the airport. Certainly someone had caught this on a security tape or a controller had seen it from the airport.  When I got home I tried to call the airport only to find out that all the flights had been cancelled due to Hurricane ? (insert appropriate alphabetical name here). I have sent this in before,the night of the sighting, but I am submitting an electronic rendering that I had made the night of the sighting so I wouldn&apos;t forget details. The picture could not show the point that the craft came to--similar to the bottom of a top, but almost flat. There were green blinking lights and the red symbol is not accurate but there were some red symbols in that position. I seriously doubt this was a plane or Boeing experiment, and wish someone could see if there is evidence of it in any number of security cameras that should be in the area.", "Bouncing and rapidly moving &quot;star&quot; in western sky.I observed what, looked just like a star, but it perfomred almost continuous movement in multiple directions for over 30 min. We were in camp site 19 of Green Ridge State Forest when I got up to go out of the tent at about 11:45 pm. I observed what I thought was a firefly going directly back and forth, back and forth and then bouncing up and down. It could move at enourmous speed and sometimes simply blinked out then appeared in a new position. It looked a little like the &quot;follow the bouncing ball&quot; thing from old cartoons, but with the light of an arc welder. It&apos;s distance was impossible to really guage, but it was directly between us and the lights of comberland MD. which was approx. 25 miles away. It increased altitude and decreased altitude a number of times during this kind of random set of movements. It was the lowest observable light in the sky, because of a ridge that was between me and the Comberland skyline. I got out of the tent, watched it for about 10 minutes, then I went back in and woke up my 8hr old son and forced him to be a witness for about another 10 minutes. I kept waiting for it to zip away at some enourmous speed, but it suddenly just faded away in uder a 2nd. The night was crystal clear and it was not much brighter than a really bright star, but it has a kind of bluish intensity that made it more than sparkle. It was no larger than a good sized star, but its movements were reallky significant. It was covering what would have been about 6 inches of sky between my outstreched hands.

No jets of any kind, including small Lears can land at this airport.  The runways are too short, for one thing.  As I turned off Roods Lake Road (airport address) east onto Haines Road, a huge shadow passed over my car.  It was so big that I thought, &quot;What the hell was that!?&quot;  There was no noise.  I drove a few more feet, slowly now, up the road all the way looking to my right.  A line of trees blocked my view for several hundred yards, but when I could see I came to a stop and looked hard.

The thing that makes it even stranger is that this thing looked &apos;cloaked.&apos;  By that, I mean you couldn&apos;t see it at a glance, but if you stared (like I did), you could see the shape and the size being surrounded by some kind of shiny, reflective shield or something.

Rather, it moved around in an odd little path for probably just over a minute and seemed to diminish in brightness and size as it did so, until I really couldn&apos;t follow it anymore, it was so tiny.

After quite a while, the &quot;craft&quot; suddenly shifted from vertical and took off leaving a jetstream behind, vanishing into the east sky.  Awesome.((NUFORC Note:  We presume the witness means a &quot;contrail,&quot; rather than a &quot;jetstream.&quot;  The latter is a meteorological phenomenon.  PD))", "DEFINITELY NOT FROM AROUND HERE!I was taking a girlfriend of mine home. We live in Louisville, KY. She had recently moved way out by a Ford plant, on Westport Road. At that time (1980) the roads were very winding and the whole area wasn&apos;t that developed. There were those huge power lines everywhere on the side of the road like you see in such rural areas. We were both 21 years old, and we had been up late because she wanted to discuss some troubling family issues that had just ocurred. I took her home and from my house (in Fern Creek)it was a very long way out there. I then drove back the same road and was moving right along in my Mustang when I got to a winding part of the road, and slowed for safety sake. Suddenly I saw a craft that was similar in body perhaps to a helicopter, in that it was long and may have been wider at the front than the rear. I only noticed it had a high beam light on me. I knew it could very possibly be a police helicopter, and figured it was just what it was. It kept putting the beam on me and scared me. I was afraid maybe they were looking for some escaped criminal or something and may have thought I fit their description. I saw that the craft though was so low to the ground that it was amazing. I suddenly thought that if it was that low, which was at the first draping power line of the two, that it may get tangled into them and then I&apos;d be affected by the mess. I was scared that it would cause an accident, so I stopped the car and watched it. It was hovering perfectly still in the air, but was that low, and had NO SOUND AT ALL. I even rolled down the window a bit because I thought maybe they would come on a bull horn or something. All the time I couldn&apos;t see much of the thing because of this beam directed at me. It didn&apos;t get entangled, though that close to the lines, and I figured before it did, I&apos;d race ahead and get out of there and did so. Strangely, it went up into the sky then but again, not all that high in altitude. Then I went all the way home, maybe 30 miles, and it had followed me every inch of the way, sometimes higher up in the sky, others lower, and I was horrified maybe it WAS the police. Then I got home, and parked in our back driveway and saw it flying in the sky slowly, in both directions, no pattern. I thought that was very weird, and it seemed it had followed me so long and far, that I ran into our house. I have always thought it was a UFO though I didn&apos;t ever know if I did or did not believe in them and still don&apos;t know for sure. But when I think back on that night, I picture driving and where it was I saw it so close to those power lines, and suddenly I realize I&apos;m recalling the right spot I was driving, but in the wrong direction. I was going homeward on that particular curve, and yet I always recall it as if going toward her apartment instead. That is very weird to me. The craft had been pretty low when I pulled into the driveway and I watched it after turning out the car lights. Suddenly it zipped up into the sky above my backyard so fast it was a mere speck. THAT is when I didn&apos;t think it was a police helicopter and the other reason was that a chopper always makes some big propeller sound, but even close to me as it was on that road by the power lines, it was SILENT. I also later heard others say that weird sitings happened around POWER LINES and wonder if they someway tap into the power or something. I am a professional person and college educated, reasonable and have never taken one drug in my life. It was definitely NOT from around here..((NUFORC Note:  One of two similar reports from the same source.  We have posted both reports.  PD))", "triangle shaped UFO with a light on each endIt was the scariest thing I saw that night. It was a triangle. It had a white light on one corner, a blue light at another corner and a red one at the third corner. The white light was flashing. It move very quickly across the Eastern sky. It went from South to North and then disappeared. I was looking through binoculars.", "Dim small light shoots across sky in wavy line, nmo tailI wa hiding behind some garages away from my home smoking with a friend when i was a teenager.  I was looking up to the starry sky when we saw what we thought to be a shooting star.  we then realised that the small pin size light had tail like most shooting stars.  I would have thought it to be a satelitte however the dim light never went in a straight line but waving from side to side.

This shot was taken facing due east. As I was framing the picture, using a through-the-lens camera, and while depressing the shutter I saw an object flash across the screen at a very high rate of speed. I looked immediately to see if I had captured the object in the digital image and I had. I am a professional consultant, and while I have some interest in UFO phenomenon, had not previously had any other experience of this type. I did some adjustments of the photo&apos;s to better view the object, but that&apos;s about it.

Was recently at your site, and at the same time came across the pictures again, and decided to submit it, unfortunately 2 years after the fact.

It rose suddenly, hovered, then dived and sped away.I noticed a flashing, silvery glint off in the west as I was driving home.   I thought it was a piece of trash in the air at first, but it had a very bright, metallic glint to it and it was holding altitude and moving along toward the south-southeast, dipping and climbing a little in a very odd manner.   I stopped and watched it;  the flashing continued in an irregular, fluttery fashion, and it continued its southerly motion at a deliberate pace that seemed very much at odds with the wind at the time, which was calm at the surface. After perhaps two minutes of observation, the object was due south of me;  it suddenly rose very rapidly to a position probably 70 degrees above the horizon and stood motionless.   It continued to flash and I could see a black phase alternating between the bright ones.   There was no discernable shape and the size was just sufficient to give me the impression of angularity.  If you imagine a rectangular mirror of a few square feet of area, perhaps half a mile away, tumbling and twisting randomly, but hanging still in the air, that&apos;s what this thing reminded me of.  It seemed to be relatively close,  I would guess between a quarter and a half a mile, but probably not over a mile.  As it hung in the sky, flashing, I could occasionally see hints of color and there was occasionally a sense of a sort of fuzzy distortion immediately around the light. It continued to hold in position for approximately a minute and then it suddenly dived down at a very rapid rate and then shot off horizontally just above the southeastern horizon, traveling roughly east-southeast.   It vanished behind some buildings and trees.   Surface winds were light and variable, with a breeze of perhaps one or two miles per hour.  Temperature was in the eighties, the time was a few minutes before one in the afternoon.  The sky was perfectly clear and visibility was on the order of eighty miles or better. The only thing I can think of that might have behaved like this would be a small piece of aluminized mylar caught in a thermal.  But this object was moving a relatively high rate of speed for most of the time I was observing it;  the winds present at the time cannot account for this motion.   The zoom to high altitude might have been caused by a thermal,   but the hover and very rapid descent to low altitude (around 100 feet) followed by a rapid translational motion is beyond anything I know that thermals are likely to do.", "In a moonlit sky, traveling from the west and turning to the southeast, it traversing an open space 30 degrees above the horizon to a position directly overhead where it disappeared out of view over the occupant&apos;s house heading in a turn.

This craft was estimated to be traveling at 4000MPH and was a chunky &quot;V&quot; shape with a discernible thickness approx. equal to the width of the body legs. It was silent even though it passed directly overhead. The angle of the legs to each other was approx. 45 degrees with blunt ends to the legs.

At first, I thought it was just an errant helium balloon -- we see those floating in the same way often enough.  But as we watched, we realized it couldn&apos;t be a balloon.  The object appeared to be shiny, silver and spherical.  We were unable to judge the size or distance, but it did not seem to be moving up or down (as a helium balloon would).  It moved across the sky (approx. west to east) at a steady pace and altitude -- perhaps at the speed of an airplane.", "4 lights moving slowly and disappearing with loud boomAround 20:45 on 6/29/2005, my 13 year old son ran into the house asking for a camera as he saw something strange in the sky. About 90 sec after he went back outside, there was a tremendous boom. My son states that he saw 4 lights that appeared to be on a circular object moving very slowly southward. The object disappeared at the same time of the extremely loud boom.((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides two interesting photos.  PD))", "It hovered over the park for several minutes then suddenly took off at incredible speed.I have never told this to anyone until now except for close relatives.  This happened when I was 14 years old, but I remember it vividly to this day.  I was visiting my aunt and uncle who lived in Lima, Peru in South America at the time.  I had gone up to the balcony of their home.  Across the street was a large park about 4 city square blocks. I had climbed on to the balcony to look down at the park to see if I could spot any of my friends playing there.  As I did so I saw that everyone in the park, and there were many people, were all looking up, so I looked up as well.  As I did I was so startled that at first I thought the sun was crashing down upon us, but in that split second I realized that what I was looking at was stationary and was not going to crash on top of us.  Then I realized I was seeing a circular material object that was very huge and bright white. It was hovoring over the trees at very close range.  It was at least the size of the park itself.  It cast a huge shadow over the park.  It hovered there for what seemed several minutes.  It seemed to be spinning quite rapidly.  Then, suddenly out of the blue it took off at incredible speed and disappeared.  I was stunned I was not sure what I had just witnessed, but eventually I came to the realization that it must have been some type of space ship.  When I looked back down at the park no one was looking up, and everyone seemed to be going about there business as if nothing had happened.  This was something that impressed me a great deal, because at that age I was hardly interested in UFO&apos;s or any such thing.  I was a typical 14 year old kid. UFO&apos;s were the last thing on my mind.  It left me completely dumb founded for quite some time.((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

Later one returned to the same sky and would move quickly one direction to the next and then stopped then seemed to disappear.", "oval slow moving crafti was outside walking my dog and i noticed a white to orangish oval craft approaching from the west. the craft was glowing  but not extremely bright. it was  moving slowly,just gliding along above the tree tops ,maybe 500 feet?? when it got close to the city water tower it became dimmer. i only saw it a few seconds after that and it was gone. this has made me a little nervous. also it made no sound.", "Immense in size, Cheveron or &quot;V&quot; shaped, silent until it turned, then there was a thunderous roar.On June 12th, 2005, at 20:33 hours, while taking an evening stroll with my wife and son, near twilight hours, in the community of Bear Valley Springs, located just outside the city of Tehachapi, CA we the three of us spotted a very unusual aircraft. The evening was dead quite when the craft was spotted. My son was the first to have seen it. Then, my wife and myself. At a first glance it appeared to me as a regular plane in the distance with possibly landing gear down creating twinkling lights that veried from red to white. However, within a split second I realized that it made no noise and it was enormous in size realtive to the mountains that it was slowly moving past. Then, an immense roar seemed to propel it heading East. When it turned it was difficult to conceive the overall size. Also, as it turned it revealed more lights appearing in a cheveron or &quot;V&quot; shape. I believe it had to be moving very rapidly, but not as one might perceive when something of normal appearing size moves. I say this because anything of such immense proprtions would have to have a significant speed to propel it out of view in such a short time. We were unable to make out an outline. However, when it turned I ran from the top of the road, down into my house. I grabbed a digital camera and shot some video. I thought the video was worthless. With my naked eye I could faintly see the craft, so I thought the camera was not picking-up anythiong of value. After reviewing the video on my computer, I was embarrassed because I sounded rediculous with excitement. I even phoned the local police that night because I thought for sure we could not have been the only people to have seen it. Recently, after finding this site I saw a picture that had lights that seemed similar. A cheveron or &quot;V&quot; type object, so I took another peak at the video. I ran through the video frame by frame. Frames of the craft appear insignificant, bouncy, and have nothing to compare relative size, but two frames one is able to identify a string of lights. What is viewable could be the back of the craft, as it had already turned towards the South/East towards Mojave. I took that picture, using some simple photo tools, I enhanced the brightness of the object to try to see an outline. I will submit the picture to you. I am not a UFO buff, I would say it had to be military. However, due to the immense size of the craft puts a immense question mark inside my brain. Why so damn big! I was USAF for six years. I saw a lot of aircraft. While I was stationed at Edwards AFB it was not uncommon to see the B-2 Bomber flying around as we played golf, but this was no B-2. In size there was no comparison and while the B-2 has deceptive lines in flight it is not silent. I&apos;m still bewildered.", "My mother brother and friend were in the back yard looking around at the sky, why, at that point I had no Idea they told me they (brother and friend) were walking and saw something strange in the sky so my mother came out and we started to look around all of a sudden this hudge oval disk with a bunch of lights came hovering silghtly just over the tree tops about 100ft above us. it had a slight humming sound but just so.

My wife pointed out an object flying in the sky above us, and about 7 of us saw it (four adults and three children). The object was a boomerang/flying wing shape, and it was very large, larger than any craft that I have seen or am familiar with.  It was flying slowly across the sky approximately south, and it had a unique engine sounds, similar to powerful jet engines, but quieter.  The body was dark and barely visible, and it had small blinking red lights across the length of the craft (approximately 7 or 8 lights).  The lights appeared to blink without a pattern, which seemed kind of strange, and they did not resemble the lights normally seen on the commercial aircraft that fly over regularly.  There was (what appeared to be) a fighter aircraft that flew by a bit west and somewhat behind the craft.  We assumed that it was an escort, as it did not appear to be in pursuit, although it was clearly following/staying close.  It would occasionally bank and maneuver. Strangely, about 10 minutes later, another similar craft flew over going in the same direction.  This one was further away from us, but it also appeared to be smaller.  It had similar lights and appeared to have a similar body shape, although it was difficult to tell.  It also emitted the same jetlike sounds.

I was at my then girlfriends house, sitting on some steps in her backyard. She has a very large back yard which pretty much surrounds the entire house from all sides. We were sitting in the area to the left of the house, so the house was to our right. Directly in front of us was her drive way which curved from the street towards her house. I was looking up at the sky, as I like to do so many nights, to admire the stars, and as I looked to my right towards the house, I saw a red ball of fire which looked to be steady over the house. It was not a huge ball, but much larger than what stars look like, and much closer. At first glance I took it to be a flare as it had the resemblence of one. Its no movement also made me think of it as a flare as I know flares are known to stay in place in the air for a brief moment. So all this was not strange to me yet. Here is where the story gets a little weird, upon seeing it, I focused my attention on it. My girlfriend was sitting to my right, but had not seen the object yet. I called her attention to the object, and as she focused on it, at that exact moment, it seemed like the object became aware of me pointing it out to her. She saw it, but for a brief moment, because at that point the object streaked upwards towards the right and then dove down behind the house. Not saying it landed behind the house, but is shot downward behind the houses path of view making it no longer visible. I immediately realized that it was not a flare, because a flare would not have that sort of movement and speed after being in the air. It moved so fast that it literally left a streak of red behind it for a few brief seconds. This object seemed to have full control of its movements, and furthermore, seemed to be conscious of our presence, as if it were watching us. That incident freaked me out but also intrigued me as I have been interested in UFO&apos;s since a very early age. I definitely think what I saw was a UFO or some sort of surveillance device, used by who, I don&apos;t know. I have had other sightings, but less conclusive than this one. My uncle is also a big UFO buff and has experienced sightings. A flare, it definitely was not, something else, in my opinion it was.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.  PD))", "15 objects were doing maneuvers and then 9 objects flew at a very slow speed in pattern over our heads.It was about 3 in the afternnon and we were swimming in our pool. My wife saw these things up in the sky. We looked up in the southwestern sky and saw about 15 objects hovering and doing manuevers. They were in this mode for about 10 minutes. They then came in a formation directly over our head. They flew slowly in formation for about 5 minutes. At this time  the shapes were very visible. They had a long body shape like a plane with wings. Only 9 of these objects were flying in this formation. The others just disappeared. After they flew overhead in formation they then did their little dance again. About 2 minutes later they got back into formation and they were out of our sight. These objects were not a plane. Planes cannot do these moves. They were flying at a relatively high altitiude. I would guess about 10 - 15,000 feet up. My wife and I are both college grads. I work in the medical implant field and she is a stay at home mother of two.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he seemed to us to be both serious-minded, and credible.", "Even more &quot;Phoenix Lights&quot;, this time over what seemed to be Southwest PhoenixBetween 9:27pm and 10:48pm myself and two others witnessed more &quot;Phoenix Lights&quot; over what seemed to be Southwest Phoenix. Our vantage point was from North Central Phoenix near Deer Valley Airport. The lights were very far off in the distance and low on the horizon. The first time they appeared there was approximately eight or ten of them clustered together. They were all amber in color with the exception of one red one. They were present for about two minutes before fading out. They appeared again further Southwest about 10 minutes later, but there were only two. They lasted again for about two minutes and faded one after the other. About two minutes later they appeared in the same location in the sky, but there were three of them which also disappeared after about two minutes one by one. They continued to appear in different quantities for quite some time as they moved further away. I my uncle and I did manage to get some pictures of them.

She attempted to look out the window to see something (At this time I was not aware that her call was about a ufo). She then ran out the door asking her brother to go with her. After several minutes I called her on her cell phone to ask her why she ran out of the house.She told me that she was looking at a ufo. I immediatly grabbed my camera and ran outside to see. Many people were looking at this black circular shaped object hovering in the sky above Brooklyn somewhere. We observed the object from 7th st. between Ave&apos;s B &amp; C. It hovered for a long time in the same location sometimes getting closer and other times moving away but never really leaving its position in the sky. The object appeared to wobble and also possesed a light corona. Not to far from it was a second object that hovered but was fainter and from time to time would completely vanish from site. After about 20 minutes it started to fade, it was however begining to get dark which might explain it&apos;s slow disapearence. After waiting a long time we decided to go up to the roof of the building and observe from there. At that point it started to get dark faster and the object faded further but was still visible.We decided to go in as we had no devices to zoom in on the object. This is the first time I am reporting a ufo but not the first time I have observed one. When I was in my twenties I worked for Fairchild Republic. The creators of the A-10 wharthog and other military aircraft on Long Island. I understand the mechanics of flight and it&apos;s characteristics. It was unusual for something of this nature to hover for so long in one loction.

The woman reported that at 02:53 hrs. (local) on Friday morning, May 20, 2005, she had witnessed from here home in Fergus Falls a &quot;bright red sphere&quot; in the southern sky.  She reported that the light was &quot;solid, not blinking,&quot; and that it was moving to the west, i.e. from her left to right.

The object appeared on the horizon as a glowing orange ball of light that was traveling from south to north.  I was not able to tell the altitude of the craft, but seemed to be the same as passenger jet airliner&apos;s.  The sky was clear and people all around the lake were setting off their fireworks, so I know a lot more people were able to see the craft because they were all ready looking up at the night sky.

It looked like when a firework shoots up and it bright green but it was just sittin there and rocking side to side very subtly. Also I noticed a police officer immediately pull into the parking lot ahead and another one go down a road ahead right under where the object would have been. The second I received my food and pulled out in the exact spot about a couple hundred to 1000 yards in front 100ft up where i had seen the lights there was nothing.

There was no drinking or intake of drugs whatsoever. We are guessing this took place around 1:30 am but do not know the time for sure. The object was circular in shape. The object hovered about 50 yards over a house in Henrietta. The middle was dark red (lit up) and the outside trim changed from light blue to dark blue. It stayed in one spot for about six seconds and then moved to the left for about six seconds then right for about five or six seconds and then it took off to the northeast which is where it came from and was out of sight.

A light in the sky caught our attention, so we decided to stand there and observe it.  It was a red light with a tail located in the sky above the field directly across the street from the restaurant.  At first, we thought it was a flare, but quickly dismissed that it wasn&apos;t because it wasn&apos;t moving upwards.  Rather, it was moving very slowly towards our direction.  The tail faded out as the light slowed down to a stop and eventually became a solitary red light.  We watched it for several minutes and during this time, it stayed stationary.  We ran through all of the possibilities of what it could be and we were just stunned having seen nothing like this before.  I even remember looking around the packed parking lot and seeing if anyone else was observing the same thing.  We decided to move on because nothing was happening.  After walking a short distance, I thought to myself to just take one more look.  I&apos;m glad I did because what I observed next was shocking.The red light had grown into a full-fledged self-contained exploding orb in the sky.  I know that sounds weird, but it&apos;s almost as if the light were in a clear balloon and exploding within the balloon.  There was no sound as this happened either and we thought that was weird.  Next, the bright orb dimmed and became white, then split into three separate white orbs.  Two headed southward and one headed northward.    The two headed southward traveled a short distance until one literally faded out and the other looked perfectly like a star amongst the others in the night sky and just stayed there.  The one headed northward also faded ever so slightly at a slow pace in the sky and also eventually looked like another star in the night sky.That is what we observed from the time the red light caught our attention until the three orbs faded and blended in with the night sky.((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch out of Cape Canaveral.

As I made a right turn onto stearns , I looked to my left side and I saw a triangular object in the sky.  It seem to be the same object I had seen maybe two years earlier on studebaker rd in long beach around 12 midnight.  Ever since the first sighting ive been keeping my eyes open. As I made the turn I saw the UFO and it was flying low and was extremely quiet/ hovering over some homes, some 40 feet in the air maybe higher. As I was heading east on stearns the object was parrallel to me and was heading west. I noticed there were no cars around, so i slammed on my brakes turned off my radio and rolled down the window. I heard no sound coming from the object and since there was no traffic I made a quick U turn. As soon as i made the U turn (now heading west) I was trying to intersect it to make sure it was the same object i had seen before but as I hit clark st. The object made a quick 80 to 90 degree turn and just disappeared. My vision was blocked by some trees and as I was on the corner of stearns and clark the object just vanished. It seemed like it knew what i was doing. This area is near the long beach airport and I know for a fact that this is not a place to do testing of military planes. Ive never called the l.b airport or authorities since I know they wont do anything about it but it was a triangular shaped object, black, it had some lights on each corner of the triangle and was extremely silent. This happen to be the second time i saw this object in the same area. The first time i saw this object was about 2002-2003 at around midnight Iam not to certain of the date. I was staring into the nights sky and was driving south on studebaker when all of a sudden i noticed the object dropping altitude rapidly. I figured it was a plane since the airport of long beach is so close. As the object dropped i slowed down.Since there was no traffic i completely stopped my car in the middle of the road and another vehicle traveling beside me was also slowed down but kept on going. I a stared at the object it must of been close enough to me that i could of gotten out of my car and hit it with a baseball. As I sat in my car with the windows down and looking up at the object which had to be hovering was going so slow and there was NO sound whatsoever coming out of this object. I could clearly see the details of the triangular object. It had lights on the tips of the triangle and was extremely silent.As it kept heading towards me by the time it hovered over my car for a brief couple of seconds it made a 45 degree turn and started going towards the residential homes. Thats when i made the same turn in my car trying to follow it but as I made the turn the object took off over the homes at a very very fast speed. Something a plane cant do. As i made the turn west I hit a school with a tall fence which I jumped out of my car and climbed the fence so i could get a better close view of it,I also did it just to make sure i wasnt going crazy but all i saw was the back end of object hovering over the homes at a high rate of speed and it vanished. Once again i didnt call the authorities since i didnt want to cause any problems for myself.", "Aprroximately around 21:45 I was Travelling westbound on the Loop 101 North Freeway in Phoenix.

I first spotted it a 9:03pm (Sprint time on my cell phone) at approximately 123-degrees magnetic bearing from my location at approx. 7-degrees elevation.  It was a bright, steady red light, comparable in brightness to that of the red navigation light on a small general aviation aircraft, of which there were two or three in the south pattern at Gillespie Field Airport at the time.  The color of red seemed slightly deeper than standard navigation light red.  The object was moving very slowly but steadily from south to north and ascending slightly.  After about 5 minutes, it began to flicker a bit.  The flickering progressed with time to where at 9:15pm it was flickering as if a flame being blown by wind.  No regularity to the flickering. At 9:17pm, the light flickered out as if it was a flame source that ran out of fuel.  I watched it through the telescope as the last glimmer of its light flickered out...and it was gone.  Last bearing, approx. 107-deg magnetic, 12-deg elevation.  (Based on alignment with Polaris(north star) and subtracting local magnetic variation of about 13-deg.)  Its appearance through the telescope gave no more details than looking at a bright star through the telescope.  There was no smoke trail visible as I might expect from a burning flare.  flares can leave a smoke trail in the air that their own light will illuminate.  There was no parachute or balloon visible that might have been illuminated by the light of a flare.  No falling sparks visible.

It may have been launched from the vicinity of Grossmont College and carried to the east by light winds to over El Cajon where it extinguished.

I was in my kitchen in West St. Paul looking out the window west northwest towards downtown Minneapolis 11 miles away from me. I saw a bright light over Minneapolis. I knew it was the landing light of a large jet on a downwind leg to land at Minneapolis International Airport. My 10 year old son was the only one home with me at the time. He was in the living room watching t.v. The jet was coming directly toward me and also decending, so it looked from my perspective like a stationary light in the sky that was just growing larger and larger. So I thought it would be fun to play a joke on my son, so I said come quick, there&apos;s a U.F.O!&quot; He came running. We looked out the window at the landing light on the jet growing larger and larger. My son was in awe! We watched it for about 2 minutes and then as it became near enough to us, we could finally see the red and green wingtip navigation lights and a blinking white strobe light on it&apos;s belly. I said to my son &quot;oh boy, I guess it was just a jet plane after all!&quot; (At this point, I would say that the jet was about 2 miles from us, maybe a bit farther). No sooner  had I finished saying that, both he and I saw a large spherical ball, I would guess about 50 feet in diameter, descend to Earth from an altitude much higher than the jet was flying. We were right at the window, and the object entered our fields of vision from the top of the window opening, so it must have come from an extremely high altitude. I have seen many meteors, and this was no meteor. When it first appeared, it was falling in a slight arcing travel path from northeast to southwest, but very quickly changed into a strightline fall directly down all the way to Earth and disappeared behind the treeline. We didn&apos;t see it rise up again. I think it struck the Earth. I know it wasn&apos;t a meteor because it fell much more slowly than a meteor would, like it&apos;s speed of descent was being controlled (imagine a meteor with a large drag chute, if you will.) The object was glowing in a very faint, light blue aura that reminded me of what a blue topaz gemstone looks like. It was EXTREMELY beautiful! Me and my son looked at each other in amazement and we both said &quot;what was that?!&quot; at the same time!  I say there were 4 witnesses to this sighting because the object came down in it&apos;s path of travel directly between me and my son and the two pilots of the jet.  I know that there is NO WAY that those 2 pilots could have missed seeing it! I watched the T.V. news and the newspapers for a few days afterwards hoping that there were many more witnesses and that there was a story to be told, but I never heard a word about it. I&apos;m not exactly sure of the date being March 10th, but I am sure it was in early March at about 6 p.m. I&apos;m reporting it now, because as the weeks have gone passed, I am at an absolute loss to explain what I saw and I&apos;ll just bust if I don&apos;t tell somebody! If this object indeed came to a rest on Earth, I would estimate it&apos;s current location would be along a line between the north end of the city of West St. Paul and downtown Minneapolis about 2, maybe 3 miles from West St. Paul toward Minneapolis. I would guess it hit the ground near Cherokee Park in St. Paul, or perhaps in the Mississippi River between the Ford Dam and downtown St. Paul. I will never forget it&apos;s slow fall and beautiful faint light blue glow! Like an angel&apos;s halo!!!((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))Hi! The best I could do to reconstruct the date was to look at our calender back in March for any unusual events. My wife gets home from work at 5:30 p.m., so she would have been home, but she wasn&apos;t. The only thing the calender shows is that on Mar. 8th, she was gone in the evening to our church for bible a study, so I believe now that the sighting was on Mar. 8th, 2005, not Mar 10th. I didn&apos;t contact any investigators or authorities because this sphere was just so unusual that it just couldn&apos;t have been anything easily explainable (from Earth!). I figured if I watched the news carefully, the two jet pilots or the FAA controllers at Mpls. International would be speaking about it, or the fact that this thing came down near sunset but still very much in broad daylight in the center of a major metropolitan area would mean there were probably many thousands of witnesses, but nothing in the news ever appeared. If I ever see anything like that again, I will certainly take careful notes, now that I have somebody like you guys that I can tell about it. I&apos;m 48 yrs. old, and I&apos;ve never seen anything like that in my life! I kinda hope I don&apos;t see one ever again!

There was no way it was a plane or helicopter from its flight pattern. It stopped and moved in erratic directions in a way no human made craft could. Also it seemed to traverse vast distances across the city quickly but move like a butterfly with soft motion. At one point it seemed very red and got long like a straight line with a hook on one end. There seemed to be 3 bright points, one at each end and one in the middle. Im interested if anyone else saw this. My best guess is that it was over gateway/coburg area, possibly closer to downtown eugene. At one point it almost landed. There were no noticable lights on the object, rather it seemed to completely glow and be made of light itself.", "Short sighting of UFOI was out at the pool, reading, when my glance happen to to catch a movement to the upper right of my line of sight. I turned my head and saw an aircraft and, wanted to see exactly what kind of aircraft it was, I turned on my side to get a better view. It was flying near east and the sky was cloudless for the most part. I found the flight path to be very odd so I began to think it was a bird but i realized that it was much too big. Its path was straight, although seeming to have some angualar velocity that was up. The most striking thing about the object that I noticed was the smoothness of the flight. Although one would not consider other aircraft to be unsmooth, this had a striking quality to it. It was triangular, exact detial I could not see. Its color was dark, although I could not tell exactly. It moved quickly from what I could tell given its relative size and height. It moved toward the tree line, although never reaching it, disappearing within an instance into the cloudness area of the sky. All of this occured in about a minute.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))", "an object travelling at an alarming speed across the skyAs my girlfriend and I were sighning up for volunteer work, I noticed a streak of light going across the sky at a very alarming speed. It was travelling from east to west in a straight line starting at the horizon to my right and was going at a speed I&apos;m sure that no jets can possibly fly at. Unable to determine how high it was, the city skyline in that direction was very clearand there were few clouds in the sky.  Although there was commercial traffic, it seemed to be higher and much much faster.As it neared  the end of the horizon it seemed to just go out of sight.", "silver disc sighted on Waterloo Bridge, London, England in 1983I was in the back seat of my boyfriends car, my friend was in the front passenger seat and my boyfriend was the driver. We were crossing Waterloo Bridge,London when we were halted by traffic. As we sat waiting suddenly to my left a space craft, disk shaped and silver in colour appeared to just drop out of the sky and hovered in front of us to the left of our car. It was huge, hovered in a tilted position, at this point i could see windows all around the craft like portholes, i am sure something was looking out.At the bottom of the craft i noticed a kind of eluminous blue light, like an electric blue colour but softer. I looked to all the people crossing the bridge. It was as though some of the people were frozen. The ones that were frozen were the ones who were pointing up to the craft in amazement. The others appeared not to see the craft at all. These people continued on but appeared slow, it was almost as though time was standing still, like a photo. Suddenly it just vanished. Just shot off and was so fast that it was like magic. I was in shock i looked at my boyfriend and said &quot;Did you see that&quot;. He asked me what, he had not seen it, which was amazing as he was the closest to the object. I then looked at my friend and said &quot;Did you see that?&quot; She looked terrified and said &quot;Yes&quot;. I told her i was glad she had seen it too as if i told people that i had seen a flying saucer they would think i had  gone mad. But the fact that we had both seen it made me feel more comfortable.

My curiosity in the skies of this area has been piqued since the other day when I saw 3 black triangles in broad daylight immediately following a black helicopter acting very strange. I called my brother over to watch the satellite in case of the remote possibility it was more than that. It wasn&apos;t, and he wasn&apos;t impressed. I made a phone call, and maybe five minutes later, I saw another satellite coming from southwest, heading northeast to the same point that the first one was headed. I couldn&apos;t believe my luck --- I constantly watch the sky, constantly watch for satellites, and I&apos;m lucky if I see one every couple of weeks or months. I decided to run to the baseball field across the street in order to get a better look at the satellite, somewhere where it wouldn&apos;t be obstructed by trees. I had to stop several times along the way so as not to lose my bearings on the satellite. When I finally got there, the satellite was fading out in the distance. Immediately thereafter, another satellite came from a more westerly direction, heading in the same direction as the other two. Three satellites in under 10 minutes? Again, I couldn&apos;t believe my luck. I called my fiancee, looking for another witness so I wouldn&apos;t think I was losing my mind again in one week. I watched this &quot;satellite&quot; for about a minute when it started to band to its right --- not subtly, drastically. Then it stopped --- just stopped dead for about 30 seconds. It then started up again at an even greater speed, travelling northeast again now. At one point, it appeared as though a little flash came off of it, perhaps blue/purple like a flash of lighting at night? though relegated to the area directly beside it. That was two nights ago. Last night, I spent hours with my fiancee looking at a clear sky for satellites. I did see one, moving west to east, but it disappeared before it even passed over us. This seemed a lot more normal, but I am completely uneducated as far as satellite flight paths go. On another note, my first time accessing this website was on Friday. I was more than shocked to learn of the alarming frequency at which people see black triangular &quot;craft&quot;, especially in groups of three, especially with a haze around it. My first clue was actually seeing it in person. One particular liting from Chicago has the witness mentioning that it looked like a kite, which was my first instinct, but there is no possible way these are one kite, let alone 3 --- not at these altitudes, not at these speeds. Do satellites act like this? What is up with these black triangles?

As she went to get the video camera (and found that all four batteries were dead, even though we just charged them not long ago), I watched the lights &quot;rotate&quot; on a central axis and then could make out a dimmer fourth light, at this point I realized that the pattern formed a perfect triangle shape, similar to the &quot;Star Destroyers&quot; from the Star Wars movies.  I could make out one bright light at the point and three across the back, one in the center and one at either &quot;point&quot;.

We were about 2-3 miles or so NE of Camp Horno On a night firing range where we were scheduled to do a familarization fire on a 200 meter course at 1/2 size silhouette targets using M-16 Rifles with Starlite scopes mounted on them.There was a 1st Lt., a 1st Sgt.,and a Cpl.(troop handler) in charge of the training. Three squads of Marines were lined up behind three bench rest positions and there were three Rifle and Starlite Scopes to be used for the firing. It was just getting dark enough to shoot when one of the Marines in my squad called me to the front of the line and pointed with his finger to what appeared(with the naked eye ) to be a star in a northerly direction just above the horizon. It looked like it was approximately 1-3 miles away.The &quot;star&quot; appeared to be changing colors like the twinkling effect of a star that you might see on any given night. The weather was clear and the stars were out and was providing good ambient light to enable us to see astonishing detail as we viewed what was vey plainly a saucer craft that was hovering slightly above a small mountain peak in the distance. Using the Starlite Scope(1X or 2x,), the craft appeared quite close. It was a classic saucer shape,dark in color, like black graphite,not shiny; similar to what the Stealth Aircraft of the 90&apos;s looked like. There were no visible landing gear,or other protuberances of any kind, nor were there any apparent &quot;hatches&quot; or doors, entrances etc. visible. The most noticible thing about the saucer was the five portholes and the bright light eminating from them,and the turret (not dome), that was slowly rotating counter clockwise. The portholes were an estimated 20 feet apart, and appeared to be tinted.  The portholes were eminating bright light in various colors; red,blue green, amber(or yellow), and white.  The source of the light was a very powerful beam emitter similar to a brillant light house beacon, and appeared to be stationary in the approximate center of the craft. The twinkling effect seemed to be due to the revolving of the turret which caused the tinted portholes to eminate the various colors described;however,through the scope we could not only clearly see the different colored portholes. We could see through them into the interior of the craft as well. The interior of the craft was consistent in symmetry to the shape of the craft&apos;s outward apparence.  The walls were curved, rounded and the floor was flat but the interesting fact was that there was no visible control center; no consoles, instruments,desks, chairs, or items,objects or property --nothing at all.We could only see into the right side of the craft; perhaps 49% of the interior space from our angle of observation. After about 5-10 minutes the craft went down behind the peak and stayed there about 5 minutes.  Just about the the time we were ready to start firing, the craft rose back up above the peak.  A short time later two more of the saucers,identical in appearance to the first, rose up, one on each side of the first craft, only lower in the sky, forming a triangular shaped formation. All three of the saucers moved slowly accross the sky to the East and then stopped. The first saucer started moving now SE at an increasing rate of speed until it reached a &quot;pivot-point&quot; and shot off in a reverse angle,of about 45% to the west at an incredibly fast speed; much faster than the military jets of the day(F-4 Phantoms and A-6 Intruders).When the craft hit the atmosphere  the front of it starting giving off tremendous sparks and a tail of fire like a comet 3-4 times the length of the saucer, trailed behind it. About 30 seconds later it was out of sight. The outher two craft repeated the same manuever and disappeared at the same point in the sky. During the observation of these saucer craft no noise was heard coming from them at any time. The area that they were in, while on or near the ground, was in a restricted area, possibly an artillary impact area. The craft displayed speeds of travel that were far in excess of any known aircraft in existence then or now and performed turning manuevers that were, according to my knowledge never seen before and even now years later.  The technological capability displayed by these craft I believe far exceeds anything I know to exist on earth. As a group we did not talk about what we saw since we were seriously concentrating on our training which was preparing for Vietnam. After the last saucer was gone, one of the Marines asked our Lt. if he was going to report the incident.

Above/beyond the birds I noticed an object slowly moving northward.  It immediately gave me chills because it didn&apos;t look like any flying vehicle I&apos;d ever seen (and since I grew up in Wichita KS I&apos;ve seem them all). For a moment I thought it might be a stealth fighter, since the nation was gearing up for the first Iraq war at the time, but the object had no wings or rotors or wheels, just a smooth oval (almond or maybe flattened egg) shape, slightly narrower in front, with a small oval bump on top. I couldn&apos;t determine surface details since the sun was down and I could only see a black silhouette against the sky.  It made no noise, there were no lights. When I first saw it, it was about 45 degrees up, to the west.  I estimate it was 20-30 feet wide, flying at approximately 1500&apos; altitude moving north around 100mph (similar to a small private plane in size and speed). I thought &apos;hey, I see YOU&apos; and looked around at other people in the parking lot, no one else was watching it. I observed it for a couple minutes until it disappeard over the horizon. After getting home I phoned the local airport and asked if they had any strange radar images or if anyone else had reported a UFO. They acted like I was crazy so I didn&apos;t bother to notify the police.I considered the posibility that it might have been some type of balloon but it was moving much faster than the wind that night.Observer info: Faculty member at the University of Illinois", "Mysterious lights over the desert just before Dateland, ArizonaWell my mother, myself and my children (they were asleep) were all on I-8 heading east a little after the second set of mountains you go through after leaving Yuma, AZ., headed toward Phoenix when I noticed to the south of us 1 triangular shaped object with amber colored lights about 4 on each side with some in the middle sitting or hovering over a mountain, and another thing of about 5-6 amber lights that was like a half cresent shape just sitting or hovering over the desert in between the freeway and the mountain that the first was at. I looked at it for about 20-30 seconds when I said to my mother &quot;look over there at all the lights, expecally the triangular one, what do you thing it is?&quot; She looked over at them and said that she did not know what it was. Then I told her that I was going to take a picture with my camera phone but as I went to get my phone and take the picture the lights looked at if they went out almost one to two at a time and were gone. I looked at a sign on the freeway to see where exectally we were on it so that when we went back by on the way back to San Diego on 6/19/05, I could look to see if it was possibly a building or something.

It was not an airplane or satellit. It should be remembered that East to West satellites can NOT be seen from the continental United States, or any lattitude substantially far from the equator (since they only travel along the equator).Sunday June 26 into Monday: Four objects spotted. Three travelled South to North; one travelled more slowly than most in a Northwest to Southeast direction. As a side note unrelated to this, a strange rushing sound was heard in the trees. There was no wind or rain.

It&apos;s course was south to north. i kept watching and it came out of the east and went up and diapeared again. So I kept watching and this time it was a quick blip, in and out. Then it came out of the south and still traveling at this great speed { I would say about 5 times the speed of a commercial jet} it stopped and reversed course for 1/2 a second and went forward again and reversed again and then shot up and disapeared.

Well lo and behold if the par is not painting one helluva a target ( the target size depends on how much return it is recieving) about the same id say as a c-5 galaxy.. as the radar supervisor im like wtf? i call the tower the target is at 5 miles and im like do you guys have someone shooting a ILS ( we have Instrument landing system aka big microwave sytem that lets the pilot fly his own precision approach) to the same runway and the angle of attack is similar .. Tower response we have nothing and see nothing... I check our search radar ASR-11 aka the REAL big radar you see in movies like pushing tin etc basically anything bigger than a moped and above 100ft msl it picks up... NADDA no target no iff (identify friend or foe or squak im notgoing into detail but those who know will go ok no secondary)  now this same par we have is able to pick up some other &quot;Stealth&quot; a/c ive seen it first hand so im freaked out as the &quot;target&quot; got to the approach end of the runway stopped and shot up!!!!!  The reason this is crazy is again the par is anolog... no digital target anomlies are gonna happen it painted something big and umm sorry birds dont stay on course and glidepath for 10 miles!!!!  not done yet .... so all 4 people in radar who see this are like wtf .. 15 minutes later call form the tower.. a EF2000 is inbound ??? huh we never get those.. and he wants to shoot a PAR to the same runway? WHA? we have a 10,000 ft ceiling and no vis problems? and its 1 in the afternoon... so the ef checks in we vecotr him for the approach prior to turning him to final the pilot says thanks for the approach i quip well at least you asked! :).. no reply lol  well we tracked mr ef2k he did his approach climed to 10k and took off at 340knts for the atlantic went there nice and leve 10k over the atlantic then all of a sudden turned north and shot off at well lets just say not legal speeds towards sevillia to the north just west of there he starts climbing and decending at a rate that made me quesy ( i dont envy the approach controller tryin to keep traffic out of his way... here is the flipside out over the ocean we have warning areas setup for the military guys to go play around why the feck would he fly level at 10k over WATER and then go all roller coaster tycoon over residential areas and in between commercial traffic? trust me as an air traffic controller that was the strangest thing ive ever seen...", "extremely loudvery loud, a few lights redish orange.

After arriving at their house I exited my car in their driveway to stretch my legs while my son gathered some belongings from the car.  I looked up to check the stars, which were brighter at that particular time and location (3 a.m., small subdivision basically in open treeless grassland/scrub brush terrain approx 1/2 mi E of I-25 at Johnstown exit).  We watched the sky and talked for a few moments when I noticed 2 faint starlike objects traveling from N to S/SE.  They were roughly an inch apart if a ruler was held at arms length.  One was not in front of the other, rather offset and slightly to the left(NE).  I checked my watch which said 3:00 a.m. exactly as they were directly overhead. Speed was close to that of a jetliner although the impression was much faster since the faintness made them appear to be well up near the edge of the atmosphere.  No noise was noted. As they travelled to the south the first one became dim and the second became much brighter, approximately half as bright as Venus.  They then both faded slowly from view.    We scanned the sky for any other movement but after a few minutes saw none, so my son went inside and after another sky check I re-entered my vehicle and drove home.((NUFORC Note:  The manner in which the two objects faded from view is characteristic of how satellites fade from view during the evening hours, as they move away from the setting sun, and into the Earth&apos;s shadow.  However, we do not know if satellites would be directly illuminated by the Sun at the hour indicated.  Moreover, as they orbit to the southeast, they would be approaching the rising sun in the east, so they should not fade from sight of a witness on the ground.  We do not know what the witness observed.

I have also recently discoverd coasttocoast on am radio and have been listing to it nearly every night.  Some of the stories we hear on it have brought back a flood of memories to my wife and I.  I have two stories which occurred about 24 hours apart.  I don&apos;t know if they are somehow related or just coincidence.  I think it&apos;s important to relay that I am a G.I. Brat who was raised on Air Force Bases throughout the US as well as Germany and England.  Shortly after high school I joined the Air Force where I was trained as an Air Traffic Controller.  After leaving the service, my girl friend (now my wife of 26 years) and I took a trip from Ohio to Florida.  While in route to Florida we stopped to spend the night in my van.  During the wee morning hours of Aug 26, 1978, I recall having the scariest most vivid nightmare of my entire life.  I woke up screaming at the top of my lungs, scaring my girlfriend of two weeks to death.  For years I could recall in vivid detail the majority of the nightmare.  But now, two and a half decades later, I can only remember bits and pieces.  I can recall running and hiding in the ruins of city buildings, dodging ray like beams which were fired from numerous disc shaped craft hovering over the city.  I don&apos;t remember seeing any movies prior to this dream that might have led to it, but since the dream, I&apos;ve seen many war of the world type movies that always bring back little flashes of my nightmare.  My wife says I screamed for a long time after my dream, and even after I stopped, it took me quite a while to completely wake up and overcome the dream induced fear that took quite a few minutes to shake.  I remained shaken all the next day as we drove the rest of the way to Florida.  The first thing we wanted to do was see the beach.  So, at about 3 AM on Aug 27, 1978, we were laying on our backs in the sand on St. Pete Beach.  It was a beautiful totally clear night and we noted that the stars never looked so bright in Ohio.  A bright star caught my attention as it seemed to get brighter and bigger over a couple of minutes period.  We were trying to decide rather it was actually an airplane or if our eyes were just tricking us for starring so long.  It seemed to be at least five times larger than any other star in the sky, then it started.  It seemed like a normal size star had emerged from the larger one, then another.  At this point they had our undivided attention.  The smaller ones darted back and forth in erratic fashion for several minutes then darted off faster than any aircraft that I have ever seen before or since.  We talked about what we had just seen when several more darted out of what we were now calling the mother ship, and in like fashion darted around occasional disappearing as though they had gone back inside, zipping off into the distance etc.  As best we can remember there were between 6 to 8 lights that we watched come and go in no particular combinations.  Sometimes only one at a time sometimes groups of mixed numbers.  We watched in amazement for twenty minutes or more.  We can&apos;t recall rather or not any or all of the little lights had retuned to the big one, because what happend next kind of made what we had been watching insignificant.  The largest light hovering over Tampa Bay was obviously getting bigger and bigger and seemed to be comming in our direction.  What once looked like the largest star in the sky soon became the size of a dime at arms length, then a quarter.  As it grew larger it turned to a bright reddish orange.  By this time we were on our feet and my girlfriend was tugging on my arm trying to get me to leave.  It was at about this point that the quarter size light which seemed to be miles out to sea accelerated so quickly that in a matter of a couple of seconds it was directly overhead and appeared larger than the sun in the sky.  The beach lit up as though it was high noon as it soared over us.  At this point I had no choice but to run as my girlfriend was already heading for the van.  We did&apos;nt have far to run, but by the time we got in the van, the light had disappeared inland over St Pete.  We argued over rather or not to leave for less than a minute, then we could see the reddish orange ball returning in our direction very rapidly.  As one of us was now screaming bloody murder and jumping up and down, I thru it into drive and sped away.  There is absoluteley no doubt in our minds that we saw an extremeley large space craft which sent out a half dozen or so scout ships to explore the area over Tampa Bay and the city of St Pete Fl.  What we are unsure of is rather or not the nightmare the night before and the actual sightings are somehow connected.", "The UFO was seen on Bakerstown Rd in Culmerville PA it was moving east towards Tarentum PA it was a long line with two heads of the object it was atleast 500ft long it looked blue after it disaper into the hills", "Four large horizontal red lights in Mauston, WI.  Starts as 4 lights, goes to 2 lights and then disappearsAt Woodside Ranch attending a conference.  Myself and two others were in the pool when one of my friends said to look in the sky.  Myself and my other friend turned to the north sky to see four red lights in a horizontal line.  They were above the treeline and were very large.  They were not like lights on an airplane, they were much, much larger.  There were four lights and then it went to just two lights (the end lights went out).  After it went to two lights, they went out and it disappeared.  We never really made out a space craft, we only saw the lights in the horizontal formation.  My friends and I believe we saw a UFO, but the fact that we saw what we believe to be 2 military jets fly by about ten minutes after the sighting made us wonder if the object was related to the jets and a military mission.  But it also made us wonder if the jets were sent to investigate the object that was seen.  Who knows, but we know we saw something very, very unusual.  I&apos;ve never ever even thought I&apos;ve seen a UFO in my entire life, but when I saw this object, I had no doubt that I had just seen something that could be one.

I looked up and saw it moving north to south, almost directly above, at approximately 80 degrees above the eastern horizon.  It was moving steadily at about the same apparent speed one would expect from a satellite, but it was brighter, about like the magnitude of one of the planets.  But as soon as I saw it, we observed 2 other similar objects in the same immediate area (within the diameter of a basketball held at arms length).  Each object was traveling steadily at the same pace but in different directions.  One to the south, one to the northeast, and one to the north.  Within seconds, each one faded out and disappeared.  I couldn&apos;t gauge their altitude, but they were way up there and silent.  Not really an astounding sighting, but unusual.

This is something that happened years ago but most of the details I still recall very cleary. We were in Kenai and Soldotna for my brothers basketball tournament. It was december and many of us drove together down there. We were going to stay the night but my brothers friend wanted to go to Girdwood the next day. I was driving a motorhome so i Loaded up the boys that wanted to go and headed home. It was a very cold night no clouds with lots of stars in the sky. We were about 10 miles approx.? from the rest stop in Turnagain Pass.  two boys were playing cards in the back of the motorhome, one was sleeping and one was sitting in the front seat by me. All of a sudden I saw a red light in my windshield. Thinking I was tired or something I continued to stare trying to figure out what it was. I looked at my  dashboard to see if any lights had come on and were reflecting of the windshield. Then i looked again after rubbing my eyes and  now the light belonged to something it was almost like it was clearance lights on the bottom of a GIANT obeject in the sky, I don&apos;t think there is ANY airplane near the size of this. This object was was circular in the front... the lights ran in a semi circle under neath this circle. It had a long body with lights runing in a strait line down it. It looked metal (but it was black) to me and the almost like a manmade object, Yet I have never seen anyhting like it. This object just hovered it was even with the mountain tops on closer to the left mountain  instead of the right. I didnt think it was possible for an object that large to hover in the same spot for so long. It wasnt that high up becuase we were pretty much at the top of pass. At this point I am still think I have lost my mind I hadnt said a word I just drove and stared in the air. I finally looked over and the boy sitting in the seat next to me was doing the same thing.

Also, I found it pretty weird that there wernt any lights on the aircraft as well. I continued to look at it for a few more seconds, by then the aircraft was really making me curious. I continued to walk, but my eyes were brought back to the sky again out of curiosity, but this time the aircraft was nowhere to be seen. Myself and my other friends took a few minutes searching the sky trying to find it, without any luck.

It was very dark that night, no moon as I can remember but the orb was silver and looked matallic. I dont know if the metal look was a reflection of the headlights or if it made its own glow.  I could not see a tree or surrounding features to compare size and distance in the air, but it seemed to me to be about the size of a soccer ball and within 15 feet above the car.When I saw it, my mind was struggling with what it possibly could be, and untill my friend screamed in horror I didnt realize it was something that shouldnt have been there.

It was a shiney metallic object that appeared to have geometrical facets on top area of it.  Furthermore, we noticed that the area around the object appeared to have a &quot;halo&quot; due to the fact that it was a darker blue color than compared to the clear blue sky behind it. This &quot;halo&quot; appeared fuzzy and did not seem to have definite edges.  Due to the traffic barely moving along we were able to observe the object for around 10 mins as we slowly moved north towards downtown Seattle.  Also, since we weren&apos;t moving we were able to compare its size to the half moon that was also in that hemisphere of the sky.  Its size relative to the half moon was about 1/5 - 1/7 of the moon.  In relation to the moon it was north of it and higher towards the sky zenith. When we compared it to fixed objects in our field of view it became obvious that it wasn&apos;t moving in relation to us. We lost sight of it when we entered the tunnels and express lanes of downtown Seattle. We saw it again when we were north of the Northgate Mall and just south of the King county line. It seemed to be in the same location in the sky relative to the horizon and moon as before. This time we only observed it for a couple of seconds before it seemed to &quot;vanish&quot; from the sky. In the car we had 3 people (including the driver) of which two of us saw the object. All of us in the car have aerospace engineering backgrounds and have significant experience in identifying flying vehicles and their systems.  The two of us who observed the object concluded that we had never observed such an object before. We were quite surprised at how it was able to hold station so precisely and the fact that it appeared to have no aerodynamic lifting surfaces to it.((NUFORC Note:  I spoke with this witness at length, and I found him to be eloquent and quite sincere.

PD))", "MULTIPLE SIGHTINGS in VERY NARROW, LOW-ALTITUDE AIR CORRIDOR  This sighting is the most recent of several objects observed in the same, highly-confined area above a densely populated suburb of Tokyo from a period beginning in 1993 and currently on-going. I am a U.S. citizen living adjacent to the northern-most shore of Tokyo Bay.  The condominium where my family and I live has a spacious outdoor terrace providing a 180 degree view facing due west.  The object I saw would be best described as triangular, although slightly irregular in shape.  My first impression was it looked like a &quot;stubby boomerang.&quot;  The object was directly overhead at roughly 90 degrees from the observation surface.  It either emitted a dull white light, or was composed of a dull white material.  At arm&apos;s length the object would have measured 2 inches in width at its base, and about an inch and a half in length (thus the &quot;stubby&quot; description).  It moved from due south to due north and was visible for only 2 or 3 seconds.  There was absolutely no sound emitted from the object, and visual contact was lost after the object underwent a process that can be described as similar to television or video image dissolve. In the same area, there have been numerous sightings of objects of varying descriptions.  I have seen several myself, my son reported seeing one and other individuals have either directly observed objects, or have recounted second-hand sightings.  Two years ago, a Japanese Air Self Defence Force helicopter was dispatched to the area described above and spent 30 minutes hovering at 60 to 80 feet.  I have no information about what a military helicopter would be doing making such a horribly loud racket and hovering so low over a residential area, but it seemed to be looking for something. OTHER SIGHTINGS:  March 1993.  I was taking out the trash at approximately 21:30 and noticed in the corner of my eye something moving to my left at an altitude of 80 or 90 feet.  The object was almost completely transparent.  Heading due north, the object moved slowly and in complete silence.  From the angle I first saw the object, there were two hemispheres side by side facing downward (the rounded edges pointed downwards).  Above the hemispheres was a platform, like a table top viewed from the side.  There was a small building right next to me, and the view of the object was blocked as it continued moving in a direction directly behind the building.  I dropped the bags of trash and ran to the other side of the building and saw the same object again.  This time, the angle had changed.  The flying object was V-shaped with three hemispheres on each wing.  Again, it was almost transparent.  There were some people walking on the street who hadn&apos;t noticed the object.  The object was so silent and so nearly invisible, no one would have seen it unless they had happened to have directly spotted it.  Observation time: approximately 15 seconds. July 1997. In the same corridor, I saw an amoeba-like blob flying due south.  From our terrace, I had a front-and-center view of the setting sun (about 18:40).  The nearly transparent blob was heading in a direction that would take it directly in front of the sun.  I recalled my 1993 sighting and wondered what would happen when the object flew between my line of sight and the sun.  As the blob passed in front of the sun, I could see that the object looked about four times larger than the sun at the distance it was from me (300 feet or so).  Although the object did not block out the sunlight, the shape of the sun was slightly distored and slightly less light was emitted.  The object passed across the sun and continued in the same direction until it was out of sight.  Total viewing time: 10 seconds. Two nights later, July 1997. I decided to sit out on the terrace every night.  At sometime around 20:45, a gray-colored boomeranng-shaped object suddenly appeared from a due west direction and began flying directly towards me at an altitude of about 100 feet.  It was moving in a zig-zag configuration.  Although moving rapidly, it was clear that the object was changing shape with each curving maneuver it made.  Instead of having straight edges, the boomerang had wavy lines.  On both wings or blades of the boomerang shape there were darker gray-colored wavy lines extending from the front of the object to the tips of the wings.  Observation time 4-5 seconds. Next night. July 1997, approximately 0:30. I was out on the terrace hoping to see another object.  By this time, I had begun to theorize that the area of the sightings was a type of corridor for the objects.  I was outside patiently waiting and had been sitting for 5 or 6 hours and was about ready to go inside and go to bed.  Suddenly due west, a huge V-shaped object appeared at about 100 feet in altitude and at about 300 feet from my position.  It was very similar to the object I had witnessed in 1993; V-shape with hemispheres on the bottom surface of the wings.  There were some notable differences from the 1993 sighting.  First, instead of being almost completely transparent, it was dark gray in color.  It looked as though it was made of smoke or cloud, yet the giant V maintained a coherent shape as it glidely slowly due south.  Second, although the wings were parallel to the ground, the wing tips curved upwards and emitted either some type of particles or energy.  The edges of the wing-tips wavered in a manner resembling heat radiating off a hot paved road.  As I watched the object move slowly and silently in a steady due south direction, I couldn&apos;t help but wonder why the object had swept V-shaped wings.  At the speed it was traveling, they would have served no aerodynamic function.  Then a fortuitous event happened.  As the object progressed on its unchanging trajectory, it approached a 12-story condo building, and from my viewing angle, flew above the building which is about 350 feet away. At the mid-way point on the roof of the building, there is a rectangular structure that houses a water tank and air-conditioning equipment.  The V-shape object passed directly behind the utility structure and the left wing just barely cleared the structure.  Using these coordinates as a reference, I would estimate that the V-shaped object was 150 to 160 feet lengthwise, and about 80 feet wide from wing-tip to wing-tip.  At this point, I had been observing the object for at least 30 seconds.  I continued to watch it for another minute as it continued on its trajectory. Although the object had not yet disappeared from view completely, it had traveled far enough away that it appeared much smaller and far less visible.  It was still vaguely visible but I decided there was nothing more to observe, so I turned away and went to bed. The above sighting was the most spectacular of any of my observations, including those leading up to the time of this writing (June 2005).  These experiences have led me to search the Internet to research what other observations have been made in other locations.  There is one important distinction that can be made about my observations and those made by other people.  The Internet has numerous postings of triangular-, boomerang-, and V-shaped objects.  But in every instance, there have been discriptions of lights on the objects.  In every case I have personally witnessed, the objects did not have what might be interpreted as mounted lights.  The objects have consistently been monochromatic or transparent, and when illuminated types were observed, the entire object was bright, not with light sources on isolated surfaces such a wing-tips, nose or center.  Again, I emphasize that each sighting I have made has been while I was alone.  However, individuals, including my son claim to have witnessed objects in the same corridor.", "Three points of light in a triangle formation.A group of friends and myself were camping in the vicinity of Kerhonkson, NY.  While stargazing, a friend of mine (female police officer from NJ) noticed &quot;three satellites moving together in formation&quot;.  I chuckled because I had been pointing out satellites and  &quot;shooting stars&quot; for most of the night because out of the eight of us camping together, half had never seen one (due to the light-pollution in Northern NJ).  That&apos;s when I turned around and was amazed to see three &quot;stars&quot; moving in a tight, smooth formation silently gliding across the dark sky.  Their motion was fluid and constant (like a LEO satellite) up until the end of our horizon when one of the &quot;lights&quot; moved out of formation.  It was not a solid object because I clearly saw stars pass between the &quot;lights&quot;.  My friends were amazed and I was left stumped for answers.

Off to the southeast  (about 40 degrees) I noticed  what appeared to be a plane with a strobe light taking the general flight path to Cleveland&apos;s lakefront airport. It was heading northeast.  The strobe became more impressive and it became readily apparent that it wasn&apos;t quite the same light as a normal aircraft would use partly because it suddenly grew quite bright.  The craft flew in a slightly erratic pattern slightly zig-zagging, then turned multi colored (red and blue) and disappeared.  Just like that.   Then  perhaps 20 seconds  later it reappeared  much further to the west  about 30 degrees behind my right shoulder  and  started to head east-southeast.

I wanted to report it after seeing that others have reported seeing UFO&apos;s in the same area.In the summer of 1980, I came out of the grocery store with the bag boy and noticed something in the sky.  It was approaching sunset and I could see an bright shining object in the sky.  I knew it was not a star because it moved. I asked the bag boy what the object was and he was clueless as well.  I drove home looking at the object, not wanting to lose track of it.  I went home and asked my father, who worked as a nuclear physicist at the Lawrence Livermore Laboratories what the object was. I figured he would know since he has put satellites up in space.  He told me it was a weather ballon or a slow moving plane and went back to work in his den.  About 45 minutes later, I advised my father that the object was still in the sky and that it was beginning to move around.  My father turned white as a ghost and came running out to see the object.We lived on farm land in a newly developed houses.  Our backyard view was a large field and Altamont Pass (mountains) with Mount Diablo in the distance. So we had a great view of what we saw.Anyhow, my entire family came outside to watch the object in the sky and then the neighbors on both sides of our home came outside to see as well.  This was around 8:00 p.m. in the evening.  The objects danced around in the sky and darted here and there.  I ran into the house to get my father&apos;s binoculars.  The object was triangular (almost like the letter &quot;A&quot;) shape with lights on all three points.  A few hours later the objects flew in the direction of Mount Diablo (Mount of the Devil, as the Indians called it.. a coincidence?  I don&apos;t think so) and disappeared behind it or on it? That night on channel 7 (newscene S.F.) a reporter named Van Amburg presented a story about an object in the sky.  It was a short uneventful segment about what people reported seeing, however, nothing was ever mentioned about it again on the news.However, every night... I mean, every night around 1 or 2 in the morning I would wake up not knowing why.  I would look out my window and it was there.  It was like it knew I was there watching it.  I watched it for a while and then it would fly away over Mount Diablo.  This happened every night.  I told my mother on occasion, but no one ever thought it was that important. I don&apos;t remember if it ever stopped or if I just forgot about it as I turned 18 years old and moved out.To hear others talk about this area freaked me out and I had to share my story. I don&apos;t know what that object was but let me put it this way.  Even though I believe in God, I didn&apos;t believe that ghosts appeared in the daytime.... till I moved to Hawaii.

There was the occaisional airplane that we saw (which isn&apos;t uncommon because we have an airport not 5 miles from our house), and just plain old stars and such...but nothing too special.

There were three lights on each side of the boomerang, and one at the point of it.  They were all white in color.  What struck me as odd was that they appeared to be dimmed...as if they were made so to avoid detection. None of the lights on the craft wavered or blinked at all.  They were all steady lights.

I am an amateur astronomer, but I usually view the sky in the early evening to about midnight. The milky way is just to the west of my house at this time of the morning.  As soon as I stepped onto my upper deck I began to gaze at the sky.  A flash of light is what originally got my attention.  When I focused on the spot just to the west of me,  I noticed three star like lights with the magnitude of about 5 1/2.  They were moving in perfect formation like a large 100 degree triangle pointing in the north to about 5 degrees maybe to the east. They seemed to be following the milky ways direction or they were atleast in that portion of the sky. They did not twinkle or vary from their formation.  They continued in their direction, northwardly, until they were lost in the distance. It took about 1 to 2 minutes for them to pass from almost directly above me to the horizon. I am not usually up at this time, but I know this is a popular time to view satellites and I have never seen one to know the difference between ufos and normal celestial objects that would be moving that way.  Another thing.  I could see stars inside the triangle so it was not one solid object.  It was like watching a small constellation move across the sky.  There was no sound of jets, but I live along side a noisy highway so there was some highway noise.  What made this seem so special was the way they moved with such precision together across the sky.  I think there is a logical explination for this, but would like to know if what I saw was a ufo. I don&apos;t know why I saw a flash of light first, or if that has anything to do with the formation.  It could have been a shooting star, but what a coincidence.  I live about 60 miles north of Houston so there is alot of air traffic and they go in that direction the most.  I think I have included everything to the best of my knowledge.  I hope it is relevent.  I am a christian who believes that if God included everything about our universe, the Bible would never end.  He lets us figure some things out for ourselves.  I believe we are the only humans with the ability to have the holy spirit in our hearts, but nature is an awesome thing.

On May 18th, 2005 we spent the day in New Mexico taking pictures.  At approximately 7:30 p.m. in the evening we were driving on Route 40 towards Santa Rosa, New Mexico and both witnessed an unusually bright object in the Southeast sky.  Out of a burning curiosity, we drove towards the object and eventually pulled over to photograph it.  We took several still photos with a Nikon CoolPix 8700 camera.  Initially, my friend insisted that it must be Venus, but upon further observation we determined that it was too large, too bright, and not where Venus should have been.  The object looked much like an extremely large, bright star.  It remained stationary for about an hour and then seemed to &quot;fade away,&quot; or possibly was covered by clouds.  We inspected the photos we had taken and then blew them up in photoshop.  The enlarged images reveal an object that was split in two-- or, possibly, two spherical objects.  We have looked all over the internet in an attempt to discover what we just witnessed and have found similar sightings.  Unfortunately, no one seems to know what it is.  Hopefully, someone out there will be kind enough to enlighten us-- if that is possible.  We will post our photos to this site. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible high-altitude balloon.

I looked to the east of it&apos;s position and saw the second, a third was southeast of the second, the 4th - 6th were south and east and coming back to the southwest.  The lights were clusted in a group of red-gree-white and appeared to be touching.  There is a large hill to the south and particularly west of where I was and was unable to tell if there were any more.  My impression was they were equidistant from each other and in a circle around Phoenix.  They remained stationary for 4 - 5 hours and when I was releived at 6 a.m. were gone/not visible due to the sun shine.  They were not there the next night.

The witnesses are reasonably safe from identification. At approximately 00:50 hours on the morning of Saturday, June 18th 2005, I ((name deleted--witness, male #1)) of the village of Fair Oak, Eastleigh, Hampshire, and two colleagues, who I am only permitted to describe as ((name deleted--male #2)) and ((name deleted--female)) were standing outside of their home close to the village center of Fair Oak, and involved in sky watching while idly discussing the stars and the activities and modus operandi of UFOs, when after mentioning to them three minutes earlier that &quot;sometimes, if you ask to see an object ... they sometimes comply,&quot; such an object did in fact appear - or seemed to appear as if on request. The object appeared in sky, almost overhead, but clearly several miles up.  I&apos;m estimating three or more as it is difficult to estimate as the sky was very dark and no point of reference other than the sky was available.  It came in from the south-southwest, initially appearing as a brilliant and fast moving light source, I estimate as being about two milimeters in diameter as if judged by reaching out and pointing to it with my outstretched hand and finger (I am five feet, three inches tall for the record). It should be noted that we are familiar with astronomical, atmospheric and satelite activity here, and that particular night the sky was exceptionally clear and dotted with stars. Within a second or two of making its appearance, the object suddenly bloomed brilliantly into a white point of light five times the brilliance of the brightest star (and to an estimated size of around four milimeters) and then after approximately half a second (having apparently gotten our attention) it dulled down considerably but remained in motion, on the same course and at the same speed. At no time did it display any evidence of being an aircraft either in motion, speed or lights. It then seemed to dull out completely and stop and take up position in the sky close to Orion&apos;s second star in the Belt of Orion where it seems to have remained for the remainder of the fifteen minute observation of the witnesses. The incident was terminated when we went inside. In the actual event, if the object, if indeed it was a UFO, was in sight for a grand total of between three to seven seconds before becoming lost in the starfield overhead. Both witnesses, who have a casual interest in the UFO phenomenon, but no serious technical background in it were wildly impressed by the sighting and announced to me that they had never seen an aircraft perform like that. They were also impressed by the fact that following the incident, we saw not only a passing satellite - clearly cutting across the heavens - and a meteorite entering the atmosphere and burning up. Both objects performed as you would expect, and did not reflect any aspect of the fast moving light source which we witnesses. This drove home the unearthly quality of the sighting to the &quot;newbies&quot; who were my additional witnesses. I was highly impressed, it was almost as if my comments about &quot;asking to see something,&quot; were being acted upon, although this should be considered merely speculation.((name of witness deleted))((NUFORC Note:  The witness indicates a time of 05:00, but states that the sighting occurred at 00:50 hrs..

THERE WERE ABOUT 6 OF THESE. they all flew the same pattern, at about airplane speed from east of the jail all the way north. then came dinner. when i got back from dinner it was getting dark. they had stopped. when it got completely dark, they started again, flying the same pattern, from the ground, then slow and low, along the horizon.  The freakiest part of this sighting is that when it was dark, they flashed like airplanes. the lights were very convincingly flashing as a normal small plane would...YET i saw them in the day, fairly closely. close enough to know they definitly were not airplanes.  i made sure i wasn&apos;t wrong about the location of the jail compared to the airport, the jail is directly north of the jail and my window was facing directly east.  i asked everyone that had a room facing east and no one was looking out of the window...i guess most people sleep or read. my celmate wouldn&apos;t look when i told him, he was scared i guess. anyway there were 2 or 3 more and then it stopped. i woke up right at sunrise the next morning and saw one more of them, fly the same pattern, in even more detail.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I passed the Gatineau Airport on my left. It was closed for the night. I was alone in my vehicle and there was no traffic on coming or behind me. Making my way to Buckingham I passed several overpasses encountered on this highway and was approaching the last before my turn off which is about six miles east of the aforementioned airport. As I approached the last overpass I noticed a bright red light just ahead and to my left, about 100 feet off the road and 100 feet off the ground. The size, colour and brilliance resembled the kind of warning light you see on top of hydro towers. I thought this was peculiar because there was a hydro tower nearby but not at that location so I figured it must be a late arrival flying to the Gatineau airport. But it was closed and this was way too far away for a flight to be in a landing pattern anyway, so I slowed down expecting the plane to make a hard landing in the field. I pulled off to the side of the road just west of the overpass, stopped and got out of my car. The field extending north of the highway is fairly level and consists of scrub and weeds for about 1500-2000 feet until it reaches the bottom of a rise in the terrain that goes up maybe 100-150 feet. So looking north is fairly black with no illumination or dwelling in my line of sight  until the horizon which is higher than where I&apos;m standing. The night sky explodes with stars and the milkyway from the horizon up. The red light is in a fixed position in the darkness below the horizon and I&apos;m marvelling at how an aircraft can remain stationary for so long. I look around for possible wind sources to make this happen but the air is still; and I haven&apos;t been able to make out any kind of outline to put a fix on the aircrafts shape. So I walk across the double highway, down the ditch and up to the fence. This gives me a lower but closer perspective, all the while looking up at this thing to see if I can make its shape. When I reach the fence I begin to think this might be some new stealth vehicle the military is trying out because I don&apos;t hear a sound and still can&apos;t make out its outline. My eyes becoming more accustomed to the inky darkness I find a hard straight edge that leads up into the sky and then to my utter shock begin to see the staggering size of this thing! I stumble back from the realisation that the inky darkness was part of a craft that was triangular in shape blotting out most of the bluff in the background, the horizon and part of the night sky! What I mistook at first to be just a lack of stars in that particular section of sky was an enormous triangular shape the reached from above and just ahead of me to just below the horizon. The point forward I believe seemed to be to my left bearing the red light under its tip. It was all I could do to see the shape. No details, no one and no sound. You could almost describe it as an absence of light, like looking into a dark hole. Having never heard of flying triangles as possible UFOs I didn&apos;t speak of this until 2001 when I read a report about them for the very first time. I was very excited by the facts and descriptions regarding triangles and discovering I wasn&apos;t alone in seeing one. When I drove away from the object that night, I contented myself with the explanation that I had witnessed a military exercise of some secret airborne vehicle and always referred to it as such, never even suspecting a possible UFO context. After 45 min I left thinking what a mammoth airplane. Truly football field size as they say.", "Object or light makes 90 degree turns in night skyI was about 13 at the time my sister the boy next door and I where in the yard on the grass looking up and the sky chatting and looking for shapes in the stars.  At that time was aware of shooting stars, meteors and commets.  I was also aware that satilites and planes cross the sky at night.  Being a farm boy I was also a good observer.  Also I grew up coon hunting at night so I am very comfortable at night and not spooked by things that go bump in the night.  While on the grass looking up the boy next door noticed what at first seemed like a slow shooting star but it was much to slow.  I determined that it was probably a satilite.  The object was no larger or brighter than any of the background stars.  That was all that was normal about this object or light in the sky.  The object was traveling in a east north east direction it was directly overhead.  Our location was almost exactly 45 degrees north.  The object or light moved in a steady striaght track and suddenly took a sharp 90 degree turn (angular not a curve) to the north.  If you held you arm out in front of you and stuck your thumb out the object traveled about the length of your thumb.  Then it took another sharp 90 degree turn to the west and again to the north.  This went on over and over and over until it left our view in the sky.", "Large pale silver dome seen over a hill and also near the house of SE Nebraska farm.On our way back from the end of our cow pasture, while bringing the milk cows in to the dairy barn area, we were startled to see a huge silvery dome over the top of a hill about two city blocks ahead -- we had just walked past there on our way out to get the cows, it wasn&apos;t there then.  We were scared,shocked, in disbelief, wondering how and why we were looking at something we could only guess was a giant quonset building or some really strange building basically between us and the safety of the barns, house or whatever. I was terrified, but the cows skirted to the right of it and kept on going.  So did we, and in about a minute or two, it just was no longer there.  Even though I didn&apos;t see more than the dome, I was frightened to the core of my being.  Then, about a month later, the same thing could be seen just past our wind break northeast of our house.

All of a sudden as it got close we noticed tht this was not an airplane or helicopter, we saw a yellow to orange oval shape on the bottem of the craft, so everybody starts sreaming, it went over our condo, so we all ran out to the hallway, they are open hallways in Puerto Rico. we saw it again on top of us, all of a sudden it turns on to its side, and you can see its like a ball of fire but oval, then around the sides there were lights of all colors, it stays like this for about 20 seconds then it turns right and heads into El Yunque (Puerto Rico&apos;s tropical Forest) and it zooms out of sight.

The road that I was traveling was the same road that Fountain Powerboats Inc. is on, so I thought that it was the lights from the parking lot, but I didn&apos;t remember seeing them there before. Then, as I was closing in on the lights, I noticed that they were starting to move. At first I thought that it was just an illusion because I was driving in a curve, but then I was on a straight stretch and I realized that it was not an illusion. There were two lights that looked about like street lights and they were about 50 -75 feet apart from each other. There movements were simultaneous which led me to believe that it was one craft, but I could never make out a shape. As I closed in on the object it seemed to increase its speed and I was trying to keep up with it as there was another car in front of me who was also trying to follow it.  Due to the trees and the curves in the road, we would loose it for a few seconds and then it would re-appear.  I was trying to make it to the end of the road were it opened up to the river where I would have a wide open sky to view the object, but by the time I and the other driver had reached the end of the road the object was gone. The other 3 people in the other car confirmed that they had seen the same thing that I had seen. We were all in disbelief. I tried to make sense of what I saw, but nothing added up. My house is in  an area that I watched the object fly over. When I got home I asked my wife if she heard anything; a jet, airplane, heli-copter, blimp? She said she heard nothing. The only thing that I thought it could have possibly been was a blimp, because noone heard it, but that doesn&apos;t explain why I couldn&apos;t keep up with it in my car running 60mph. Or why it disappeared out of sight over a river that is 1 mile wide.

There had been reports of UFO sightings in the Perth Amboy area for several days before this.  These events were even reported in a local newspaper.  My friend and I laughed about these reports as we both thought the poor ignorant fools were actually witnessing Venus and didn&apos;t know any better.  We were a bit cocky since we had a little knowledge of astronomy, and we were young.  Several minutes into our observing Venus, my friend said to me, what&apos;s that?  I looked up and saw two small lights moving in a northerly direction toward us, side by side, and about to move directly over my (parents) house. Since we lived in the flight path of Newark airport, I thought the lights were the wing lights of an airliner, and I said to my friend, it&apos;s just a plane, why?  I then went back to looking through my telescope.  My friend, who was older then me and a very intelligent kid, said, &quot;but there&apos;s no plane in the middle&quot;.  I thought that was a silly thing for him to say, and I then looked back up.  Sure enough he was right; there was no plane in between the lights.  Now we just kept looking up at these small moving lights, not sure what they were, but not thinking UFO&apos;s.  We were just curious as to what aircrafts would be traveling so high up (20,000 feet or more), next to each other in this way.  When they were almost directly overhead, one of the lights came to a complete stop while the other light made a 45 degree turn around it and then both lights started to travel easterly, at a right angle from their original path.  This was absolutely shocking since there were no crafts either of us had ever heard of that could do such a thing.  We were stunned into silence as we watched the small lights continue their new easterly path. After a few more seconds both lights stopped altogether, at a point that a small star was between them (we thought it was a star).  The two lights turned around this star in such a manner as to resume their original configuration as they had been when they were traveling northerly.  At this point all three lights started to move north together!  Obviously, the center light was not a star, but it was another craft that had been waiting for the other two crafts (lights). Up to this point my friend and I didn&apos;t say a word, we just watched in sheer, silent amazement.  As the lights traveled north toward Newark airport, we started to talk to each other and ask, what did you see?   Neither of us has ever been able to explain the event.

Along the street behind me were maple trees that were about 20-30 ft. tall and the yards all were separated by fences but they had no tall trees in them.  My grandmother&apos;s house was a 2 1/2 story house not quite as tall as the trees along the street.

PD))Unbelievable lights in the sky. at least 60 lights in circle formations.I was on holiday checking out the desert in nevada with my wife. We were planning on setting up camp for the night when my wife called me out of the jeep. I went over to her and she explained she had just seen several lights in the sky.  I thought she was probably joking around and pretended i believed her. About two hours later at around 21:00 a collection of lights caught my attention.  They were formed in circles.  Each circle had 6 lights to it.  My wife saw them as well.  They really did light up the sky. There were loads of these circles that were slowly moving around the night sky. Some dipped below the mountains and some rose above the terrain as they moved. I took pictures on my camera phone of these lights however i cannot send them to this site as they cannot be transfered to computer unfourtunatly.  My wife and i stayed for about 15 minutes before falling to sleep while they were still above us.  I woke in the morning to find no evidence of lights or craft in the sky.  I was not too far away from a military installment so there is a chance they were testing military aircraft up there.

Like always my window blades were open and I remember that I could see the townhouses that were across my street very clearly. Then all of a sudden a flash of light, as big as my window, maybe a little smaller was right outside of it. It was so bright and I started to try to tell my older sister but she was still in a deep sleep. The lights were so bright and white and yellow. I went running up to my big window, not knowing wether my eyes played a trick on me or it was for real. By the time I was up to my window, the flash of lights or the oval or disk or whatever it was, was gone. I think it was in a disk or oval formation. The scary part of this event was that the next morning when I was heading to my bustop for school, my nieghbor, who usually walks with me to the bustop, said that when she was getting a glass of water in the middle of the night, she noticed wierd lights through her skylight window, and then she went and opened her front door and she saw a disk shaped object or something, then it dissapeared. She claimed that to me without me even mentioning the story to her before she told me.

After her initial shock and upon regaining her composure she attempted to further describe what she saw and what course of action the object she viewed had done. To the best of my recollection and again the following is admittedly classified third-hand information, she advised my father that what she saw was rather long 2 - 300 feet in length.  She also stated that it travelled from the South to the North and from her perspective, likely directly over the Hudson River which is approximately one half a mile East of her home, in North Albany about 3/4 of a mile from Albany&apos;s boundry line with Menands, New York to the North.

We noticed a glowing red ball that hovered in place above a field, we were about 1/2 mile away. It was a clear night and the sky was almost completely dark at the time. We didn&apos;t take our eyes off of it even though we wanted to go in and tell everyone to come see, we just couldn&apos;t pull ourselves away from looking at it.

After it happened we decided not to say anything to our families that were inside because we didn&apos;t want to be made fun of, since none of them would have believed it.  So hard as it was, we kept it quiet. Then the next day at school, I overheard some of my classmates whispering together in a huddle about the same thing that I had seen.  So I chimed in about my account, and they told me that they had been practically under it (which made sense because my friend lived just across that field) and they said that it was a glowing red ball but they could see three white lights on the bottom that formed a triangle pattern. They also watched it for a while and it shot straight up in the sky, there were four of them that seen it including my friend&apos;s father.I never seen anything like that before or since.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate, elects to remain totally anonymous.

I have seen the &quot;Phoenix Lights&quot; many times from this location and a few others, perhaps altogether 12 times total. I saw them again last night (5-18-05) around 10:00pm just southwest of Deer Valley Airport over the city. It was hard to get an exact count of the number of lights involved, but I counted at least 5 which hovered stationary for about 10-15 minutes in exactly the same spot. Eventually, a small plane which had come in for a landing at the airport swooped back up and headed in the direction of the lights; the lights faded out one by one as the small plane approached them. One of the lights seemed to pulsate red in light color while the others were yellowish orange. In past sightings I had seen these lights in more of an amber color. Based on the color of the amber street lights both near and far (because there is a light refraction effect due to the atmosphere causing slight change in color over distance) and the observable size comparison between the &quot;Phoenix Lights&quot; and the street lights, I estimate that the &quot;Phoenix Lights&quot; would have to have been at least three feet in diameter and at least three miles from my location. As student with a physics major at ASU, after my last sighting I had devised this basic concept in order to guage the size of what I was seeing. I know that this is not a concrete method and is only a somewhat successful estimate. I will be conducting some experiments along this line which may give me a more solid premise. The real key here is exactly what color light was actually being emitted and consequently refracted, so I have used past experiences as a model for the test method. Over a year ago I had witnessed the lights in front of South Mountain which I later measured with my tripometer in my car to have been no more than ten miles away. Based on my recollection of the color and size from that experience and this new experience, I have come to the conclusion that the light source must be somewhere between 5 to 15 feet in diameter most likely. Hopefully, I will have devised a more precise guaging method by the next time I see them. During this siting the lights did appear once more about 15 minutes later much farther away and appearing more orange in color; the duration of this second instance was approximately two minutes. If my estimates are correct, these are not common flares as so many debunkers (I believe someone from NUFORC even attested to these lights having been flares on Coast to Coast AM if I am not mistaken because of a statement from what was referred to as a credible source&apos;s observation) have testified in the past. I have seen these lights do some amazing things in the past with formations and maneuvers. According to my estimates of size, these light sources would have to be remotely flown or possibly manned flights. My curiosity is piqued.", "a really bright star that moved about a second after we noticed it, at a slow speed till it crossed the horizoni was walking out of my friends house with another friend to help them leave. we were looking up and noticed a star like object shining a little brighter directly above our heads. at first we thought it was the closest start esides the sun, or the north star.

Given the anonymous nature of your reporting requirements, and the fact I just found your site, I figured what the heck because I have dwelled on the issue for some time and just need to get it out. Plus I&apos;m at work wasting time reading your case files, and I do have one to tell.Myself and my friend were 21 at the time, in his Ford Escort parked just outside the city of Idaho Falls, ID, near the High-C waterpark about a quarter mile from a railroad bridge.  It is called Zombie Bridge by the locals. It is fairly isolated, with only a few homes dispersed over about two square miles. The car was parked facing approx. northwest along the road, steep hillside to the left, creek to the right.  Not sure if road is paved now, but in those days it was graded gravel only.  If you head the opposite direction from the car&apos;s orientation, there is a sharp right turn about fifty meters behind where we were parked.  We were being naughty at the time, in that we were ((alleged minor infraction deleted)) (hence my reticence about disclosing the incident), just sitting there in his car in the dark, ((deleted)). Only other sound were the multitudes of crickets out and about.We decided to leave as we both had to work in the morning. I get out to relieve myself in the bushes by the creek and when returning to the car, saw an erratic light.  Best way to describe it was akin to when someone flicks a still-lit cigarette butt in the dark.  Erratic in movement, orange, and very dim in apparent magnitude.  It came from the direction in front of the car, over the car, decended just like if it was falling, and then it looked like it &quot;bounced&quot; on the ground about forty meters behind the car.  Never made a sound.I thought someone was nearby and had actually flicked a cigarette butt at first, and looked around. Realized it would take some pretty impressive cigarette butt flicking to launch one forty meters or so, and no one was around, so I got in the car somewhat perplexed at what I&apos;d seen. My friend had seen it too, and queried me what it was, and I replied that I didn&apos;t know.  He also noted the crickets had stopped chirping, and I noticed that as well when he said it, which was eerie.  We both looked in the rearview mirrors, and noticed the &quot;cigarette butt,&quot; or at least its glow, was shining on the road behind us although the source was obscured by the intervening hill beyond the right turn. The source must have been on the hill itself, and not airborne judging by the angle the glow was hitting the road. By the size of the glow on the road (about ten meters visible diameter), we realized it wasn&apos;t a cigarette butt either, and we both got a little bit of a shiver.I tell my friend it might be a good idea to go, and he heartily agrees, we both are a little scared at this point.  He fires up the Escort, and we promptly flip out.  See, the car started fine, but every electronic device in his car that can make noise, his radar detector, his pager, and his stereo, all are making a pulsed high pitched and very loud noise.  Sounded almost like when a CD player malfunctions in your stereo, like a pulsed digital noise.  We turn the volume down on the stereo, nothing happens. We turn the stereo off, nothing happens...unplugged the cig lighter power to the radar detector, nothing happens.  Speakers in these devices seemed to be working off of pure inductance in their voice coils without any amplification from their supporting electronics.  I swear we both we&apos;re going to fill our pants we took off out of there so fast.  After about ten seconds of frenzied driving, the EM effects ceased, and his equipment began behaving normally.  Never bothered to see if the glow we had seen was behind us or what, too scared while speeding away.Never reported it to the cops or other authorities, would have just gotten a ticket for smoking dope. Have reflected on this numerous times with my friend, don&apos;t believe it was anything &quot;E.T.ish&quot; or whatever.  Sometimes I wonder if we got hit with a beam from a JointSTARS or some other military aircraft in the region.  That could potentially explain the inductance in the speakers, which have a much lower threshold of resistance to outside EM effects then say the car&apos;s ignition system.  But I have no clue what that oversized mystery cigarette butt was. Just totally weird night.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  We do not know what a JOINTSTARS aircraft is, but it seems to us that the metal body of the car would have served as a Faraday Cage, and therefore would have shielded all, or most, of the electronic equipment in the car, particularly the radio, which probably was shielded by the metal in the dashboard, and the metal of the hood and the firewall.

Star gazing and enjoying the cool breeze from the lake this evening, I was on my patio with my dog getting some fresh air. I saw something move across the sky above me, from east to west just over my head. Blinked my eyes to have a better look.   When I refocused I saw an unusual object / objects. It was hard to determine if just one object or more then one because of the glow of lights on it/them. I can&apos;t give you a size because I&quot;m not sure if it was more then one object or just one. There were three lights, in the shape of a triangle/chevron two bottom lights then one top light..in the direction of travel. The shape didn&apos;t appear to be all straight lines, it appeared shadowed in and curved a little on the inside like a chevron. It was a fuzzy outline and it&apos;s overcast tonight so I really couldn&apos;t make out if this was one object or not. The lights were not blinking like aircraft lights do just illuminated, it wasn&apos;t a search light, spot light or other regular type lighting,there was NO engine/motor sound, no propeller sound, no NOTHING!  At first while I was watching it seemed to be moving at a fast pace like a streak above me which caught my eye...I thought at first it was a shooting star. This craft/crafts, then slowed down almost to a crawl but still moving (slower then the speed you would see a satellite move in the night sky) Then it stopped but not abruptly, very gently and went the left (south towards the lake) then back to where it started from in the same line (east to west), then to the right (north)  It came back to the original spot and began again travelling westward, towards the downtown or main core of Toronto. As I watched it, I noticed the speed was not consistent, very irradic like fast then slow but never jerky, very smooth but odd speeds. The speed seemed to move steadily after it did that little left right (north south) thing and began it&apos;s way west again.  Eventually it was out of my sight. I remained outside for awhile looking again and I know I will go back out again and look more.  There was a small engine aircraft and a jet around the same time and area, one travelling east the other south west (Towards Toronto Island Airport)  I&apos;ve seen something almost identical to this with my father , in this same yard on this same patio and same time of year..roughly 22 years ago..I was just a young girl then.  THE ONLY difference, it was travelling from west to east and a bit lower in the sky. At that time there were (3) of them. I remember they were glowing and as I recall they looked perhaps with a green glow but not a dark or deep green rather a pale green , soft green. As for the other things, the chevron shaped crafts...they look like the formation of how birds fly in a V but upside down..the point is the direction it travels. I Just found this website and I&quot;m just so very excited to provide this information and see what others have seen and read their stories. I don&apos;t want to over run you with information but I have an additional situation which happened to me in this very house around 1am in the morning, winter time about 5 yrs ago. A beam of light entered my front room window where I was watching tv and relaxing with my mother. We both saw it. It filled our room with the brightest yet softest light that didnt&apos; hurt or harm our eyes. I could see the light originated from the sky but it ONLY focused on our front room. The light did NOT cascade to the other rooms in the house nor did it cascade around the lawn/trees/shrubs or even the driveway or road. It was localized in this house.  I got up to look at it and stared out the window to the direction of which it came. The only thing I could see was this soft but bright glowing light in the sky hovering low, just above the treeline and across the street from us, over a park. I continued to watch, opened the window all the way then went and stood by the front door opening it to hear if there was any noise NO NOISE no engine no propeller no nothing DEAD SILENT. It was eerie but it didn&apos;t scare me.  I wondered what it wanted why just us just our home just here?  After a short while the light immediately faded and the craft streaked across the sky heading in a north east direction. I saw a streak, like a glowing streak behind it for a few seconds then that vanished and it was gone. That was one of the most amazing things I&apos;d ever been witness to.  If it makes any difference, since that time I&apos;d become quite ill. I always thought that that light and craft had something to do with it....but then again it could just be coincidental.

We are located 1 mile from the Batchlerville Bridge in close proximity to the Edinburgh Marina.  AT 10:55 this evening, my mother and myself were having a cigarette on the front porch looking up at the stars when we saw two object moving very fast (looked like stars) across the sky in a southearsterly direction...they were side by side when we first saw them...then one of the object started to slow down and lag behind the other...their brilliance also seemed to become brighter and dimmer while they were moving....then all of a sudden they COMPLETELY STOPPED dead in their tracks and began to hover, maintaining consistant distance between them.  Then a 3rd object appeared and the three together formed A PERFECT TRIANGLE !!!!.  These star like objects then hovered together for almost 20 minutes while all that time we NEVER TOOK our eyes off them..we ran into the house grabbed my Dad out of bed who came out and saw the triangle in the sky...after about 15 minutes the clouds began to obstruct our view....then one of the objects started to move in a westerly direction slowly then changed coarse in a perect half circle 180 degree turn, then stoped again, hovered and began to move in a straight line directly over our house stoppped again and is still hovering there....Now the cloud cover has obstructed our view but my parents and I are amazed at what we saw tonight !!!

I had left Fruitland, Idaho, late on the 7th of July. The distance is about 45 miles one way.  I&rsquo;m not sure exactly what time we left but it was getting close to midnight.  I took the Franklin exit off of Interstate 84 by mistake.  So I just headed north till I hit cherry lane road.  It&rsquo;s a back road which heads straight into meridian.  There was no other traffic that night on that road and all we could see was a lot of open fields.  Most of the fields on that road were not in use.From out of nowhere a strange light approached the side of the car at ground level and then flew right over us.  It hardly made any sound at all. I could see 4 bright white lights that were round in shape.  It felt like I was being watched for a split second.  After it flew over the car it dove down into the field next to us and its lights went out.  I saw that it didn&rsquo;t look anything like a plane.  It looked more like a long wing or saucer shaped.  I saw one light come on after the bright ones went out.  It was a small blinking blue light. After it had swooped down in the field I saw it whip around and jump back up in to the sky.  I felt lucky this thing didn&rsquo;t crash into us and I just kept driving.  I looked back in my rear view mirror at it and it was just hovering above the trees.((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken with this witness on several occasions, and we believe him to be quite credible.

Mr. Hall travelled to the site from the Seattle area, and both witnessed, and tape recorded the sound from, a turbine-powered aerial application aircraft.  Based on Mr. Hall&apos;s work, we now believe that the witnesses might have been brightly illuminated by the landing light of such an aircraft, after which it flew directly over their vehicle, as they drove along the highway.

So just out of curiosity, I stepped outside and sat on some stairs and I looked up at the sky and there was about 3 solid lights moving slowly.  Around this time the dog started to bark and act kind of manic, once and a while sitting and looking up at the sky.  I became interested so I stayed a while outside and the same amount of lights appeared like 10 minutes later but forming a triangular shape across the sky.  Then later on around midnight, I started to notice that there where jet like sounds and two lights appeared together.  One light was small and unchanging and was following another craft that looked like a commercial ariplane.  Both were moving in the same direction at apparently the same speed.  I became scared so I went inside, where I kept hearing a couple minutes of jet-like sounds followed by about 5 min. interludes of silence, then starting back up again.  The same thing has been happenening since then untill today and in the day some people and I have been noticing the jet sounds in the same way I described above throughout the day.  Maybe its normal, I don&apos;t know.  By the way, my dog is still acting kind of strange, eventhough I took him to the vet to see what was wrong.  That didn&apos;t help.

Three of the witnesses had no alchol the entire day. At about 17:35 we begin to hear military jets begin to orbit the city about once every five minutes.  After we here this occur three time we go out to see whats going on.  We see two F/A-18 in an orbiting pattern over to the east of our location. Aircraft were in a lag formation with wing 1/2 mile back with an altitude of about 4000 Ft and an orbit radius of about 5 miles.  I look to the center of there orbit and spotted a glowing silver ball.  I pointed this out to relatives and three others witnessed this.  I would estimate it&apos;s altitude at 6000-8000 ft. The ball would flash a golden color every 30 seconds or so in a seemingly regular pattern.  This went on until about 18:30 pm, the location of the ball did not change the entire time.  Two of us witnessed white streaks appear within proximity to the ball, and a haze happened to appear arround the location of the ball. The F/A-18s continued to orbit until we lost sight of the ball.  We didn&apos;t really start to think seriously about what the ball could be until about 18:15, and took one film photo that may contain a picture of the aircraft and ball. I checked 4th of July celebrations for Mission Viejo and Lake Forest but found no evidence of military fly-bys for any of the festivities. I think we were not the only ones to spot this, so we checked with local CBS affiliates to see if there had been any reports of objects in the sky and military airpower present and were told nothing was reported.", "So much to say and so little space. Odd Dark object flying from Dartmouth out of Harbour, not a bird!This would be my second viewing of what I would call a UFO sighting. I once sighted something out of the ordinary here in Halifax while walking in Point Pleasnt Park after hours when the park was closed. Although you are not allowed to be in the park after hours a few friends of mine liked to play childish games in the dark with flashlights, usually in the fog. I was facing I believe south looking over the North West Arm ( a body of water in the Halifax Harbour ) Where something caught my eye, This had been back in 2003, at the time I didnt think too much about it, mainly because I didnt want to get caught by my friends. The time was about 11 PM and the night was foggy. A blue blob moved from avove me from the north side of the water to the south in a quick swift motion. It went pretty fast. Becasue it was foggy i didnt see any shape to it just an odd blue color, like looking into a CD or something. But this was not the report I was looking to submit.Two nights ago I was awake and feeling bored, I went out for a walk down the waterfront here in Halifax and sitting on the boardwalk near the Metropolis building, or what I refer to it as, I seen an odd dark spot move across the sky from the dartmouth area to the harbour entrance. I&apos;m guessing it went East to west. No sound and not moving fast. No lights and no real shape. really it looked like a huge blackish shaddow moving across the sky. I did have my Digital camera with me and I did manage to capture a video of this event but when I tried viewing the video on my PC I seen nothing in the video. I was not going to say anything about this sighting becasue people dont seem to believe in UFO, but what I seen 2 nights ago was not a plane, it had no lights and no shape, Was not a bird, only seaguls fly at night and I&apos;ve seen my share of them flying here at night, plus they would show up on this video.

The triangle was shorter on the back half and was moving very slowly. We couldn&apos;t tell if it was solid or not because it didn&apos;t pass in front of any stars.

While there I saw a very large bright light at about 12:45am to the SouthWest about a mile away and a few thousand feet above the ground (near) the canyon rim.  The light was circular and very large and bright, emitting a very white light, it had no collision lights like an airplane and it was far to big and bright to be a star.

I drive a convertible so we could see the sky for miles around us. I glanced out the front windshield in the direction towards the passenger seat and saw four lights (three white one red) over a small wooded area slightly higher then the trees (maybe 150-200 feet).  I asked her what that was since I needed to concentrate on the road.  She stated she thought it was lights overlooking a baseball diamond.  I looked again and said there was no pole or any other mechanism holding it up, and besides there was a red light right in the middle.  She looked again as we passed and said she wasn&apos;t sure.  With the top down and the radio off we heard nothing more then road noise, no sound to indicate a helicopter, plane, etc...especially one that low.  We pulled into Burger King parking lot and turned around so we were once again facing the object and studied it for a matter of seconds before I made the decision to see if we could get closer.  I pulled out and headed back in its general direction and before I even drove 100 feet it took off out across Grand Traverse Bay, and seemed to disappear instantaneously.  These lights moved faster then any jet or plane I have ever seen fly over head.  We drove back and forth along US 31 three more times looking out over US 31 before we decided to head home.

I got out my 35 MM Mamia camera, put on my 205 MM telephoto lens with a 2x doubler. I set it up on my tripod and took 6 or 7 color slides of the object. The only movement was the rotation of the earth caused it to move down out of the view finder. I was facing due west looking up at about a 45 degree angle. The sun was below and left of the object, below the ridge west of me. I lived down in a valley with a ridge to my west with an elevation of 850 feet above sea level.

The night was clear.  I was facing almost directly west, perhaps a few degrees south also, looking at the stars.  I picked out the Big Dipper, and a very bright star/planet (Jupiter?) south following the arc of the handle at about 45 degrees or a little more up in azimuth.  (There is another group of stars that is like an inverted triangle at a higher azimuth, and Jupiter(?) was straight under the point star of that. I am in the city so only the brightest stars of most constellations are visible.)  As I was wondering if the bright star was a planet or what star, I noticed an odd flash of a light near it.  The object seemed very, very high up in altitude, higher than a plane would normally be, so at first I thought I was seeing a satellite, then two satellites.  The first object I saw did seem to appear at each flash farther to the right (north) to about four fingers&apos; width, but did not continue on beyond that and disappeared at that position. As I watched I noticed that there was another light, and then two more all surrounding Jupiter(?).  Most appeared less than a finger&apos;s width from Jupiter(?), but one was out about two fingers&apos; width.  These flashes of light were distinct and quick, not twinkly like stars, and there were no visible clouds.  Either the object I had first seen was moving to all sides of Jupiter(?), or there were several objects, as these flashes would appear at about 11 o&apos;clock, 2 o&apos;clock, 5 o&apos;clock, and 7 o&apos;clock positions around it with no regularity as to which light went on where.  One light seemed to have an interval of about 45 seconds for a few flashes. They did not seem coordinated with each other. The lights were small and contained, not lighting up the sky, just themselves. They were white, and perhaps a little red. They flashed one at a time very quickly on and off again--if I blinked I missed it, which made it hard to pick up a pattern. They stayed off for varying periods.  There was no sound, and no smoke trails. A jet in another part of the sky looked completely different and could be heard as it went on.  The environment was otherwise very quiet except for an occasional car passing on the street in front and a little rustling of leaves in a light breeze. The objects stayed around Jupiter(?) for about an hour or more altogether but seemed harder to see later as Jupiter(?) sank a little to the west.  I could no longer see four.

It was a perfectly clear morning, although a little hazy.  While still driving on 166th Street heading east, and approaching the intersection with Indiana Avenue, I saw in the eastern sky, right above the treeline (actually between two bunches of trees in the distance), a dark grey or black rectangular object hanging in the sky, which seemed to be tapered on its lower end.  It was about the size of a dime, if held at arms-length.  Its shape was like a rectangle with its longer measure pointing up and down, but its lower end was more tapered than its top end, as if maybe the lower end was pointed away from me and the top end was pointed towards me, so that the top end appeared bigger and the lower end smaller.  I don&apos;t know how far away it was, or how big it was, but I&apos;d estimate, just by the way it looked through the haze, and the fact that it was low on the horizon, that it was only a few miles away. It most definitely was not a plane.  I suppose it could have been the rectangular underside of a dark green Huey-type army helicopter, but it sure didn&apos;t look like that, and I can&apos;t think of any reason why a military helicopter would be in that area (there aren&apos;t any military bases nearby), and hovering with its nose pointed up at such an angle, so that I could see its entire undercarriage from several miles away.  I think that such an extreme manuever would have put any helicopter at risk of crashing.  Also, Huey-type military helicopters make a very loud &quot;whump-whump-whump&quot; sound with their rotor blades that can be heard (and sometimes even felt) from miles away, but I didn&apos;t hear any sound.  My first thought was that it might be some kind of strange rectangular advertising balloon, or a cluster of balloons in a rectangular formation, even though I&apos;d never seen a rectangular configuration of balloons before.  And, it just didn&apos;t didn&apos;t look like any balloons I&apos;d ever seen.  It looked like a solid object.  I actually said aloud to myself, &quot;What the hell is that?&quot;  I&apos;d never seen anything like that before.  It was very low on the horizon, and I was able to catch only a few glimpses of it between the many trees in that area, as I drove.  When I first saw it on 166th Street, it seemed to be stationary, but after I got onto Indiana Avenue going north, I realized that it must have moved, because I couldn&apos;t find it again in the location where I first saw it.  About 3 minutes later (11:03 AM), I got another glimpse of it as I drove east on 154th Street, near the intersection of 154th Street and Cottage Grove Avenue (I drive fast).  At that time, it had definitely moved quite a distance to the northwest, because now it was almost due north of me, behind St. Jude Church, but still several miles away, and low on the horizon.  I then drove further east on 154th Street, trying to find it again. About 3 minutes later (11:06 AM), I saw it one last time as I drove east on 154th Street (also called Pulaski Road) in Calumet City, near the intersection of 154th Street and Michigan City Road.  It was now directly north of me, way off in the distance behind Dirksen Junior High School, and it now looked like an elongated dark grey or black teardrop, with the larger bulbous end facing down.  It was also obviously much farther away, because it was more obscured by haze at that point, and smaller. After seeing it in the distance behind Dirksen Junior High School, I turned left onto Calhoun street, going north, attempting to get past all the trees in that area and find it again.  But when I got to a relatively clear area near Calhoun street and Sibley Blvd. a few seconds later, it was gone. This was definitely the strangest thing I&apos;ve ever seen in the sky.  I&apos;m still trying to find a logical explanation for what it was.  I thought maybe there was an air show downtown, and that this object might have been some weird aircraft that was part of the show.  But as far as I know, there was no air show going in downtown Chicago on 6/26/2005.  Then I thought, maybe it was some type of large advertising display being pulled by a small plane.  But it was just too big and bulky-looking to be that.  Usually, such aerial advertising displays are of the long, thin banner variety.  Any advertising display which was so big and bulky would have interfered with the aerodynamics of the plane pulling it, and caused the plane to crash.  Then I thought, maybe it was just a strange rectangular balloon.  But it was just going too damned fast to be any type of balloon.  I&apos;ve seen Goodyear-type balloons in this area before, so I know what they look like, and how slow they travel.  If it was a balloon, it could not have covered such a distance and disppeared from view so quickly.  And, as I mentioned, it definitely was not a plane, and I don&apos;t believe that it was a helicopter, either. I would like to know what the hell this thing was.  It&apos;s really bugging me now.  I actually called the non-emergency numbers for both the South Holland and Calumet City police, and asked them if anyone had reported anything strange in the sky at around 11:00 AM, but they both said that nothing had been reported.  That doesn&apos;t really surprise me, due to the short length of time it was visible.  But I would like to know if anyone else saw anything strange in the sky that morning, or whether it was just a big, dark colored helicopter or something.", "Man witnesses peculiar, orange-colored, triangular object against the night sky.Telephoned Report:  A man called to report having witnessed a very peculiar, triangular-shaped craft, as it flew along a nearby river. The witness reported that he awoke from sleep, and looked out the north-facing window of his residence at approximately 0250 hrs..  After a short period of time, he witnessed a very peculiar, triangular-shaped object, that was covered with many tiny orange lights.  The net effect of the lights was to give the object an overall, distinctly orange color. He added that the object appeared to be an equilateral triangle, and its apparent size, from his vantage point, he thought would have been slightly smaller than the apparent size of a full Moon in the night sky. The object slowly moved out of his sight to the east, after he had witnessed it for an estimated two minutes.((NUFORC Note:  We were first apprised of this incident by Mr. Brandon Stahl, a journalist for  the Daily Journal Newspaper in Fergus Falls, MN.

As I was coming down the hill I was looking ahead towards the intersection when I saw an event, out of nothing in a clear blue sky three red objects appeared from what appeared to be one source.  The three objects projected out equally and evenly from the center source and then they all disappeared at the same time.  They were shaped kind of funny, kind of like potatoes.  There was no sound and no explosion or anything like that.  Very, very weird, it kind of reminded me of craft that lost their cloaking function for a few seconds and then it began to work again.

The property behind my house is private, and gated so that no cars can enter.  Further, I am sure that no one should be there at all.  I was concerned why it was there and that if it was a fire I should call for help.  After watching for about 5 minutes I realized that it had not grown larger and appeared to have both red and white lights that seemed to be flickering.  I woke my husband still thinking maybe it was a large electrical item of some sort.  He said he thought it was too large and also saw that it had both red and white lights.  After watching this light for about 30minutes, I got pretty scared and decided to turn off all of our house lights and check our doors.  After going downstairs, I realized that I could still see it from my downstairs windows and realized it was too large to be a gadget of a camper or homeless person.   At this point my two sons and a house guest tried to get a better look from my deck.  We went outside and used binoculars.  Speaking for myself I can say that what I saw seemed to have a pattern of lights.  Three very faint white lights on top, one large bright one in the center and a number of white and red ones below that that seemed to be moving and alternating colors.  The exact shape of the thing I can not say.  I could only see the lights.  My husband whistled out very loudly and nothing changed at all.   My house guest taped the lights with his video camera.  Eventually, too frustrated and tired I decided to go to bed.  I went to bed at 2am.  I woke at 6am and as usual there were deer grazing in the meadow and I could see no evidence of anything out of the ordinary.  Today, my husband and I decided to go back there to see if we could find evidence of a camper or some other explanation.   What we found was no reasonable way to explain it.  I had originally speculated that the only thing I could think of with that pattern of lights would be a tractor.  The area is very wet, as it is a recently drained pond and there was not only no way for a tractor to get into the area but no tracks as well.  What we did find was a large round indentation with deeper indentations within it about every foot or so and one indentation in the center.  Some of the weeds were dried and brittle (dead) and bent to one side behind where the object had been.  I am also certain now too that it was too large to be something someone could have walked into the area with.  There was no sound at all as we witnessed the lights and the bugs, frogs and whatnots were all as usual.  I can say for sure that I will be watching tonight.  I do not wish to be interviewed or my name identified but would like to know if anything like this has been reported previously.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and she seemed quite sincere and credible to us.  We have urged her to obtain photos of the indentation, and to have the other two witnesses submit reports, too.  We hope to obtain a copy of the video.

Inside appeared to be a long horizontial window within each doorway. I could only see this side, I didn&apos;t see top or bottom. There was no sound and I didn&apos;t see it arrive or depart. The part that bothers me is it was so close, just above the tree tops. This sighting was about 2=3 houses from where I live. I was facing north west. I live about 4 blocks from the ocean.  The dogs didn&apos;t seem to notice anything, no barking. This took place on or after midnight. I tried to put in 06/01/2005, but it would not accept in the form.

I looked up to the night sky towards the moon, (as I do every night) and I noticed what appeared to be a star except it didn&rsquo;t seem to fit with the constellations. I&rsquo;m not saying I know all my constellations, I&rsquo;m just saying it didn&rsquo;t fit. Now this star was directly Underneath the moon and I thought to myself is it moving or doe&rsquo;s it just appear as so because I was moving. So I stopped, and low and behold the &quot;star&quot; was still descending very rapidly. I called over a few co-workers, and the security guard on duty to take a look. Just for self-satisfaction that I wasn&rsquo;t crazy. We all continued to watch it descend, now when I say descend I don&rsquo;t mean on an angle, it was dropping straight down. Not at a speed you would contribute to something falling from the sky, and then at a certain point it looked as though it stopped, and wavered a little then it continued its journey down. Just before it got below my line of sight from the roof of my job, it just vanished. For as many years as I have been looking up (I&rsquo;m 25 now) I have never seen anything so peculiar in my life.  It was probably nothing, I just figured I&rsquo;d share what I saw in case you receive similar reports.Regards,  ((name deleted))((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))Mr. Davenport,I was facing S-SE. It was moving niether left or right, but verticly down from my perception. If I were to assume a situation where I thought this perticular insident would fit. It would be something free falling, then it stopped, and then continued to decsend verticly down at a slower rate. IE: Free falling, parachute deploy, gradule decsent. It was also the brightest object in that vecinity, very far from my location. Before it dropped from my line of sight the light vanished.

Another sighting more recently, same kind of object.I was outside feeding my animals when I notice they&apos;re all looking at something. So I look up and I see a totally weird object. It&apos;s this white oval shaped object hovering in the sky. It was not a cloud, as it was moving too rapidly to be a cloud, and it was not a plane. I am certain of this. It was not a balloon or anything like that. I don&apos;t think it was from around here. Anyway, I look up to see it heading towards a range of mountains we call &quot;The Pinnacles&quot;. I watched it for a few seconds and all of a sudden, it was gone! I was astonished. No flash of light. No sound. Nothing. It was just gone. And the weird thing is, it was just this spooky object that made no sound. I got the chills, and I&apos;m not sure if it was because I was really scared or if it was because I was pumped that I saw this. But then I thought, &apos;Probably just my mind playing tricks on me.&apos; And that was that. Until a month or so ago.I went outside on the porch and I see that same white oval shaped object in the sky. It made no sound or anything, and it certainly didn&apos;t look like a plane. But the weird thing was, it was kind of near The Pinnacles where I saw the first white oval object. I rushed inside to grab the binoculars to see whether or not I could discern what the object was, and I couldn&apos;t find them so I rushed back outside. It was gone. I had only been inside for a few seconds, so I was puzzled. There were no traces of it whatsoever. It was totally weird.

We were in our subdivision and as I turned the corner onto one of our streets I saw out of my driverside window a solid triangular shaped object about 24-48 feet about the treetops over several houses. It was low enough that I could see without any doubt what it was. It was hovering but not stationary. It was illuminated with a bright silvery white light and a bright blue aura. The object was triangular but instead of the corners being pointed they were rounded. I yelled at the kids and my daughter looked and saw it and screamed. THe object then sped up and flew west over the treetops and up into the sky. It made no sound and there was no movement from the tops of the trees. The light was so bright that it made it possible to see the object clearly. There were no markings or windows. It appeared solid almost like aluminum but even smoother. As we drove down the street trying to keep up with it it continued to fly higher and west. There is no doubt whatsoever as to what we saw. I have never in my life see something like this. I am a nurse and I never imagined something like this existed. It was low enough that we saw exactly what it was.", "Diamond shape craft above the horizon.On April 7th, I was looking up pat the horizon above Standing Bear Lake, which is located west of my house when I noticed a strange light.  Now this light appeared to be blinking off and on.  It was still quite a distance away, but close enough to know that it was blinking and standing still.  I watched it for about five minutes until I went in and brought out the binoculars.  My first thought was lights from a helicopter searching the valley below, but after careful examination of the object I had to rethink this, since there was no searchlight emitting from the object.  Focusing the lenses on the binoculars, I discovered that the blinking lights emitted a read and green hue in color in the center of the object.  The shape of the object appeared to be diamond shape or triangular in dimension; in fact, a faint ray of light came out on three, maybe four areas of the object, which made me think it could be diamond shape. It was definitely not a plane.  The object made no noise whatsoever.  In fact, a commercial or military passenger jet flew over the house in the same general location as the object, so you could definitely tell the difference in the way the objects moved in the air relative to each other.  Eventually, the object did move very slowly towards the right and up into the night sky.  Sometimes it went back to where it started, but eventually moved away.  Now at the same time this is going on, I saw another non-blinking white light just above the horizon.  It would move upwards and then just as fast as it appeared would disappear.  In addition, there were tiny, faint lights that appeared to be coming from the main object, but would disappear in the night sky.  I watched the main object for about twenty-five minutes before I gave up and went inside.", "Fighter jet observed chasing a triangular craft in central OklahomaI am a competent, educated scientist of sound mind and character. I have never reported anything like this before. At 23:30 on 5/27/05 while taking my nightly walk, I obsereved a triangluar craft (craft) traversing the sky from north to south at about 20K feet. The sky is very clear this night with several miles of clear visibility. The craft&apos;s speed was about 500 knots. The craft was perfectly silent and moving rapidly. Several miles behind the craft was what appeared to be a fighter jet moving very rapidly, 600 to 700 knots.  As the jet was chasing the craft they both where flying toward my position.  I could begin to hear the engines of the jet at that time. It appeared as thought the triangular craft was toying with the jet in that as the jet got closer to the craft, the craft would speed up somewhat and leave the jet behind.  As the craft and jet got nearly directly over my location, the triangular craft made a sharp right hand turn the the west. The jet was unable to make the turn at the same angle as the craft. The jet&apos;s turn was much more pronounced and made a much wider loop. Due to that, the jet lost quite a bit of ground on the craft during the turn, yet again as both craft began traverseing in a straight line toward the west-nortwest the craft again appeared to toy with the pursuing jet in the same manner aforementioned. After a few seconds it appeared that the craft accelerated dramaticaly and left the jet behind.  I observed the jet make one tight loop several miles from my position and then turn off to the north-northeast and flew out of my line of sight. One thing that was odd about the triangular craft was the three lights making up the trianglar pattern were not equal in distance.  Referencing the wingspan of the jet, two of the lights on the craft were about 50 to 75 feet apart and the third light was approximately 100 to 150 feet from the other two lights. Additionally, the two lights closer together were at the front and the other further away light was at the rear facing the pursuing jet. This made the craft to appear to be moving in reverse. It should be noted, that the color of the triangular craft lights were an unusual milky white color, nothing like that of the very bright red, green and white lights obsereved on the jet. Tinker Air Force Base, which does have fighters, is located about 25 miles east of my house.  I assure you that this is a true account of what I observed on the stated date and time.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone on two occasions, and we found him to be quite objective in his description of the alleged sighting, and very well organized in his description of what it was he apparently witnessed.  We have invited him to contact media and law enforcement offices, to inquire whether anyone else might have been witness to the event.  Also, he will contact the FAA ARTCC in Oklahoma City, to inquire whether the controllers on duty Friday night, May 27, might know what the cause of the incident was. We have to allow for the possibility that the object apparently being pursued by what may have been a military fighter jet may have been an F-22 &quot;Raptor&quot; fighter on a test flight, but even that aircraft would have to have displayed conventional red and green marker lights on its wing tips.  The witness will submit an illustration of what the lights on the object looked like to him, as he viewed it from the ground.    If any visitors to the NUFORC site were witness to this event over Oklahoma, we would request that they submit a short report of what they saw, using the Online Report Form on our website.

One witness called home and asked a family member to go outside and two other witnesses saw streaks in the sky, both heading west, estimate altitude was 15-20 thousand feet. One witness reported the original object was not moving, but when they reached their home, the object look like it dived and then disappear or like it just shrunk and turn small.

I was sitting in the front passenger seat and the car was in the righthand lane. We had just past the small red island thats next to the Bridge and i was looking out to the south bay past the Bay bridge and and i saw the Big and long looking 747 jet Aircrafts flying towards and away from SFO. When you see a big plane or any plane far out in the distane they look slow and closer it is the faster it seems to move and the same for the opposite. So there was two planes, the one leaving SFO and the one coming in.the one leaving was further in the distane and you could see it moving reall slow and the same for the one coming into SFO.Right in between the view of the two jets was this bigger object, it was not longer then the two jets that are at two different distanes, but it was taller and had the shape of a blimp or an round and smooth oval and it had the shine of sun hitting cromed metal. What realley got me thinking was why was the oject near the two planes or even further away in the distance moving  faster then the planes. it was hualling ass in the air and it was big but not a plane.

It was just over the treeline of the horizon. It looked to be about three miles away. It definitely had glimmering lights that were flashing and the lights color was white. At the beginning of the sighting, it was still light outside and no stars were visible. We determined for certain that it was NOT a satellite, a meteor, a blimp, a comet, etc. Because they move and this object was stationary for about 15 minutes! I thought it may be the star Sirius cause I know a little about astronomy and it is the brightest star in our constellations over Earth. But when we went outside to investigate further, we saw more signs that this was an unexplaniable phenomenon. We had high-quality binochulars, and we both saw in them that the object was silver colored. Then the most amazing thing happened. We both witnesssed the object very quickly move to the southwest and then several seconds later returned exactly to where it was prior. Then a few minutes elapsed and it suddenly moved very quickly further from our view in a backwards motion. It was no longer visible, which means it cannot be a star. We moved back further about twenty-feet and up a slight hill on the side of our property. We could see the object again. My brother and I think that the object was being operated by intelligent forces because of the way it moved so fast and deliberately. After a couple of more minutes the object retreated a distance into the west and we could no longer see it.((NUFORC Note:  Possibly a celestial body.

At first I thought it was another aircraft and looked at my TCAS.  There was no aircraft around in that vicinity. I then looked back at the craft noticing it was passing us like we were sitting still while we were at Mach .78.  I also noticed it was at least 40,000 feet higher than us.  Pointed the target out to the first officer and she saw it as well. It may have been a satellite but it seemed to change directions as got directly off our nose and then dissappeared.  Object seemed to have a strobes. We both know it was not a shooting star so it was either satellite or unexplained.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous.

I was facing southwest as I looked up and to my left at the tea cup part of the Sagitarius constelation which was about 35 degrees high in the sky. I looked down at the dog and then looked up again. This time I looked up near zenith facing southwest. I did not see a craft. I saw some type of strange light effect. I will be able to describe it very clearly but it will take a lot of words.Imagine how this would look in the sky: If you had a plastic zip-loc sandwich bag and you were looking down on the opening as the bag hung vertically, you would only see a thin line of transparent plastic. This is what I saw in the sky. If I held up my hand at arms length and spread my thumb and little finger as far appart as possible it would seem to be about that width. It was translucent white. I could see stars through it.I saw this thing apear while looking up at the sky. It was a straight line then the thing got wider in the middle, the same way a plastic bag would look if you started opening it from the middle. Inside of the widening thing it still had a whiteness to it but it was easier to see through the middle than the edges. Inside it there was a line from end to end but it wasn&apos;t straight. It curved a little toward the top line of the light. The line was as thick as the other edges.If I were looking southwest and then tilted my head up this light in the sky was side to side.Here is what happened and it happened faster than you can read this. I looked up, the long horizontal light then started appearing like someone at a TV station sliding in an effect. It got wider in the middle, reached its maximum brightness (a little brighter than a cloud passing over a city at night) then started fading away to nothing as it started closing and it was gone.I guess I should mention how wide it seemed to open. Looking at the overall length and then comparing the opening to the length of the whole thing I would say it got about one tenth as wide as the whole length.This thing was see-through the whole time.After watching it I remembered to look at my watch and also the position of the stars. At first it seemed to show up almost diagonally in what reminded me of the great square of Pegasus. Five minutes later I looked up again and I couldn&apos;t find that group of stars. I found this very odd that I couldn&apos;t locate that pattern again. Did the sky change on me? It is the weirdest thing. Perhaps something is up in the sky creating some type of camoflage that resembles stars, just the wrong pattern. That would change the pattern in the sky. I don&apos;t have a star chart to do a check. Years ago I had an interest in astronomy and I have some experience with the sky but I am just a very rank amature.

Theres a mini-mart along that road were I used a payphone to call a friend to ask if he was seeing what I saw, He lives on Fairdale Ave nearly two or so miles from my location he went outside and saw the same thing I asked him to describe it and and got the same thing,only he said it was solid black.Luckily there were two police officers at the store at the time. I quickly asked both of them if they too say the craft. Both saw it, one even took out some binoculars. We all looked and when I did I could tell then that the craft seemed almost compressed and square like a CD case.

Lewis at the time, I don&apos;t remember which. I can&apos;t recall the exact time and date, I&apos;m sure it wouldn&apos;t be hard to find out, I&apos;m fairly certain it was October.  My neighbor and I were outside talking and he remarked he was watching the F-16s or whatever they were doing circles around what I guess was the Puget Sound area.  We were guessing they were circling because GW was in town and the whole terrorist threat and all that was (is) going on.  As we looked over the roof of my apartment which from my position is south to south east, we both saw three orange circles that seemed to dance around and change formation in random order. They changed places but never intersected, very quickly, while moving east.  I didn&apos;t see them disappear, as I took my eyes off them to tell my wife to come look, I asked my neighbor, &quot;Did you see that?&quot; and he said &quot;Yes.&quot; I said &quot;What WAS that?&quot;. At first I thought the jets were chasing it or it was chasing the jets, but it was too hard to judge the distance. It looked like it could have been 100 feet away or 2 miles away. The reason I couldn&apos;t judge the distance, I think, was because it was unlike anything I&apos;d ever seen in the sky. They weren&apos;t like lights because the edges were crisp, or at least not blurry, something in between.  They didn&apos;t glow so much as they were just &quot;on&quot;. It was hard to tell if they changed shape as they maneuvered because they moved so fast. They looked very close at first, because of their clarity...but they made no sound, and so I reasoned that they could not be close. I think they got smaller as they danced away, it was hard to tell. It all happened so fast. Maybe four seconds. I then reasoned it may have been a reflection off my glasses or something but my neighbor saw it too. I got very excited about what I just saw. I told my wife I saw a UFO or &quot;something&quot;. My neighbor and I tried to figure out what it could have been, and came to the conclusion it must have been a UFO, as it was unlike anything we had ever seen. Right after it all happened, I went back outside and looked up in that direction hoping to see something more, but after several minutes I thought it foolish to think I would see something like that again in the same place in the universe. To this day, I cannot accurately describe what they looked like- not bright like a light, no discernable three dimensional shape except circular; almost like putting a flashlight to a piece of clear-orange plastic, but not glowing(?).    When I say &quot;danced&quot;, it was not a zig-zagging movement so much as it was a quick and fluid motion, so fast I didn&apos;t see a pattern to it.  They seemed to randomly switch around positions in a very, very tight &quot;formation&quot; as they moved in a group.  Proportionately, if they were billiard ball size, the &quot;formation&quot; never got more than, if even, five billiard balls across in any direction.  The whole thing was over so quickly, I imagine it may have been only two seconds, I really don&apos;t know.  Two days ago I talked with my neighbor and recalled that night and we both agree we have no idea what we saw.  He is from what I know of him an average and honest guy,  maybe 10 or 15 years older than I am.  I have never asked him if he has ever seen a UFO, but he seemed to me to be fairly accepting and not so surprised as I was.  Kinda like, &quot;Yep, there&apos;s one right there.&quot;  The people I work with would laugh at me if I told them, although my family did not.  Although I may have marked it on my calendar (which I have since thrown away), and I don&apos;t recall the exact day, I&apos;ll never forget seeing whatever it was I saw.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

We were going through the town of Woodville on Hwy 72, travelling east. Coming over a small mountain, I saw a couple of white lights and a red blinking light.  I thought, there is a plane.  See them all the time and it looked just like that. I then noticed, &quot;Hey, isn&apos;t that plane awfully low?&quot;  Oh my gosh, it is going to crash, it looked like it was getting lower. My friend said, &quot;What is that?&quot;  Just so happened he had glass tops in his corvette and I was on the passenger side.  As it came over the top of us, I watched it. It wasn&apos;t moving as fast as we were so it had to be less that 60 miles an hour. It sort of stopped, suspended in air over the highway for a couple seconds. I could see the dark shape but couldn&apos;t tell if it was quite triangular or not. The most amazing thing was the lights. I saw a red blinking one underneath. There were 4 white lights, 2 on the front and 2 on the rear. Now, what was odd about these lights was the fact that they were all shining backwards. You could see the beams off into the night sky. Kind of like shining a flashlight and kicking up a bunch of dust - you see the beam. Well, when it stopped, all 4 beams slowly turned clockwise, sweeping down across the road and then turned up to shine forward. When they did this, it started moving again and quickly flew north. It was moving from the south. The mountains there are about 1000-1200 feet high, so it could have only been 1300-1500 in the air.

What attracted our attention was the loud noise from a Blackhawk helicopter beating as it was flying as top speed with white lights pointing forward and about a half mile ahead of the helicopter was a very low flying disk.  It was very large (larger than 747)and made no noise, it was as if it was floating in the air and the flying so low that I could have shined a flashlight on it.  I could not tell if the helicopter was just following the craft or chasing the craft.  I believe the blackhawk was trying its best to keep up with the craft and because the lightes were pointing forward, I am sure the craft was just following the craft.

I woke up at around 12:00am from some sort of noise that is too hard to describe. For the first time in as long as i have lived in my house (5 years), i opened my blinds. Instantly i saw a disk or saucer glowing with white lights in the sky. It must have been very distant because it was very small. The lights would become very bright and then dim so that it was invisible. This went on for about 30 minutes, while i tried to figure out how to turn the flash off of my parents new digital camera. I feel ashamed that i didnt wake them up upon this event in order to perserve my pride. I am an Honor student at Stanton College Preparatory HighSchool. # 1 magnet school in the nation. That said, i still dont believe in UFO&apos;s; but i have seen many aircrafts fly by my location, this one was floating in the same position almost glowing for that period of time. I did not take any medication of any type, nor have i ever taken a drink or illegal substance in my entire life. (I am 16).

Then hours later saw exact object again.It was yesterday the 4th of July. After lighting off fireworks, my friends and i were sitting on the front lawn. I was facing the left side of my house when i noticed a very bright circular, orange colored object in the sky. It was very bright and was just hovering there. At first i thought it was an airplane of some sort, but then i thought airplanes arent that bright and just orange like that, nor are helicopters. Then i thought it was a star, but realized the area we&apos;re in, stars dont shine that bright, and if they did we would have seen this star before. So i realized it was a UFO. As all my friends were looking at it, i ran in the house to grab the video camera. As I was zooming in, i thought it looked like a small bump on the top of the circular object, but couldnt exactly make it out. Because the object was small to catch on tape, it was hard to keep the camera still because i had to zoom in so far. So i turned the camera off. Then we noticed the UFO started to vanish. It just got smaller and smaller. I tried to get it dissapearing on tape, but for some reason i couldnt pick it up. Then it was gone. At about 3:35 PM me and my friends were going to bed. My windows were open and i was kidding around with my friends saying that i saw the same UFO again. They looked and knew i was joking. Then before i was closing my windows I noticed the same UFO, Orange and circular. It was doing the same motions, barely moving then dissapearing. This startled me and my friends, as a joke turned serious. I didnt know what to think. Now it is the next day. And i am typing this report.", "Golden orb seen over Colorado SpringsSighting in Colorado Springs, July 4, 2005 at 8 pm  I was at my friend Gail&apos;s house in the Springs. We were sitting on her deck after a BBQ when she looked up at the cloud pattern toward the East and said, Oh, there&apos;s a ship up there, I feel it. She is a practicing psychic with years of good experience so I pay attention when she feels something. I looked where she was pointing and saw nothing. While we were both looking in the area suddenly a bright illuminated golden spot (small circle) manifested there and traveled from East to West at a constant speed. It never changed its course, speed or brightness and went across the sky in about one minute while we watched it. We have a lot of military in the area, Ft Carson, NORAD, Schreiver Air Base, Space Command and we see aircraft all the time. This was not a plane or a chopper. Even though it was the fourth of July, it was not any kind of fireworks I had ever seen. While we thought at first it might have been a mylar balloon, it traveled in the opposite direction to the prevailing wind with no bobbing or wobble we could discern, more like a determined path than one subject to the wind. We have no other explanation than it was a ship, like she intuited.", "flash of light...then disapeared~It was about 12 noon....me, my father, and my friend where rideing our boat....in the distiance we saw a light,almost like a star but in daytime.we noticed it and after about 10 sec it just disapeard. no trace of it again! we looked hard but nothing it just disapeard!", "I was taking out the trash and when I was going inside I saw a redish glow so I looked up and there were 4 red balls hovering over my house they stayed there for about 3 minutes and then sped off.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report elects to remain totally anonymous.

StrangeA co-worker and myself first spotted a dot way up in the sky as we were building a deck on a new house in Martha&apos;s Vineyard. I looked out at the beautiful day as we always did from this beach front property, not a cloud in the sky. As I was taking in our surroundings I looked almost straight up following a hawk that lived in the tree next to our deck, as I did I saw this dot in the sky I stopped for about 30 to 40 seconds which made my co-worker ask what I was looking at and I said to him &quot;can you see that up there&quot;? He replied yeah that little spot and I said something to the affect that &quot;wow it isn&apos;t moving at all&quot; and he agreed. We kept an eye on it as time went by and told others as they came into our area everyone noticed it and that&apos;s when things began to get strange because we all agreed it was something big but it was so far up that we could not make it out. Not one of us wanted to blurt out the dreaded UFO phrase but I had to because this thing was bugging me now. We would go back to work for a while and stop to look up and it stayed there. Finally luch time arrived and we all took a look as we made the lunch list and at almost noon time to the second this thing just began to drop straight down and it looked round and silver before we noticed that it headed east at a clip unreconisable to me, it moved so fast as we all watched it leave. The five of us just amazed at this point agreed we had just witnessed a UFO and knowing there wasn&apos;t a thing we could do about it we continued our work and told everyone on the island what we had seen.

We thought it might be a plane, as many planes approach Portland International Airport in the general area where we first spotted it.

Through the Binoculars the object appeared to have  a yellowish tint to it.  The object appeared to be disappearing and appearing agian then was gone.

Other times it moved slowly and changed directions several times. I had a good view as the sky was clear and there was really nothing else in the sky.

My two teenage children were at home with her, so I was alone in the car. Coming down Parker Street, which is a suburban area, I started going past part of the golf course on the left.  There are many trees here and the night was dark although there are streetlamps.  I was compelled to slow down the car (windows were open) and look over to the left as I pulled over to the curb.  There were no other cars on the road, which is strange for even this late hour as Parker Street is a main four-lane throughway.  I know the radio was on, but cannot recall any music playing just before, during or after the incident.  I realized that hovering directly over the treetops (maybe 40&apos; at the most as they are predominantly maples) was an immense black triangle. No lights, but it blocked all stars and ambient lighting from the surrounding area so that it was like dense black velvet. It was silent.  As soon as I recognized it as a UFO, I recall nothing else until I was pulling away from the curb and driving on my way home.  I had a hard time understanding why I had been pulled over in the first place and struggled to recall.  A few moments later it came back to me what I had seen.  Then I heard the music playing, looked at the car clock realizing I was missing 18 minutes of time.  I cannot recall the exact timing but I do recall the 18 minutes as the number 18 is a lifelong pattern of synchronicity. I had to laugh at that one!  I told my mom when I got back to the house about what had happened.

This was just the last time.The area I see them is always by the airport going down the highway.  Now, the first time, I noticed a round bright light in the clear blue sky that would fade out and reappear as I traveled along. It seemed to stay with me.  It didn&apos;t move. It seemed to stay fixed in the sky except when it would fade out and reappear almost as if to stay with me.  This lasted about ten minutes and was in September of 2003.  This past year I have noticed it at least two other times.  Except two other times it was not a light but a solid round white object that seemed to hover and then zoom off into the distance.  The last sighting looked like a white rectangle that I was open to the possibility of it being a jet.  So I watched it as it went behind a cloud and never came out.  I watched that cloud for at least ten minutes.  I really felt that it wasn&apos;t a plane, but knew for sure when it &quot;hid&quot; behind a cloud.  I have had other experiences in my life since I was little, including lights surrounding my bed and not being able to move. My sister was a witness to this and stared in shock.  Also, a couple years ago my son noticed a &quot;moving star&quot; when he looked out his window.In that same time period he showed me a rash under his left rib cage that was the shape of a perfect equilateral triangle.  This is just the surface of the things I&apos;ve seen.  I&apos;m beginning to think that they&apos;re following me. By the way, my very first sighting was when I was about nine.

But I do remember my brother had left for college, so I must have been a Junior in high school.  I had shelves built in to the wall at the foot of my bed.  Suddenly, in the middle of the night, I awoke to a crashing sound on my floor.  I leapt out of bed, headed for the light switch, and flipped it on while runningout the door (feared the boogie man).  As I tried to excape, I ran into my mom who was standing just outside my bedroom door.  She scared me half to death too, since her room was on the opposite end of the house...and she was not the type to check and see what went boom in the night.  I couldn&apos;t figure out how she got there so quickly.  I then turned around, out of breath, to see what the noise was.  My shelves had fallen to the floor with all the books, etc...  Relieved, I said, something to the effect of, &quot;Oh, thank God, it was just my books.  I flipped off the switch and went back to bed, leaving my mom in the doorway.  She turned the light back on and said, Karen, look out your window, in a monotonous tone.  Now, this is coming from a hyper melodramatic woman.  Again, &quot;Karen, look out your window.&quot;  I yelled back like the brat that I was, &quot;Mom, it was just my books, I&apos;m trying to sleep.  I&apos;ll clean it up tomorrow. Now, turn off my light!&quot;  And she repeated herself again, &quot;Karen, look out your window.&quot;  This went on a couple of more times, until I huffed and crawled to the end of my bed, opened the blinds and said, &quot;What?&quot;  At that very moment, I saw a huge fireball about a hundred yards above our back yard.  It was partically over ours, and the house behind us. I was wowed, and instantly thought that we should call somebody, but I didn&apos;t know who.  Just to report it, or to see if someone else had seen it, or, I thought, perhaps it was there just for us.   I wasn&apos;t afriad of it.  I thought it was cool. She said that there was no point in calling,that no one would believe us, or someon else would have called in by then.   She said, &quot;Yeah, I&apos;ve been watching it for hours.  It hovering above our yard like that, then it just... and at that very instant, it seemed to respond to her words.  It took off way across the infinite skyline and became the size of a pea, then it zoomed all over the sky and soon anough came back to our backyard, only slightly higher and further away this time.  I ended up getting in my moms bed with her so that I could watch it through binoculars out her sliding glass doors.  It didn&apos;t look like fire through the binoculars.  It was not of this earth.  I frustrated me, because I wanted to label it, even the colour seemed to change to various shades of orange.  I&apos;m not sure, but I think I remember seeing a little red.  The colour hovered around the ball, like a tangile hue. I watched it for hours.  I oinged all over the sky, then land slightly further away, over and over and over, until I fell asleep.  I never talked about it again, my mom and I never spoke of it.  Many years later, whenI was about thirty, I called my mom after years of not speaking to her.  I asked for two things; 1) my birth certificate and 2) I wanted to know about what she saw.  She said, oh, that thing.  Who knows what that was.  It could have been anything.

I recognized red, blue, and green. I went to grab my friend, when we returned there was a bright firey light adjacent to the object. The light was shaped like a torn seem, the light was seemingly almost as bright as the sun. The light was a mix of white and orange. A jet from the local airforce bace approached from the west traveling east directly for the triangular object and adjacent light.  We knew it was a jet because of airfoce experience, it was unmistakeable. As the jet approached the source the seem of light moved inward and closed as if it pixilated from mass to miniscule. The Triangular shape turned in a direction that faced upward and north by northwest. At this point we no longer saw three colors of light.  We saw three red circles instead and they grew rapidly smaller with the Triangles departure.  As it moved north by northwest it broke due east and appeared to be a weather helicopter or civilian chopper of some sort. Another event in seemingly the same location happened tonight, coincidentally while I was on the phone outside.  This time the triangular shape was difficult to see.  The adjacent light was much brighter and appeared to move south towards my self. As this happened the Triangular shape became more and more difficult to see.  Then impossible to see. The light moved inward and closed what seemed to be a tear or gap or seem. There was no triangular object after the light closed. Airforce jets responded this time as well from the same direction. They didnt get nearly as close before the firey light as ceased.

As I looked up, I spotted them immediately as well.  We asked each other what it may be?

NorthRidge Apartments) off of N. Nevada Ave. and I-25. (west of Pulpit Rock) Location of Sighting: Near and Around Pulpit Rock (about 4000 feet from apartments).Looking out one of the apt. windows, viewing the rock possibly after a rainstorm and watching the rainbow, I saw a mysterious ball shaped object floating south in a staight horizontal line toward the middle near the top of the rock. It was golden-white, sometimes with a bluish tone. I knew that it wasn&apos;t an airplane or any known flying object, especially since it never had any blinking lights, made any noise and lacked other shape than a sphere. I felt entranced everytime I saw it. The most peculiar thing about it, was that after reaching the rock, it appeared as if going behind it, yet never came out the other side! I have hiked the rock many times in my life and there is no trace of any aircraft landing, nor any place for a helicoptor or even a smally plane to land, since it is very treacherous terrain, behind the rock, ie., rocky hills and ravines with lots trees and uneven territory. In recent years, I came to conclude that this object may have not even entered behind the rock, but perhaps into the rock itself, judging by the rocks enormity. I not only had seen this phenomenon on this occasion, but aproximately three to four other times, in a span or two to three years, always in the same location...and horizonal direcion and height. The appearance of this happening occured usually in the mid summertime, and always durring the early part of the evening, where it was still lit outside. It was usually after it rained and the sky was almost all clear, yet I observed the same occurance on a clear evening, where it had not rained at all! I do not recall any other witnesses beside me, I was perhaps alone in the room everytime.I always felt that Pulpit Rock was a Strange and Mystical place, where I always felt drawn to. Up to this day, this place is like a magnet to me....It energizes my spirit, stimulates my Higher conciousness, and body and a peculiar something that isn&apos;t logical and radiates from it.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.

There were many lights on the base of the object, seemed to be in a circle. Flying very very low, much lower than conventional aircraft. It hovered over our heads and indeed it was a sphere shaped object with a circle of lights on the bottom, moved very slowly just right of where we were standing.

I was always forgetting to do this and this time was no exception.  I walked out of the back door grabbed both cans and walked around the corner of the house. I had taken maybe 6 steps when the thought to look up occured to me. I mention this because it seemed kind of odd to me afterward that I had this thought. I looked directly up(12:00) and saw bright, white, oval or elipse shaped light . The light had diagonal bands or lines that were in a zig-zag pattern across the short diameter of the elipse . The lines were on the apparent bottom and were darker in color than the rest of it. The light was moving due north at slow steady speed. I was facing south . It was kind of a blustery night with strong winds and a very low cloud ceiling . The clouds were moving in a southerly direction at a really good clip . Racing across the sky if you will . At first I thought it was a spotlight shing on the bottom of the clouds but the light was shining down THRU the clouds and I could see wisps of cloud partially obscuring the light . The light was so intense though that I could see  right thru them . There was NO sound at all. As near as I could tell the object/light was just above the cloud layer which seemed to be somewhat less than a 1000 ft. Thats a really uneduacated guess but the best I can give. I was really stunned by this sight and stood there watching it until it went out of sight and for a good while after. What really got me was the fact  of having seen it DIRECTLY over me .I mean if you had dropped a plumb line from it I WOULD HAVE BEEN RIGHT THERE and that precise second is  when I looked up. A  half a second later and I woulnt have seen it at all because it would have been out of my field of vision. The odds of that happening the way it did seemed to be important to me in some way at the time. When I went back in the house my mom asked what had taken so long and I was surprised at her question and I told her nothing! I dont know why I didnt tell her but  I did tell my brother who was very unimpressed . I remember staying up all night thinking about it over and over . Thanks for listening and for the work you do .p.s. I almost forgot ! The size of the light object was slightly less than a lemon if you held it up to the sky .

The object was much higher than most aircraft one would typically observe in the area, and appeared almost as a moving star. The object was not moving with particular quickness. The object appeared to wobble slightly from right to left as it moved on its course. We observed the object until we could no longer see the object due to its distance. We all saw it, and the entire event lasted at the very least 5 minutes, perhaps longer. The interesting thing is that I - along with several of my friends - have witnessed these objects - these white balls of light - moving through the skies of Ocean County on numerous occasions. Often times, they go from dim to bright while moving and sometimes even blink out completely. Sometimes after they blink out you can swear you can still see a form moving thorugh the sky. Sometimes you dont necessarily have that feeling. Sometimes they blink out and then back on. It is very weird whatever it is. My friends and I have observed these objects moving not only south to north (the most typical route of travel) but also north to south, and in the east-west directions. We have seen even seen them several times in one night, and in multiple locations. Whatever these are, they definately are not airplanes. They can only be described as moving stars! Its very, very odd. They are usually seen between 20:00-23:00. I have seen similar accounts of white moving orbs accross the country, and even some where they blink out or on, or brighten or dim, as these do.

I told my friend about this, and while she &quot;believed&quot; me, just for a little more verification, she found this site and also saw someone else around my age who remembers seeing something similar at around the same time! -- She then brought it to my attention, and I was so excited about it, that I decided to now post my recollection of what I saw on that summer evening probably sometime in the late 60&apos;s!  Unfortunately, since I was so young at the time, I cannot really recall the exact date or time of when I actually saw it, but it is a safe bet to say it was definitely in the late 60&apos;s, and it was definitely in the evening and in the summer.  My guess would be around August of 1966 or 1967 at around 7:30 PM or so.  My Aunt and I were in the living room in our home in Queens, New York and all of a sudden we heard this extremely loud noise of something flying over the house -- though, it was not the same type of sound like an airplane, a helicopter or even a blimp makes, though, if I were to pick which one of these it resembled in sound the most, I&apos;d have to say a blimp, though, it&apos;s hard to describe the sound really, but it was very loud, and it was different, so we both ran together to the front porch window and we both looked out just in time to see this huge object that had just flown over our house.  As I recall, it was long and left a beautiful redish and greenish color streaked across the sky as it passed.  It was actually travelling quite fast, and was also flying quite low -- at least what had looked to me to be much lower than I had ever seen any plane fly in the sky at that time. As I recall, the front end of the object was like a big, red diamond-like shape object attached to what looked to me like a long rod-type of thing, and the bottom had a green diamond-like shape attached to it, which, as I also recall, was quite smaller in size than the red diamond-like shape. -- (It&apos;s actually been so long since I saw the object, that it could also very well have been visa versa -- the green diamond-like object could&apos;ve been on the front end of the rod-like object and could&apos;ve been the bigger one in size and the red one could&apos;ve been in the back, and have been the smaller diamond-like object -- I&apos;m not really 100% sure about that anymore -- but I do remember very vividly the red and green colors and how bright both shapes were, and how diamond-like in shape that they both were and how extremely loud the object was as it flew over my house -- almost like it vibrated the house a little as it flew over it!)  As I also recalled at that time, there was some mention on the news about there being spottings of people seeing a foreign object, so we really weren&apos;t completely shocked by the sighting, but just real excited about seeing it!  As it passed over more houses, it became out of sight, so I quickly ran upstairs and looked out my hallway window, but lost sight of the object after that.  However, as I said before, it left a beautiful streak of red and green in the sky, which lasted for a little while!  My Aunt is deceased now, so I cannot ask her what her recollection of the sighting was, and if she remembered anything different than I did. -- But even today, I still get excited when I recall the sighting!  I think it would be very nice if you had some kind of message board or something like that on this site where people who have had similar sightings could talk back and forth with each about them if they choose to, as it&apos;s kind of nice to know that I&apos;m not alone in what I saw back then!  I also never even knew that this site existed until my friend just brought it to my attention....  But I&apos;m glad at least for the opportunity to post my recollection of the sighting -- and I thank you very much!((NUFOR Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

All but a few of our sightings took place usually just after dark. This was just the first time that we saw something in that area.

Although after the first time it seemed that for about the next aprox. 2 years nearly we saw something that neither one of us could explain. Anyway each time we saw these crafts they moved almost directly over our heads and made no noise that we could hear. But it seemed that one could feel like a presure or something when they were directly over head. I really don&apos;t know how to explain it. They almost always moved from norhwest to southeast very low no more than 300 to 400 ft off the ground. We were both into model rocketry when we were younger and kind of used to judging height. We even tried shinning a spot light at them a few times but it didn&apos;t seem to do anything so we only did that a few times. The bottom of the triangular craft was smooth and kind of (roundish). The round craft went bye much faster and was harder to make out. For a while we were camping sometimes 2 weekends a month and for that period of time we saw something almost every time we went up. I wish I could tell you more but thats about it. After about 2 years they just stopped showing up. We both remarried and stopped doing so much camping.As I said.

This is a new millenia and it&apos;s time for a new world order allright but not the stilted, contrived childs building block type promoted by patrician &apos;we know better than you&apos; demagogues. Their silly secret society, michiavellian intrigue ways of running things are as outdated as the buggy whips that remained in the last century, and as unnatural and bizarre as the pathetic face-hip-boob lifts obsessed by celebrities today. There are many, many things that press for answers and change in our society, that require a different focus for human behaviour away from competition and greed.Today let&apos;s start with our new neighbors; who the hell are they and where do they come from? Are they here to eat us or eat with us? SORRY FOLKS, I just had to get all that off my chest. I&apos;ve been saving it up since my first encounter in 1971 and its built up over the years with three unforgettable episodes. #1) - October 7, 1971,1 am. While travelling east on a country road towards Kitchener, Ontario, Canada, on a clear moonless night; my wife and I noticed a peculiar glowing object hovering just above the tree line to our left about 1000 feet away. I remarked what an interesting effect the moon had reflecting off the top of a silo that way. It looked like a flying saucer, (chuckle) As we proceeded along the road at a leisurely 40 miles per hour, I continued to glance back over my shoulder to watch the changes occur, expecting it to change shape and get smaller as we moved away from it. However when my observations discovered that not only was it holding its horizontal, elliptical shape but getting larger and brighter, I immediately and frantically searched for the moon, craning my neck this way and that. Not finding it, I asked my wife to search for the moon and she discovered also, no moon! I then asked her to look over her left shoulder, and tell me what she saw across the field. She confirmed there was a horizontal, elliptical object, nearly as bright as moon light, getting bigger and closer; I pulled over and stopped the car. By now my wife was frightened and refused to get out of the car, clinging to the door knob out of fear. I wanted to settle this and conclude it was the movement caused by driving that was responsible for what I expected was an illusion. Up to then my only knowledge of flying saucers was in the realm of Buck Rogers, science fiction and stories of peculiar incidents and artifacts from the history of humankind, never putting much credence in the few current reports I had read, I didn&apos;t really know what to think, the jury was still out. So I got out of the car and stood very still, bracing myself against the automobile to be sure of my bearing. Well this thing kept moving very slowly from an  ENE direction, still skirting the tops of the forest across the field from us, but not yet coming directly towards us. By now its scale had gone from a dime size at arms length when we first saw it about five minutes earlier to a nickle size. Its steady movement and even moonglow illumination convinced me this neede closer inspection, and that it probably was a flying saucer. Looking back at my wife I said I was going for a closer look to which she groaned her displeasure. I blythely and quite naively raced across the road towards a point in the field about five hundred feet away to intersect its direction of travel, this involved risking an encounter with a barnyard dog because we happened to be next to a farm house to our north east. I made it across the yard without incidence, over a fence then into the field which I discovered was fallow with just short scrub and weeds. As I was running towards my point of intersection in the field ahead, I kept my eyes on the prize and noticed it had altered its course and was coming towards me more directly. Our paths crossed quicker than I had anticipated and was caught up a bit in surprise. Now looking due north, with my head canted back so sharply as to cause me to stop suddenly with the realisation this thing is REALLY close and REALLY big and I should stop now. Art arms length, if you were to hold a yardstick horizontally in your hand it would give you some idea of the scale. My best guess was one hundred feet off the ground and it was dead still. I stood there hollering up to it, &apos;Come on down here and talk to me!&apos; It just sat there and glowed. I saw no one, no details, no sounds. Just two saucers inverted together glowing brighter than a full moon. Out of the corner of my eye I caught the glint of headlights from an approaching car so I ran back across the field and onto the road to flag it down. They stopped, I pointed to the UFO telling them to look there! At that moment it went from roughly four inches across at arms length , to a pin point and vanished in one second. My wife and I reported it to the night officer in charge at the old OPP station on King street near Rockway Gardens in Kitchener that night. He made a written record of our report, also checking with the local airport for possible fly ins or radar evidence. Nothing. Since then I have encountered a born again christian and a business man both men of character beyond reproach, confiding to me  encounters very similar mine. #2) - November 15,1987, 2 am. While returning home from work on a crisp, clear moonless night, I was travelling east on hwy 50 just north of Gatineau, Quebec, Canada. I had passed the airport on my left which was closed for the evening and was alone in my vehicle with no traffic on coming or following. Making my way to Buckingham I passed the several overpasses encountered on this highway and was approaching the last one before my turn off which is about six miles east of the aforementioned airport. As I approached the last overpass I noticed a bright red light just ahead and to my left off the road about 100 feet and 100 feet off the ground. The size, colour and brilliance resembling the kind of warning light you see on top of hydro towers. I thought this was peculiar because the hydro tower that was near by was not located there, so I conjectured to myself it must be a late arrival flying in to Gatineau airport. But it was closed and this is way to far away for a flight to be in a landing pattern so I slowed down expecting the plane to make a hard landing in the field.Eventually I pulled to the side of the road just west of the overpass, stopped and got out of my car.The field extending north from the highway is fairly level and consists of weeds and scrub for about 1500 -2000 feet until it reaches the bottom of a rise in the terrain that goes up suddenly about 100 - 150 feet. So looking north is fairly black with no illumination or dwelling in my line of sight until the horizon which is higher up than where I&apos;m standing. Then the night sky explodes with stars and the milky way from the horizon up. The red light is in a fixed position in the darkness below the horizon and I&apos;m marveling at how an aircraft can remain stationery for so long. I look around for possible wind sources to make this happen but the air is still, And I haven&apos;t yet been able to make out any kind of outline to put a fix on the aircrafts shape. So I walk across the double highway, down the ditch and up to the fence.This gives me a lower but closer perspective, all the while looking at this thing to see if I can make its shape. When I reach the fence I begin to think this might be some new stealth vehicle the military is trying out because I don&apos;t hear a sound and still can&apos;t make out its outline.My eyes becoming more accustomed to the inky darkness I find a hard edge that leads up into the night sky and then to my utter shock begin to see the staggering size of this thing! I stumble back from the realisation that the inky darkness was part of a craft that was triangular in shape blotting out most of the bluff in the background, the horizon and part of the night sky. What I mistook at first to be just a lack of stars in that particular section of the sky was an enormous triangular shape that reached from above and just ahead of me to just below the horizon. The point forward seeming to be to my left bearing the red light under its tip.It was all I could do to see its shape. No one, no details and no sound. You could almost describe it as an absence of light. Having never heard of flying triangles as possible UFOs I didn&apos;t speak of this until 2001 when I read my very first report about them. I was very excited by the facts and descriptions regarding the triangles reported and discovering I wasn&apos;t alone in sighting a triangle. When I drove away from the object that night, I contented myself with the explanation that I had witnessed a military exercise for forty five minutes and always referred to it as such, never suspecting a possible UFO context. It was still there when I got up and left thinking what a mammoth airplane. Truly football field size as they say. #3) -This final event involved my entire family of seven including myself and our elderly neighbor and his wife. It occurred on the night before the first Phoenix, Arizona flurry of multiple UFOs appeared. Those identical lights appeared here around 10 pm looking east over Waupoos Island towards Kingston, Ontario, Canada. They remained in the sky over Lake Ontario for several hours, were brighter than stars, orange/gold in colour, creating geometric patterns and remaining basically stationary. We went next door upon discovering the lights to watch them unobstucted from my neighbours deck. As some would vanish others would appear maintaining roughly 9 to 12 at any one time in the sky.It was an awesome display that none of us will ever forget and I&apos;m still puzzled why no one else in our area reported seeing them. We didn&apos;t hear about the Phoenix lights until several days later when my son saw a report on mainstream news. One difference with our sighting though was the object that simultaneously flashed red and white lights, like a cop cars, to our immediate right looking south half way across the bay seemingly just sitting on the water while the orange light show was happening high in the sky towards the east.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.  We have invited the witness to re-submit two of the report, using separate report forms.  PD))", "Surprised to find flying disk in photographOn the afternoon of June 6th I decided to take some pictures of our beautiful desert willows against a deep blue sky. I saw and heard nothing unusual, but upon checking the images from the camera, I discovered that I had photographed a classic disk with a domed top. Images to follow via e-mail.", "moved really fast across the sky with no sound heard and the lights were white and flashed and they were not like those seen on an airplane. Was the weirdest thing I have ever seen.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))", "Large UFO over Mt. ILIAMNA Alaska.Driving westerly, uphill out of Homer Alaska, passenger spotted an object that was somewhat cloud-like but different in that it had a metallic sheen to it and it was in motion contrary to the other clouds that were nearly motion-less on the northern portion of the sky. Thus, the cloud condition was only partly cloudy and this object appeared to be at approximately 15-to 20,000ft and at least 3 miles distant to the clouds present when first sighted.  The &apos;craft&apos; traveled at a high rate of speed, climbing higher into the western sky that was relatively free from clouds over the &quot;Cook Inlet&quot;.  It was first noted to be about an inch long over head when first sighted; half an inch over the middle of the Inlet and about a quarter of an inch in length (over Mt. Iliamna), when one measures with an arm extended out using finger and thumb to bracket the object.  This experience lasted 3, 5, minutes, no more.  We have noticed many jet-liners, military transports flying in our skies day and night and basically comprehend their size relative to their flying altitudes fairly well since we are both military veterans, U.S.N., and U.S.A.F.  This was MUCH TOO LARGE for anything published in Jane&apos;s--LOL!!!!!

I then noticed a third light out in front of the other 2 lights.When my eyes adjusted, I realized I was seeing a triangle-shaped object. This was not a equal-sided triangle, but long pointed one. The sides of the triangle were about 3 times as long as the base of the triangle. I noticed the object appeared blurred, like it was oscillating or vibrating at a very fast frequency. The flight characteristics appeared jerky or out of focus all along the perimeter. When the object passed between me and some of the stars, the star light was blocked out. This was something I had never seen before.I am a disabled Navy Veteran and I was stationed on the aircraft carrier U.S.S. Coral Sea for almost 6 years and I have seen a lot of different types of aircraft. I live 5 miles south of a Marine helicopter and Harrier training base. There are 2 Proving grounds within 25 miles of my house; Yuma Proving Grounds and the Barry Goldwater Test Range. So, I have seen many types or aircraft, both fixed-wing and rotary types. I have never seen anything like this before.I will not take a guess on the altitude, speed, or distance but I had the impression this object was at a very high altitude.After about a minute of observing this object going south, it just faded from view.", "Had a close encounter with UFO which moved silently and seemed to be following and watching me.I was driving home from work and became aware of a small red flashing light in the sky as I left work.  For some reason I continued to look at the red flashing light in the sky which seemed to move at a similar speed to my car the whole of the trip home,(approx.twenty minutes).  In those days,I kept my car in a rented garege a couple of roads away from the road where my house was situated.  After garaging my car I looked again in to the sky and the red flashing light had gone.  I walked from the garage to my road.  As I turned the corner in to my road I observed the red flashing light stationery in the sky above the house opposite to mine. I would say at this point I was approx. 300 ft away from my house.  As I walked to my house, I continued to look at the red flashing light which seemed quite low, above the house opposite (the neighbour&apos;s roof).  As I almost reached my garden gate, the red flashing light came across the road and stopped above my head, at which point the red flashing light went out and a large green light came on which was circular in shape and approx. 20 ft in diameter. When it was a red flashing light accompanying my car, when it was above the neighbours roof and came across the road, went out there was NO outline of any sort of craft whatsoever.  That was strange because it was a clear summer&apos;s night. I remember there was only one cloud in the sky and it was not dark.  As the red flashing light was over the neighbour&apos;s roof it was perfectly still as if it were a fixture and there was no sound.  As it came across the road it moved in perfect silence and did not shake or quiver, it came across the road in a perfect silent line.  When the green light came on (the circular shape), which looked like looking up at the bottom of a saucer, (saucer shaped).  It was just like looking in to a green traffic light. It appeared to be glass. I could not see through the green light to what was behind it. Whilst all this was happening I remember that my mouth dropped open in shock, amazement and shear awe!  I decided to rush inside my house and fetch my family out to share in this most facinating experience.  As I moved, the green light went out and the red flahing light came back on and it moved off in an upward angled direction and went behind the one visiable cloud. I reported what I had seen to the then called Elmdon airpot, (now called Birmingham International airport.  At the time they informed me that they had a resident UFO expert who was one of the air traffic controllers.  When I reported my sighting, they said they as the crow flies, we were about two miles from the airport.  They said what I described could be done by a helicopter, but they said it was strange that on that particular night they did not have any helicopters out and said there would not have been helicopters from anywhere else. I remember that when I was on holiday and was lying on the beach I saw and heard a helicopter way up in the distance and it was tiny and loud.  What I saw was just over my head. I don&apos;t know how high.  I would say at a guess, 30ft up. Certainly not in the distance. I then rang the airport and they wrote back, unfotunatly I do not still have the letter.  Then letter said because I did not request a radar check they did not do any checks. I rang later that evening of the sighting. What was interesting was that when I was giving my account at work the next day, a lady who worked there and was listening said &quot;Oh my God&quot; &quot;last night I was sitting in my boy friend&apos;s car at the petrol station&quot;.  &quot;As it was a hot night, I wound the window down and put my head out of the car to get some air&quot;.  &quot;As I looked up there was a massive orange ball hanging low in the sky above the car&quot;.  &quot;I immediatly shut the window and sat almost frozen in my seat, terrified&quot;. It has to be said that following my experience, I became facinated for several years in UFOs spending most nights in the garden looking in to the night skys, such was the strength of my experience.  It was only as I came across your web sight that I read that you publish very old sightings and therefore decided to send mine.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD))", "Mumbai ufo sightingWe were on our terrace and it is a monsoon season so whatever we saw was not stars because it was cloudy as monsoon is out here and the we saw was a small circle light dot and was just above our head and went to east side and again went back to opposite direction in high speed so fast that i dont know any modern military craft can go at such high speed.", "Bright red light hovering and taking offBefore i begin i&apos;d just like to say im not a nut job and have just stumbled on this site after doing a google search, basically i just wanted to tell someone about what i saw, wether folks believe me or not i dont care!  I was sat downstairs watching a movie around 1.20am (UK time) and i heard a sound outside so i pulled the curtain across to have a look because our area has had a number of break-ins and to my absolute shock was this bright red light in the middle of the sky over the houses just hovering there in mid air with what looked like a brighter light moving around it in the middle. It stayed in the same spot for around three to four minutes (it could have been in the sky longer, i dont know) then did kind of a small circular motion then took off in the other direction at a speed  I would consider too fast to be a helicopter.  Another thing, while it was turning it seemed to flash an orangy colour for a second. During the time it was hovering i ran upstairs to wake everyone up and come have a look. My mother finally got out of bed and came to have a look too, by the time she got there it was taking off over in the far distance but she did see the &apos;craft&apos; moving and agreed it was too fast for a helicopter. As i am writing this right now i have goosebumps on my arms as you just never believe you would ever see anything like that being as i am in the UK and most of these reports seem to come from America.", "the ufo was trailing the air craftAs I was standing on my balcony smoking late at nite, well after dark I saw and jet in landing pattern.  As it flew from dark sky into sky that was lighter because of the city lights I saw somthing behind the jet, it was cigar shaped.  The sighting lasted only 2 to 3 seconds as it changed color to match the sky it was flying in. I was unable to see it anymore.  When I could see it, it was very close to the jet and bigger then jet air craft((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.

My friends who watched with me,had a few minutes earlier saw six crafts come together and form a cross.Four of these were silver light, two were red.After forming the cross they dispearsed and flew out of sight.

They were visible for about 1 1/2 minutes; quite impressive. My apartment lights flickered briefly. This was not ball lighting, as it appeared that the ships were of fairly large size. On the next large lighting flash in the same area of the sky, the sky was clear.

By the time I saw it (maybe 5 seconds later) it was at about 45 degrees in the sky in relation to my vantage point.  It appeared to be spherical (or at least circular) in shape and black.  I saw no detail at all.  It appeared to be one quarter of the sun&apos;s size.  It was moving at a steady pace WSW and appeared to be ever so slightly descending&hellip;hard to tell, though.

As I looked up at a star, I noticed flaches of light at different points around this particular star.  A few jets flew over head with strobes flashing. The jets were much lower than the flashes of what I saw. It seemed as if the objects were manervering for position. Then flashes of light were seen eminting from eacj craft.  It seemed as though they were shooting at east other. Sometimes one would (fire) the the other one.  At other times both would fire at the same time.This was very much higher than anything of referance. A few commercial jets flew over but at a noticible much lower altitude.I was reminded of the bible, the book of Ephesians, where it says that we wrestle not against flesh and bollod, but against spiritual wickedness in the heavenly places. Again in the Book of Revelation it speakes of Michael asnd His angels fought against the Dragan (Satan) adn his angels, and they prevailed not, but were cast down to the earth.  I saw a streak as lightning finaly zoom across the sky. seeming to become lower as it passed out of sight to the west behing the mountain.

As I was sitting on my back deck waiting, I saw a shooting star out of the corner of my eyes. The sky was extremly clear and I could see more stars than usual. As I watched the sky, I noticed what appeared to be a satelite moving North to South. It did not dawn on me at the time that satelites do not normally move North to South. I watched it move across the sky and was following its path. When it reached 12:00, or directly over head, it stopped. I was floored. I have seen many satelites travel across the sky, so I knew this was not normal. It stayed motion less for about 5 seconds, then it move in the same direction quickly in a &quot;S&quot; pattern and stopped at approximately 11:00 O clock. Again it stayed motion less for approximately 5 seconds, then streak west to east and out of sight in approximately 1 second. I am a private pilot who has flown many nights and have seen many satelites. This event leaves me with no reasonable idea what this was. It was not a weather balloon, laser, plane, cloud, meteor, or satelite. I was awake, not tired, no stress, not intoxicated, or under the influence of any medication. It appeared first like a star, when I realized it was moving I thought it was a satelite. It did not grow in size or get brighter. It stayed constent in appearance and brightness. It defied all logic and Physics. I have read simular stories of this pattern, and have always thought that people eyes were playing tricks, or they wanted to see a UFO so bad that they saw what they wanted.

I thought it was the moon at first behind the clouds but then it moved to the right and then the left never stoping again and then just got smaller as it took off to the left more. I thought it went around the back side of the house cause I lost site of it once it got past the roof of the carport. I stepped out and looked behind the house and saw nothing. I was just gone.

At least 7 of us saw it. it was probably within a mile of us at just a few hundred feet above the ground heading Northeast at a very fast pace, probably several hundred miles per hour, what I remeber most aside from the 5 lights on it was the loud rumbling sound it made.  It was constant but incredibly loud for how far it was from us.

I looked back towards Adam, his arms were raised above his waist level with his palms facing down and he was looking down. I looked down and I saw the trail of light this sphere had left behind as it made a figure eight around us. We are not sure if it made the figure eight around us once or twice. We think it shot across the yard after that and left over the fence towards the park (the same fence it entered the yard over to begin with).

I have seen strange objects which appear to be shooting stars (space junk?) on a few times before over that area.There are a military base, and astronomical observatories in that area.", "we watch alot of shows on this subject and what we have in this picture closely resembles a UFO formationEntering on our cruise ship into port at Cozumel, Mexico around 11:45 am we took a picture of a quarter moon formation - The picture we snapped  showing this formation, we would be happy to share it with you.", "Orange round object appears dims and reappears no soundStorms were rolling in and like normal my husband and I retreated to our front porch to enjoy the lightening show. We kept witnessing bright circular bursts of white light that reminded me of a flash and I kept question it b/c it was like no lightening I had ever witnessed in my life. At about 2 am we began to see a orange shape circle off in the distance and I was drawn to it b/c it looked like a setting sun though small in comparison and it began to dim then went away and within a minute or so it was back as bright as could be in the same location it appeared to stay in the same position the entire time before once again dimming and disappering. We live in the flight path of the Airport so I&apos;ve grown accustome to the sounds and shapes of planes. The object had no sound like the planes that pass over our house with running lights on and landing gear down. About 45 minutes to an hour after the event a plane did fly over our house and I remarked how we heard it and could distinctly see the red and white blinking plane lights.During our encounter of this odd orange blob, I sent my husband running for our camera. I got one capture that when blown up looked like two curved smiles. The whole event lasted about 10 minutes and then within 1/2 hour we heard this odd tone that neither of us could place. My husband, is usualy the logical skeptic, said there is no way it was a flare nor weather balloon because it remained in the same position and the way it dimmed and came back so bright was not typical of either.((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides a photo of two objects against a night sky.  We do not know what the objects are.  PD))", "apparently solid cylinder , no wings . Very bright with bumps on it&apos;s surface. Very graceful movementIwas sitting in my backyard having a coffee and smoke when I happened to look up into the sky. I observed a cylinder shaped object . It appeared to be at the altitude of a commercial airliner, moving somewhat slower than a commercial jet. If it was at the cruising altitude of an airliner it would have been at least one and a half their size. The thing seemed to yaw slightly as it moved from the northwest to the southeast. It was definetly cylinder shaped with no wings or vertical stabilizer. I observed sunlight glinting off it&apos;s surface. I&apos;m a formal aircrewman with extensive training in the observation of aircraft and I know this wasn&apos;t any kind of aircraft ,military,private or commercial that I know of. It was absolutely silent during the observation period and moved with a strange kind of grace and ease that is hard to put into words. I also noticed that there were bumbs or blisters scattered in an uneven pattern over its surface. These &quot;bumps&quot; were not readily apperant, but were noticed as sunlight glinted unevenly across it&apos;s surface. Thanks", "A white cylindrical object apparently without wings flew from SSE to NNW and I took a very good picture of it.On June 23, 2005 at approximately 7:00PM my twelve year old son and I had walked to the lake shore for him to play while I took several pictures with my Fujifilm FinePix 2800 digital camera.  The sky was mostly clear but the wind was approximately 15MPH.  At exactly 8:00PM (according to the time on the pictures I took) I heard what sounded like a jet, and I looked for a few seconds for it (direction of sound was somewhat difficult to ascertain due to the wind and the waves by the lake shore) before I spotted what I assume was the source of the sound.  The object appeared to my naked eye to be white and cylindrical without wings and flew from south-southeast to north-northwest in a straight line at a speed that didn&apos;t seem unusually fast or slow for a jet, and I believe it was lower than most of the jets I see in the area because I could see it fairly well with my eyes and it was clearly visible.  Barksdale AFB and the Shreveport Regional airport are east of my location approximately 60 miles and most jets I see travel from west to east or east to west in this area and I&apos;ve taken a number of pictures of them as well.  The object did not produce a contrail nor exhibit any unusual behavior other than appearing to fly without wings.  I attempted to take three pictures of the object (zoomed at 6X at 2 megapixels), the first of which turned out very good and clear and verified that no wings were visible.  The second picture was focused on the tree tops and the object was blurry and washed out, and by the time I took the third picture I believe the object had disappeared behind the trees.  From the time I first spotted the object to the time it disappeared was approximately fifteen seconds.  My son continued playing and did not see the object, though he heard the sound of a jet engine.", "I was sitting on the front porch, not able to sleep. My dog was with me. Suddenly my dog became very agitated and seemed to want back in the house. At the same time my head and hair began to tingle.  This caused me to look up and to my right.  I was shocked to see a luminous green object, circular in the center, with pointed (wings) off to each side. It was just under the cloud deck about 1000 feet. No sound whatsoever, it was just gliding North to South over the middle of the town.I should note here that Carlisle Pa. is the site of the Army War College.  I only note this because a lot of sitings are known to be near US military bases. This is only a School for the learning of warfare tactics.  There are no airfields, of anykind nearby that could be used by the military for experimental aircraft.

There was no noise, it was totaly silent. as far as i know I was the only one to see it. The lights along the sidewalks went out. It had to be about 30 ft above the building. it sat there for about 2 minutes. I jokingly said &quot;hey my friend is in Lampasas about 68 miles behind you.&quot;. It &quot;backed&quot; up and left. shortly there after the radio started working again and the dj said that &quot;there was military activity at the airport, and the airport was closed until further notice.&quot;.

PD))", "Two Jupiters!!!I just saw this minutes ago. I went out on my porch to have a cigarette. I looked up at Jupiter. I am very familiar with the night sky as I have enjoyed amateur astronomy all my life. I own a nice telescope and have been observing Jupiter and Saturn within the last week. As I looked up to see Jupiter I was very surprised. There were two of them! This really threw me and confused me. The reason I say there were two Jupiters is that both objects looked identical in magnitude, size and even color. Jupiter is a yellowish-white to the eye. I knew one of these objects could not be Jupiter, so I watched carefully for movement. I did not see any movement or seperation whatsoever. Both objects were completely still in the sky. I noticed that the northern-most object had a fainter star-like object very close by. So I was utterly confused. I did not know what this second object was. I stared at both for about 15 seconds (I wasn&apos;t sure which was the real Jupiter). Then I noticed that the one to the north started to dim out as did it&apos;s companion. The sky is clear tonight, no clouds at all, very good visibility. This object was about 5 degrees or a fist held at arms length north of Jupiter. It took about 15 seconds to dim. I could still see this object as a very faint star-like object for about another 15-20 seconds. Then I could see it no more. I watched for several minutes but did not see this object again. I came right in to make this report. I don&apos;t know what this object was but it did not move at all the entire time I observed it. I am very familiar with aircraft and satellites. It did not make any sound whatsoever. There were no clouds. I could still see all surrounding stars the entire time.", "Saucer shaped reflective object moving and hovering with chasing Government Jets and a Helicopter/Photos takenWe were working in the yard this afternoon.  At 2:00 p.m. we heard and spotted a huge Coast Guard helicopter flying from the west into the east, as if it came from the Oregon coast line.  Right in front and above, at approx. 20,000 feet of the helicopter was a bright reflective saucer shaped object moving very, very slowly.  It was backdropped by a clear blue sky without a cloud behind it.  It seemed to be reflecting the sun in a type of pulsating, rythmic display of extremely bright light.  It may have just been pulsating with intense light.  It was moving very slowly and then stopped moving.   At approximately 2:12 the UFO did  a vertical ascent and disappeared.  The helicopter did a sharp turn right/south when the object stopped moving and did a 180 degree reverse path heading straight back west.  The helicopter turned south, running along what seemed to be the west side of the Cascade mountains.  We live on the east side of Springfield as you start up the pass to cross the Cascades.Within two minutes we saw a large white jet coming from the south (maybe Klamath Air Force Base) heading north.  It had radar unit on top of it.  It was headed north into the exact spot from where the UFO hovered and disappeared.  That jet was first noted at 2:35 p.m..  Another radar jet appeared, following the same south to north path that the first jet traveled.  At 3:14 a third jet appeared following the same path from south to north into the same space where the UFO disappeared.  At 3:17 and 3:19 the same type of jets appeared also, following the same path.   Using our digital camera we took several pictures of the UFO.  We now have them downloaded from our camera and burned to CD&apos;s for safe keeping.  Note:  Today is the day that the USA NASA probe will hit a comet at 10:52 p.m. West Coast time.", "((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the person who submitted the report, and we found him to be quite credible.  We await photocopied materials from the witness.  PD))On April 17th , 1966, one of the greatest UFO chases occured With police  in NE Ohio and Western PAAt 0510 hrs on April 17th, 1966 2 Portage County Deputies in one car were dispatched to drive towards the Summit County line to check out a call from Summit County Sheriff&apos;s Dept. about a strange light or craft in the sky, heading east down Route 224 toward Portage County. While enroute they stopped to check on what appeared to be an abandoned car with antennas and full of &quot;radio &amp; electronic equipment&quot;. It had a strange emblem on the door in the shape of a diamond with lightning bolts and other symbols. While checking out the car, a large luminous object arouse from beyond the north bank of the State Route, and hovered above them. Both deputies described it as ice-cream cone shaped, with the &apos;ice cream&apos; being solid and the &apos;cone&apos;, pointing down, seeming to be mostly light. Both instinctivle jumped pack into the patrol car. The object then started moving east down Route 224 toward Atwater Center, and they started following it. They also called their radio operator who told them to keep it in sight. Another deputy, in a single unit car was in Atwater at the intersection of Waterloo Rd &amp; Stroup Rd., and called to say he saw it, it was about 800 feet up and the &quot;cone&quot; of light beneath it appeared to be blue to purple in color. He heard no sound but noticed static on his radio until the object had passed several miles to the east. The 2 persuing deputies in car P-13 followed it east on 224 to the Deerfield circle, then SE on State Route 14. At the dinner on the circle, a night cook &amp; waitress both saw the object and attempted to hide behind a car in the parking lot. As the object proceeded down Route 14 across the corner of Mahoning County and into Columbiana County, 2 Salem patrolmen were sent to the edge of town to see what all the radio calls were about. They describe seeing a bright object, about 1000 feet up going from their left to right (or, as they were looking north, west to east), and it made no noise, but had a trail of bluish colored smoke or light trailing behind &amp; below it. They watched it for a few minutes and listened to the deputies on the radio, but the object veered east following Routr 165 and did not enter Salem city. After it had been out of their sight for 15 to 20 minutes, they both saw &amp; heard jets, 2 or 3, travelling at a high rate of speed from the northwest heading south then turning east as if folloing the object. There was the Youngstown 459th Troop Carrier Wing, Youngstown AFR located in that direction. As P-13 approached the intersection of Route 165 and State Route 14,  a Patrolman from the city of East Palestine saw the object and had been listening to the radio. He pulled out behind P-13 and joined the chase. Both cars now stated that the speed was between 85 &amp; 105 MPH. As they approached the county line, the fell well behind the object a couple of times, and it would seem to slow down to &apos;wait&apos; for them. They crossed into PA where Route 14 becomes Route 51 and continued SE. A officer partoling at Conway PA saw the object coming and went down to Route 65 (51 becomes 65) to see if it was an aircraft having trouble. Being from PA his radio did not pick up the Ohio unit&apos;s chase. As the object shot overhead, he saw the apporaching Ohio cars. The object came to a hover over Harmony Township, and all 4 officers sat at a gas station to discuss what was going on. Then they heard the jets. One came in and flew over the object, while the other 2 started circling around. The Conway officer called his dispatch and asked him to call the Pittsburgh airport to see if they had any activity going on. Then as the first jet turned to make another pass over the object, the objects &apos;cone of light&apos; turned orange and it shot straight up into the air, and dissapeared in a couple of seconds. All 4 of the officers heard a high pitched winning sound, when it changed color, and their hairs all stood up as it shot up. Also all of their cars shut off at the same instant, though they all easily restarted when tried. The Conway radio operator called back and said some military man at the airport wanted to talk with them. They went to a nearby police station (Rochester) and took the call. The Rochester officer stated that the man said they had scrambled jets, but another man, a Colonel, as he identified himself, came on and said that there were no jets scrambled, and that they had probably been chasing the moon. When the Portage deputies returned to Ravenna (where their HQ &amp; jail was) they were told to sit tight. A Maj. Quintanilla, USAF was driving up from Dayton to interview them. In the mean time the Sheriff started his own investigation into the events. In all, of all the officers involved (2 Portage deputies, 2 Salam patrolmen, 1 East Palestine patrolman, and 1 Conway Police officer), 6 of them, were interviewed by a detective from Portage County, then by Maj. Quintanilla, a Maj. Donald E. Keyhoe, USMC (RET), William B. Weitzel (NICAP), Prof. William Powers of Northwestern University and Director of the Dearborn Observatory, and various newspaper reporters. The Detective that investigated this found elevated levels on his CD survey meter, and scourched earth in the field where the deputies claim it rose out of. And there were the photos taken by a local police chief (From Mantua) which were discounted by the &quot;official&quot; investigators, that this experienced detective found compelling. And there are the recorded tapes from the interviews, that never made it into the official government investigation because the Sheriff wanted his to be an independant investigation and not to come to the attention of the military - which it did not. I was a deputy at Portage County Ohio from 1985 - 1989, and came across these files while cleaning up old files for removal to the new facility. I was to dispose of all the case material that was not related to open cases or those involving deaths of violence. But this was just too good to  throw out. Much of the material is on the NICAP web site, just search under Portage County Ohio UFO Chase. However, what I found was the independant investigation the Sheriff had done, and which was never turned over to the investigators - at the request of the Sheriff himself. So I have witness statements made on the Sheriff office&apos;s report forms, the detectives report, and material never before examined by UFOlogists, or skeptics. This was a significant case in 1966, and the chase seen in &quot;close Encounters&quot; were the UFO goes over the lead actor&apos;s pick-up and it stalls, and as the object leaves it is being chased by police cars, was inspired by this very case. The Portage officers followed the object for 86 miles. It was chased by 6 police officers, seen by many civilian witnesses, was chased by Air Force jets, and resulted in 3 of the officers leaving the profession, 2 quit, one was fired and he got a divorice as well - all because of this chase. I am preparing to include this in a book,  with all of the new details, reports, and the evidence which was never before released, along with some other interesting events from Eastern Ohio / Western PA. But in the mean time I am sending copies of the documents and tapes to the UFO center for their examination.((CORRESPONDENCE WITH SOURCE OF REPORT))Dear Mr. Davenport:Thank you for your prompt reply. The information in the material is interesting, and I would be glad to put it into report form. Some of the material I have is indeed in the NICAP database (Just do a search there under Portage County and you get lots of hits), but the vast majority of it came from the Sheriff&apos;s Office report, which again were in the detective&apos;s files, and according to deputies who participated in the investigation the material was never given to Maj. Quintanilla or to Mr. Keyhoe or the NICAP folks - it was just locked away in the detective division&apos;s files. The taped material is from reel-to-reel tapes of the interview of the 2 portage deputies involved (interview by Major Quintanilla of Project Blue Book), a Salem police officer and East Palestine police officer (both by Portage County Detectives), and some material that I cannot make out what it is. There are police reports, the original NICAP report, and some interview transcripts of 4 witnesses - all not in the NICAP data base. I did email NICAP, but was told that it is not an &quot;active site&quot; anymore - just a data repository. I could attach these to some emails, or better yet I could fax them if you have a number. As for the tapes, I have copied most onto cassette format, and can easily mail you a copy for you to keep. These files were not considered an active case, so I believe legally it would be OK to publish this stuff. I will, however, ask my lawyer to be sure I am not breaching any confidentiality rules (it was not a solved case either, so it had not ever been placed in the public domain file at the Sheriff&apos;s Office; and I want to be sure that I am not going to be liable for slander in any way). The telling of the story back in 1966 led to one deputy involved loosing his job, getting divorced, and he lived in poverty for most of the intervening years - so mentioning him again in a public forum MAY be a problem. At worst, you may have to withhold my identity until I get these questions answered. But I will get this stuff together in the next few days and either email or fax the documents, and mail you the tapes.Thanks again for your fast reply.Regards,  ((name deleted))((END CORRESPONDENCE))", "Object heading direct west moving about 3 times the speed of a plane, with one light flashing, jumping from position to position.I have never seen a UFO or anything resembling one before.  I was outside at about 10:15 pm CST and looked up to see a flashing light.  At first I thought it was a low-level airplane, but as I watched it (it was only one craft) it&apos;s behavior was extremely unusual.  The object flashed a white light approximately 6 or 7 times during the entire 10 or so seconds before flying off into the horizon.  It was moving very fast, about 3 times the speed of a normal aircraft.  It was heading nearly direct west at first, flashing twice, appearing to jump between each flash.  Then, it &apos;jumped&apos; to a 90 degree angle south from the original flight path, blinking once again.  With each blink, it seemed to travel about the same distance.  It again, jumped and flashed direct west, then took another 90 degree angle jump to the north, where it flashed again, seemingly to resume it&apos;s original course.  I said &quot;do you see that?&quot; to my husband and the thing flashed again, still on the path headed direct west, then very quickly flashed a couple more times and took off toward the horizon until it was out of sight.", "Early mourning sightingI woke up for no reason, to look out my bedroom window and see a very bright round circular UFO traveling north to south. I live in the Sanbernardino mountains and the skys are very clear with very little light polution. Outside my bedroom I can see millions of stars at night. There is a large cedar tree about 25 feet from my window that blocks some of my view. As I woke up to see this object, it was very peculiar because of it&apos;s size. I see jet plane, helicopters, etc. all the time up here and can tell the difference between them very easily. I have also had many encounters with UFO&apos;s in my past and I know what to look for and what many of the types look like. As this bright white object traveled, it went about a slow as a satelight moves. I see many of them also but this light was much bigger and was a lot lower in the horizon then satelights. This object faded out a few times then got brighter. Just as it went behind the big cedar tree, I lost sight of it for a while but because I knew this was no ordinary object, I got out of bed to go out on the deck to see it emerge from the other side of the tree. I was tempted to wake up my wife but I didn&apos;t want to lose sight of it, so I stayed there watching it. Now as it emerged from behind the tree, it did something very common of UFO&apos;s. It stayed bright and I could make out it&apos;s shape as a circle with no haze or glow around it. It was completely circular and contained it&apos;s brightness within it self. It was much brighter then the stars and the brightness was steady and not twinklely like stars. Then, it began to dim and them brighten up again then dim. Now its was fading, not moving fast, just fading until it completely disapeared within a second right before my eyes. I watched to see if it would appear again down further, but it didn&apos;t. It just went out of sight. But before it completely dissapeared, it faded into catregories of brightness. The more it faded the more I could see it was completely round until it dissapeared completely, almost as if it went from very bright to a transparency with just the outline of the circle about it. It was strange but very exciting at the same time. Also this UFO made no sound what so ever. I am an avid UFO watcher and always look up to ketch a glimps of one of these wonders. For some reason, I was woke up at the right time to witness one of these UFO&apos;s. This will be the 4th UFO that I  have seen since I&apos;ve lived up here in the last 11 years. MY son has seen 2 of them also. We often go outside at night to look for them. This is one of my favorite past times. I have also written a full report of a very close encounter of the fourth kind that happened to me in 1963. There were many witnesses to this particular UFO that made the headlines in the local papers. I was 14 at the time and a UFO actually gave me a ride in it&apos;s craft. I talked to it&apos;s occupants and can veryfy every bit of it! If you would like to read this account look up 1963, New Kensington, Pa. I am 54 now and own a catering business called ((name deleted)) in Southern California.

It at first appeared to be a helicopter because it hovered and moved very slowy in a south western direction.  When I looked at it with my eyes alone, I could not decipher exactly what the image was. I thought it was a plane but the lights seemed too bright.  I also thought that it might be a star or the moon as you might view them as the sun is rising in the morning, however, the object appeared to be moving.  I returned to my home from my morning walk,.  I retrieved my binoculars from my car and then viewed the object.  I thought I would see something normal that would explain what seemed abnormal.  What I saw was a somewhat round object silver in color outlined with what looked like a flourescent light tube that rapped arround the entire object.  At the base of the object there were three beams of the same flourescent light that encircled the object.  The shape of the beams were similar to the fire seen when a rocket is taking off or boosting power.  They were located at the base of the object.  One on both ends and one in the middle that appeared to be shorter that the other two.  I did awaken my roommate and asked him to come outside and view what I had seen.  He asked me what he was suppose to see.  I told him to just look and tell me what he thought it was.  He said that it must be a UFO and just went back to bed.  He did see the same image that I viewed.  I checked the morning paper to see if I could find an explanation for what I saw.  This evening I telephoned three local TV news stations and asked if anyone had reported seeing any strange obects that morning on the the west side of El Paso.  They all answered no.  The object that I saw was not a balloon, a plane, a helicopter nor was it like anything I have ever seen in my lifetime.  I am not one to make up stories.  I saw what I saw and so did my roommate.  I am sure there is a logical explanation for what I saw and that is why I must know what it was that I did see.  Any help that you can offer would be greatly appreciated.  I just need to know what it was?  Thanks.", "My mother and I witnessed a strange &quot;blackout&quot; at 1:30 pm on a clear sunny day.My mother and I were riding in her car, about 1:30pm, clear day, and all of the sudden the sky went dark, just for a second.  It was enough to get our attention, we looked at each other in disbelief. I opened her sunroof right away and there was nothing in the sky, no noise of a plane.  We thought it was really strange and I have talked to a couple of other people who say.&quot;now that you mention it, I noticed the same thing&quot;. It was something that I wouldn&apos;t have paid much attention to if I had been ny myself.  The fact that we both witnessed this &quot;total eclipse&quot; just made me want to find out more information or if others had the same experience.

It appeared to be motionless not ascending or descending.  It looked to be about 1 mile away and at an altitude of 5-10,000 feet.  The sky was clear and visibility greater then 7 miles.  My wife and my 6 year old daughter also witnessed the object.  We were watching this for about 10 minutes and then it slowly began to rise higher on the horizon and move to the right behind a tree that is in our back yard.  I could see the object through he tree branches and leaves.  I immediately got out of my pool while my daughter handed me my binoculars and headed to the front of the house.  It didn&apos;t take more then 30 seconds to get to the front of the house.  To my surprise I looked up to the East well clear of the tree and couldn&apos;t find the object.  I yelled over to my wife who was still in the pool and asked her if she could see the object.  She said she could not.  I looked all over the sky but could not see the object.  Since it was moving at such a slow speed I should of been able to see it once I move to the front of the house and away from the tree.", "4 white lights at high altitude11 pm central we were near Underwood lighting firewoks. As soon as our last artillery shell went off 3 of us saw a single bright white light shoot across the sky just above where the firework went off. One hour later while driving past Washburn we saw a single bright light wobbeling across the sky heading east, several thousand feet up. At 1 am two more bright lights were seen near Bismarck, one traveling faster than the other, racing towards the north northwest. I made two attempts to photograph the wobbling light but it was too dim for the camera to pick up.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

This is common because at my dad&apos;s house we live under the military&apos;s flight path between bases and it is used every day.these aircraft normally approach our house from the West, turn above our home and depart to North. The chopper was doing just that. Except it was going much faster than normal. Not to far behind it was a plane. I couldn&apos;t tell what kind as it was dark outside. The plane was obviously going to pass the helicopter eventually but it was to far behind it for me to see it when it would pass it becoase it would already be out of sight by then. What was behind it was what is strange. A triangle shaped craft. It was perfectly silent and was speeding toward the plane. But it was still to far behind the plane for me to still hear the plane&apos;s engine(s). The craft had three sides all the same length. It had white strobe lights on each of the corners and one red strobe light in the center on the bottom.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.

I had just done a radio check with range control to let them know everything was ok (that is why I remeber the time so well)anyway I pulled my poncho up over my whole body because of the bugs attacking me, and the next thing I know my poncho is pulled off of me and I see what would be called a typical &quot;Grey&quot; looking alien, except that his skin was more of an almond color (it was a very bright night with a full moon)standing over me with what looked like four others behind him.  What shocked me even more was that it talked to to me, but it sounded like one of those adult characters on the &quot;peanuts&quot; cartoons - like &quot;wha wha wha -wha wha etc.&quot; I remeber just becoming unglued and jumped up and started screaming when it talked to me and then it just disappeared along with the others- The other guy out there guarding ammo with me, woke up when he heard me scream and asked what was wrong - I told him what had just happened and he looked at me like I was crazy, I then noticed that it was 10:30pm, and I was like what the heck, I know that I did not fall asleep because it was my turn on radio watch, so I know that I did not dream this but cannot account for the missing time. I did not want to radio in what just happened for fear of getting a psych eval, even though an intruder near an ammunition dump is serious and should have been called in and the other Marine with me said that he was asleep the whole time and did not see or hear anything until i started screaming and jumping around.  Anyway I kept quiet about this incident for a few days but it was bothering me so much that finally about a week later I told a couple of my friends about it, and a good friend of mine that had been out there a day before, said that almost the same thing happened to him, except that he had chased into the ammo tent and when he was just about to shoot it, it just disappeared - he said that he was also afraid to say anything because he thought that people would think that he was crazy.  I never saw any bright lights or alien space craft - just the aliens.", "object banked and disappeared quicklybaseball sized light/reflection in the nothern sky, banked slightly to the west and became the size of a pin head in less than a second and was gone.", "Objects in the sky over Rochester, NYAt 10:46 pm I went outside my house located in East Rochester, NY to have a smoke. While I was looking at some of the brighter stars in the sky I noticed what I thought was a jet of sorts cruising at a very slow rate of speed. As I watched it, it split into three parts which had a sort of redish glow to all of the parts. Standing outside of my house these objects would have been East towards Metro Rochester. They looked circular in shape or even ovalish. I could not see the color of them but within about 15 seconds the three objects stopped in mid air. One went East, one went West and the third shot up into the sky and as soon as I looked to see the other two they were all gone. I did not hear any noise at all. I don&apos;t think i could guess the speed of the objects but it was super quick."]
