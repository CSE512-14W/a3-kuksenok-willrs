["While driving north on I-5 at approximately NE 65th and looking to the northwest towards Greenlake, I saw an electric blue fireball that appeared to drip in a vertical descent and disappear at 25 to 30 degrees over horizonal.", "Went out to see the ring around the moon,when I saw strange light in the sky. As it got closer noticed it was a triangular craft with a &apos;red&apos; nose in the point.Went out in the front yard to see the ring around the moon.  I also looked around to see what stars were out, it was then that I saw a strange light in the sky. As it got closer noticed it was a triangular craft.  It was then that I called my husband out to look and said: &apos;see you finally got to see one&apos;. We were in the front yard.  It was then that I held my left arm straight out and the ship was at the finger tips. None of the neighbors were out, no dogs barking etc. Hairs on arms stood up--like static electricity. Husband went in and I watched it for a while longer. It was a cool clear night.  I didn&apos;t think of moving, just stood there watching it.  I drew picture of the ship at 0838 the next morning, and asked husband if he saw this and showed him the picture.  He answered: No (had no memory of said sighting).  This was not a dream. Saw 1 triangular craft, black, with red crystalline ball at tip.

At the time of the sighting, I was a California Highway Patrol Officer for 6 years and very good at detail and observation.  A friens and I were driving fron San Jose, CA. to Mazatlan, Mexico over Christmas holidays in Dec. 1988.  It was approximately 3:55 a.m. when my friend kept insisting that I look out the driver&apos;s window (he was driving, I was in the passenger&apos;s seat).  I was busy talking and kept ignoring his request.  Finally, just to shut him up, I looked out his window.  What I saw made me scream in excitement, not fear.  I told him to immediately pull off the road so I could have a better look.  I sat on the hood of the car for the next 2 hours writing down my observations.  We thought, at first, that what we were looking at was a freak act of nature where a star was unusually close to the earth.  It looked like a partical star at first except that it was 3/4 the size of the full moon that was out that night.  Also, when we were driving, my friend told me that this object he was looking at did not seem to be left in the distance as we were driving, but rather keeping parallel to us.  It was hugh!  If the stars in the sky could be compared to a golf ball, this ufo was the size of a  over-sized basketball!  At first, it was just this white light being eminated from it&apos;s center.  There was no solidness to it, just lights being refracted.  The &quot;star&quot;  slowly floated in several directions ( I wrote it all down as to it&apos;s positions) with no rhymm or reason.  Then it changed colors and a red light appeared in the center of this &quot;star&quot; horizontally and vertically (like a cross), in it&apos;s center.  It still continued to &quot;float&quot; from left to right and up and down.  The object continued to change color as the points of the light continued to grow and shrink with a blue color. (It looked like a starburst that was growing and shinking.  At this time, I still thought that it was some unusual astronomical  disturbances until this &quot;star&quot; suddenly &quot;ZOOMED&quot; in closer to us! .At this time, I became fearful and jumped into the car.  this &quot;star&quot; &quot;ZOMED back and forth without any visible  signs of movement!  My best analogy would be this,  it looked like the opening and closing of a camera lens, (like the aperature of a camera opening and closing.  It was as if this &quot;star&quot; &quot;Zoomed&quot; in on us to take a better look!  Ithe &quot;star&quot; continued to change colors from white with red, to white with red, to white with red and blue.  It contiued to slowly float in various directions and changing shapes.  As the sun was rising,  the other stars in the sky disappeared except for this one.  It was the only object in the sky as the sun rose.  The lights disappeared as the sun was rising and I expected the object to disappear.  Instead, a thin, long silver/gray line in the sky remained.  There was no longer lights, but rather a very bright or very big object remained.  As the sun was high in the sky, this &quot;star&quot; slowly drifted higher and higher into the sky until just a pinpoint was visible.  It slowly disappeared. As we arrived in Mazatlan, I quickly bought the newspapers to read of the incident.  No article was written re: a U.F.O that night.  THIS WAS NOT A WEATHER BALLOON OR ANY OTHER MILITARY OR GOVERNMENTAL EXPERIMENT.NOTHING ON THIS EARTH COULD POSSIBLY MOVE AND &quot;ZOOM&quot; AS THIS &quot;STAR DID!", "Dimmed orange lights in formation of a half circle--six lights in semi-circle with one light in center of semi-circleThe &quot;craft&quot; moved much too fast for known aircraft. It shimmered as it moved from north to south towards Sarasota. There was no sound. The stars appeared to be beyond the shape. I lost sight of it as trees obscurred the horizon. I happened to be gazing up at the night sky when it passed by.  This is my first sighting of any unknown craft.", "Driving home from work on a clear night, I saw in the middle of the sky four bright lights grouped together in the shape of a square.  They didn&apos;t appear to be moving.I think it was the last tuesday of the month of July.  I had just gotten done with work, and it was about 9:13 pm.  I wasn&apos;t looking for anything, I was just driving home, like I did every other night.  (currently I am enrolled in college)  I live on a big hill, with a nice view, so when I got half of the way up there I saw some lights in the sky.  It was freaky, all I could do is stare.  Then I got to a patch of trees where I couldn&apos;t see anything anymore.  The sight scared me so much that as soon as I got home, I told my dad about it and I took my younger brother down to the exact spot to see it again.  When we got down there, it was nowhere to be seen.  I waited a bit, but nothing happened so we drove back home.  As I recall, there were four bright objects, floating directly in the center of the sky.  There is no way they could have been attached to anything on the ground.  Since then I put it in the back of my mind, saying that it was just my imagination, that I wanted to see a ufo so much, that I wanted to believe so much, that I created the image in my head.  I discredited the fact that it could have been a reflection in my mirror or window because there were no other lights around, and no one had been following me that night.  So I forgot about the whole incident, until today.  I just read the November 1998 issue of UFO magazine, and on page 9 it shows a picture exactly of what I saw that night.  I am now, totally convinced that what I saw that night can be classified as a UFO.  The sighting that was pictured in the magazine was taken in Texas, in 1996 and I had never seen the magazine before in my life.  I don&apos;t think that I could have made something like that up on my own.", "Two eliptical luminous pink objects travelling North East at approximately Mark-2 in parallel formation.

It might have been several craft in a straight line, but I&apos;m not sure.  It didn&apos;t have any beacon lights. The color of the lights was white or yellow, but I don&apos;t remember exactly.  At the time, I was 9.  Don&apos;t think that I was young and made a mistake, I was sure of what I saw, because my friend saw it too.  He was 10.  We both were at an astronomy night at my school, and we were the only ones that saw it, as far as we know.  It was visible to the naked eye.  It was either very large, or very close.  Since it was at night, it was hard to tell how large or far it was.  It was just hovering, and we were watching it from the north, so it was south of us. we were on an asphault campus maybe 80-100 yards north to south.  We spotted the UFO over a tree that was about 100 yards away, and maybe 50 feet high.  From our view, the thing was as long as the tree is wide (including the branches).  About 10 seconds of watching it, it started moving west, but made a zigzag, and moved east, somewhat downward, until it disappeared behind some trees and buildings.  I seemed a little slow, but if it was as large as a Boeing 747, it was moving a little faster than a 747 5 miles from the runway.  I have another sighting, but it isn&apos;t mine, so I just want to say, my dad and brother saw the same thing almost exactly 3 years later, only it moved a little faster. It was near the same spot too, only a block away.", "5 bright orange lights in a line going up the western horizon, slowly moving up the sky, quite spaced apart.  2 of them seem to have exploded at one point and shower of bright white sparks were seen.  other lights moved back and forth while moving up and then slowly faded out.I was heading northbound in my car when I looked to the west to see 5 bright orange lights in a line up the sky.  They were about the size of a half dollar at an arm&apos;s length.  Intensity was a little more than a street light.  I was heading to my girlfriends house and I had to turn eastbound.  So I repedidly stuck my head out my window to look back at the lights which appeared to slowly be moving up the sky.  After doing this for about 5 mins I looked back again and the lights were gone.  I arrived at my girlfriend&apos;s house to find her with her neighbors on the back porch who had been watching the same thing.  They claimed that the lights were swaying as they moved up the sky and 2 of them looked like they exploded and there were bright white sparks when this happened.  The rest of the lights then slowly faded out.  There were 6 witnesses in all, me, my girlfriend, her sister, and three neighbors.  There did also seem to be a large number of aircraft in the sky that night and I couldnt tell but some of them may had been heading towards the lights.", "At 11:24 PST., travelling southbound I-5, I saw a bright blue flash/streak heading from the southeast, from my point of view, to the southwest at an angle of 55 to 65 degrees.

They were traveling similiar to what a jet would appear as. They all were heading southerly from the north. Couldn&apos;t hear anything, they were in the hundreds. I was very shocked by this. I was told that it could be mapping satelites or reflections of some kind from distant cities or cars off the atmosphere or ionosphere. I am no astronomer so bare with me. I watched in amazement, tried counting the groups and guessing at a # of them like you would jelly beans in a jar. The distance I could see them in was roughly 3 miles to the lef&Yacute;&nbsp;and right, from the top of the small mountain I was on.Looked like points of light.

Saw Ufo above trees on our right about 3,000 yards away.After passing Ogden exit at 1:00am or so my husband saw a disc shaped object hovering above trees in the sky about 3,000 yrds. away from Highway 82. He commented &quot;There are no blinking lights from this object which is unusual for a flying object at night.&quot; I stopped our van off the side of the highway. We saw a disc with lights all around it glowing from inside. We saw the shape of it very well; maybe from city lights or moonlight. The left and right side of the disc shape was not a pointed shape as in most photos. The shape of the disc had sharp corners more like rectangles, yet it looked like a disc. It hovered above trees for a few minutes and moved toward the right behind trees. So then I moved the van a few feet and saw it hovering again. The disc was close to the trees, did this once more, and we followed again to be able to see it. And then it went behind trees one last time and it disapeared from our vision. It did not spin or glow, it just hovered in one place for a few minutes at a time and slowly went behind trees toward our right. I had never seen a Ufo before. My husband saw one in 1978 while on duty at Fort Dix, New Jersey, 04:30am with 250-300 hundred other soldiers. As for this recent sighting this July 98&apos;, the oddest aspect to him was that there were no blinking lights, no apparent motion at times, and that the shape was large and seemed cigar shaped to him. We drew pictures of what we both saw. And what we saw was very similar. The best and frankly the only way to describe it was to draw a picture of it.

I stopped playing for a while and rested on the lawn.  As I was laying on my back, I noticed a bright circular/oval shape hovering back and forth over the area.  It was about the size of a nickle hald at arms length; about as high as a helicopter might fly.  As I called my friends over to watch, another craft appeared.  They (the craft) flew overhead and circled one another for about two or three minutes, then stopped momentarily, and shot skyward at a very high speed.  The objects were, as I said, circular and had a bright, but not illuminating, light cast from them.They did not move too quickly before dissapearing.

I looked in that direction (E-NE) and heard a second noise exactly the same and saw an ignited type flash - bright green - streak down from the sky coinciding exactly with the noise.I was standing in my arcadia doorway smoking a cigarette when  we heard an extremely loud noise, my husband describes it as a rocket engine noise, that seemed extremely close.  I stepped out of the doorway to look in that direction and heard a second noise exactly the  same.  At that time I was looking at the horizon (tree top level) and saw a bright green flash ( I did not see the &quot;ignition&quot; it was a flash that had occurred and retained the shape of the flash).  It was like a jagged edged star with many irregular points, like a cartoon explosion.  It was bright green, rimmed with white, and retained that complete shape as it streaked down from the sky.  The streaking downward coincided directly with the loud noise (the noise followed the downward path) until it was below my point of vision.  It did not burn out on it&apos;s way down but retained the shape the entire time.  I did not hear a crash or any ending, the noise just quit. From my location at Scottsdale Rd. and McDowell Rd. it would have been approximately over 4 Peaks or maybe a little south of there.  There were very few stars in that direction, and it occured between two stars that are about 2 fingers apart vertically at arms length, and about 6-7 inches above the horizon at arms length.  It started just below the top star and a little to the north, and streamed down at about a 60 degree angle in a northwesterly direction.  The entire episode lasted about 10 seconds.

It swerved in the sky,going up(not too high) and dipping almost to the ground over the empty fields then it flew over the interstate low to the traffic. Turning around and doing the same thing on the other side of the interstate, again crossing over low to the traffic. It did this 4 times then we drove past it. After about 5 minutes we saw the craft again in the field to the left of us, again swerving up and down toward the ground then it crossed in front of us, turned in the field and headed towards the car flying just over the length of the van.

I watched it travel south, for about a 5 seconds then turn east just for a couple of seconds.  It then turned back south and continued in a straight line.  I jumped off my porch to get to the side of the house where I could  still observe the object and watch until I lost it in the tree line from neighbor&apos;s trees.  When I first noticed the object (straight up) it looked like a cloud that you could see through.  After I observed it turn east then south, I specifically watched for it to pass between me and a star.  When it did,  the star light did not blink off, but dimmed instead.

I was in Oxford, MS on business, and stopped at a friends apartment befor going out for the night.  On the drive over, my other friends and I had japed that it was a perfect night to see a U.F.O. because of the beautiful clear sky.  I stepped out back (9:45)to light a cigarette, and happened to glance at the tree covered sky line, to see what I thought was a kite flying in the distance.  It appeared to be a black plastic triangular kite, barely reflecting the light.  As the object got closer (about the size of my hand held at arms leangth), I thought maybe someone had lost a kite and it was flying free. The only thing that seemed stange was the fact that the object was flying in a straight line. At this point I realized I could make out the shape of the object because of it&apos;s reflective or illuminated front sides.  As the thing approched almost directly overhead the it was still almost invisible, other than the nine or eleven very dim lights outlining the front.  at this time it had gone from legal pad sized to a full arms lenght across.  I new I didn&apos;t have a camera, so I called into the apartment to get some attention.  Three friend came outside to see the object pass overhead and disapear into the night on the opposit horizon.  Although the triangle seemed to light up in the front, we could not tell if it was reflecting light or self illuminated.  the triangle was so faint that if you were not looking directly at it, you couldn&apos;t see it.

It was a cloudless night with no moon at the time.  We arrived at the top of the mountain about 9:45pm.  We had an unobstructed 360 degree view of the horizon.  We ate sandwiches as a late dinner, and gazed at the stars, locating several constellations, the Milky Way, etc. in the clear mountain air. After eating, we lay on our backs and looked at the sky with our 8x35 binoculars.  Almost directly overhead, near the constellation Cygnus, we saw two objects that we were uncertain about.  Both were slightly larger than stars, one bluish and one orange-tinted.  Neither were familiar to us, though we had been amateur astronomers throughout our youth.  They were no brighter than Vega, an Magnitude Order 1star.  We commented to one another about these two objects of which we were unfamiliar. I looked at the orange-tinted one through the binoculars to see if it might be a planet, but could not identify it as such.  As I was watching it, the binoculars stable against my eye sockets and my head resting directly on a rock, I observed the object begin to move in a zig-zag pattern toward the southeast, with abrupt near-ninety-degree turns at each zig or zag.  The zig-zags were not large, but were about the distance of the width of my index finger held at arm&apos;s length, relative to the stars.  After zig-zagging about the distance of the width of my hand held at arm&apos;s length, the object accelerated in a straight line for another realtive two inches, then faded from view.  The object did not change in intensity of brightness or color during its movement. The duration of movement was about four seconds. This amazed me, and I exclaimed how cool it was and asked my sister if she saw it.  She answered with an anxious yes.  We discussed what it might have been, and she asked for the binoculars.  I gave them to her, and we commented on the strange bluish object.  As she was watching the bluish object with the binoculars, and I with my naked eye, it proceeeded to move in the same manner as the orange-tinted object, and faded from view. There were no sounds emanating from either object.  We ruled out helicopters due to the no-sound factor, and that we were already at almost 6000 feet.  We ruled out airplanes, due to the impossibility of performing the stationary moevement, then the zig-zag.  Same for balloons.  While they might have been satelites, this does not explain the erratic and substantial zig-zag movement, nor the change from being a stationary object to being a moving one.  They were not comets, as these obviously do not have an apparent movement over that small a time-interval.  They did not behave like meteors, in that they were clearly visible in a stationary fashion for at least five minutes before they moved.  We were left with no aceptable explanation in identifying these. My sister was a rising junior at a state university, and I was a rising freshman at UNC.  Neither of us took drugs or alcohol.", "small fast ball of orange light moving east to west above the treetops.I am a radar Air Traffic Controller with the FAA. I was on my way home and my brother was with me. I had just turned off Highway 18 near S.I.R. in Kent, WA. When I rounded the turn on the exit ramp I saw a very bright, round ball of orange light. It was small from my view and at treetop level.  I have no way of judging the distance because it was just hazy enough to block out any terrain refferences or landmarks.  The object appeared at about 15 degrees above the horizon, at treetop level (from my perspective).  The object was south of my position. It moved at a high rate of speed from East to West. I observed it for about 6 seconds then it was gone. When I made the turn off the highway I was headed West, the light was moving past me, not in the opposite direction as when you pass a light on a pole. About a minute after this I turned on The Art Bell Show and Peter Davenport was playing a clip from a woman who described almost exactly what I just saw.

It was about two thousand feet altitiude and glowing a golden color. It  flashed about every half second a red  pulse of some sort. I rationalize it&apos;s heating the atmosphere. The object was seemed to hover in that location  but had a wobbling effect similiar to the coriolis effect . In my binos  , I tried to determine the range. My associate used his compass to  get it&apos;s direction. It was 78 degrees north east.  With daylight it faded to a point.

It was white with little blinking lights around the underside. (red,white flashes) It looked huge! It was hovering slowly back and forth not moving like any plane or helicopter would be. And the size!  I have never seen anything that large in the sky before.  We drove toward it for awhile and then we turned off the road.  We thought it too weird to be a real UFO. But I think we are in denial.  I truly believe we saw a UFO now that I know (from this site) that others have seen similar things.

That night I couldn&apos;t make it so I took to looking at the night skies from my house which is in vega alta two towns away from the laungh site. that&apos;s when I began to see some activity in the sky, soon after the first NASA laungh an object started moving about in the sky.  I saw it from a distance for a very long time, but for a minute or two it came extremely close. seconds after it took of never to be seen that night but as NASA&apos;S project continiud more sightings apeared. I believe that what NASA was doing was distracting the public so that some other government agency would have the chance to perform their testing of a program in fact something was happening on the opposit side of the Island in lajas this is a town on the southwest side. After watching NASA have a rocket failier on almost every one of this, I began wondering NASA CAN&apos;T be so disorganize. That&apos;s when I personally saw a lot of activity on the sorounding area of the laguna cartagena, many different government and military vehicles sighted there all thru the same time NASA was launghing rockets. Look I spent some time in the military with top secret clearence and I know something enough to understand that something is going on. Soon after roswell was hit by the media that&apos;s when plenty of night activity in the skies began hapening more government personel were being seen and on US military bases housing construction for more military personel is taking place at this very moment. Since I&apos;m retired I often have time to look around and their are more unidentified agency working on sites that are of limits to civilians the same ones that used to be tourist sites, like the small Island near PR called vieques this is next to the bigest naval base of the USA. Somehow the government has take! n almost the entire Island {vieques}they say is for target practice. This is one of the most beautiful places in the word.

PLEASE TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.", "while traveling south on I 24 @ 10 miles north of murfreesboro I saw three round silvery bright objects in an equilateral triangle. They did not move but remained motionless. Very bright but looked like large polished silver balls. The most forward of the balls suddenly inflated in size and then they all vanished.I could not tell the size of the object. They seemed to be within a mile or so. To me they looked @ 3 inches big from the distance I viewed them. I would guess they were ten feet in diameter or larger. The day was partly cloudy. The interstate runs downhill at the point where I noticed them. They remained for @ 5 minutes before the sphere closest to me became larger and then they all disappeared. I was wondering if any one else had seen it out of the many people on the interstate going home. The objects were a good 50-70 ft off the ground. I could not tell if they were lighted or if the sun was reflecting. That is really the only thing from the list below that I saw.", "Saw 2 cylindrical and 4 oval objects slowly descend from clouds over the Wenatchee area. About 15 jets over area, but only 2 or 3 at a time.First spotted a thin (flat) horizontal cloud that began to tilt and descend. Then a larger thicker (taller) horizontal cloud also tilted to the left but the leading portion no longer looked like a cloud but cylindrical and dark (not sunlit by the rising sun). Two small clouds came out of a separate larger cloud. Binoculars showed them to be oval in shape with distinct edges - NOT clouds. The second cylindrical one now down past mountains. Another oval one came out of the same cloud the earlier ones had. All objects SLOWLY descending past Cascades. Jets flew in from the South, about 1 or 2 at a time. Jets in the area past 9:30. All objects were lit by the sun as clouds are.", "Observed a disk-shaped object completing unbelievable maneuvers to the SE above the city of Bend, Oregon. Object hovered, did split second U-turns, appeared to be &apos;playing,&apos; or &apos;dancing.&apos; There was no sound emitted. The only light from the craft seemed to be reflected from the moon. Object when first sighted was moving towards the west.On the night of November 12, in Bend, Oregon, I was outside of my home observing the moon and the planets currently visible. My roommate had asked that if they were at all visible to let him know (it has been overcast alot here lately). It was clear. I went in and we both came out. I was pointing out a neighborhood light that was in violation of an Oregon code because it was not subdued (any amateur astronomer can relate,) when he pointed to an object in the sky and asked me what it was. I first saw the object heading due west and was about to say it must be an airliner when I saw it do an unbelievable U-turn. Astonished, we both watched this &apos;craft&apos; do maneuvers that would be impossible for any known aircraft to perform. I am a veteran, and used to work while A-10&apos;s and a variety of other aircraft flew overhead. What we saw seemed to be so unhindered by gravity that I can only describe it&apos;s behavior as playful, like it was &apos;dancing&apos; in the air. It performed multiple U-turns, and would accelerate to incredible speeds and then come to a complete halt in what seemed milliseconds. It made absolutely no sound at all. I would estimate it&apos;s distance from us to be anywhere from one to three miles away, and it&apos;s size as possibly quite large. I did see a very distinct &apos;disk&apos; shape. The thing eventually seemed to vanish, and we remained outside for about another hour watching for it before we gave up and went inside. I am an Archaeology student, my roommate is a Geologist. We are both well grounded in science and the tradition that believes empirical data adds to the human understanding of ourselves and our surroundings. If this comes off sounding like a disclaimer let me just add that our &apos;data&apos; goes against everything we have been tought to believe. I did not want, nor wish, to see such a thing. Nevertheless, I, we, saw the damned thing. For myself it calls too much into question. But there it is.", "Two white lights beneath clouds-one fell at a 90 degree angle straight down, blinking continouslyand then stopped over the San Joaquin River. Lost sight of objects as I was driving.I was driving north of Fresno on Friant Rd., heading for my home in Auberry, when I noticed two white lights that I took to be aircraft landing lights. Suddenly, one object fell at a 90 degree angle straight down, blinking continously. The other object remained hovering as the second fell. The falling object then came to a stop over the San Joaquin River(Fresno-Madera County Line) and kept blinking. Objects were lost to sight as I was driving. Weather-Cloudy and light-moderate rain.

This particular morning, I left my house and Pulled to an intersection, where I looked towards the East, and saw the beautiful clouds. I got my camera all ready, rolled down my window, right before I snapped the shot, before holding the camera up to my face, I saw what looked to be a shooting star upwards to my right.. I looked up, and it slowly dissappeared.. I went ahead and took the photo, thinking, &quot;At least I got the clouds and the sky. I wish I Could&apos;ve got the star!&quot; Well, never really studied the picture once it was developed.. Until last week, I was looking at some pictures of furniture, and my eyes were attracted to it immediately! I looked and looked, I could not tell WHAT had shown up on my picture, but it looked as if the shooting star that I saw, had dissappeared to my eye, but the instant I shot the picture, it reappeared.. It must have been traveling at a high rate of speed, and also I had noticed, shooting stars usually do not stop, or turn back around, as shown in the picture.. I have tried to contact some local college professors, or really someone that wants this picture.. I do not know the first thing about UFO&apos;s, I&apos;m just amazed that it finally happened to me!

The oject began to move east ward at first slow and then picked up speed.  It was out of sight in about 5-6 SecondsThe object glowed when it picked up speed because I noticed when it went past the clouds about 10 miles ahead of us I saw the light flicker through the clouds giving away its position.  I would say the object was well over 70-80 Thousand feet due to the amount of flutter of light that was seen.  It wasn&apos;t easy getting the exact shape due to this affect but me and my wife keep trying to catch the exact objects shape.

West-North-West, upwards at approx. 45 degrees, I witnessed what I belive to be a &quot;shooting star&quot; or metorite.  A very bright, greenish dot, streaked downward and faded.  The entire sighting was no more than 2 seconds in length.  The dot was very bright, white/greenish in color.  Could compare it to burnning magnesium.  The size of the dot was approx. 1/4 - 1/8 the size of the Moon at the time.  The dot also left a faint, whiteish trail behind it.  The dot moved in a straight line, straight downward (no movement across the horizon, i.e. South-to-North).  The dot appeared approx. 45 degrees above the horizon, streaked straight downward, and faded at approx. 10-15 degress above the horizon.  Its speed was extremely fast and constant.

Both objects were SILENT 2nd on travelled slightly faster and way above altitude of saucer.Fathers Day (June 21, 1998) in Millbrae on Highway 101 heading nbound in my car my daughter pointed out a strange object; at this point it looked like a distant planet;  it was twilite and as we drove on the object was too large to be a star but was very high in the sky.  We forgot about it for a few minutes as we headed to 380 to connect to highway 280 there was a huge saucer lit up solid whitish color; flat but w/some type of 2nd story; it was low enough to feel in awe of it; it was definitely a &quot;flying saucer;&quot; as real as it gets.  We pulled over into the Tan Foran Shopping Center parking lot instead of connecting onto 280.  It still was not completely dark although it was if you looked toward the south; it was so well lit it kind of hovered and floated it went right over our heads and to the southeast.  Approximately 4 minutes later (we were still standing there in shock) from the northwest another object only this seemed to be more of a diamond or rectangle shape) followed although it was much higher in the sky and had blue and white (and possibly red) lights that outlined the bottom of the object; first you would see a dim blue blink; then next to that one a dim white blink; next to that one a dim blue blink; so on probably two per second approximately; it followed exact same direction as saucer.  My 8 year old daughter and 6 year old son saw it with me.  Neither of these objects made any noise.

I have had 3 dreams of events as they happened; including one terrifying one when my greatgrandmother died in 1981; six months later I be! gan having what I call my &quot;synergy&quot; dreams - electrocuted and pulled out of my body with all kinds of horrific things happening; recurring to this day.  Odd that about 4 weeks ago I went to the library and began reading about UFO&apos;s.  I do not know what triggered the recent increase in my interest; I do find it strange, however, that I should see such dramatic examples of UFO&apos;s that even I found too close for comfort but it was extremely fascinating.  I do not know if anyone else saw this; the local news did not report a thing;  I find it hard to believe that no one saw these objects, and if I had been alone I would doubt myself by now; however, my children saw it too and I cannot doubt all three of us so I stand by what we saw, no matter how odd it may be.", "A friend and myself were standing on the shore of the Pamlico sound as we observed 4 objects moving in up and down motions for about 30 minutes and then moving across the entire horizon at incredible speeds.

It&apos;s movements were distinctly were not that of any conventional aircraft, that&apos;s for sure. There were also mutltiple colored flashing lights. As it got closer to me, I could make out a dark metallic hull. The actual lights were in a circular-disk shape. It went away, and came back about an hour later. When I got back to Wadley, I talked to a friend who saw it from town,10 miles away.

After realizing that it hadn&apos;t moved in the 5 minutes I examined it through binoculars and quickly called my roommate (who described the same thing).  See description below.After calling my roommate upstairs I stuck a pair of binoculars in his hands and, before telling him what I saw, I asked him to describe what it looked like to him.  Through the binoculars he saw five or six lights arranged in a compressed oval pattern.  Through the binculars each of these lights seemed rather faint, but with the naked eye it was very bright and impossible to miss the colors flashing between red, blue and white (the colors changed rapidly, more than a strobe light even).  To my surprise, he was seeing EXACTLY what I was seeing.  We watched it for about twenty minutes and, before we decided to give it a rest, what was originally five or six lights had become one -- perhaps whatever it was was moving farther away, although it seemed to hold the same position for the time we watched.  (I continued to watch it from my bed -- I&apos;m in a loft and have a terrific view of the sky.) If I had to pinpoint an exact location of the light, I would place it at at least two miles away in the SW sky over Lake Michigan.  I&apos;m on the North Side, so I guess that would put it parallel with the Lincoln Park/Gold Coast area.  It could easily have been overlooked by people on the ground, but once they saw it I guarantee it would have raised an eyebrow. I don&apos;t know what it was, but I definitely know what it wasn&apos;t.  Any of your ideas or insight would be much appreciated.", "I hung up the phone with a friend and went to bed. I had pulled the covers around my shoulders and my eyes were closed. With closed eyes I noticed a bright light enter my room. I opened my eyes and the room was light (not with an exceptionally bright light, just like a lite room). The light dissapated and then through partially cosed vertical blinds, a light entered my room and circled the room. Through the verticle blinds a shadow appeared in the light in the room. The shadow had an elongated head (not long as in high, but as in a sort of football shape) a long thin neck and a thick body. I shadow didn&apos;t move with the light, but through it.  So in otherwords the light behind it was not moving, the shadow was. I thought of more rational possibilities than an extra terrestrial or alien or other life form, whatever your preference in title, but because of the angle of the blinds, I couldn&apos;t justify the way the light moved around the room instead of on one wall. Perhaps this is something to report, or perhaps I need a lesson in light movement?  I&apos;m not ruling either possibility out. when I got the nerve up to look outside, the light had vanished and car alarms were going off.

Unknown whether source of light was close by or far away but no explosion was heard.  Second identical flash occurred about 10 seconds later coming from same direction.  Light had color of copper vapor laser.  Observers thought some kind of electrical transformer may have shorted out in the storm but power was not lost.

I imagine there were about 8 to 10 children, mostly in the range of 5 to 10 years old.  I was 6 or 7 years old.  The sun had just set, but the sky still had a warm orange glow.  We played for some time and finally it was my chance to be &quot;it&quot;, the one who counted then went to find the others in their hiding places.  I recall that I couldn&apos;t count to 50, so I counted to 10 five times.  I was leaning on a tree in the side yard of our house.  By then it was pretty dark and I felt compelled to look up.  As I did so, I observed the leading edge of a circular object emerge from over top of our house.  I was transfixed: I just stood there speechless and stared at it.  It was bigger than our house and perfectly round.  I assume it was a disc and I was observing the bottom of the craft.  It was uniformly a brilliant red-orange.  There were no external marking, windows, lights, or construction details.  Just what appeared to be a self-illuminated object.  It was perfectly silent, which added to the drama.  As soon as it dawned on me that I was seeing something extraordinary, I was filled with the strange sensation that it or they  had seen me, too.  I ran into the house to get one of my parents.  My mother was finishing up the dishes, but she came outside to see it.  It was no longer visible.  We looked in the direction of the sunset and the sky was almost the same red-orange of the craft.  This has made me wonder if the craft was reflecting the sunlight or glowing on its own.  None of the other children saw it and my mother commented that I&apos;d seen a falling star before returning to the kitchen.  I knew I had not seen a falling star.  I was always nervous that whoever was responsible for that craft knew I saw it and might someday return.  In the years following this incident, I have had many occurences which can only best be described as psychic.  I&apos;ve had lucid drea! ms and numerous sleep-walking episodes -- once even going into the front yard of my grandmother&apos;s house and staring at the eastern horizon, only to see the moon rise just at that moment.  My entire family and I observed a spherical craft while on a drive one evening in Greene County, TN.  I discovered in a casual conversation one day that two of my three brothers had also seen spherical craft during their lives - in the exact same neighborhood where we lived when I had the episode mentioned above.  We believe in the reality of the experience, but have no conclusion about the exact nature of the phenomenon.", "Sunny evening...shiney cigar shaped object moving slowly rotating...then disappeared, later followed by 3 military aircraftAbout three years ago, I and two of my friends, were washing our cars in my freinds driveway...it was about 18:00 (6pm) the sun was about an hour or two from setting. My freind ((Name deleted)) noticed a wierd looking object in the sky to the west. He drew my attention to the object as well as my other friend ((Name deleted)). The object i witnessed apeared to be bigger than a commercial airline, in the form of a long cigar (like a 747 with no wings or tail). The object hovered vertically, which was why i didn&apos;t think it was an airliner. It appeared to drift slowly to the north after about two minutes..as it did this a white illumination encompassed it. The Illumination dimmed after about three minutes, and when it dimmed completely the object dissapeared (in no direction without sound) Just as we had convinced ourselves it was an airplane refecting the setting sun, a formation of 3 low flying, military style, black helicopters flew by directly over head in the direction we viewed the object.

The object stopped for about a second, then travelled in a N.W. direction at about a 90 degree angle and emitted another 6 &quot;fireballs&quot; in rapid succession that also appeared to fall downward.  the object then disappeared from my view.  I then got on I-15 Southbound and at about 8:15 PM saw a bright light off to my right at mile marker 85; it was stationary and increased in brightness for maybe 2 seconds and then dissipated.  At approximately 8:25 PM. I saw four Fighter planes from Nellis AFB pursuing a rapid course in the direction in which the objects were spotted.The only other information that comes to mind is that when I initially thought I was Witnessing a meteor coming into our atmosphere, the object had a very yellow hue to it, as opposed to a more white hue associated with such objects.  The other witnesses were: a person who pulled off the road to witness the event, as well as, three truckers who were pulled over on I-15 looking up in the vicinity of the incident.", "An object viewed very close to me moveing slow. 250-300 ft. of altitude. I could hear popping and or snapping as streams of sparks or light of many colors dropped down.  object black very rough 100 ft long 1/3 of length high. dropingI was working on my car, a sound like snapping and crackeling caused me to look and see a black object with a very rough surface moving slowly from south to north within 400-500 ft. from me. There were, as it looked sparks falling off the retreating end and falling straght down toward the ground. The lights were of many colors. There was a background reference of a tree line. I was able to estimate the size. This object was 100-150 ft. long and 1/3 that length high. This experience happed a long time ago but is peminently etched in my mind. I witnessed this and it has bothered me ever since. The object made no other sounds it was not anything of this planet unless the government has such technology for antigravity! I am relectant to report this but maybe it is helpful. I do not want to be called nuts! From time to time I have wanted to tell the authorities but you can understand the fears. This is my brothers computer and came across your website. I am 46 years of age now and I am convinced of other technology. Is it ours? Or from somewhere else. My brother, mother and father saw me very disturbed after the sighting. This object now as I have understood the stealth technology, was similar to how the surface on this object would reflect radar. But in the year 1970-&apos;71?", "My son had seen the UFO when he went to look out the window. He was looking straight when he saw a huge UFO with white bright lights at the corner of his eye. He turned to look at it compltetely and confirmed he saw it. He yelled to me and my wife that he saw a UFO. We both ran to the window when we saw the UFO. It was big.It was about 300 or 400 feet long.The UFO was grey like when an F-18 is made brand new and it had white, very bright, lights. It was like a flying saucer but it had like a mound, the shape of a pitchers mound at the top. It hovered for about 20 seconds. It then started to move and it kept picking up speed as it moved. It had went really fast as it moved that it disappeared.", "A red circle in the sky that was very high in the sky.  Everytime the craft went by stars the stars disappered for about 10-15 seconds.A red circle in the sky, very high up.  I knew this wasn&apos;t a plane because the craft didn&apos;t flash or blink.  It did not go strait across the sky, it kept on going back and forth and circleing around until it finally went across the sky and out of sight about 15 minutes after I spotted it.  When this object went passed stars the stars would disappear for about 10-15 seconds, this was the most mysterious event about the sighting.", "White, vertical cigar shape floating around in the eastern sky.From the jacuzzi at the MGM Grand pool area, myself and 12 other friends all saw a small white-ish vertical cigar shape in the eastern sky, looking over the roof of the convention center. It looked to be at least 2 miles away, at approximately 55 degrees altitude from our posiion. My first thought was that it must be an elongated weather balloon, but it changed shape in weird fashion. It went from being clearly defined, to very blurry, as if it were vibrating violently. It also lengthened and shortened slightly. It appeared only to move slightly left (north) then right (south) a few times before moving off south and east, moving out of our view behind the building. What amazed me was that all the people I was with looked up at it after I spotted it, then looked away as if they had seen nothing at all. But here was this clearly unexplainble thing floating in the sky!! It reminded me of that footage from Florida of the floating metallic cylinder over the water...", "Silver Sphere sighted, Flew off!  A USAF Jet circled the area in search of the object.I was relaxing in my parents spa.  About ten minutes had past and I got a strange feeling that I was being watched.  I opened my eyes and stared up into the sky.  I noticed a silver greyish ball in the sky just hovering, approx 2 football fields high. I thought it was the damnest thing.  Being a person with a rational mind I ran inside and told my wife, and mother to come see. I realized that a multiple sighting would have more weight than a single eye witness account. They rushed outside and I had them look in the area of the object.  I was actually suprised it was still there 3 min must have passed since I first saw it.  &quot;I thought it could be a weather balloon&quot; My mother has poor eyesight and can not see even with the help of her glasses.  My wife could not see it until it emitted a orange glow from underneath that lasted about 1.5 sec.  That helped her focus in on the object.  Shortly after it emitted a blue orange glow underneath and went up out of the atmosphere. Out of site. No sound was heard during the whole event and it was quite windy.  The object never diviated from it&apos;s local position, was not affected by the wind.  At that point I desided it wasn&apos;t a weather balloon I continued to scan the sky about 1 minute after the object left the atmosphere a military jet flew into the area where the object was and circled as if searching for something then it left. Usually jets don&apos;t fly in our area that low.  I then called the local MUFON group and and told them what I saw.  They blew me off. I was 24 years of age at the time and personally didn&apos;t believe in UFO&apos;s at that time.  Several days after the incident I had seen some strange lights in the sky, green shooting comets on a horizontal plane with the earth. I am a member of the US Reserves.  My reasons for reporting this is to have a documented report of this incident, I feel it is worth mentioning.", "Was witnessed by my girlfriend on her way home.

I am a police supervisor for one of the local cities in the Kansas City area.  My girlfriend called me very upset because she had just seen an object.  The following is her description as best I can remember.  She was traveling north on the street she lives and the object was seen in the sky to her north, but she stated it was towards the end of her block.  The height that she described was only described as lower than an airplane would fly.  She stated that the object was flying slowly from the east to the west.  She stated that it gave her the feeling that it was going to come after her, so she huried inside her home.  She stated that as she was walking in she was still watching it and after traveling slowly it shot west very fast.  She described it as a glowing object, and one that left a trail.  I asked her to call and she wouldn&apos;t because she was at home and  it was late. ( Her parents are elderly).

I saw a large, straight line of about 10 lights moving quickly and soundlessly across the northern sky.  The formation formed a perfect horizontal line, and as it continued to move, the line of lights changed formation into a horseshoe shape and I lost sight of it as it passed behind my building. I heard absolutely no sound as this happened and the lights were yellow-white like a light bulb.

It appeared to change directions from south to west and back east then to the north also appeared to stop on occasion, which could be when it was headin at at us. I went in and viewed the object from our binoculars, which were set up in our kitchen window. The object filled the viewing from the binoculars to where I had to back off the distance. Once in focus A very bright obscure light with a trailing tail was visable. I followed it in a northerly direction, the object appeared to seperate into three different balls of light. I then went back out on my deck where mywife was still watching the object, I agin started to video the object.Approximately 15 min after first seeint the object it was no longer visable.", "two craft with 3 white lights arranged in tringle and red light in center of triangle.  slow flight.  no noise.On July 31, 1998, ((male name deleted)) and ((female name deleted)). were 30 miles north of Ft. Collins Colorado at a mountain home at about 8500 ft elevation.  At 11 pm they saw directly above two identical objects approaching each other, appear to meet, then cross each other&apos;s path, and diverge.  The general flight direction of the entire event was from east to west, and the event lasted approximately 10 minutes.  After the two objects crossed, one&apos;s flight path was directly overhead, and its speed was very slow.  It was observed to fly west and appeared to hover far in the west for a long time.  ((witness names deleted)) showed two other people the hovering light in the west.  By this time it appeared no more unusual than a first magnitude star. At the crossing point of both objects their largest angular extent was the size of a ping-pong ball at arm&apos;s length.  There was no sound heard throughout the sighting except near the crossing point when a very faint jet aicraft-like sound was heard for less than one second. Since it was dark during the sighting, no shapes were observed for either object.  However the distinguishing features of both these objects were three whitish lights arranged in an equilateral triangle, with a brighter red-orange light in the center of the triangle.  The red light seemed to pulsate.  Strange as it may sound, the red light appeared to grow especially intense during moments of skepticism as the observers speculated about these objects actually being terrestrial aircraft. This pulsation apparently linked to thoughts was most intense as the one object was hovering in the western sky.", "Due west of our position, spotted an unusual flickering and bright light above the horizon.  Observed light in relation to other stars, rotation was not similar.  Two red objects shot out from the light.At 2000 on 9/6/98 while facing due west, I observed a light travel from south to north at high rate of speed.  Light stopped and hovered for 1 1/2 hours and was observed by my son and I.  Light was a bright white and then would emanate bright flashes of red, blue and green.  Light did not change its position in the sky at the same  pace the stars did and clearly appeared much closer than any star.  At one point, a bright red light shot off to the north and downward to the horizon from the light.  About 40 minutes later, another red light shot out to the south from the object at an incredible rate of speed.  The main light appeared to shift position to regain a position relative to a star we were measuring against.  The sky was perfectly clear.  We were in the woods with no background lighting other than a full moon.  Comparing the position of the light to a map, the light may have been in proximity to McChord AFB. No other aircraft ever flew in proximity for the 1 1/2 hours we watched.", "I was on patrol I looked up in the sky at the little dipper &amp; at the bottom left of it inbetween a star to the left bottom was a very bright teardrop shape.It dove down then pull up and turned from white to yellow then it was gone.

After mentioning this sighting to two different air traffic controllers, the second offered the UFO Center phone and web sight address...  We continue to feel that we wittnessed a military aircraft of some kind, however we could not get any confirmation from ATC.

There appeared to be some sort of orange light or glow in the cender of the bottom. I could not see the top. I could not see the color of the object. It appeared to move very slow, slower then a normal plane. Then, all of a sudden, the object increased it&apos;s speed almost instantly, shot straight up and out of sight in about 1-2 seconds.

Coming home I noticed a bright beam of light coming straight down froma an object in the sky and proceded to analyze what I was looking at, but could not explain the object. Having my oldest daughter in the back seat I asked her to look in the sky and describe what she saw (@5 years old). She described the oval disk with the ring of red light around the side and the beam of light coming down but not touching the ground. My wife also saw the object as described. We stopped the car and I attempted to get my 35mm camera from the trunk but was not quick enough and the object stopped as if reading my mind and proceded to star to move away. In an instant it was a streak across the sky and became a white dot that transversed the sky in seconds. I am not crazy and don&apos;t drink or do drugs but when you tell people this story they wonder.

It had a long tail, much like a comet, except it too was green.  It was very low, beneath the overcast cieling, and seemed to fall to earth before it reached the horizion.  I was surprised at how bright it was, because I could see it, despite the flourescent lights of a nearby gas station which was between me and the object.

This was followed by a &quot;Stealth&quot; bomber flying overhead in a easterly direction. Several streaks across the sky followed and each time a streak was seen there was an object flying across the sky at the starting point or beyond the finishing point of the streak. There were several fly-overs at altitudes exceeding the normal for passenger jets. Then there was a large silver and bright blue streak across the sky in a westerly direction. This streak exploded into many directions. The explosion seemed to be very high in the sky, and no report was heard. Within less than five minutes the &quot;Stealth&quot; came back overhead from a south-east direction and proceeded north-west. The &quot;Stealth&quot; was low enough that you could see its outline. The objects flying at high altitude were moving in several directions, but did not follow the horizon line. Some dissapeared in the middle of our line of site. Some were just flying across the sky, turned bright blue, and was gone. Some flew across the sky, stopped, and held position. Five object held position for almost an hour, moving closer together then separating. These were also a extremely high altitude. These objects had no back-trail, and were traveling 15-20 times faster than the &quot;Stealth&quot; when it flew over.

I was looking towards the direction of where the car was parked when I noticed with my right field of view, a very large  dark object that was moving from East to West just above tree top. The event happened so fast that I could barely point fast enough with my hand (while yelling Look..Look!) towards the object, hoping to get my wife&apos;s attention. Even though black in color, it had dimly glowing light along all the bottom edges and the sihlouette of the object was easily distinguished as a large silent triangle. The scene was fairly quiet and I was able to clearly hear in the background the motor noise of a small plane, during and well after the event took place. I was so shook up with my heart pounding that I could hardly breathe.After the event took place I noticed that to attract my wife&apos;s attention to the black triangle I used my index finger with my arm fully extended.  This would later provide me with a scale of the relative size of the object.  The speed of movement across my field of view (in this case approximately 70&deg; to 80&deg;) took ~2 seconds. The altitude I estimated had to be less than some visible background mountain peaks that are ~3000ft about ~5 to 6 miles from wher I was viewing. It travelled right over the city and made no sound whatsoever!.  If I had not been gazing at exactly in the direction of the mountains behind the city, I would have missed the event.  It was that quick and that lucky.  After gaining my composure my wife and I exchanged information, but it was clearly evident that she had missed all the initial trajectory as i was trying to get her to follow the object by my pointing towards it.  The next morning I went back to the exact place I was standing the night before and took a picture.  From the picture I was able to determine the relative speed at &gt;800 mph!...and an object size (when compared to some features of the background) observed the day I took the picture. I estimated the object to be some  60 to 80 meters? in some size (It&apos;s hard to extract all this from such a short mental picture). It also looked blunt at the back, not aerodynamic per se.  I noted that fromthe perspective that I saw it dissapear behing the trees, it looked more like a wide arrow head but was flat across the back. I purchased newspapers and asked around if any reports were submitted, but was not able to confirm any other observers which would have seen this craft.

I was about 3-5 miles from Battle Ground when I saw a light traveling south at approximately 1000 feet high in the distance in front of me. The object appeared to be far enough away as to be flying over Battle Ground. It&apos;s appearance was like an airplane at night. It was a white light with a smaller red light on it. At this distance, an airplane would appear to the eye to be traveling relatively slow in perspective. However the object was moving at a fairly rapid rate. My estimate based on it&apos;s altitude and distance in front me was that it would be traveling at several hundred miles per hour. It is the velicity which grabbed my attention. I am used to seeing planes fly as Portland International Airport is about 25 miles away. This moved way faster than anything I&apos;ve seen before.

Looking through binoculars, another male 65 years old, sighted small lights below the planet.  A female 64 yrs old sighted three lights in a horizontal configuration, moving from south to north with a brilliant halogen-type beam coming down from above the three lights.  A fourth light came into view on the left, as if something were rotating.  Another female, 65, saw the lights through binoculars.  The lights seemed to be at approximately 20,000 ft.  The observers had been playing bridge in a mountain cabin, drinking only coffee; first observer had stepped outside for a breath of cool air, then called the others to come and see &quot;the bright light in the sky.&quot;The four observers are retired from their professional fields: a teacher, a writer, a photographic processing lab owner, and a printing company owner.  The first to notice the &quot;bright light&quot; was able to see it with the naked eye.  The other three observers needed the binoculars to see the detail of three lights in a row.  One of the observers noticed that as the lights approached, a bright halogen-type beam of light seemed to be aimed down at the earth below from a point just above the three lights.  As the lights approached very high in the sky (approx. 20,000 ft) they seemed to move sideways several times as the binoculars moved...as though the lights and observer were somehow interacting.  This &quot;interaction&quot; was very brief---perhaps 20 seconds---and then the lights were gone.  Afterwards, all four observers talked about what they had seen.  The teacher saw something but felt the binoculars were too unsteady to say what she saw.  The retired owner of a printing company was the first to see the thrr horizontal lights, first with the naked eye, then with the binoculars.  The writer saw the lights approach and then the halogen-type spotlight, and then a fourth light appearing on the left of the other three, as though rotating into view.  The photo lab owner saw the horizontal lights but later decided they were just reflections on the lenses from two distant lights that illuminate the driveway in this otherwise pitch-black mountain setting in the Blue Ridge Mountains.  All four of us tried to duplicate the lights in the binoculars to see if they were indeed reflections, to no avail---the phenomenon couldn&apos;t be duplicated.", "was looking at stares and saw huge streak of fire cross the skyMy sister and I were watching the stars one night when we looked up and saw a huge red fire like streak cross the sky. It was to big and fast to be a metor and we never heard anything about it. We could not keep our eyes on it because it went over the tree line. it must have been at least an inch wide to us as we saw it, that is compareing it to a stare which looks like a 1/64 inch.", "While traveling north on I-95 we saw what we thought was a shooting star but as it kept coming down it seem to burn up or burst into a green fire it continued to fall untill it was out of sight, I would say around Vero Beach or alittle north of there.

It manuevered when it was overhead.the best way to describe the manuever was to say it appeared to &apos;slip sideways&apos;off of its path then immediately resumed its original flight pattern.It glowed with a faint silver pink color,and was totally silent in operation. It appeared to loosely follow the I-5 freeway. we are located just to the east of the I-5. There is also an airport 3-4 miles southwest of our location. this was definitely not a conventional aircraft.", "While traveling East on I40, between Newport, Tn. and Ashville, Nc. I saw an object streak across the sky. The weather was clear. The stars were bright. The object I saw was like a round globe, dull white, in color. The strangest thing about this object was, it did not have a tail . That and the color. It was almost transparant. You could clearly see the shape. But the middle was a dull white. I have never seen a comet, meteor, or anything else, that did not have a tail behind it. I would be intrested to know if any one else reported this. The object was traveling West To East.", "Four round lights traveling in a diamond formation traveling at a very high rate of speed. All four lights appeared attached to a smaller red light. Approximately 10 seconds into the sighting, the tailing light broke formation and crossed the pattern and the then trailing light moved forward to the position vacated at that time. This formation then became a square. The formation then traveled out of sight over the horizon. The formation was traveling in a East to West direction making no noise what so ever.At approximately 1:30 in the morning of July 1, 1998, while on vacation at my father&apos;s house in St. Cathrines, Ontario Canada, a friend and I were sitting on my father&apos;s porch. As I was looking into the sky I wittnessed a formation of 4 lights traveling through the night sky in an East to West direction. Each white light was attached to a smaller red light about 1/3 the size of the white light. There was absolutly no noise. The duration of the sighting lasted approximately 17 seconds. The formation was originally traveling in a diamond shape. After approximately 10 seconds the formation changed to a square when the tailing light moved to front left of the formation and the then tailing light moved to the right tailing left of the formation. The formation was traveling at an extremly high rate of speed. Faster than any known aircraft that I have ever wittnessed. At the time there was another aircraft in the air, that was appearantly making its approch to the local airport in a southly direction.", "I was on the second floor deck, looked up for stars, craft went right over me, just above tree tops, no lights, covered mile to power co. in about 5 seconds. It was so low, others had to have seen it.  It was small and the bottom was striped like a bullseye.  There was no noise. At the time K.I. Sawyer AFB was nearby.I had taken the dog outside, I stayed on the second floor deck, and looked at the sky.  It was overcast, the kind that gives off a daylight glow.  The small craft came over, just above the tree line. No light, no noise.  I turned and watched as it flew toward and into the low clouds around the power co. smokestacks.  The craft would have flown over Northern Michigan University and a fly-by of the hospital (with all those windows).  I could not have been the only one to see it.  There was a Miss  ??

I went with friends to watch a meteor shower in the desert. It was late at night and we could hear normal night desert sounds. We were all watching the falling stars when one person noticed lights slowly approaching. As the lights neared us we saw three triangle shaped craft flying in a triangle formation. The craft were (RAM?)black, with three lights on each one. I do not remember which lights were red and which were white, but each craft had red and white lights on the 3 points. The craft were 500 to 1000 feet above us as they went past. They were moving at about 350 mph judging by how low they were and how long it took them to pass. They were completely silent, as they passed we still heard the desert night sounds. there were no car engines running or lights on,(so I do not know if they would have had any effect on them,) as we were all watching the sky. Most of us they worked at the air force plant and held security clearances,  but none of us had ever seen any craft like that before. We were all used to watching fighters and bombers fly by, so were used to judging aircraft size and speed. We had never saw an aircraft that was a perfect triangle float past us at 350 mph though! They flew/floated overhead and vanished in the distance. The profile of the craft were very low. We saw the light before we saw the craft and the craft outline vanished before the lights disappeared. We were used to seeing F117 fighters, and these were not shaped like them. I worked briefly on the first F22&apos;s and they were not flying yet. Besides, both of these craft make a lot of noise and cannot glide that long and that low without power. This craft was powered by magnetics or atomic/nuclear fuel. There was no exhaust vents visible on the trailing edge of any of the three craft. It was probably 11:30 at night and as they passed no heat from them distorted any stars behind them as they passed. I heard of Art Bell seeing a single triangle craft abou! t the same time, or a bit after we saw these three. The artists rendition of his craft on his web page makes the craft way to big. They were all three the size of an F15 or F16, not any bigger than that. I realize this happened in 1993, and it is now 1998, but I told the story to people I worked with when I was transferred from Palmdale to Everett, Wa. Those people could vouch that I told them about it in 1993. Besides, I did not know who else would care, as it was not the classic round ball of light or flying saucer sighting, and we did not have any camera&apos;s.", "We were two driving south to LA on the 101 freeway through Oxnard. Suddenly the sky lit up in green and bluish flashes.They seemed to come from behind tall , distant buildings (office buildings of some sort).

Looked up in the parking lot and observed a egg shaped clear yet irridecent &quot;bubble&quot;.  It moved slowly upward while at the same time &quot;vibrating&quot; as if something was spinning around inside the bubble causing it to wobble as if off balance.  It made no noise and was completely clear except for the appearance of a bubble... having multicolored yet clear walls. Stars could be seen through the object.  It moved from a SSE to a NNW location in the sky while slowly moving upward and quietly wobbling. When I began to observe it it was about 100 to 200 feet above me. Several people came out of the restraunt and saw me looking up so they took the time to watch with me.  We all talked about it while it happend and tried to determine what it was.  It was definitely not a balloon or any craft that I have ever seen before.  When the object obtained a height too high for us to observe it any longer we all talked about wether or not to report it.  All present decided not to report it to the local press or air traffic because we felt they would think we are crazy.  We all parted and went home to bed.", "I saw what at first was one glowing greenish light and then a total of three that moved in unison in a square pattern down/up and then from corner to corner, maybe a couple hundred feet in the sky.I woke up early....I tend to wake around 2 or 3 in the morning, as a habit. I often look out at the stars. This particular night there was a glowing greenish light that caught my eye. It was bright an unusual and unfamiliar. I live close to an airport, but the airport&apos;s last flight in/out is not past midnight. There is a cargo plane that takes off every night around 2 am, but I can hear it; it is a familiar sound to me.I also see the planes come in and out and I can not remember a plane or helicopter ever hover or circle around the airport. The light was not familiar to me, so I stared at it for awhile and went closer to the window to study it...it just sort of loomed over the hillside. Then it moved slowly and two other lights appeared. I heard nothing. It is very isolated and quiet where I live. I can hear the planes that take off very well, but I could hear nothing; no rumble of a motor or screem of engines. I thought it was a helicopter, but thought it strange that it hovered in this particular area at this particular time at night. The lights were the size of a melon at my distance and moved in unison now. All together the lights moved like they were attached to something. First they moved &apos;forward&apos; or my direction (west), then they went up and over further(south) and then back and down and back(east). And, then, suddenly they seemed to just disappear. There was no cloud obstruction and it didn&apos;t seem that the object/lights went behind the mountain or that a craft had landed. The lights were too far away from the airport to be able to land. It was very strange. Almost as if they went out all of a sudden. I would not be even reporting this if I had not been listening to Art Bell tonite. All of a sudden I felt this strange familiarity with the reports that were coming in on his show (11/16/98-Monday). I had no idea that other people were seeing this kind of thing. I just wrote it off as &apos;being tired&apos;; seeing a strange star(s); or, a cargo plan or helicopter I just couldn&apos;t hear. Ironically, I&apos;ve been ! looking for the lights every time I get up late at night...just to satisfy my sanity more than anything...did I really see something or didn&apos;t I? Until tonite, I wasn&apos;t altogether too sure. Now, I know, that others, during this very same time period really saw something like what I saw. It is both reassuring and eerie at the same time. I only wish I had written down the experience right away or called the air control tower or something. I was afraid to call or report the sighting because I didn&apos;t want to be &apos;wrong&apos; about what I&apos;d seen. The reports on Art Bell&apos;s show make me even more sure of the siting, but I still feel strange about what I saw. I&apos;m a teacher and this is a small town and I wouldn&apos;t want people to think I&apos;ve gone nutty or something! But, I am reporting the information because so many others out there seem to verify what I too saw! Hope this helps", "The &quot;craft&quot; had about 6 white lights around its perimeter and a redish one in the middle.

I looked outside into the yard to see a gigantic shadow with a curved leading edge race across the ground outside in the backyard. I ran outside to see if I could see anything but there was nothing visible (our yard is partly covered by trees). We heard no sounds out of the ordinary, felt no motion, and do not live in a flight path (in fact, the shadow moved the wrong direction for our local aiport&apos;s typical takeoff or landing routes).

I had been at just gotten to work and had time to spare the set and it was dark the parking lot lights had not come on yet so the sky was pretty clear.  There were no clouds, it was a perfect evening.  I had glanced around a bit and was going to grab my book, when I saw a plane in the sky which looked like either a medium sized prop plane or a private jet.  Behind this plane about 50 to 100 feet or so was glowing red ball.  The plane could not be that long for the altitude it was flying at.  Behind the glowing red ball was what looked to be 3 helicopters in formation.  I was able to tell they were helicopters because the lights on the tail were flickering from the tail rotor.  The flew from east to west until they dissappeared over the tree tops.

At that time in my life I was interested in astronomy so I looked at the sky alot. On this particular night I was looking to the south over the top of a mountain range and to my surprise I saw 2 seperate sets of 3 red lights approach each other from the East and West. The objects came very close to each other but didn&apos;t appear to touch. I was able to get a relative to come outside just in time to see the objects seperate and fly away in different directions. One object flew back to the West while the other flew North over the house. At no time was I able to discern a shape of the crafts or even any engine noise. I would guess that the crafts were approximately a 3/4-1 mile up, as they didn&apos;t appear to be much higher that the mountains.

My brother and I had been pheasant hunting all day in the Clarkston area. I would not have seen the disc except that my headlights and the headlights of an oncoming car reflected off of it&apos;s surface. The oncoming car and mine were going to meet each other at the top of a small rise. As our headlights were pointed up the rise, they reflected off of a disc shaped object. My brother was asleep, and I did not have time to wake him. The disc was slowly moving from right to left. It was the color of wet, smooth concrete, and about as wide as the road.  Ido not know if the other car saw it or not. I went back to the same spot the next day and there was nothing haning over the road that I could have mistaken for what I saw.

Weather clear ca. 70 degrees F. light breeze from north.  Object was very bright blue-white light, steady illumination (no variation in luminance or color).  Object was size of small pea at the end of my arm.   When I first noticed it, I thought it was an especially bright satellite given its steady  tracking characteristics,  but the object suddenly disappeared when it reached a position straight on from my observation point, and I also am not aware of many satellites in easterly to westerly orbits!  As I could see no evidence of running lights or strobe, and I could hear no noise during the sighting or for two minutes after the object disappeared.  It also did not appear to be in usual flight approach or departure lanes for PDX.   I decided to report sighting as unknown. Track:  appeared to be very high.  About 4 degrees below a very bright star or planet (slightly less bright than the moving object), and about 80 deg. above horizon.  Went through 3--5 deg. of arc in about 40 seconds.  Sudden winkout at 90 degrees azimuth. I felt strange after seeing this.  I thought I heard a couple behind me say &quot;Oh, another sighting!&quot; but no way did I want to talk to anyone about what I saw at the moment.  Needless to say, I debated a long time before deciding to report this. I am a professional archaeologist  trained in photointerpretation and physical observation techniques.

I was picking up rocks and hitting them with a beat-up baseball bat. I bent over to pick up a rock and I noticed a shadow moving directly between my legs. It was a triangular formation of 6 perfectly round circles moving at about 5 mph. Shocked to see such a shadow, I looked up to see what was in the sky above me. There was nothing (no birds, no clouds, no planes; the sky was all blue and they weren&apos;t sunspots because I was not looking up until that point). I started to follow the shadow, looking back &amp; forth from ground to sky. I followed it for about 20 yards until the end of the property. This was not my imagination, nor was I under any influence. These objects were casting a perfect shadow on the ground, but were totally invisible to the naked eye.

The fireball was about the width of my thumb at arms length and had a glare similar to a magnesium flare (only green, not white). The tail had a length about 7 times the size of the fireball. In all, the object was as long as my middle finger held at arms length. It came straight down, 260 degrees by magnetic compass. It made no sound. I have no clue about its distance from me.

We walked around and underneath the craft for 15 or 20 minutes while it remained motionless and soundless above what should have been a busy, suburban street. Without apparent means the craft suddenly shot straight up into a small cloud and drifted away. We both completly forgot about this incident for 3 years. I think it is also relevant that both of us felt then and now that we are missing a 24 hour period of our lives.Please forgive me in advance if this narrative seems to ramble. Frankly I am a little trepeditious of relaying the events of that afternoon 25 years ago. I am still fearful of what I saw but I am more afraid of what I cannot remember. My hope is that by relaying this bit of truth I might be able to let go of some of the isolation I feel in a forum of like-minded individuals and perhaps make contact with someone who also saw what we saw. As for autobiography I am a 41 year old Police Captain who has led a relatively normal life of ups and downs, good times and bad. I had an average childhood and an interesting adult life of travel. love affairs and advanced education. I suppose I&apos;m just pretty damned average in every way except for this nagging experience which continues to haunt me. In either September or October of 1973 at approximately 1515 hours, my sister ((Name deleted)) (13yoa) and I (16yoa) had just been dropped off by our school bus in front of our house. We were living in a heavily populated suburban area of Mansfield Ohio in the ((Address deleted)) block of Cook Road. Cook Road itself is a busy two lane street and, although our section was mostly residential, a school and a convenience store were both within half a block from where we stood. Our house was at the base of two gradually sloping hills amidst dozens of homes on both sides of the street. I had exited the bus before my sister and stood waiting for her on the sidewalk. As she stepped from the bus and it pulled away I was startled to see a large object hovering over the street where the school bus had been. I pointed it out to my sister and we both stood captivated by it&apos;s appearance and proximity. The craft was approximatly 40 feet long and 15 or 20 feet tall. It hovered silently 35 or 40 feet overhead and had lights encircling it&apos;s cigar-shaped structure. I believe there was a larger red light on one end and a green light on the other but the rest of the smaller lights were multicolored. It was of a metal which looked like brushed aluminium and had no visible means of levitation or propulsion, no wings or propellers. I walked into the street underneath the craft and accross the street to see it from the other side. There were no numbers or letters of any kind displayed and I could not see any seams for the release of landing apparatus. At one point I picked up a rock to hear what it would sound like bounced against the exterior but my sister disuaded me from throwing it. I remember we were becomming increasingly distressed when I was not able to identify this object and by the fact we were alone. It had been at least 15 minutes since we first saw the craft and during this time, remarkably, no one had passed by. No one came out onto their front porch, no other kids walked the sidewalks and no cars drove by. In retrospect this seems absurd given the time of day and usual traffic on Cook Road. When I returned to the side of the street on which my sister stood I now saw a small black oval slightly above the row of lights. We thought it might be a window and waved but there was no response. Several minutes later the craft silently shot up and into a small cumulus cloud which drifted away. I remember my sister asking me what it was to which I replied &quot;I don&apos;t know. do you think it could be one of those UFO&apos;s the paper&apos;s been writing about?&quot; We were both excited and scared as we walked into our ho! use whereupon we both completely forgot about it. Although we had no apparant memory of the event I recall that we were both very upset with our mother whom we accused of leaving us for a 24 hour period. Mom insisted she had never done such a thing but we were convinced we had experienced a full 24 hours without her. This missing time was particularly perplexing to both of us and, to this day, remains a disturbing reality. I know that I am missing a day, but I cannot explain it. Three years after our encounter I had a sudden recall of the events described above while talking about the cosmos with some college friends. I called my sister and asked her if she had ever seen a flying saucer. At first she said no but when I mentioned the school bus in Ohio she also had a sudden realization and literally gasped on the phone. Her memory of the event is almost exactly like my own including the little window and the strange missing time. There&apos;s a lot more to tell about subsequent related occurances and some strange stories of little men I used to tell to my mother when I was very young but this is the heart of the matter. Life goes on but I sure wish I could understand the &quot;what&apos;s&quot; and the &quot;why&quot;s&quot;  of this event.", "The two white saucers were flying parallel for most of the time.  For approximately 5 seconds they became one then they were parallel again.  The left craft was spinning and disappeared for a moment.  They flew parallel for the rest of the time then split apart, one went east and the other one flew on a diagonal to the west.  At the time of the sighting there was a severe wind storm in the city of Calgary and a tornado touched down to the norhteast of Calgary. Also, the international airport was shut down temporarily.  No small aircraft would have been cleared to fly at that time. The observers have never seen a ufo and were very skeptical before this event.", "3 orange fireballs in triangle formation - 1 triangle shaped craft without sound.on 9/1/98 in Mt Sterling, Il.

I then turned around and proceeded to drive south on route 99 where the lights of the town was not a factor and my view would not be obscured. Approx. 1.5 mi. south of town I seen 3 orange fireballs to the east of me approx. 1/4 mile. from my location at about 1000 ft. in altitude. These fireballs were in a triangular formation and motionless. The location of these lights were less than 1/4 of a mile east of the Western Illinois Correctional Facility. After approx. 5 minutes they seemed to implode into themselves. I proceeded to a small black top road called the Wild Cat Road, to head back to town. I then noticed what appeared to be an air craft with 2 white landing lights approaching from the south west. The craft was slow moving like an old j-3 Cub and made no noise. I got out of my car and watched the craft pass over me. It was small like a fighter jet but was totally quiet and moved so slow. As the craft passed I noticed a string of 5 white lights along the trailing edge all in a line. The were no aircraft marker lights or strobes on the object. This is a small community with a population of 1900 in rual America. What the Hell is going on??????", "I saw a bright green &quot;shooting star,&quot; but it was much brighter and larger than a normal SS, which I&apos;ve seen dozens of.

It did not flash or sparkle like a normal SS.summary says it all", "Craft motionless above us we pulled over and stopped very large triangle shape several glowing lights on bottom, craft as big as one or two football fields after a min or two craft slowly moved west up and away turned north picking up speed ...no noise  when above us it was only about 100 to 300  feet up.....Father and daughter (39 and 15 in age) Father Had been in Army Rangers trained to observe and report information, familer with aircraft Daugher your average 15 year old drug free.....She was first to see it and kept telling me to look as I looked I could see some lights and a shape so I pulled into a gas station and got out of the car the craft was large a triangle shape pointing west.....the first thing I noticed was that it made no noise and seemed to have bigger brighter lights near the bottom of each point of the triangle smaller lights in from those it was so big and close we could not see the sides of it until it started to move away.......it seemed to have some lights or windows along its sides moviing west ....up and away it still made no noise......it turned towards the north and we got in our car and started to drive along the road ....soon it was gone ....it seemed to be 20 to 50 feet in hieght......", "star light appeared travelled a short distance then faided away1st a bright light apeared high in the south sky. travelling down at a  approx 45degrea angle passing behind a mountian range in the north .the light apperead to be burning with a bright long tail .the second light i  witnessed was in the south eastern sky it appeared travelled north a short ditance then disapeared but it did this twice with no bright tail it was just like a star but defenetly was not a saterlight", "Shape was rounded but slightly elongated with slight fin-like sides.  Moving very slowly: not stationary like a star but too slowly to be a plane. Very &quot;pure&quot; white light, no color. Circular lights covered it,reminicent of honeycomb...separate and destinct, not interlocking. Shape was too round to be an oval but not a circle.Coming out of work last night we happened to look upward and saw the above mentioned object.  My friend saw it simultaneously and jokingly asked if it was a UFO.  It moved very slowly yet was not stationary.  I commented that if it was...&quot;Beam me up, Scotty.  There&apos;s no signs of intelligent life here.&quot;  We laughed about it and didn&apos;t give it a second thought.  However in retrospect it defies logical explanation in terms of a conventional aircraft.  We both work at a retirement community as a nurse (myself) and a nurses&apos; aide.   The above description  is as accurate as I can be  except for the &quot;fins&quot; on the side...they were more like jug handle in shape but not separate from the actual body but tight against it and also covered with lights...barely destinct from the body of the object but noticable due to the shape not being a continuous oval/circle becase of them.", "Boiling, back lighted clouds obscurred full moon. Then three light balls appeared less then 30 feet from me appearing as multishaft lucite stars with rods emanating from center 15 feet in diameter floating one foot above ground.I am a retired air traffic controller and I have an airline transport pilot license. I&apos;ve been trained specifically to see and interpret correctly what I see in the sky and on radar. Technically speaking, people like me are the most credible of witnesses. Not that that will convince the people with their heads in the sand but for what it&apos;s worth, I saw three UFOs and they were, at their closest approach, no more than 20 feet (not less than 15 and not more than 25 feet) from me. I was parked in a tourist attraction parking lot in Ponce, Puerto Rico at a place called &quot;El Vigia&quot;. There were at least 30 other people there with their friends listening to music from their car radios or portable radios. Some were drinking. I was not. It was April 9, 1990. I got to the parking lot right after dark. I watched the moon rise. It was a lovely night and I was enjoying the full moon. At about 9:00 P.M. the moon became obscured by clouds. Then the clouds began to boil just like in the movie cucoon. This thunder cell of clouds or whatever it was (it made no sound) began moving from east to west towrds the city of Ponce. I was somewhat worried but just kept standing outside my car and watching it move. It was lighted from inside with a white glow. I could here the gasps and oos and ahhhs from the people around the parking lot. After about 15 minutes of this two lights shot out of this cloud formation I estimated to be at about 6,000 feet maximum altitude at 2000 plus miles an hour and moved south, made a hairpin turn and went north and disappeared. Then I heard this poof sound and three 15 foot diameter light balls appeared in front of me at about 20 feet away (one poof sound for each ball), floated across the parking lot about 2 feet above the gound  for about 3 minutes and disappeared with the same poof sound. These &quot;light balls&quot; as I call them looked like giant sea urchins with clear lucite rods  extending fom the center in a star burst design. Another similar item is a fiber optic lamp with straight fibers bristling ! out of it. The rods all came from a compact center. They were basically all glowing with a white light and rotating slight lightly and lazily as they floated along.I observed that the black asphalt beneath the light balls was lit as the balls passed over. A couple of 4 year old children practically walked into the leading light ball. The children turned away towards there parents with their arms above their heads and ducking their heads as if something was bothering them (similar to what a child woud do if a bee was buzzing around him). They quickly got away from the light balls. I clearly saw each ball disappear with a poof sound. To someone who didn&apos;t know that stars are huge infernos in the sky such as the sun, would assume that these were stars. The boiling cloud slowed to a normal cumulus formation. It all happened in about 20 minutes. I left about 30 minutes later but spoke to nobody else there about what we had all seen because I didn&apos;t know anybody there. No one approached me either. It was all very pretty but I saw no purpose in it. Has anybody seen anything like this ?", "An EXTREMELY BRIGHT localized flash (within 200 yards from me) that was as bright as lightening but silent.  The light was white and lite an area of at least two city blocks BRIGHTER than day.I can relate three other occasions this has happened in the last 5 years in my presence.  On one occasion there was another witness. On this particular occasion, (11-22-98), it was a misty night and I went out to feed my livestock.  At 8pm it was very dark.  As I was walking to my barn (north) in my pasture, the flash took place to my south on the other side of my house.  The light was coming from ground level, or withing 25 feet or so of ground level near a neighbors house or in the woods behind it.  I estimate it was no more than 200 yards south of my position.  The mist and fog made it possible to pinpoint the source of the light as it lite up a very large &quot;sphere&quot; of the mist around it for as many as 5 seconds, then went out abrubtly.  It was so bright, and the weather conditions seemed so ripe for lightening, that I waited for the thunderclap but it never came.  During the flash there was absolutely no sound coming from it as well. I submit this as a UFO only because it may have been, but I have no idea what it was and I have seen it now three times in the last 5 years, still with no explanation.  Is there any other reports of such phenomenon as is there an easy explanation?  In all locations this has happened, there certain have been indications of power lines, but in no case has there been any sounds, power outages, fires, or any other indication that it was electrical in nature.  And the intensity of the light is beyond any commercially available lighting source that I know of.", "saw what I first thought was a comet or some other object. It looked like a falling star....it was very high up.  I watched the object fall from the norht towards the south and then suddenly it made a sharp almost 90 degree turn.  I have never seen anything like it. It was so high up in the sky that i could not see the shape of the object((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "Noticed red lights to the north of Simi appearing to be in the mountains, girlfriend thought she was seeing Magic MountainObject had all red lights around edge, and hovered for 5min. Then all red lights went out and a few stayed on others blinked making it look like a plane as it went south towards a rocket engine testing sight called Rocket-Dyne, as it got over Rocket-Dyne all lights once again returned as it hovered for a few min. The object appeared to be disc shaped with a sail shaped rotating apparatus on top with lights at the points. This object never made a sound and was no more than 1000ft in the sky. As this object moved south it did so at about the speed as a plane. When it left it did so very fast, looking like a blue streak, you could not follow it, it was gone in a second, still never making a sound. This has been a long time ago, but I still remember all the details, this is really the first time I have had an opportunity to document it. Hoping there are others who witnessed the same object.", "witnessed approximately 1 second of flight of an object unknown to me in the northern hemisphere of the night sky.this is the first time i have completed a report such as this, but i was curious as to what exactly it was that i saw.  the objectwas triangular in shape and had a fuzzy white aura with a green core; it flew east in between the constellations of corona borealis, bootes, draco, and hercules.  it then  literally disappeared within 1 second; like it slipped into a pocket of invisibility.  i was wondering if anyone there either observed the object or picked it up on their telescopes.  i just happened to glance at the sky, myself. i wasn&apos;t even looking. anyways, i took two college level astronomy classes, i otherwise am always looking up at the sky.  i really do not have much experience.  but if someone could get back to me with an identification of the object, i would appreciate it.  thanks!", "while walking on beach, two teenagers witnessed football-field-sized triangular craft over water from distance of approx. 50 feet.In August of 1985 while my family vacationed for a week in South Nags Head, NC, a friend of mine and I watched a triangular-shaped craft above us at the beach one night.  Although I do not recall precisely what week we were there, this incident took place on a Friday night.  I and my friend, both females aged 14 at the time, customarily strolled along the shoreline in the evenings.  I estimate that our &quot;sighting&quot; occurred around 8 p.m., but that time is not absolute. I recall that night as very dark, both starless and moonless.  However, it is possible that the fear I felt after we encountered the craft skewed my impressions of the environment; to be certain of the moon phase, I&apos;d have to check a calendar from back then.  I do remember absolutely that the evening began clear and temperate, with just a few stringy clouds hanging here and there over the ocean.  I was looking down, trying to avoid stepping with my bare feet on the sand crabs that come out at night.  So it was my friend who first saw something odd in the sky. &quot;Do you see those lights?&quot; she asked me.  I followed her gaze, then, and I saw five lights in a tight triangular formation...the center light was red, and it was the largest.  It was flanked on either side by two smaller white lights.  I do not remember any of the lights flashing; they all maintained a kind of focused dull sheen, if that makes sense.  They did not emit beams or illuminate the sky around them.  Together, they formed what we later interpreted as the &quot;nose&quot; of the craft, although we did not at first notice any other lights or even an outline of the craft&apos;s shape because the night was so very dark.  I am guesstimating the craft&apos;s distance from us as about 50-100 feet -- very close -- and about the same distance up in the air from the ocean, but the darkness and the lack of earthbound objects (i.e. trees) by which to judge height/size made it difficult to pinpoint how large or how close this object was. As I looked up, I caught this &quot;nose&quot; emerging seemingly out of nowhere.  In retrospect, I believe that I decided on-the-spot that the craft must have been behind cloud cover because that was the only way I could rationalize its sudden appearance.  But as I said above, what few clouds there were that night were unsubstantial and spaced far apart from one another.  As farfetched as it seems, I have to consider that the craft may actually have been &quot;cloaked&quot; in some fashion and then it revealed itself...?  I feel ridiculous writing that, but I have no other explanation.  It&apos;s possible that my friend and I just happened not to see it until it was dead even with where we stood.  But the enormity of the craft and its apparent proximity to us makes that possibility seem unlikely to me. Regardless of how the lights got there, from the moment my friend and I first noticed them, some inexplicable quality they seemed to give off made us both vaguely uneasy.  I think that strangeness was why my friend had to ask me whether or not I saw what she saw, and it was why I didn&apos;t question her needing my confirmation.  I&apos;m not sure how long it took us to realize that a big contribution to this strange &quot;vibe&quot; we were experiencing was the craft&apos;s utter silence.  It wasn&apos;t merely an absence of engine or other familiar aircraft noise; it was an intense, all-pervasive silence that was eerily powerful precisely because it was so absolute.  It was a consuming silence, the likes of which I cannot recall experiencing in any other situation. I have always remembered that silence and have tried to describe it on the few occasions that I have discussed my &quot;sighting&quot; over the years with friends.  But it wasn&apos;t until I happened to catch a bit of a cable program the other night that I heard another so-called witness state that she had viewed a completely silent airborne object.  That was the first time I had ever heard a UFO-sighting detail that matched my own experience, and it made me snap back to the events of August &apos;85.  I researched online and came across this site; now that I&apos;ve read numerous other reports, I understand that very many people indeed have witnessed silent crafts.  A few have also seen triangular crafts (another detail from my personal encounter that I had never heard elsewhere).  Obviously, I have not made a point of keeping up with ufology!  Hearing and reading some other people&apos;s testimony has encouraged me to share my experience now.  Although I have never doubted the nature of what I saw that night, the content of other witnesses&apos; reports lends credence in my mind to my personal memories, legitimizing them somehow. So I will continue with my report:  I and my friend stopped walking to watch these lights for awhile.  At some point, we became aware of a sixth light.  It was the same color and size as the large dull-red light which marked the center of the &quot;nose&quot; of the ship, and it was straight back from that light.  (Imagine an arrow, designated only by five points outlining the tip of the arrowhead and a single dot at the base of the arrow).  Here is where my friend&apos;s and my accounts differ; one of us thought that the space between the original five lights and this single sixth light encompassed about one football field&apos;s length, but the other thought it was closer to two football fields long.  After all this time, I don&apos;t recall which of us insisted on which length.  Let me reiterate how hard it was to determine size and distance in that environment. Now that we saw the sixth light (it, too, just quietly asserted itself; it may have been there all along, or it may have appeared after the others), we determined that the entire area in between must be one giant craft.  This final light marked the middle of the third leg that formed the base of the triangle.  I know that my friend and I agreed that the ship was triangular and basically flat, but as far as I remember, we couldn&apos;t actually see an outline.  It was like this ship swallowed the whole night sky above us.  I remember just barely discerning the distant horizon break between the dark blue ocean &amp; the deep black sky, and my vision was 20/20 at the time.  So if the night really was as dark as I am remembering, the craft was either pitch black itself or it was utterly transparent. We never questioned that the sixth light belonged to the same craft.  All of the lights moved in tandem.  They slid so smoothly and slowly across the sky that their motion was almost imperceptible.  They moved in the same direction in which my friend and I had been walking, and then shortly after we stopped to watch them, they stopped, too.  After I&apos;m not sure how long, we tried moving forward again, and the craft moved with us.  We stopped again; it stopped again.  I think anxiety started seeping in to me about then if it hadn&apos;t already.  Perhaps the coincided movements were an optical illusion, as when you view a painted portrait from many angles and it seems to always be looking directly at you.  But my friend and I got the very definite impression that the craft was watching us.  We reacted by speaking in low murmurs as if it could hear us, and for some reason I got it into my head that we ought not stand looking at it for too long at a stretch or it would overpower us.  I kept having to shake off a certain numbness -- not so much a physical numbness as a mental one.  It was very easy to fall into a sort of spellbound state as we watched these lights. Eventually, we decided to head back in the direction we&apos;d come from.  I think we were both beginning to feel frightened, but the onset of fear was slow.  We turned and walked back down the beach, and lo &amp; behold -- the craft switched direction, too.  It did not turn; it just moved &quot;backwards,&quot; so that the sixth light -- the second red light -- now became the &quot;front.&quot;  I remember feeling a bit scared, but more giddy.  It was like a game we were engaging in with this strange craft.  Now we stopped and waited for awhile to see what might happen.  My friend felt less anxious than I did, and I took courage from her equanimity at first. I don&apos;t know how long we stood there.  It was probably under 10 minutes, maybe even under 5 minutes, but it could have been hours.  I had absolutely no grasp of time.  I know that I got that numbness again because I realized at some point that my friend had sunk down to the sand and I hadn&apos;t even noticed.  She and I had stopped talking.  The object mesmerized us, or we allowed ourselves to believe that it did.  It continued to merely hover, stationary. After we had watched it for some time, rain began to fall, lightly at its start.  Maybe it was the rain that jolted me back to my senses or maybe I just &quot;came to&quot; again of my own accord, but whatever the reason, I forced my attention away from the lights.  I bent down to look at my friend&apos;s face.  I had to get close up to her because of the darkness, so when I looked in her eyes, we were only a few inches apart.  I remember that what I saw in her eyes sent a chill through me.  She was smiling a strange little smile and her eyes were all glazed over.  It wasn&apos;t like she was totally unresponsive or anything, but there was an unnatural excitement and faraway attitude that she conveyed.  (I should clarify here that we were both very much drug-free).  When she spoke -- something like, &quot;you&apos;re in my way, I want to see them&quot; -- her voice quality had changed, too.  It was then that I understood that what I&apos;d taken for her equanimity was actually closer to her willingly &quot;zoning out.&quot;  That really scared me.  The rain started to fall harder. Then, quite suddenly, the whole craft just took off at a speed that made my breath catch in my throat.  Again, absolutely no sound unless it was quieter than the rain.  The craft went up the beach about a half-mile at approximately a 30-degree incine, and there it stopped near a short cliff.  At first we thought it wasn&apos;t doing anything, but then we noticed that the positions of the lights relative to one another seemed to change.  That was because, as we soon figured out, the craft was turning around.  It did not bank at all -- the nose did not dip down.  The whole craft just turned on a flat plane.  Oddly, as it turned, we could see all of the lights all of the time.  It was as if the inside of the craft were invisible -- we could see the &quot;nose&quot; lights through the &quot;tail&quot; light like no craft was in between.  Yet we had no doubt that there really was a craft in the shape of a triangle, not just disconnected lights.  So I think that the ship must have been very, very flat. Another few minutes went by, during which we couldn&apos;t tell what the craft was doing.  But then we understood that, in a slow, steady, direct line, it was returning -- it was approaching our area again.  It was moving so deliberately and so directly towards us that at first we hadn&apos;t been able to perceive its motion.  Somehow, seeing those lights begin to get larger with the perspective as the craft neared again, my friend and I finally got filled to bursting with a sort of elated terror, and we ran all the way back down the beach where we&apos;d come from and then up a gravel road to our cabin.  The rain was furious now and blinding.  I am not a sportive person, but I ran fast and hard that night with no regard for my bare feet on the rough gravel.  They got fairly cut up from our run. I remember seeing other people on the beach as we ran back.  Being 14, we yelled loudly all the way home, garbled giddy warnings about &quot;the lights!  the lights!  don&apos;t let them take you!&quot; and so on.  People flitted past in a blur as we ran, but I do remember some puzzled looks on people&apos;s faces.  It occurred to me later to wonder whether they even saw these lights at all.  But when I and my friend finally got back to our empty cabin (my parents were out for the evening), we slammed &amp; locked the door and turned on all the lights and pulled down all the blinds -- and as we yanked down the blinds, we kept peering through the windows.  We couldn&apos;t see the lights where they should have been.  The whole run back had taken maybe 5 minutes and we hadn&apos;t checked behind us to see the location of the lights since maybe 2 minutes earlier when the other houses had obscured our view.  Now, gazing through a back window, we finally located the lights again.  Maybe the reason we had gotten puzzled/startled looks from people as we ran was because the craft had zoomed off, far past the area where it had made that no-bank turn earlier, and higher up.  It must have moved very quickly.  The fact that it had flown away again rather than continue to move toward where we had been standing excited us because that &quot;confirmed&quot; that the craft had actually been focusing on me and my friend.  We decided that it had wanted to abduct us and that it nearly had.  I&apos;d still like to think that.  But who knows.", "Greenish blue fireball streaking across horizonI work for a security company operating out of Rancho Cordova Ca. upon arrival on a site to check on a guard he advised me of a greenish blue fireball that appeared as a falling star streaking west across the horizon", "Pair of objects flying side by side.My son (10 years old) and I were driving to our hotel in Tucson after dinner out with some friends.  We saw two objects flying toward us from the SW (moving NE).  Objects were side by side with a single light on either end (?) front &amp; back.  Moving slowly toward us, they came to a stop and one of the objects just sort of pivoted it&apos;s front end out to the side, heading E and started moving again.  The second object did the same and they continued one behind the other to the E.  We stopped the car when we first saw them because they looked so strange and we were on a secluded dirt road.  There was no noticeable engine noise.  My son and I live very near an active MCAS in So Cal and we are very accustomed to seeing military craft.  We have also been to Tucson several dozen times in the last few years and we have become very familiar with the military aircraft at the Davis-Monthan Air Station in Tucson.  My son can identify most any military jet with only a slight glance - he loves them!  But these had him stumped and spooked.  We watched them for about a minute as they disappeared off into the eastern sky.  The way they turned was not at all like any aircraft we have observed.  There was no banking involved.  They just stopped and one of them slid out to the side, started moving E and the other followed with exactly the same kind of pivoting turn.", "I saw a spherical object at a distance.

I saw the picture of the sighting in CA and decided that it was similar enough that I&apos;d send you a report.  THe differences between this and that report are the direction it traveled and the one I saw was not as green, just a green haze around it.

We watched it move across the sky a ways and then it moved up then out of sight. We went inside and then came out again aproximately 5 minutes later.

The object seemd stationary, but would twist around. The profile was very slim, almost cigar shaped. As it spun around, the light seemed to  change from four to three.

The luminous spheres were so bright that it wasn&apos;t possible to determine shape. The three objects were a bright silvery color and followed the aircraft below our altitude in a loose formation. There was no wild manuevering but the objects did ascend and descend slightly. The distance from the aircraft could have been a mile behind us and perhaps 1000 ft below our altitude. I notified the flight attendant and she said she would notify the crew--possibly the crew made visual contact also.  Most of the passengers were asleep at the time. Do not know if NWA flight crew notified air control. I was formerly with North American Aviation/Space Division assigned to a photographic unit documenting the command module tests during the Apollo program.", "I saw a white light move from left to right, back to the left then it dissapered.I was driving down a street that dead ends into another street.I stopped to turn left and saw a quick movment above.I took a second look and noticed that it was not a star when it moved from left to right, back to right then it dissapeared.It was just a little bit bigger than the closest star.I was shoked when I saw it.I thought that all you people were full of it.This site was recommended by friend.", "I was driving by on the road and seen this saucer , it was ON the ground near a house. I stopped down the road and got out to get a closer look. By the way when I drove by I was about 400 feet away. I would estimate it to be about 30 feet wide by 15 feet high. I stopped down the road and walked towards the saucer. I could not see it from where I stopped because of a hill. When I got about 600 feet  away I seen the ground across the field from the saucer light up with a red light. and the light was moving around from a reflection of something  moving. I was looking around to see where this light was coming from because the saucer was NOT lit up on the ground. It had a metalic color. I was looking up and turning around to see where the light was coming from and saw nothing. Then I started to see the saucer rise up from behind the hill it was behind , while on the road I was on the other side of the hill , the side the saucer was on. It rose up very slow and was now glowing a red color. It rose up I would say about 10 feet a second and made NO noise at all. If you were not looking at it you would not know it was there. It rose up to about 350 feet and stopped. The bottom of the saucer was white light with movement of like a turning fan with 3 blades. and it turned about one revolution every 10 seconds. the movement object was not clear it was behind a semi transparent bottom with a grid type support. The top of the saucer I could not see any detail because of the glowing red , it was the entire top surface lit up glowing. anyway I was watching it rise and when it stopped rising I watched it for about 45 seconds more then I decided to run towards some trees because I didn&apos;t know if they were going to abduct me or what. While running I looked over my shoulder to see if it was still there and it was. When I got to the trees I looked and it was gone and still heard nothing.

I estimated the object to be about twice as big as Tampa Stadium. We pulled over and got out to see if we could tell if it was moving,because we were doing 85 across the desert and it was hard to judge it while we were moving.  We stood there for about a half hour looking,pointing and basically freaking out on the fact that we were seeing something that was very obviously way too huge to be man-made. It was a couple thousand feet up in the air and a few miles from us to the south. We saw other cars pull over and other people were standing on the roadside watching it to. We got back on the road and we watched it until dark. We first saw it between 4pm &amp; 5pm. We basically drove INTO and OUT OF sight of the object. We watched it for THAT LONG!!!! While we were getting further into dusk, almost dark, we saw tiny lights in random patterns begin to blink. The lights were not bright at all, but they were visible after it was dark. I was on my way to a trade show in L.A.,coming from florida. The date was tuesday,Jan.27th 1998. I am giving this report on monday,Aug.17th 1998,because I have looked in all of the UFO sighting report sites on the net and I have not found one single report of this event that I and at least 8 other people witnessed.

I am a pilot and I have been around flying craft all my life, I did not recognize this object.  It stayed about 1500 feet in the air for about 20 min moving north and south about 10 degrees.  We were facing east over the city of Carbondale when we saw it.  It then disappered into the blue sky.  About an hour later an F-16 fighter flew down from Springfield Il. and buzzed the city of Carbondale 5-7 times.  I have been here for 3 years and have never seen a military fighter jet fly over Carbondale.At approximately 2:30pm CST myself and a friend were sitting on a couch outside of our fraternity house in Carbondale Illinois.  I looked at the sky to see some birds flying around and then behind the birds was a black object not moving.  It was about 1500-2000 feet in altitude, and about the size of a gumball held at arms length.  We both stood up to get a better look and could not figure out what it was.  We were faceing east and it was about 3-6 miles away from us.  The object began to move from north to south and back, in the sky.  The object was also changing shape.  When I say changing shape I mean it looked like a large rubber bag full of water suspended in the air and the bag was changing shape.  I have been around flying aircraft all my life, I am a pilot, and I have never seen anything like this ever.  To prove to my friend and I that we were not crazy, I went inside to get some othrer people to witness this object.  I brought out 5 people.  They all saw it, some skeptical, but they did admit they saw something not normal.  Then another friend of mine drove up, and stated he saw the object from one of the dorms on campus which is about 2.5 miles from where I saw the object.  The object then disappered into the blue sky after about 20 min.  It was a slow disapperence, it was not a quick bolt out of the atmosphere.  After all this took place, about 1-2 hours later an F-16 fighter jet from Springfield Illiionis flew over the city of Carbondale 5-7 times.  There were several rumors of why the jet was flying around down here, but nothing official ever came out.  The odd part of the jet is that for the 4 years I have been in Carbondale, I have never seen a fighter jet fly around this area.  It just so happens that the military jet shows up shortly after this craft was witnessed.", "we stood on a cliff and watched the skies when a blue fireball crossed the skies at a very high speed.  This was seen again 3 days later.It was about 11.30 pm and we were all going home.  I was watching the skies with my girlfriend and spotted the object pass across the sky at an unbelievable speed.  It sped across the sky covering as far as I could see before disappearing.  It was blue in colour and left a trail behind it. 2 of my friends also saw it and thats when I knew I wasnt seeing things. This was also seen again 3 days later at the same place.  We havent seen it since but then again we havent been to that area since the summer.", "A red glow lighting up low lying clouds. After a few moments the glow got more clear and about a dozen red lights in no noticable arrangment dropped through the clouds and then quickly shot upward.While driving south on Interstate 15 about 20 miles North of St. George Utah I noticed a red glow lighting up a small area of the low lying cloud bank.  I could tell that it was being lite up from above and not below (as city lights would do) and it was also not a very bright light or it would have lite up a larger area. The area that was lite up was about the size of a very large house. I was driving a loaded semi, so it took me a about a minute or two to come to a safe stop. I got out and observed it for about a minute or so. The spot of glow never moved in any direction for the few minutes I watched it. I say this because the glow never moved even up or down because the lighting did not get brighter or dimmer. Then it became clear that the object was lowering itself straight down. The glow became brighter and clearer until it completely dropped below the clouds for about 2 seconds, then quickly went straight up until I could no longer see even a hint of red glow. It moved up about the speed of a helicopter on a quick take off. The clouds were so low that I could have easily seen if the clouds were being disturbed by the wind that a helicopter would have produced but the clouds were not disturbed at all. Leaving me most curious about what propulsion system could produce no push or pull wind. A hot air baloon could have done what I saw if it wasn&apos;t for the lights. This had about a dozen red lights about the brightness of marker lights on planes and seem to be placed in no particular order. I could not see any of the object that the lights were on because it was dark except for the clouds and the glow. The craft ( as I assume it had to be ) was not flat, round, tubular, or anything else that would have a uniform surface around it. The lights were as if they were mounted on something with various surface levels. Like lights would look if mounted on an engine. My personal opinion of the movement of the craft was as if it was peeking below the clouds or suddenly realized it was below the clouds and didn&apos;t w! ant to be. Then took off like a child who has been caught.", "large boomerang shaped craft that glowed an irridescent white light. approx. 4am ..... the 4th week of september........ moving at a steadily rapid speed in a south eastern (out of the north west) direction. approx. amount of time in sight : 30-45 secondsi was alone in my backyard at approx. 4am in the last week of september, 1998 having a smoke. i was gazing at the stars {my usual nightly activity!} when i saw this boomerang type shaped &quot;glow&quot; heading towards the south east out of the north west. the glow seemed to stay in form but sometimes it would slightly shift into almost a striaght line. then back to its original boomerang form. it seemed to have a bright luminous white glow {sometimes a little pale pinkish or pale green} about it. it moved rather quickly and at a steady pace. the glow was like an irridescent type glow though. it was almost like the aurora borealis. i couldnt believe what i was seeing. i know the night sky well. this was like nothing i had ever seen before.", "The object moved up, down, hovered, then left with extreme speed on a huge trajectory up into space.  We followed it on a surveyor&apos;s transit, as did the other family about a mile away, whom dad had me call, as the man was also a surveyor.This is a direct quote from a diary I kept at the time, which I just got back from mom a year ago after dad died.   &quot;April 8, 1968, Monday.  {....I am skipping the first four paragraphs.....}  After dinner I did the dishes and after that I went outside for a cigarette.  At about five to seven I looked up at the sky and saw a strange sight.  A huge, lighted object, quite noiseless, was hovering and swaying over the city to the SoutEast.  I watched it go slowly across the sky, stopping here, going up there, and it moved very slowly.  I was intrigued, thinking at first that it was  helicopter, but then I became aware that there was no nise.  I watched it and I went to the front of the house to have the folks come out.  I had that silly egoistical feeling that the thing was there just for me to see and that it was watching me and reacting to me.  Anyway, before I got too far, it had one large lighted sphere on the bottom and one small one on the top, aparently connected by some metal structure I could only get glimpses of (here I have an arrow pointing to a drawing I made of the object).  It was the shape that intrigued me at first.  As soon as the folks came out, it egan to pick up speed and travel up, and then after about five minutes, like a trajectory it went into &quot;orbit&quot; and disappeared.  But, mind you, the thing was very close to ttown and earth at first and later went up, up, &apos;till it vanished.  Here I want to inject the story Steve, my 12 year old brother, wrote about it.  It&apos;s not quite right, but it inspired him to write and that pleases me very much.  I copy even his spelling. &apos;Steven Smith and family  April 8, 6:45-7:20 spotted a UFO  At aprovamatly 6:45 Mr. Ken Smith (my brother) saw an oblong [here I edited with: not so, but he must not know it - K.L.S.] shaped object hovering over southern Walla Walla.  It was a lumonus object oblong with a smaller light, a foot above it, at first he thought it was a helicopter.  But as though someone in it saw him looking at it put on &apos;full speed&apos;.  It was th! en he notified us, [myu mother, father and me] it was now southwest and moving rapidly.  My father then got his trancit and sighted it.  It was now west and going up!  It was passed the clouds and shining brightly.  They were very thick.  After changing poisition it looked like a &apos;cone&apos;.  The light on top sent rays and shaped a cone.  But we soon lost it.  Now turning from the transit it was found, but going higher, soonit dissappeared but to reapere and then leave for good.  I hope .   Later my broter phoned the FAA and they said no sattilite was scheduled now.  Well, we know its UFO, funny.  it was noiseless, I was expecting at least a beep.&quot;   Written by Steven Smith.   I hope he&apos;ll be inspired to do more writing.  That is right - Dad and I called several government agencies, but they laughed us off.&quot; end of quote from my diary.  I am writing to you with this sighting as it has haunted me for the past thirty years, I think of it often and before I die, I&apos;d like it recorded somewhere besides my spiral college notebook that I used as a diary.", "Diamond Shape Object Glowing incadescent Yellowish, The object was to our front right hovering just slightly below cloud level.  It was about 50 Feet tall and had about 10 beams of white light comming out of the bottom of the lower half of the triangle (Like a skirt)  They were about 20  feet long in length and glowed like Florescent Lights.  The beams were straight but they came out of the ship at a slight angle.  The object moved away and the beams of light disapated as they blew away in the wind.I think the beams of light were generated by some sort of Ionization from the vehicle.  The beams were of almost equal lenghts even though they  were from farther up on the ship.  The light from the moon on the left of us distracted our vision from the right where the diamond was heading. At that time we pulled over next to an off ramp and tried to see where the diamond went to but it was too late.  There were other vehicles on the off ramp backed up.  I don&apos;t know it they was what I saw!  But it was unusual for a off ramp to be backed up at 2:15 in the morning.", "SALL A LIGHT LIGHT UP THE SKI OVER THE HILL SIDE..I WAS HAVE A SMOKE OUT ON THE BACK PORCH.AND NOTEST A FUNNY LOOKIN LIGHT COMEN FROME THE HILL SIDES ACROSS THE VALLEY.I SAW A BEAM OF LIGHT LIKE A FLASH LIGHT BEAM.LIGHTING UP THE HILL SIDE.

The first time I saw it I was driving home from work aroung 6:30 pm EST. It had been dark for half an hour. I was traveling north on 441 about 7 miles north of Gainesville on my way home. I then noticed this orange ball of light hovering above the treeline. It just sat there. It glowed but didn&apos;t move. At first I thought maybe it was a heicopter searching for something, but the more I looked at it I realized it couldn&apos;t be a helicopter because the light wasn&apos;t a searchlight. It didn&apos;t reflect a beam of light: it just glowed. It couldn&apos;t have been a plane or helicopter because there were no other lights on it and no strobes. There are some towers in this area but it wasn&apos;t them because I could see them off in the distance and besides they having flashing red lights on them. I didn&apos;t stop to watch further because I had to get home. It was still in the same place as I watched from my rear view mirror until I was too far away from it to see it anymore. The second time I saw it was about a week later with my wife in the car as well. It was in almost the same spot that I saw it in the last time, but I think it was further north along the road. She didn&apos;t want me to stop and look at it so we continued on home. I saw it again about a week after that. So this time I stopped my car on the edge of the road to check it out. Unfortunately because of the height of the trees next to the road, it blocked my view of the orange ball of light. There was no sound from that spot in the sky. I thought surely I would hear an engine of some kind, but I didn&apos;t. When I got backl on the road I could still see it above the trees until I was too far away to see it anymore. I never reported this to anyone because of the skepticism most authorities have towards this type of siuation.

When veiwed through the scope it became apparent that the object was not one light but rather a group of 7 independent lights.( at this time the lights were all blue and in a triangular pattern they later changed to 4 different colors  ) These light were pulsing at fast rate, and they appeared to be pulsing in some pattern. alternating in paterns of 2 colors at one time.

We witnessed a second object that had only two lights and these lights also cycled through the 4 colors of the first object. The object with the 4 lights was in a northeastern direction, and the 2nd object was in a northwestern direction respective to our position. Distance is hard to judge, but the objects moved away from each other. The second object moved below the tree line, and the object with four lights moved in a hook pattern to a higher point in the sky.

Light reappeared about half an hour after first sighting and was traveling with a fast speed at a slanted angle towards the ground, and dissapeared.On the morning of July 31, 1998, at approximately 4.00 am, I saw a faint light in the sky, that appeared to be a star.  I was alone outside, with the only other person a few feet away, sleeping in a tent.  He did not observe the occurance.  The light was moving, and suddenly it shifted, turning to reveal a brighttness.  It then shrunk back into the smaller light, and dissapeared.  I believe that the object was turning.  At first, I thougth this was an airplane.  I made this conclusion because there was a hum in the air, like an engine.  I figured that the plane would be moving away quickly, and the hum would dissapear.  However, this did not happen.  The hum continued for over twenty minutes to half an hour, when the light reappear, further out towards the hills surrounding the area.  However, this time the light was traveling downwards, at an inclined angel, and traveling at a quick speed.  It moved downwards, and dissapeared.

As my friend and I were talking he interupted and asked me if I heard something. We heard a faint blowing sound but couldn&apos;t tell what direction it was coming from.  At first we passed it off as a strange wind.  However, a few minutes later the sound suddenly became much louder from behind us.

After I took the second picture the object became much quieter and in a flash shot straight up in to the sky and dissapeared. The object was perfectly round with several smaller circles on the bottom of it. These smaller circles were somewhat reflective.  My best guess is the object was no more then 25 feet from one side to the other and about 5 to 8 feet high.  The main part was gloss black and the smaller circles were a peach color. My friend and I both grew up in Colorado and have spent a great portion of our adult lives in the mountains of Colorado.  My friend is a top broker at a leading firm and I own a computer related business.  I have never seen anything like this or have given it much thought.  We both have a lot to lose if this was to get out that we &quot;believed&quot; in such things.  The only reason I&apos;m reporting this is because my wife said it might help me close this issue in my mind.  However, I do not want to let anyone who I am other then my name.

I looked up towards the north and observed what looked like a low flying plane traveling at a very high rate of speed.  But after looking at it for a while I noticed it didn&apos;t look like a plane at all, it was actually two lights on the botom of some craft that bliked at the exact same time, about 3 second intervals.  What was so srtange is that there weren&apos;t any other lights on the craft.  Also  it was going really fast. It was out of sight within 3 min. It traveled along I 80 for about a min. and then took a sharp turn to the north and flew out of sight.  It went towards lake Michigan not towards the airports. It just didn&apos;t look like any plane I have ever seen flying around here, with the two airports (Ohare and Midway) I see planes all the time and what they look like at night, this just didn&apos;t have the normal plane or jet lights.

My brother&apos;s fiance&apos;, my husband and I were all 21 years of age. My brother, sister-in-law, and myself all have IQs above the 98th percentile, are college educated, and are in business administration, mainframe programming, and systems engineering, respectively. My brother, his fiance&apos;, my husband and I were riding around in the county back roads late at night with my brother at the wheel, some fifteen miles from the nearest town. We decided to park the car at the end of a dead end road, a well known spot to the local young people, near the river bottom. Facing in a northerly direction, directly in front of the car was a pasture, then virtually miles of undeveloped &quot;bottom&quot; land covered in timber and underbrush, and used for nothing other than an occasional hunt. As we sat there in the car, talking and listening to the radio, we began to notice a faint glow quite some distance away, which formed a semicircle above the tree line which we were facing. As we watched, the glow began to brighten, and slowly a very large egg shaped object began to rise from the forest at a distance of approximately three to four miles from our location. As the object began to move in a SSE direction (and closer to us), I became extremely nervous and began to ask my brother to leave. Moving very slowly some 100 yards above the earth (judging by the proximity of the 60 ft oaks),  and glowing white much like a huge florescent street light, it had no visible windows, lights, portals, or attachments of any kind. The others in the car at first seemed very curious at this sight, and were wanting to stay and watch it. I, however, was insistent that we leave immediately, and I soon convinced my brother to start the car. In order to leave the area, as we were on a dead end road, we had to travel due east approximately one mile to the intersection, and then travel south back toward town. As we began to approach the intersection, the object had traveled just to the SSE of the intersection, and had stopped and was hovering in mid air for a moment, and then reversed it&apos;s course as if to meet us at the intersection. We were moving down this small, dark backroad at an incredible speed, and as we reached the intersection, the object had almost reached it as well. The only sound that was emitted was a strange, barely audible humming noise. It was at this point that we realized that this &quot;ship&quot; was approximately the length of a football field, and twice the width. As we rounded the corner of the intersection and began heading south, the object redirected it&apos;s course as well, and began heading south directly behind us at a distance of some three hundred yards. I watched out the back window as we sped down the road, all the while yelling at my brother to &quot;Hurry Up!&quot;, and in and instant this huge object literally zipped into the sky so fast that I could not distinguish it from the stars. I continued to look for it, and soon, I watched as it moved slowly in a horizontal direction, then reversed and rapidly danced around the sky in all directions for several moments. I lost track of it at this time due to the tree limbs rushing by overhead. Judging by the size of the object as I had observed it previously, it had managed to ascend to an altitude of some 30,000 feet or so in a split second, without any increase in noise level. The most bizarre part, in my opinion, is that we had spoken about the occurrence immediately after it occurred but after that night I was the only one who mentioned it again. A week or so after this event,  my husband and I had joined some friends at the lake, where they had a small bonfire and party. I was sitting on the tailgate of our pickup and again it was a very clear night. I noticed something move in the sky, and began to tell our friends of the experience we had had the previous weekend. As I started to recount the story, I began to feel extremely nervous, and decided to drink a beer to calm down. As I began to cross the parking area toward the beer cooler, I felt the most excruciating pain of  my life. In mid stride, several yards from where I began, I felt as if a bomb had exploded in my head. I had collapsed on the ground and was throwing up from the intensity of the pain. My husband picked me up and loaded me into the pickup, then drove to my parents house just a few miles away. I laid on the den floor, still sick and in extreme pain, while my father applied ice packs to my head and waited for my mother (a nurse) to return from work. A couple of hours and narcotic pain killers relieved the pain. I didn&apos;t mention the ufo incident to anyone again for over ten years, strictly out of fear. Over a decade later, after thinking of that night again and again, I mentioned something to my sister-in-law about &quot;the time we saw the ship&quot;, and literally watched the hair stand on her arm. She had an incredible look on her face, as she told me that she had not thought of that night since it had happened. She wondered how she could have forgotten such a sight, and shuddered as she relived it. Based on this, I then asked my brother (now her husband), the same question. Again, the same response. In over ten years together, neither of the two had thought of that night until I had brought it up, and then all the details rushed over them as if it had happened yesterday. My husband and I were divorced just thre! e years after this occurrence, and he had never mentioned it to me in those three years. I have thought of  contacting him to ask the same question. I have always had full recollection of  the entire episode, and have remained silent due to fear. I wonder why I remembered and they did not.", "4 bright, platinum white, round lights, were seen on top of a hill.  The lights were situated in a circle.

To the east, high atop a hill, we saw four circular bright lights.  The lights were situated in a circle, and seemed to be stark or platinum white.  They were very bright.  We were not aware of any towers, construction, airplanes, etc. that could be located on the hill.  We parked in our car, along the road and watched for about 2-3 minutes.  We then, went to an intersection where we could see straight down the road, and had even a more clear view of the lights.  They did not blink, they remained perfectly still.  We left.

Within seconds we all saw a glowing green fireball travelling at what seemed a slow pace. We watched it for approx&apos; three mins&apos; during which it made no sound. It was guessed that it was about a mile away from us. The object travelled horizontally (east to west I think).

When we went outside on the balcony to have a smoke, we noticed a beam of light behind Kapiti Island. This is not necessarily unusual as sometimes Sea and Rescue Searches with Helicopters produce similar visual effects. However, standing there arguing why S&amp;R was called out again, we noticed that the colour of the light changed from the usual bright white to an alteration at low frequency of a dull, surealistic green and pink. Slowly, the source of the greenish light appeared to rise from behind Kapiti Island. At this stage, we could not make out the body of the object emitting the light nor could we hear any sounds. The objects movement appeared to be relatively slow. When the light changed to pink, we briefly noticed that the source of the pink light was positioned behind the source of the green light making a huge squshed cylindrical object in front of it visible for a couple of seconds. Unfortunately, the pink beam of light and the object in front of it synchroneously set slowly behind Kapiti Island. The whole spectacle appeared to last a long time, but judging by the length of the cigarettes we smoked, it whould have had been lasting for less than one minute.", "Multi-colored sphere shaped object observed in western sky for approx. 30 minutes, the first 15 minutes or so in a stationary position.First observed at about 11:40pm pdt in a stationary position in the western sky approx. 40 degrees above horizon.

I could see the general shape and colors but it wasn&apos;t close enough to make out any other details.After a few more minutes, it began moving slowly in a northwesterly direction and lower on the horizon until it disapeared out of sight.

The object was four times the size of the north star &quot;Polaris.&quot; It was at least 10 times brighter than the brightest star in the sky. At its brightest moment it appeared to have the structure of a cross which bulbed out at each end. It traveled N.W. to S.W. at a consistent speed and appeared to be floating, instead of being propelled across the sky. Between 7-10 minutes later, as it approached the South West, it came to a complete stop for about 10 seconds. Then between 5-8 smaller objects began to fall out of the larger object. The smaller objects which fell out of the larger one fell for 15-25 seconds.  Each object that fell from the larger one, fell straight to the earth for 2-3 seconds and then another one would fall. The smaller objects were extremely bright and moved at a high consistent speed. After each of the smaller objects made their way to the earth, the bigger orange object became less bright.  After the last small object fell, the larger orange object dissappeared for a split second and then re-appeared brighter than before.  This is when the cross shape structure of the object was visible. It remained at a dead stop for a few seconds and then dissapeared completely.My girlfriend and I have just recently moved to the Charleston area from Denver Colorado.  She was raised in Atlanta and I was raised in Denver, Colorado and Seattle Washington. She has been living on the Isle of Palmes for about five months.  On November 7, 1998, we had just returend from dinner.  It was between 21:50 and 22:00 when we both noticed a bright orange object in the North West.  There was no clouds in the entire sky. It was about four times the size of the north star and at least ten times brighter.  It was a bright consistent orange light and it never changed color or brightness until the end. It moved towards the South West, traveling very slowly at a very consistent speed.  It appeared to be floating instread of being propelled.  It made no sound. We watched it float across the sky for at least five minutes before it came to a complete stop in the South West sky.  It stayed there for about ten seconds. The stop was extremely sudden and abrupt. After about ten seconds, smaller objects began to fall from the large orange object. They fell for about 15-25 seconds and there was between 5-8 total objects that fell from the bigger one. They were very bright and fell extremely fast. Each small object fell for about 2-4 seconds and then another one would fall.  Each time a smaller object would fall, the orange object became less bright.  After the last small object fell the orange object dissappeared for a split second and then re-appeared brighter than before.  At the objects brightest moment, it appeared to have structure.  The structure resembled two perpendicular bars that bulbed out at the end.  My girlfriend discribed it as two dog bones perpendicular to each other.", "Green FireballI was driving southbound out of Renton, before the 212 exit, when I saw a brilliant blue-green (mostly green with a hint of blue.) ball of light with some yellow at the end of the tail.  It was much bigger and much much brighter than any star, but smaller than the moon (maybe 1/6th to 1/8th the size of the moon.  It looked like a bottle rocket except it was green and the angle wrong.  It was traveling from East to West, coming down at about a 45 deg. angle.  It lasted about 3 to 4 seconds.  It looked like it landed in north Kent.  It had all the characteristics and trajectory of a meteorite except it was a little slow for a meteorite, but I think that may be explained if it were moving toward or away from me.  It did seem to be low in the sky (I could see it at the top of my windshield and it ended up about half way down on the right side. I have seen one or two like it before in my life except they were not green.  It did not do anything funny like stopping or changing direction.  I think the green comes from copper material in the meteorite burning up.  My final conclusion:  It was a meteorite.  Probably the most spectacular one I&apos;ve ever seen, certainly the most colorful.  When I got home about 2145 I called my flight instructor and told him about it.  Then I turned on my radio about 2218 and tuned into the Art Bell show and heard you guys talking about what I saw.", "Speed Walker on Mt. Rainer came out on que.James said, &quot;Should we use the Dr. Greer meditation?&quot; half joking and I said, &quot;no, they already know we are here.&quot;  We were outside on the mountain at 10:30p.m.there was a full moon and no clouds.  We were using our binoculars and night vision and were looking at the stars in the night sky. A large light slightly brighter than a large star which had been sitting motionless for a half hour suddenly, started moving from N.E. to S.E. at approx. 45 degrees above the horizon We had been watching planes fly slowly by during the evening and knew immidiatly it was a UFO.  We have seen ufos many times before so are familar with their flight pattern. From a stopped position it speed up three or four times faster than the planes or jets that we could see in the distance.It varied its speed slowing down and speeding back up for about ten seconds than James who had been looking at the ufo with his binoculars took them down for a quick readjustment.  I looked at my night vision scope in preparation to looking through it.  This took about one second for both of us to make these adjustments when we both looked back to our amazement it was completely gone from the center of the sky a distance that would have taken a plane about ten minutes to travel.

At this point, the two balls of light merged into one, and approached the cliffs.The first yellow, glowing, ball was seen heading north from the Mexico border, leaving a bright trail behind. I looked around, from a bench on the cliffs, to see if anybody on the cliffs or the pier below, saw the bright ball approach. Now looking north, I saw another yellow glowing ball, between myself and the pier, making a steep decent, then leveling out momemtarily, then rapidly decending behind a house, and down into cliffs below. I am certain that the second ball of light hit landfall. The first glowing ball was now hovering 1/2 mile out over the ocean directly in front of me. The second ball rose up into view again, hovered, then slowly flew out to join the first yellow ball. The strange thing about these glowing balls, was that they seemed to stay the same size no matter if they approached or flew off. The two yellow balls became one while hovering directly in front of the bench I was on.

While trying to keep track of where it was in the sky I called out to a family member to quickly come and look at the object.  We both stood in the door way looking at it for a few seconds.  The white circular lights on each of the points then independently converged in toward the center while the object was still, as a whole, moving to the right.  It then faded out of sight. There was no sound and I estimate that they were a couple miles southwest of Idaho Falls.

A discernable craft flew directly overhead and proceeded to disappear over the horizon at low altitude. There was no sound and viewing conditions were optimal.We were moving harvesting equipment from a remote field back to the farm. While driving  I had observed 2 orange fireballs in the southern and 2 in the western quarter of the sky. A cold front had passed through earlier and viewing conditions were optimal.  The fireballs were distinctly orange, had a definate round shape, did not move, were all of the same appearent size, and faded quickly after about four seconds.  There was no pattern to their appearence; 2 were seen at the same time to the west. I could see only a small area of the sky while driving but saw these while driving for only 15 minutes. The fireballs were approximately the size of the full moon, about half a degree of arc.  After arriving at the farm on the prairie at 9:15 PM I asked the other drivers if they had seen the fireballs but no-one had.  We scanned the sky and noticed a very bright light to the SW low to the horizon. It was a point source but did not appear to be moving.  I determined that it was not a planet because it was south of the plane of the ecliptic.  We observed it for a while until  we realized it was gaining altitude.  It soon resembled car headlights about 2 miles away and was at about 15&deg; elevation.  At this point it became evident that it was an aobject moving directly at us and maintaining altitude.  I remembered I had my Pentax with a 205mm lens in my truck a started taking pictures.  The object flew almost directly over our heads.  It had 3 bright white lights that were visible from all angles. There was a white light on each side with the center light  slightly ahead of the other two. There was also a cluster of green lights in the center of the object with one or two red ones intermixed.  These lights were very faint and did not blink.  There was no sound whatsover. As it continued to the NE the white lights were still dominate but there was also faint reddish lights visible from behind.  We eventually became bored with the event an left the property about 9:30PM with the object still visible above the horizon.  We were treated to 2 more orange fireballs in the west as we left.  My cousin says he returned to the field at 10PM and saw the object again.  I recall an incident in April of this year just a few miles to the north of this sighting that I saw the same lights (the rear aspect) at about 10PM along the same flightpath as abseved on 10/1.  I had lost sight of them as they moved behind a neighborhood house.

At the same moment, I saw what at first appeared to be a fast-moving jet moving from NNW to SSE. Because of my location, I could only view about as much of the sky as the equivalent of twice the width of my hand held at arm&apos;s length. The object crossed this section of the sky in less than two seconds (possibly as quickly as one second), only long enough for me to barely open my mouth to draw attention to the others sitting with me, but not long enough for me to utter a word. What surprised me about the object was that it was very dark compared to other jets in the air that evening (dark grey) and the way the &quot;wings&quot; met at a right angle, giving the appearance of a carpenter&apos;s square flying through the air. There was no fuselage visible. I thought it might be a very large, very fast jet flying at very high altitude or a smaller, slower jet at lower altitude. I observed other jets crossing the sky within the following quarter-hour and, even though some were quite some distance away (i.e. viewed at 45% from the horizon or less), I could clearly make out their fuselages in all cases, they were much lighter in colour than what I had observed earlier, their wings did not have the distinctive right-angled proportions or even width from fuselage to tip, and they travelled at much slower apparent speeds. There was no sound from the object (not necessarily surprising if it were in fact a very high aircraft), although I could hear most of the other aircraft I observed that night, even the high, distant ones. Anyway, it made me curious, and I&apos;ve been closely watching a lot of aircraft for the past few days and nothing I&apos;ve seen in the air even closely resembles what flew over on Sunday night. The object&apos;s flight path struck me as rather strange, as most commercial aircraft fly either more-or-less on east-west lines in this part of the country or northeast to southwest if they&apos;re overseas flights. I&apos;ve never seen anything flying on so nearly a north-south axis (although this might be a good route for commercial flights from Russia or military craft returning from the far north).", "A friend of mine and I where in the woods camping and we kept seeing this bright light that would come on and go off so we went out of the tent and looked around and nothing so we sat outside the tent to see if it would happen again. So about ten minutes later a bright light shines down on us so we looked up at the source and here is an aircraft about 50 feet above us that is maybe about the size of a football field and a half and it looked like it was made out of metal rods and had about three different inclosers and the spot light on the bottom so it stayed there for about five minutes stupid us didn&apos;t have a camamera or anything to take a picture and then it took off at a high rate of speed.

It had 4 lights in front, a bright light underneath, a wavelike column of yellow-orange light in back.Last year, on July 2nd, on the 50th Roswell anniversary, I was at my pond with a friend. We saw a very bright light, which looked brighter than Venus, in the Northwestern sky. It was 21:30. It was very high in the sky, and looked like a very bright star. We observed it as it got closer. By 21:40, the sky was dark, the aircraft was very close to us. By that time, we could see 4 lights, two on each side of an inverted, very broad V. The lights looked like the headlights of two cars flying sideways. We could see the air move around the lights, like you can see the air move over a hot road in the summer. The aircraft came down right over us, it was barely over the fir trees around my pond, maybe 100 feet directly above us. There was absolutely no noise, except for a barely audible hum which seemed to encompass everything. There was no noticeable air movement. The aircraft was going very slowly, maybe 20 or 30 mph. At that point, we could see its underside: it was rectangular in shape, light colored, and the very bright light we had seen earlier was right underneath the middle, lighting itself more than the ground. We could see two wings, the tips of which barely went beyond the rectangular underside. The whole aircraft was very large, at least as large as a large commercial airplane. As it started going beyond us, we could see from its outline against the sky that it was triangular in shape, probably dark in color. The back of the aircraft had a vertical column of yellow-orange light. The light moved up and down the column in a seamless wavelike pattern. The pattern was not regular, and when I told my friend that it looked more like a language of some sort than a simple aircraft lighting system, at that very instant, the pattern changed completely. After that, the aircraft started going back up and disappeared behind a hill. I tried to report this sighting to one local newspaper and one TV station the next day. I wanted to find out if anyone else had seen it. I got some chuckles and I did not insist. This year, on July 2nd also, I invited my friend for a sky-watch evening. She could not make it, but 2 other friends came. The sky was perfectly clear. Around 21:30, we saw a very bright light in the South sky, just as I was describing my experience of the previous year. One friend pointed to that light and asked: &quot;You mean to tell me this is a UFO?&quot; Within 2 seconds, the light was gone. It just faded away. My friends went home. Later that night, at 23:00, I went to pick up my daughter from town. On the way back, I saw the same bright light, closer than before, I showed it to my 14 year old daughter, and it was gone before she had a chance to see it. Around midnight, I went outside and saw the same bright light close-by in the Northwest sky. As soon as I concentrated my attention on it, it disappeared. 10 mn later, I looked out my bedroom window and saw the light again in the Western sky. I went to get my binoculars, pointed them at the light, it disappeared. I went to sleep. I am a 49 year old female, and I grow grapes and aromatic plants. I also teach plant propagation. My female friend who saw the large aircraft with me is an herbalist, as are the 2 other friends who saw the lights with me.

I was facing towards the Northwest and suddenly something streaked across the sky directly above my position.  It was heading in a Northeast to Southwest direction.  The sighting was very brief, maybe a half second, as the object moved very quickly.  At first I did not think much of what I had seen.  After further consideration of the event, I began to realize that I could not figure out what it could possibly have been with any certainty. When I had originally sighted the object, my first thought was that it must have been a shooting star.  I then rejected this idea as it did not &apos;burn and spark&apos; as other shooting stars that I had seen in the past.  The object had been, in fact, rather dull in appearance.  It had no luminescence to speak of and my best guess is that it was only illuminated by ambient light from the ground.  There are streetlights and other less intense light sources in the immediate area.  The night was clear and visibility in the sky was quite good.  The moon, if I remember correctly, was low on the horizon and not full.  I do remember that whatever the moons&apos; aspect, its light did not interfere. I had been rather pleased by the clarity of the stars and this is why I had been looking skyward in the first place.  Dirtectly behind me was a streetlight that was approx. 120 feet away and I had faced away from it in order to see better. The best way to describe what I had seen is to say that it appeared to be a small orb or disc that was a dull, metallic color.  It had no external sources of light and did not emit any noticeable sound.  There was no trail or glow to the object.  As I had indicated previously, it appeared that ambient light was reflected from the object.  It looked rather dim/dull and was only visible for a brief instant.  This leads me to believe that it was travelling very low to the ground.  I had considered that it may have been a bird or bat.  I dismissed that notion also as its velocity was far greater than any bird or bat I had ever seen.  I also briefly thought that it may have been a airplane of some kind.  I again rejected that idea as the circumstances and my perceptions of the object strongly refuted this.  There is alot of low-flying air traffic in this area.  This is due to the nearby Air Force base and small commercial airport that share runways.  Mostly they are rather large commercial and military planes with a few small, private planes and jet fighters.  However, the vast majority of the air traffic are large planes.  The Air Force base is part of the Strategic Air Command. The only other information that I can provide is that, by my estimation, the object covered 30-40 degrees across my line of sight.  The object appeared very suddenly and had disappeared just as quickly.  This reminded me of something flying low and only visible by ambient light from the ground.  The object moved in a very straight trajectory.  This is the best and most accurate description that I can provide of the events and observations on that occasion.  I do not completely rule out any possible explanation to what I saw that night.  I can say that, whatever I had witnessed, I am perplexed and had never seen anyhting similar.", "Luminous, green, round sphere of light moved across sky from S to WSWObject appeared to the South at 30 Degrees above the horizon, moved in a slightly downward curved line across SW quadrant and abruptly disappeared beyond the 3,500 ft MSL Oat Mt., 4 miles to the West just slightly above the visable mountain skyline.  The object moved at constant speed and looked like a round glowing sphere, green in color with no distinguishing marks. The color was light green and looked similar to the bio-luminescent green light sticks the kids use on Halloween.  The diameter appeared abount ten times Jupiter and brigter than the Moon. The Moon was full, due South, close to Zenith with Jupiter just to the West, sky was very clear. Just before disappearing (.5 sec) a second smaller sphere appeared just in front of the larger sphere. It traveled at the same speed, with the same glowing green light at about one fifth the size.  The objects moved much faster than any jet or prop plane, but slower than meteors. There was a slight hint of a tail but I&apos;m not sure if that was just my eye&apos;s retina persistance. I have worked as an engineer in the aerospace industry for 25 years. I have extensive knowledge and experiance in Astronomy, Optics, Electronics and Astro-Physics having designed Earth, Moon, and Sun sensors, star trackers and Star Magnitude Photon Detectors for use on communication and spy satellites.  I regularly observe and am familiar with the local flight patterns around Burbank airport to the SE and Van Nuys to the S.  There were at least 3 planes to the S and W. I have 20/10 vision and no color blindness. I have seen a few large meteors (comparable to the above object) that appeared to have some visable diameter but they usually have a tail with visable fragments that persist for up to several seconds.  I have never seen a green one.  Maybe burning copper?  I was the only witness and was observing from my house at N34 23.400&apos;  W118 29.350&apos;  1200 ft AMSL", "Good day: This evening at approximately 9:00pm in Scottsdale Arizona I was driving eastbound on Sheer Blvd. at 110th street, my attention was diverted to the sky at about a 40 degree angle vertically and 30 degrees horizontally.  What I saw was what appeared to me as a shooting star, the object resembled a shot from a roman candle that was what I judge as about 10 times that in diameter.  It appeared at the area that I described and traveled at a high rate of speed in a strait line towards the horizon and appeared to be traveling in a descending northwesterly direction.  This lasted about 1.5 seconds and the object disappeared at about 10 degrees above the horizon.  The object did appear to have a slight bluish or greenish tint and was quite bright.  The tail seemed to have the same property of a comet as best as I can describe. The object though appeared to be at a great distance from my location, but still appeared proportionaly large from my perspective. I thought this interesting, mentioned it to my girlfriend who was riding with me.  She had not observed it.  I thought nothing more of this until listening to The Art Bell show this morning at 3 am, and heard the reports from Seattle from Mr. Peter Davenport. I felt compelled to report this in some manner.

He saw a green glowing object like a fireball with a long &quot;tail&quot; moving rapidly west to east across the sky.  In less than a minute it disappeared behind a small cloud but never reappeared.  Please see the report for 11/2 also.  He said it was like a comet, but too bright and too low to the ground. There was no sound.", "Adamski type craft visible for 5 mins 500&apos; above Swatara Creek. Portholes, red light, ion-blue glow on bottom. Craft accellerated into beam of rainbow colored light after interceptor jets from Olmstead Airbase gave chase.On our way home from work, we passed under PA turnpike on Middletown Rd heading south. I saw a red light on an object in sky on left (east) side approx 15 degrees elevation. I am a private pilot, so I knew the object was not a plane or helicopter. To get a better view, thinking it might be a saucer, I pulled the car over and shut off the engine and lights. I rolled down the window and observed a saucer shaped craft. Once I knew what it was, I got out of the car to get better view of object. The saucer hovered motionless above the trees and over the Swatara Creek. The saucer had cupola on top. There were portholes emitting a bright yellowish glow that bathed the top of the saucer. The bottom of saucer had an ion-blue glow.  I observed solid red light (no other lights) on top - very bright, casting a red glow over top of cupola. I looked for silhouettes in windows but observed none. Craft was as big as thumb held at arms length, maybe 1/2 mile distant.  Est size of the saucer was 30&apos; in dia. Sky was overcast. Clg was 1500&apos; or more. Visibility was two miles or better.  Temperature was approximately 55 degrees.  I remember it was damp.  The sun had set and the sky was almost dark. The saucer was positioned 1/4 mile from my residence. I was a little scared but elated, too, because I knew that this was a really rare event.  I wondered what would happen if I waved.  Would it move?  So, I mustered my courage and waved at the saucer and sent a mental message out, &quot;Peace be with you!&quot; but there was no response. My wife said she was too cold and told me to shut car door.  I asked her if she would get out and look at the saucer. She didn&apos;t believe me and said it was just a helicopter. While we argued about that, I heard a roar of jet engines/afterburners from Olmstead AFB across the Susquehana River. When I heard the sound, I saw the saucer dart from my 10 o&apos;clock to 11 o&apos;clock instantly. There was a yellow flicker in the sky from the west as the jets got closer. After two seconds, the saucer darted back to the same position it was in before, only 250&apos; higher. I thought, is it trying to triangulate the position of the jets or get out of their radar beam? Then, the flickering in the clouds and the afterburner noise got very loud. The west side of my sky started to turn yellow, they were so close above the town of Middletown. The saucer had had enough. It shot up at a 70 deg. angle instantly, leaving a rainbow colored trail behind as it went up through the sky.  The jet&apos;s never descended below the clouds, but turned upwards to chase futily after the saucer.  In a minute, the light and sound had faded. I stood for a few minutes, waiting to see if they would return, but they didn&apos;t. I got back in the car with my wife and drove home.  I decided not to report this incident because I knew that the military was involved in a cover-up and feared reprisal and did not want my life interfered with at that time by the government. Years later, I saw the pictures that George Adamski took of his saucer. That was the same saucer I saw. How could what he saw be a fake if what I saw was as real as the car I was driving home in? The chasing of the craft by the AF jets validated my experience for me.  There were no reports in the local papers anytime thereafter. It would be interesting to try to use FOI Act to obtain information from any records kept by the AF from Olmstead AFB during that time period to see if there were any evening chases of an &apos;unknown.&apos;  I do not, unfortunately, remember the exact date of the event, except that it was a week-day because we were coming home from work. The location of the sighting was a few miles from Three Mile Island.  The famous TMI reactor meltdown occurred there the following year.  Was this a coincidence? I think not. In the last 22 years, I have not seen another UFO. Feel free to contact me if you have any additional questions.", "Late night summer of 1979.  Three triangle shaped craft.We were playing outside in the summer of 1979.  There were four of us ranging in ages of 7 to 12.  It was about 9:30pm.  We saw 3, totally silent triangular shaped craft either hovering or moving too slowly to have been any kind of conventional aircraft. One was very low in the sky.  It seemed to be lower than the tree tops.  It was probably at least 50 feet across.  One was illuminated by the moon and had a rounded or bull-nosed edge.  Metallic to dark silver-the color of hemotite.  the other 2 craft seemed higher up, not smaller, just fur- ther away. They moved from east to west very slowly. My brother shined a flashlight up at one, that&apos;s how low it was.  Each craft had bright white lights on each corner and a reddish orange one in the center, that appeared to be flashing.  The sighting lasted for approximately 15 minutes.  We were children at the time so we were not taken ser- iously by our parents and never revealed this to anyone else...until now.", "white fireball w/blue tail going streight down. lit up the sky and trees. the fireball was 1/32 the size of full moon. the tail was 4x the full moon, and was electric blue color and very bright blue and very bright.I was going to work northbound on 151 across lake Keystone at 511 am  on 11/16/98 sw of Tulsa Ok.  when I saw a bright whight fireball at aprox. 075 deg. going almost streight down.

I then saw that the object had two lights. I retreived my binoculars. The two lights were at the ends of a cylinder. I watched the object until my view was obstructed by trees.At 20:45 (PST) on 04-September-1998 I observed an object in the sky travelling in a northwestern direction. At first I believed the object was a satellite. As I watched the object I noticed that it had two lights and not one. I quickly obtained my binoculars so that I could observe the object more clearly. Upon doing so, I noticed that the two lights were at the ends of a cylinder-shaped object. It was difficult to make any other details of the craft out as the magnification of my binoculars are not that high. The lights on the object were about the color of a star and did not blink as you would find with aviation lights. I observed the object flying in a straight line with no sound. the object appeared to be travelling at a slow pace then seemed to gain in speed. I watched the object until my view was obstructed by trees in the area. It is difficult to say what color the cylinder was, it appeared almost transparent, yet it appeared solid. This is not the first time I have had a sighting in this area, to date this is my fourth.", "A sighting of 2 types of craft over a two week period.I awoke on the first night around 2:00am, I looked out my window on the warm evening and observed two objects in the sky that seemed to hover and did not move like planes.  They circled each other a few times.  After a while I became very tired and had to go to bed. The next night I set my alarm on purpose to see if they came back, and was not disappointed, I observed 3 objects this time, 2 boomerang and one oval I was prepared this time with binoculars and a stand made out of LEGO to support it.  I watched the objects through an open windoe (without a screen)  Over the rest of the 2 weeks I observed the objects about 10 out of the 14 days.  I observed a pattern that seemed to support the idea that they were looking for something.  The area they were located in was beside a cliff that led to the Bow River, just down from a church.  Some of the things I was able to observe between the objects was a sort of &quot;static electricity&quot; bolts as the objects came close together.  The oval objects had a brighter band around the middle.  Most curious was that the objects seemed to remain the same sort of yellowish colour, sort of like reflection off the city lights.", "There were 4 this time , My neighbors ran over to my house beating on the door , I ran outside and everyone was pointing up.They were moving at a high rate , from west to east , till out of sight . aprox.3 min .In this formation    (  .  :  . )  and then split off to a row of 4 , then two disapered , then only 1 could be seen .It was over as fast as it began .

On 7-18-98 at  about 10:02 PM Mountain Time (04:02 Universal Time) as my family and I drove west away from the Wal-Mart store in Longmont Colorado we spotted a craft flying from the southwest of our area and moving northward across our field of view.  It was moving slowing and in a slightly jerky manner and this caught my attention.  It seemed to have a great many red pulsating lights with some white lights in the central area.  At the time I wondered if it were a helicopter.  It descended toward the Longmont Airport, but it did not follow the usual flight path and was actually going down toward the farm fields just south of the airport.   We lost sight of it behind trees as we drove and I forgot about it.  About 5 minutes later (about 10:07 PM) we were driving north toward the west end of the airport when we spotted a craft that looked like the first one.  We assumed it was the same one.  The craft looked like a very large plane ascending from the west end of the airport.  It was moving slowly and was large enough that as it crossed the road ahead of us the lights on the front passed over the farm fence west of the road as the rear lights were still well toward the east of the road.  The length appeared to be 50 to 60 feet.  As we drove up toward this seen we assumed that this was merely a very large plane.  The airport normally handles small twin engine and single engine aircraft.  Thus, we eyed the craft as it slowly flew over the road about 50 feet above the ground. I commented that it was lit funny because it seemed to be box shaped in that the rear had at least two red lights one above the other, and the front of the craft had two or more red lights in a vertical column.  In the middle area were other red lights and some white.  All four of the four people in the car continued to stare at the craft  on the West side of the Airport as the car was greatly slowed.  The craft ascended slowly toward the west to about 120 feet above the ground and about 1300 feet west of the road.  Then it appeared to stop! and hover.  At no time did the lights change direction and the craft at no time banked or turned around.  Because the lights did not change their orientation we continued to assume that the craft was still going west even though the craft was now growing larger.  Suddenly we realized it was headed back towards us, it having never executed a turn, and it was ascending as it moved back toward the airport in a slight northeast direction.  It came very near the rear of our car (from 160 to 200 feet).  No airplane motor noise was heard - at other times we have heard the engines of smaller craft passing over the road.  It passed over the road at about 170 feet above the ground.  As it neared the road three people in the car saw that the craft was shaped like a triangle with three equal sides.  The leading point was facing the northeast in the direction of its movement.  Many new lights were seen on its bottom hull.  Along each of the two side angles there ran long tube like lights, like neon tubes, that were a yellowish-white.  These tubes curved inward near the west end of the craft and came to sharp points. Just east of each was a large round red light and toward the west two more red lights.  Near the apex of the triangle, the east tip, was a large round recessed hole in which was a bright light-blue light.  While the red lights had been pulsating earlier as the craft was moving west, now all the lights were continually on with no blinking or pulsation.  The lights provided enough illumination to allow the viewers to see that the craft had a dark triangle hull.  We quickly tried to pull over onto another side road to we could get out.  We saw the craft move silently toward the middle section of the airport area, just north of the runway at about 350 feet above the ground.  Then the craft changed course and moved northward until it was hidden by trees near us.  We drove to another location where we could see the surrounding area but the craft was no where in sight.  AT this point it was about 10:12 PM Mountai! n Time. It appears that as the craft lifted off from the airport grounds toward the west it was moving with the flat side of the triangle toward the direction of its movement.  It then stopped and hovered a moment as it lifted the east tip of the triangle and reversed course in a slight climb back over the airport grounds.", "I saw a green phosphorous light in the sky west from Vancouver Washington, and a bit to the south, appearing to drop with a very slight northwestern angle.I was enjoying some raccoon company from the hot tub. The direction I was facing is southwest.  A very bright phosphorous green light attracted my attention as it appeared in the sky southwest of Vancouver, WA and came down to earth quickly in what I think was a northwest direction.  The light had a slight northern slant (almost vertical) to it and was visible for three to five seconds.I am not sure whether it just abruptly left my area of vision or whether the treetops obscured my view. The light was a very bright phosphorous green. I don&apos;t believe that it was a meteor because of its slow speed. My immediate thought was fireworks but it was too large and didn&apos;t go UP in my field of vision because I would have seen that, too.`", "We had just finished playing hide and go seek, my neighbors and I.

It was a fairly solid light source, with another smaller light at the rear of the craft.  It was about an 1/8 to 1/10 the size of a full moon, and seemed to be fairly low, about 1000-1200 feet.  It was moving north by north west, at an average speed, compared to commercial planes in our area from the Nashville terminals.  This object was a solid light, though, so I was interested in it, and I took two or three camara shots of it.  When the object was nearly due East of my position, it seemed as if it grew or swelled in proportions.  It dimmed, and an object with running lights exactly like a plane shot out of it, the new object hovered in position to the East of the first object, then began moving to the West.  When I next looked to the first object(I was taking photos of the second object)it had reversed it&apos;s course, and was rapidly losing altitude.

It was white like a star but as it zoomed away it&apos;s color seemed to shift towards yellow or light red.", "It was a red light in the north west sky. it rose very slowly for about three minetes and then droped down flashing red and white.To slow to be a meteor and way to fast to be an airplane or helicopter.

Inside the outline of the shape was an equal shape but a darker brown.", "I went out and saw this cigar shaped object, high above, about where the sun would be at 12 o&apos;clock. I stared at it trying to identify it, but could not. It was moving slowly westbound, at (my estimate)about 25,000 feet. I went in to get my binoculars, but when I came out, it was gone.As I mentioned in my summary, this object was not something that I could identify. It seem to have some metallic components because it did reflect the sunlight. It also had a strange movement, like drifting and yawing at the same time. What amazes me the most is that it was not there when I came back, about a minute after. At the pace it was moving, it should have been there still. I immediately called the San Juan Flight Services Station, to find out if they had seen something in the vicinity with their primary radar. They offered me your number instead. I place a call and left a message in the answering machine, but I erroneously reported the time of the event as 1605Z, instead of 1805 which is correct. I later called the San Juan Center (CERAP) to check if they had any information that could confirm or explain my sighteen, but they said it was difficult to check their recordings and data bases and to get something usefull from there. One more thing, the object was in the vicinity of the Dorado Beacon (DDP) which is an NDB used as reference for IFR flights inbound to Puerto Rico. I am a private pilot and I can tell you, what I saw was not an airplane or a rotorcraft.", "In backyard, looked up admiring sky and saw bright lights moving.My brother and I were in my backyard enjoying the great weather. My brother looked up and saw something. He told me and I looked as well. We saw 12 bright objects in the sky, moving.I grabbed my video recorder and stated taping them. They moved around as if the wind was moving them and also deliberatley in straight lines. Sometimes there would be a couple that were stationary and one would move away from them. My tape has also been viewed by a retired air force pilot and he said they are definately ufo&apos;s.They were appx. at 85 degrees up toward the north east above the cascade range. This is no joke.", "orange nocturnal lightThis happened when I was a young child. The date is based on a similar report I read about in Kevin Randle&apos;s _The UFO Casebook_(p. 141). My mother, grandmother, and I had stopped for dinner in El Centro, CA, and were westbound on I-8 when we observed a very bright, orange light to the north. Soon, the object began to emit a cloud of smoke or vapor, which was greyish- white. The light &quot;blinked out&quot; and then came back on several times during the sighting (I don&apos;t remember exactly how many times), leaving the cloud hanging. The light was stationary (yet it seemed to &quot;move with us&quot; as we travelled down the freeway) and was approx. 20 degrees above the horizon. My mother and grandmother were panicking, I was was very scared at one point and hiding my eyes; it was then that I heard them exclaiming that several smaller lights were emerging from the light, flew around it, then returned to it. Unfortunately, I myself did not witness this.  Finally, the light went out permanently and the cloud dissipated. One strange feature of this event was that our car was being tailgated by a semi during the duration of the sighting, rather relentlessly (I remember we were in the slow lane the whole time, but don&apos;t recall if my grandmother, who was driving, tried to &quot;shake&quot; the tailgater at any point by changing lanes). I&apos;m posting this primarily to find out if anyone else was a witness to this, even though it was long ago.", "One object--thought was satelite.  Flying high alt.

We were looking for satelites so it was flying at a high alttitude in the area we had already seen satelites in.  It was traveling roughly E to W at extreme speed-crossing the sky in just a few seconds. From the object came a brilliant light flash of 1 sec duration and another 5-6 seconds later of the same duration-then the object completely vanished 10-15 degrees before reaching the horizon.

The other 2 women looked &amp; started screaming for their kids to come out.  I was a child of 7 when I flew out the back steps and saw a huge spacecraft take off straight up and disappear.  My mother, aunt, and neighbor were shaking and running in all directions. The women were in their 30&apos;s and 40&apos;s, sane women, and the neighbor&apos;s husband was in politics in Redbank, NJ. They ran up to the local grocery store and heard other people had sighted UFO&apos;s that winter on the beach.  At that time Long Beach Island was scarcely populated during the winter months. In June, the season had not quite started. My mother &amp; neighbor are now deceased, but my aunt is still alive, and lucid.

It just went out about 60 deg above the eastern horizon. It left no trail and it lasted approx. 4 seconds. the size of the object was approx.1/2 the width of my thumbnail as I held my hand out at arms length.  I am a former Airforce airways communications specialist. I am 65 years old and am in good health. It was moving too fast for an aircraft and too slow for a meteor.", "Very intense light moving and changing course rapidly causing cars to pull off highway and stop. All lights shot into sky getting smaller and smaller until so far away you could not see.On my way to Mount SAC college from Costa Mesa in the early evening, my ex-wife and I where on the 57 highway going about 60 MPH. I was distracted by a very intense light by the horizon on the hills where ther are no houses or roads. This very intense disc of light made is way over the side of the 57 highway and was causing cars to start pulling over to side of the road on both roads. It would come closer and lower and then go back up and farther away. It took me about a minute to stop the car and get out. By that time it was gone. The way it disapeared was very strange. It shot up into differnt spots in the sky that were not to distant, however; Every time it would move it would go from a complete stop to an increadable speed in an instant. It would also go from an increadible speed to a complete stop in an instant. At the end it seemed to break up into about 8 distinct balls of light that were many miles up in the air. I am very good with estimating speed and acceleration of jets and rockets. I would estimate that this object must have accelerated to a speed of 10,000 MPH in a fraction of a second only to come to a complete stop and accelerate again on a vector that was in the opposite direction. I know that this was not any aircraft or lightning. I know many others had seen it. I have recently stopped mentioned it to people, because most people either dont care or think that I am not correct.", "It had 3 points of light forming a triangle. There were 2 more lights side by side near the center and front within the triangle shape. It flew in northwest directionI was laying out on my sundeck looking at the stars. It was just after midnight and the sky was mostly clear with some high cirrus. As I looked up I saw what I thought was a satellite, except it seemed to be moving almost twice as fast as the average satellite. It only took a fraction of a second for me to realize that there was more than one point of light moving across the sky (as described above). The three points of light that made up the main outline of the triangle were a dull reddish-orange colour and about the same size as most of the smaller stars that make up the night sky. The two other lights that could be seen from within the triangle were a white light but were no larger and only slightly more intense than the outer lights. These two lights were quite close together and located on either side of a central axis extending from a halfway point  at the base to the apex and closer to the front of the craft. I could not see any of the usual running lights associated with typical aircraft ie. (port and starboard lights and the bright pulsing  central light).  As it moved across the sky in a southeast to northwest direction it seemed to me that there was no substance to this shape, as if it were held together by strands of wire, with the leading light pulling the others in tow.  The colour within the triangle was exactly the colour of the night sky, and there was no dark siloette, and no reflected light.  It did make a slight sound as it passed overhead but, the sound was not far behind which seemed odd considering the speed it seemed to be travelling at. It was not as loud or delayed as even the highest jetliners that fly over.  The best way to describe the size would be to say that across the base of the triangle it would measure about the length of an average human thumb extended to arms length, with the two sides being slightly longer than the base. I was the only one in my family to see this although my wife and three children were all sleeping beside me. I tried to wake my wife but the duration of the event was so short that she never had a chance to roll over.  I am 45 years old and I have been married for ten years I have three young children and I live an otherwise normal and routine existence.   I have my own design and construction business and my wife is a recreational coordinator.  We own our house and live in a suburban neighbourhood.

My 14 yr. old son ran to me from the back area of the Pony( we had just finished hosting a holiday show/barbeque) and excitedly described the same object that one of the band members &amp; I had just seen. We all kept searching the skies when the object rose very slowly from the north side of Convention Hall. It hung in the air for approximately 15-20 seconds before moving, what looked like, west.

He stopped the car and got out and saw a saucer shaped object to the northwest of us. It was dark while a red light was on located on the bottom in the center. When the red light went out there was a glow coming from a circular area out from the center. This glow was greenish-blue in color. We stood next to the car for about 2-3 minutes watching the object as it was stationary directly above us. It did not wobble, there was no sound or distubance to indicate a propulsion. It then moved to the east following hammerly Road. It went over a Parking lot at Wirt rd. and Long Point Rd. where there was a carnival being held on the parking lot. It stopped over the carnival as if it was watching. We could see the lights reflecting off the bottom. It then started moving east bound following Long Point rd.

With the binoccular I was able to determine an oval shape.  It was not a convetional aircraft, it could have been a balloon based on it&apos;s shape.  I could discern no further details of the object itself. While viewing the object a jetliner passed in the same viewing area directly overhead flying south to north. From my perspective, it seemed the jetliner had to also see the object.  The jetliner appeared to be 16-20 times larger than the object. A short time later, another object of similar size and shape flew across my viewing area directly overhead. It had a heading of NE to SE.  It approached the first object, and went past.  Speed was similar to the rate the jetliner passed. A startling observation for me was the very limited viewing field where I could see the stationary object.  If I left the cover area to an open area of the same deck, I could not find the object in the sky.  If I returned to the hammock and looked straight up I could see the object solidly.  The difference of shade and light surrounding me could be the cause of this effect.  I repeated this several times, until I was convinced near the hammock was the only place I could see this object. I then went to get my video camera.  Laying on the hammock, the object was too small to show up in the view finder.  That discuraged me from shooting tape. I figured that if the viewfinder couldn&apos;t see it, I would probably have nothing special on tape. All of this ocurred over about 30 minutes.  In that time the stationary object had drifted only a couple inches south relative to my deck shade. Finally, I just quit looking and went back to my other activities.", "Light green ball, the size of one quarter the moon, when the autumn moon is at twelve o&apos;clock, traveling in a due north tragectory.

Then the object began to shift to the East at a very slow rate at the same time it&apos;s glow was changing from bright white to some what of a fireball color. it changed directions several times. I took a picture of it with my digital camera while a second jet airliner was crossing the same vicinity. I&apos;m not sure what it was but I could almost make out a Spherical object just hovering. Please get back to me on this Image that I took of this event.As I said before the object appeared to Spherical in shape while glowing brightly, I noticed the sun&apos;s reflection of the jet was sort of bright but it wasn&apos;t nearly as bright as the object I was observing, and the object appeared to be much more further away than the jet. That&apos;s why I was at a loss for an explanation. It was so bright and there were no clouds in the sky, It was Sunny out. The way it changed directions was very awkward. It was very subtle but quick. When I took the picture I thought that was enough of that. To my surprise when I get home all I see is A bright Blue sky. Then I started changing the Contrast of the JPG and Zooming in and to my surprise, and out of all that blue sky appears this glowing object again, round in shape with a very strong bright energy glowing from the center. I&apos;m not an expert. You be the judge. Please get back too me.", "Noticed singular exceptionally bright light which appeared to rotate around a soild oval or disk shaped object, bottom of which was faintly visible. On closer examination, the object was either revolving with a single light or there was a row of lights flashing in sequence.While driving north on rt 5 in Waldorf, on the left, I noticed out of the coner of my eye a single light that caught my attention.  I started to slow down and noticed that there appeared to be more lights that were flashing in sequence from right to left. I then looked closer at it and could only see half of what to appeared to be round. I saw also a faint u-shaped bottom to a solid object.  After I looked more closly at the object the lights sped up the sequence in which they had started with.  The lights had sped up so much that it became one continuous blur of lights, all lights were bright white.  The number of lights I saw was 6.  After what seemed to be a lifetime, but was only about a minute, this object was gone.  No sign of anything ever being there, nothing.

I often watch the sky as i am interested in the stars and I also like aircraft. I looked up at the sky and saw what i could only describe as a line of lights, there were 6 of them and the 2nd light was brighter than the rest, they were spaced out unequally behind each other and the last 2 were very close together, all of them had a varying brightness, there was no noise. I immediatley thought that these were 6 satellites. But after talking to someone they told me it couldnt have been satellites. This was definately not an aircraft, the lights were too far apart and of a different colour and brightness. they were moving in a South to North heading.

Object was in a flat horizontal projectory. More information can be found in depth at the URL above.UFO Spotted on Mt. Baker, Washington (September 12, 1998) UFO Skywatchers from several parts of the United States gathered this year at Mt. Baker&apos;s &quot;Snowline Inn&quot;. The group was gathered for the yearly rendevous at this location where organizer, Tom Sanger, of Arizona, had his UFO experience in 1988. He and a buddy were hiking near the US-Canadian border when they were closely approached by a UFO. Oddly, the ridge closest to the UFO&apos;s position is called the Pleiades. Since then, Tom has gotten a group together every year for the outing to Mt. Baker. This object was clearly seen by ten people that were in our party and 4 others that were set up farther away with telescopes. It initially approached from west to east traveling approximately 7,000 miles per hour, according to retired Air Force personnel in our party. Far too fast to see through binoculars or telescopes. It was clearly visible for 5-10 seconds before it faded out. Interestingly, it was on a horizontal trajectory and not arching as a meteor would. The UFO had an orange corona as something traveling very fast in the atmosphere. It was the size of a pencil eraser at arms length. Distance was difficult to judge in the darkness, but it was between Mt. Baker, and Mt. Shuksin and at about 15 degrees. Last year, several residents of the area reported bright green lights over Goat Mt. and what appeared to be a large round circular area &quot;cut out&quot; of the snow. The area is only accessible by air or walking. There are no logging roads to get up there. The &quot;cut&quot; was on the northern slope where there are no residents on the other side to see it. Local deer hunters ran across it. Shortly after, black helicopters were seen in the area flying over the area of the missing snow. No mention was ever made to anyone in the area as to what this might have been. After we observed the UFO, the moon rose and shone brightly. We could clearly see a dense fog rolling into the area making it impossible to see any further. We opted to leave. In the 8 minutes it took to get everyone going, the fog was so thick you could hardly see the one in front of you. The road was twenty miles of winding hairpins. That combined with fog was more than we wanted to chance. We took off down the road slowly at first. We passed only one car coming up. Our driver, a lady from Arizona named Tina, was sharp eyed and spotted Owls in the trees alongside the road. She stopped and we shone the flashlight on them. They stayed put. We saw about four of them on the way off the mountain. Were they really owls? One might wonder.... The following morning at breakfast, we spoke to the driver of the car that was coming up the mountain. She said there was no fog when they got to the top. Amazing, since it was only 20 miles, and they were almost to the top when we passed them. This fact and that our driver could spot owls in the trees on a treacherous road at night in the fog was just totally amazing. If Tom has this next year, it&apos;s a must go for me! You can&apos;t spot them if you don&apos;t look for them! If you want to take part in it, email me and I&apos;ll put you on the list. Your mind is like a parachute. It only works when it is open!", "Strange bright, white light with 4 other smaller lights. All in a diagonal row.I went out to fill the dog bowl before going to bed. I saw a bright light out of the corner of my eye. I just thought it was the moon. When I turned around I saw a very bright light high in the sky. I was looking east from a small town outside of San Diego, California. I have seen bright lights before but none this bright. So I went to get binoculars. At first, the light was just bright and blury. Then I steadied myself against the house and this is when I saw something very strange. Starting from what would be one&apos;s lower left corner of a screen there were smaller lights (star-like) that were spaced apart. There were 3 of these smaller lights in a diagonal line which started at the lower left corner of view and moved up to the higher right side of view. What appeared to be right next to the 3rd light was the larger bright light. Then, still going diagonally up to the right, there was a 4th small light. It was like a perfect line. I didn&apos;t know what to make of it. I tried to capture it on video but it just shows a blurry bright white light. The smaller lights wouldn&apos;t show up on the lens with the zoom all the way out. Anyhow, I have never seen anything like this. I use the Internet a lot and decided to type in a search for anything that would give me a place to tell about this sighting. I found a site with links that led me to this page. The objects did not move at all. I don&apos;t believe it was alien, but then again I don&apos;t have a clue what could it could be. The 5 objects were aligned in such a perfect line that it is not something I think is common to see. The distance from earth that these objects appeared to be must make each of the objects very far apart from each other. I have no clue about the stars and systems in space. Maybe the bigger bright light was a satelite that just happened to be in alignment with a row of stars. If anyone has seen similar or knows what this is, please let me know. I am just curious. I have never seen anything like this. And as I write this, it is still visible. Thank you.", "Twinkling lights, oval shaped craft, no sound, hovered for 45 min.

She lived in Hoopa, a sort of Indian resevation in northern California right near the Trinity River. At around midnight she looked out her bedroom window and saw tinkling lights in the shape of an oval just hovering near the western ridge of the valley.

They were black with no lights or markings.I was taking my morning walk around the hiking trails on my property on the morning of Tuesday, Dec. 1, 1998. It was 7:10am. (07:10) As I was approaching a clearing near the treeline I heard a familiar sound that I have heard several times of birds swooping down making only the sound of air passing their wings. The sun was just starting to peek over the hills behind me. It had not yet shined on Mt. Konocti directly across the lake from where I was waiting for what I expected to see, birds. Instead of birds, I saw four objects flying in close formation. They were black in color. They had no visable lights or markings. I have to guess their size to be approx. six feet across the wings and equal in length. The fuselage was round and pointed at both ends. The wings were narrow in relationship the the fuselage, located in the center and were pointed at the ends. The wing span was maybe just a little wider than the length of the fuselage. I heard the swooshing sound about two or three seconds before seeing the objects. They seemed to have flown down the ravine that I had just walked down and was flying just above the tree tops. Immediately after first seeing them, they leveled out and flew in a straight line out over the lake toward Mt. Konocti. Buckingham Peninsula extends out into the lake at the base of the mountain. They flew to where the peninsula is, then the one on the left made a smooth turn to the left. The other three wobbled just a bit as if they were not aware that they were to turn left, then they too turned. They flew in front of the mountain where it was still dark. Because of the darkness they blended in with the mountain and I lost sight of them. I waited to see if they would reappear in the light of the sky to the left of the mountain, but they did not reappear. From the time I first heard the familiar sound to when they flew out of sight, was about 6 seconds. They flew in a southwesterly direction before they made their turn. At that point, they were flying south across the face of the mountain.", "The craft hovered over a neighbors home.The object was  circular, dark and the bottom of the craft appeared to be hollowed out or scooped out and dark.

It had no lights at all, and moved without any sound.  It just a big black object that was heading south about 100 feet in the air at a slow steady pace.

As I watched one meteor directly overhead, the meteor trail crossed the path of the object. The object appeared to be triangular in shape, with three hemi-spherical projections from the bottom.  Imagine three silver ballons with their stems tied together.  It was about the size of ones thumbnail if held at arms length, or the distance between any two of the three stars that make up Orion&apos;s belt.  It&apos;s leading edge and the leading portions of the projections seemed to be reflecting the pinkish color of a nearby streetlight, or possibly the glow from Austin, but it did not seem to be creating any other light of its own.  The wind was a dead calm and it made no sound. It was moving extrememly fast.  I approximated that it would travel from horizon to horizon in about 10-15 seconds.  I saw it first when it was almost directly overhead, and watched it for about five seconds before it was obscured by a house.  During that time it travelled N-S along a line from Polaris passing roughly between Leo and Orion. I felt it might actually be three silver ballons that someone had let go, or possibly a set of weather balloons, but the object was moving very fast and the wind was a dead calm.  I continued to watch until 3:00 AM but saw nothing else except meteors. I am an amateur astronomer with a degree in Physics.  I am very skeptical about what I saw, but I have no explanation.  I have to count out normal balloons or weather balloons due to the extremely fast movement of the object and the lack of any wind whatsoever.

I said something like &quot;Woah!&quot; and my friend looked up to catch it just as it was going past. It seemed to be an egg shaped thing, travelling very very fast and it was glowing green/yellow in colour. It appeared to leave a trail behind it which was also green/yellow. The trail didn&apos;t remain fo any length of time so it may have been just the light from the craft leaving a trail because of its speed. There was no noise at all. It appeared to be quite high in the sky, but not high enough to be any sort of plane or shooting star. It travelled in a very straight line, unlike shooting stars which fall rather than fly.

I then made a right on Placentia. The light was now about a half a mile away and now moving north at a rising 30 degree angle. It was heading towards March AFB. I finally got home, told my parents and my sister to come and see the UFO. When they got out side the light was moving slowly up.  The light was, at the most, four miles from us.

It was before bedtime, and for some reason I was looking out the front window.  I was wide awake, and I did not have a fever that may cause hallucinations.  The way my memory retains it, I saw a large pink house floating in the sky.  It was glowing.  I recall passing out or something to that effect.  There are other memories, such as seeing a small man in my room at night...and I remember thinking it was &apos;E.T.&apos;. I kept the memories in the back of my mind for years. I have other memories from high school, that inolve me lying in bed and having the strange feeling that the &apos;pink house&apos; was coming back. I saw a movie called Communion during my freshman year, and was terrified of the image of the being.  This perplexes me, being someone who likes monster movies.  I just turned 21, and all of these memories have just started to come together.  I recently read the book Communion, and had a strange experience.  When I got to a part about what the author refers to as &apos;screen memories&apos;, a vision of the &apos;pink house&apos; popped in my head and my entire body went ice cold.  I was paralyzed; stunned.", "I was sitting on the deck of the Best Western Hotel at Savannah and I saw a streak across the sky with flames trailing.I was sitting on the deck of the Best Western Hotel at Savannah and I saw a streak across the sky with flames trailing. TV news later reported that a meteorite was seen.", "Bright Green blazing ball passing from Northeast to Southwest burning out before the horizon.I was driving on Southbound I-5 and just passed under the 23rd Street Bridge in Everett, WA (between exits 194 and 195) and suddenly out the top of the vehicle windsheild I observed a bright green ball with a brighter center pass throught the sky.  It was trailing faint red sparks.  I believed it burned out before reaching the horizion as i continued to follow the trajectory after it wnet out to see what would happen nothing did but I had no horizontal reference point so it may have passed over the horizon.  The direction noted at the time was Northeast to Southwest.  The altitude upon sighting was extremely high and then it lost altitude as it moved to the Southwest from the Northeast.  The range from inception was just South and an undetermined distance east and it moved considerably down range during the sighting.  As for the altitude and range estimations no Earth visual clues were availible.  Immediately upon seeing this object I noted my watch as 9:11 Pacific Daylight Savings time. The object itself:  Since there was not a frame of reference the exact or reasonably estimated size object is unknown.  The object was large and the green light probaly could have illuminated clouds if they had been around.  The color was bright emerald green.  The center of the ball was almost bright white/green and it was about 20% of the diamter of the object.  The object also trailed a sparky red tail that was about 2 times longer than the grren ball&apos;s diameter.  Interesting to note is that I was driving at about 60 mph and the object was spotted out the top of the windsheild.  I wonder how far it may have traveled before I started observing it.  Also interesting there was no noise from this object.  Bacground on the author.  B.S. Civil Engineering from University of Washington.

Its shape was disk-like and hung around approximately 20 minutes.  My friend had been looking at it approximately 2 minutes when he finaly got my attention.  It seemed stationary, then moved southeast very slowly.(about the speed of an hour-hand on a analog clock.It was about 1138hrs. when my friend from the warehouse next to mine brougt my attention to something in the sky.  His first words to me were ,&quot;What the hell is that!&quot;  I looked up and saw a disk-like abject in the shy directly above Mount Baldy here in CA.  It seemed to be at a very high altitude and was turning so that the sun reflected off of it.  At that point, we both saw a small black dot with a dual jet-stream following what appeard to be a small black jet-fighter.  The object was moving at a speed of no more than an hour hand on a analog clock.  It was then when we called Edwards Air Force Base.  They got irritated when at our call and asked why we called them.  They also stated it was a, &quot;Metalic weather baloon&quot;, and told us to call the FAA. I did so and the official gave me this address.  It might be important to add, that my friend saw it at 1500hrs. but this time, while trying to get my attention, said it just vanished: also, I saw another fighter, or what seemed to be.  That is about all I can think of.", "Several light&apos;s reported seen in the Sky over Scotland,on the West CoastAcording to a local radio ( Century Radio )of Sunderland England.

And then as we got up to the beams, even longer, it was off the side of the freeway, we twisted are heads up as much as we could, following the beams, and we then saw this large triangular shaped object, like an arrowhead, with round corners, silver, with three large oval shaped white lights on each corner.  The two beams, which were not very wide but very noticable they were so bright, were coming from the center of this object.  It was just sitting there as I saw from miles back the two beams, they were not moving.  I do not know if anyone else on the freeway saw it.  I know the area, it was in a residential area.  I have not heard any other report on it, so I do not know if anyone in the area has seen it.  It seemed to be able to make itself not so obvious.", "This was observed while driviing north on US 31.

I am saying the object emitted other objects because it emmitted the tail.I don&apos;t know what a meteor&apos;s size would be normally so maybe this is typical- I  myself have just never seen anything like it.", "saw a glowing sphere with a tail shoot across the sky from the West to East (from US toward Atlantic Ocean)I was sitting on a boat on a dock on Isle of Palms, SC talking to my boyfriend.  He was sitting on my right side. We were facing south looking down the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway. While talking I saw something that looked like a shooting star but 100 times larger. I looked at it in awe, with my mouth open for a good 3 seconds. I didn&apos;t speak, I just elbowed my boyfriend until he looked at the object. By this time it was directly above us.  It came from the US went directly over our heads and rounded down toward Isle of Palms and faded out. We both thought were going to see some type of explosion or something. It was extremely close to Earth.  Looked like it was going to land. The sphere was about the size of a basketball. the sphere glowed yellow and had a red glow around it. It also had a very long tail about ten times the size of the ball.  The tail was red where it met the ball and faded out to blue toward the end of the tail. From the red it turned to orange to yellow to green to blue at the point, or end of the tail. This was the first time I had ever seen anything like it. I didn&apos;t know to report it. I work at a television station and asked our meteoroligist about it and asked his opinion on what I saw. He did some research and had no idea. Then I witnessed the same type of event on Sunday, October 4th. The next day there was a small little article about it then the day after that there was a bigger article with your phone # and address.((NUFORC Note:  Similar report from same source, and in same location, for the date of 10/04/98.

We didn&apos;t think too much about it until last night (Sunday, November 15, 1998 approximately 8:30 pm), when I saw another white-blue flash to the north again.  This time, I was standing in the kitchen and saw it out of the window.  It was almost identical to the one the night before and appeared to be in about the same location.

Behind it was a streak of what looked like smoke approx. a hands length if you held out your arm all the way above you and looked at your hand.

Objects were first seen from the southeast about 75 or 80 degrees off the horizon.  The objects were redish orange in color and appeared as square shaped light through a 6X spotter scope on a 4.5 inch relecting telescope.  The objects were not abreast each other in a perfectly straight line. At one time, one object fell behind and then quickly caught up to the formation.  The two sets were close to being in line with each other at a distance of 8 to 10 lengths of a single formation. The objects continued to move at a constant speed toward the northwest.  The two formations then separated at about 70 degrees off the northern horizon; one direction unknown, the other moved west and the formation appeared to close in on its self, but still abreast one another.  The objects could be seen with the naked eye, and appeared as fuzzy or hazy lights, not sharp like that of a star. The objects then appeared to fade or diminish in intensity as they moved westward. The object were obscured from view by trees and could no longer be followed.

The light from the explosion lit as far as I could see and it really did seem like it was 12:00. Unvoluntarily, I was &quot;escorted&quot; back to my bed and pulled my covers over myself and rolled back into the fetal position that I normally sleep in. Immediately, I was able to control myself. I lept from bed and called my ex to see if he had a clue what I was talking about and I also confronted my family about the bright light. No one else had noticed a thing. The main things I remember was that the UFO was about the size of my fist, perhaps a quarter of a mile away from me, it was white/yellowish and at impact it emitted a brilliant white/blue light that sent a kind of &quot;hot flash&quot; through me as it shined. I remember not being able to move and being forced to watch this occurance. The night sky also seemed to not have any other stars that were visible either. The moon was also not visible, but when I was able to move, reappeared. The stars never reappeared. Colfax is a forest setting and the UFO grazed the treetops in its descent.

At approximately 10:45 p.m. on June 22, my fiancee and I both noticed a strange speck of light as we stood on the ledge of our second story apartment.  The light behaved in a bizarre fashion, moving at what seemed to be incredible speeds in a zigzag motion back and forth.  It would disappear into some trees for a moment then reappear.  The entire episode lasted until 10:50. In are attempt to give this moment a rational explanation we both ruled out the following: The object did not appear to be any type of aircraft due to it&apos;s bizarre flying behavior, nor was it a search light because there was no ground source projecting it. I am writing this to the National UFO Reporting Center in the hopes that there may have been others that had witnessed this strange event.  It may be possible that the object was picked up on radar at our local air port though I could not obtain that information at this time.

No lights or windows  were observed  they reminded me of enormous baloons but could not tell if they were metallic. I was driving taxi at that time and went to work  not making a report but telling a few of my friends about it ,    of course no one had any notion of what it could have been, but several years later in casual conversation with a sranger the subject of UFOs came up and he told of seeing the same thing at the same place except he was observing from highway 395 heading south into Minden (at least 2-3 miles out in the valley.", "Blue-green fireball appears, lighting the ground all around.

I was coming toward the pool when I noticed 3 lights above the pool that didn&apos;t look familiar to me.  I figured that when I got closer I would be able to see what they were.  As I kept getting closer they started moving off to the right.  I noticed that there were a lot of dogs barking very wildly at the time.  As it went off to the right it also began coming in my direction.  At this point all I saw were 3 lights because it was so dark out.  I started to walk into a field off to my right in order to get closer to it and it began to go off to tward me.  It was very low in the sky and I could see it lean toward me.  I was no more than about 200 feet from it.  As it leaned toward me I could see a disc schilloette(sp) around it.  I then got scared and stopped in my tracks.  It then slowly went back away from me and floated out of sight.  I went to the house of a girl I knew in the neighborhood and told her about the incident.  She said that about the same time their german shepard dog started barking very wildly for no apparent reason.  At the time I had been reading some UFO books and remembered that many times when a UFO was present, dogs would start barking wildly, possibly due to some ultra sound that humans could not hear and dogs could.", "I work a Chas.

It flew at very high altitude and was going in a southeast direction.

Then it proceded to almost make a complete change of direction in mid-air and took off in a northwest direction, climing rapidly until it disappeared.", "Triangular shaped object moving from north to south.  Object was barely discernable from the night sky.  Leading edges faint orange. No lights or sound.I was outside in my driveway lying on my back in order to view the evening meteor shower.  Suddenly, I noticed an odd looking triangular shaped craft moving at the speed of a commercial airliner flying directly overhead.  It was very faint, barely discernable, had I not been attentively focused on the stars I probably would not have noticed it at all.  The object obliterated any starlight behind it as it silently glided from north to south.  The leading edges of the object had an eerie faint orange glow.  No lights were visible on this craft.  I often watch the night sky and must say that I have never seen anything quite like this.  It was exciting to see.  The object moved behind a tree and I jumped up to see if I could reestablish a visual contact.  As I expected, once the visual contact was interrupted, I was not able to focus on it again. I did notice the red light of an aircraft in the vicinity but probably at a much lower altitude than the object.  This aircraft certainly was not in pursuit of the object and was moving almost perpendicular to the object trajectory. I called the sighting in shortly therafter to the National UFO Reporting Center.  I was quite surprised but at the same time elated to find myself speaking directly to Peter Davenport, Center Director.  Having heard him speak in the past as a special guest on the Art Bell Show, I recognized his voice immediately.  After phoning in the sighting, I returned to my post, hoping to see more, but there was nothing but stars once again.  I thought about what I had witnessed, and wondered if I would ever see something like this again in my lifetime.", "Saw triangular craft approaching from horizon from the N.W., approached slowly, silently, and low to the ground.  Passed directly over our car as we drove west on I-40.  Very large - 200-300 feet long, with circular thing in front on bottom.  Saw beamwork, tubing, ducts, wiring, lights.My husband and I were travelling on I-40 westbound from Alburquerque, New Mexico toward Arizona.  We were approx. 30-60 miles west of Alburquerque at approx. 11:30 pm when I sighted a lighted object at the horizon line, northwest of us. I guess I must have noticed something unusual about it, because I became fixated on it.  It was triangular in shape, with lights.  I remember at least three lights at the point of triangle at front of craft and one on each back corner. It approached silently, at a very slow steady rate.  I continued to stare at it, and the next thing I knew it was gliding directly overhead, over our vehicle and I-40.  It was huge - I would say 200-300 feet long, and very low to the ground, about 3-5 telephone poles in height from the ground.  I could clearly see the underside of the craft as it was illuminated.  It was so big as it passed over it blocked out most of my view of the sky.  I watched it by looking directly up through the windshield.  It now appeared an elongated octogon-shape (rectangle with corners cut.)  I was viewing the underside: There was a large circular thing in the front center, beamwork, ducts, tubes, wiring of some kind. I would say it was dark grey or black metal.  As it glided across the highway heading southeast, and over the car eventually obstructing my view, I then looked through the driver&apos;s side rear window to continue watching it....but it vanished!  Completely!  I looked and looked, all over the sky--nothing!  I continued to be alert and watch the sky as we drove that night, but never saw it or anything else unusual again. I should clarify that I was a passenger, sitting in the front seat.  My husband was driving. I am sending sketches of what I saw via e-mail. Reactions:  I had totally conflicting reactions to this event.  The craft appeared mechanical in nature (lights, beamwork, even rivets) so it could have been some kind of military craft.  HOWEVER...the craft was moving at an extremely slow speed. I would estimate my husband was driving about 60 m.p.h, and the craft was moving slower than that.  It made no sound that I could hear.  What is even more bizarre is that even though I viewed it approaching all the way from the horizon, for several minutes, and I strongly desired to tell my husband to look and pull over I did not. I did not say anything. I just watched it!  There were other cars on the highway, and I could not believe they were not all pulling over and freaking out.  They were all just travelling like everything was normal.  Then it disappeared right after it went overhead!  Something 200-300 feet long just disappeared!  I was completely dumbfounded, and just remember continuing to watch the sky for the duration of drive that night. Although I thought I remembered saying something about it to my husband after it passed by, he had absolutely no recollection of the event at all, and said he did not see anything that night, that he must have been concentrating on driving. I think I did not bring up the subject and describe it in detail to him, including drawing a sketch, until we were in Florida a month later.  How could he have NOT seen something as big as a football field fly directly over our vehicle that night, even if he was watching the road? If it was some secret military craft on a test flight, why would it travel over a major interstate slow and low to the ground, with lights and in plain view?  I can&apos;t reason this through, and my reactions were definitely out of character.  It has been perplexing me for a long time, and I&apos;ve always wondered if anybody else on that highway that night also saw it. So I decided I should report it.  I am now 33 years old, female, married, own my own small business, have a bachelor&apos;s degree, and currently live on the west coast. I wish my memory was clearer so I could remember more details - I am capable of drawing and wish I could offer more information.", "I was at the window when I saw a yellow bright light then I called my mom  and we stood there watching  the strange light.Then a helicopter appraoched and the light turned off.Then the helicopter went back again  and the light turned back on  but in another direction then the light  turned off. That was the last time I saw that light.The object was a light a very bright light that didn&apos;t move till it finally turned off and that was the last time I saw it then it looked like it had landed on a mountain far away from Phoenix", "Three Objects Looking Like Planets Moving in fast and odd directions:My wife and I were sitting out on the deck enjoying the nice nite weather. My wife noticed what she first thought to be Mars and we both looked at it. I noticed a second object and this one had a moon above it. All of a sudden, the moon started to move around what we thought was a planet, and darted off southeast at great speed and  upward towards 11&apos;O CLOCK. Then the craft it was orbiting took off after. Still the first object remains in the same position. About 15 to 20 seconds later it shot off going straght back, also at a fantistic speed. As we continue to look in this direction, the third craft returns traveling back to the same position wtih another one following or chaseing it. We had a tele-scope out at this time. My wife manage to get these two ships in view and we both saw as they departed the one following had a row of three lights across it, this one flew off again to the southeast as the other shot back in the direction it came from. The objects were redish-orange in color and round in shape. In the telescope the one viewed was cigar shaped with three white lights. This all took place in the seaside town of Sea Ranch, California.

I was looking to the south when I saw a super large ball of light with a tail 3 times longer that sparkeled. It was traveling due south. I have never seen anything as big or bright and so low following the horizon. It lasted 4 sec. I then turned to my husband and asked him if he saw it. Which he didn&apos;t . It was a clear night .", "My Dad and I were driving down the street when I looked up and saw it, it was huge, it had a triagular top and bottom with revolving lights around the centre.  We stopped and watched it as it flew just over the top of the trees, it moves very quickly and made the sky very bright. after it had dissappeared my dad and I got back in the car and raced back home to tell momthe night was clear, we were driving down the old dirt roud when we saw it,the UFO was tiangular on top and bottom with a circular centre, with lights that seemed to revolve around the centre,the lights were very bright, so bright that it almost blinded me, it kind of hovered there for a few minutes not making a sound, then it took off with great speed we watched as it flew out of site.", "Black silhouetted object against glow of distant town.  Flashing light on one edge. Hovers then drops down out of sight.My hobby was Astronomy and I would get up late at night to look out of my window at the stars.  It was a summer night I believe in August of 1957. I was looking south toward the massachusetts turnpike and toward the town of Indian Orchard, Mass which cast a glow into the night sky. I was ten years old at the time.  My stargazing was interrupted by a rapidly flashing bluish white light.  I thought it was some kind of firefly but when I looked directly at it I saw that it was on one edge of a black silhouetted cigar shaped object.  It reminded me of a weapon discharge such as a machine gun.  It was &apos;firing&apos; in the same direction of travel as the object and appeared to be slowing the object down as if it were a retrorocket.  The object (which I estimated to be large...at least several hundred feet long) slowed to a halt over the hill.  The blue-white light ceased to discharge.  After a few seconds it slowly descended behind the hill and out of sight (there is a valley there where the Ludlow River (it may be called the Chicopee River actually) flows.  I watched for hours but it never came up into view again.  I had heard that the Ludlow police had seen it in a different area that night at about 3am but never verified this in newspapers recently.((NUFORC Note:  Date in 1957 is approximate.  We have assigned an arbitrary date in August 1957.  PD))", "Overflight of strange craft with chase planeMy son and I were out playing in our front yard when we witnessed a small, single-engine plane circling the neighborhood at only a few hundred feet elevation. It caught my attention, so I watched it for a while. It had no apparant markings, and I recall it being dark grey in color. It was still light, and visibility was good except for scattered clouds. There were some clouds to the West of us. After the small plane circled for a few minutes, an object came out of the clouds. It was either the size of a fighter plane at about 1000 feet, or something larger much higher. My 7-year-old son who has very sharp eyes said it looked like a fighter plane to him, but I couldn&apos;t make out the exact shape. It didn&apos;t look like any fighter I was familiar with, but was roughly that shape. What was odd was that there were two glowing orange circles on the back of the object like it was a fighter jet on afterburners, but it was completely silent. It was not that far away nor that far up -- a fighter on afterburners sounds like a freight train. After the object came out of the clouds, the small plane stopped circling and they both headed off to the East. If it was a fighter on afterburners, it was moving much too slowly. I estimate it was going only about 2-3 times as fast as the small plane. It looked all the world to me like the small plane was waiting for the object, and then escorted it somewhere. An army base is in the approximate direction that the two craft were heading.", "Bright fireball that seemed to stay stationary in the Northwestern part of the sky above the San Gabriel mountains Mt. Baldy area for about 10 seconds before burning out to a faint yellow  orange glow.

Everyone else saw craft in the shape of a suacer and I see one shaped like a Big Mac. As I was driving home, I saw a National Speed Limit Sign. This is when In realised that the thing that I saw was in fact spherical rather than shaped as described above. If you rotate the National speed limit sign in England, around, about 45 degrees and you shrink the black centre line by a little, then you have the basic shape of what I saw. The colour was the same colour as Ragoo, a kind of sandstone orange. I have been asked how big it was? If you take a double decker bus and then split it in half, make the square bit that you have left, round, then this is about the size of what I saw. There were no flashing lights or anything to make this interesting, but I know I saw this object (although I somtimes even dought myself) and I know, having thought about it since, that every natural object, by it&apos;s natural shape is spherical. To travel at speeds exceeding light, which is not generaly acceptable today through the scientific channels, we would have to be super-human, but I know what I saw, and I have considered what I saw.

Object did not have any contours like a plane would have, no flashing lights, no different colored lights. It quickly made its way across the sky in a short elliptical path, north to south, and then as if someone clicked off its lights, disappeared into a clear night sky. I could see a couple of small aircraft approaching from the east, one high and one low. Also quite evident was the usual long line of aircraft lined up in the sky waiting to land at Orlando International Airport. I will be sending a drawing ASAP.

Vic had a convertable and it was an unusually warm evening so we had the top down... In the area of Hat Creek Campground, on Highway 89, I was leaning back with my head on the back of the front seat when I saw a HUGE object moving diagonally over the highway above us.. I was saying Oh my God, and Vic was trying to see what I was looking at while trying to keep the car on the road.. When he realized what I was looking, he immediately pulled over to the side of the road.. For about a half a minute we watched it fly over the woods to our right, and almost out of sight, so Vic said &quot;Let&apos;s follow it&quot;.. We found a logging road and drove up until we reached the edge of a canyon..We sat on the top of the back of the front seats and just watched the huge, silent, rectangular object with lights that went all all around the edge of it, (I can&apos;t remember if they were in color).. When we realized that if we could see them, then they could see us, we decided to leave the area...It was the most amazing thing I have ever seen in my life..

We had crossed the San Diego County line on westbound Interstate 8 headed toward the Desert Tower that overlooks the mountainous area of the Anza Borrego Desert, or at least I think that this is part of the famous desert.  My girlfriend had fallen asleep, but as I was going around the many rock strewn mountains that cover this area, I witnessed what appeared to be a saucer-shaped object hovering about five to six feet above the ground in one of the canyons there.  It didn&apos;t exactly glow like in many sci fi movies but any light that hit it seemed to brighten its surface, like that material that glows in the dark when you expose it to light.  For about two minutes it just floated there silently.  It was shaped like a cross section of a cylinder, perfectly smooth, no lights, no portals or doors. In other words a smooth sided saucer with no curves. It then rose perfectly verticle into the air then zigzagged around the mountain peaks and finally disappeared into the night sky.  I tried waking my girlfriend but the events were so fascinating that by the time I could wake her the object was gone. I spent the rest of the trip trying to explain away what I saw.", "((This is the seventh  of several of these experiences, all of which I now feel are connected. If visitors to this site have any questions I&apos;ll be glad to answer if I can. If anyone has any further information or explanation on them I&apos;d appreciate a reply. I&apos;ve copied these experiences from a past journal.))I went for a drive one evening, down south on highway 71 and about 6 or 7 pm when I was returning, happened to glance off to my right, in the sky and noticed two light-blue colored lights, side by side, heading angle-wise toward the road (&apos;8 oclock&apos;). The distance between the lights, perspective-wise, was less than an inch apart, and didn&apos;t blink or flash. Also, what struck my attention had been the color...almost a neon blue. I kept an eye on the because I knew they&apos;d soon pass across the road; however, when they got closer and I could see better what they were attached to, they began to arc south (back toward &apos;6 oclock&apos;). These were particularly curious because I&apos;ve never seen that color blue before ~ this neon or flourescent blue is as close as I can describe it. I pulled onto the shoulder and stopped, got out and watched. THIS event scared me damn near as bad as the moon-looking orb. The object or craft was a thin rectangle, and the lights were inside either end. It looked like a big 2x4 on its widest side, and perspective-wise, about 3 feet in length if at arm&apos;s length.  The lights were inside the narrow-most side, like the eyes of a hammerhead shark, only in front, not the side. ___________________________ |_*_____________________*__| Initially I assumed it was a plane but it made no sound at all...literally soundless, and as it went by, there hadn&apos;t been any more to it ~ just a simple, black (or possibly dark gray, steel color) rectangle. If it would have been a plane (and this was a low as a low flying plane could fly without dropping out of the sky, and about twice as wide as the wing span of a little charter plane), I could have seen the rivits and seams and bolts, etc. This was solid and looked seamless. It cruised at plane speed. My rationale tried to convince me this was likely some new machine  that they&apos;re testing out...maybe a remote operated spy plane or something...military jets do a lot of low flying out there in that part of the city (outskirts of Bossier City)...but reality said it was doubtful...this IS Barksdale. I watched it head south at a languid speed until it was no longer visible, and gathered myself, and went home. Later, I mentioned this event to my mother, who related a similar account she&apos;d had with the same sort of object being chased by two military jets, and it shot off out of sight. I also asked an Air Force buddy of mine if they were testing something out there and he said they weren&apos;t, it wasn&apos;t ours, and several pilots on base were all wired over it because no one knew what it was or where it came from.  I found this a little hard to choke down tho, because I would think that it would&apos;ve been shot out of the sky had it breezed in over an air base. He also said, tho, that we have nothing at Barksdale that could fly that low without making deafening noise, much less crashing. I would appreciate any details on this from anyone military with suggestions!! *** I have posted the other events here also. Look for: 1. MOSES LAKE  WASHINGTON  MARCH 23, 1995 2.

The airport at Chico is used for pratice approaches by aircraft from Beale AFB for the U-2 and SRC71.  The Arrora replacement for the SRC71 is currently being hangered at Beale for short periods of time, in training situations.This is not meant to downgrade the observation of the Lady from Paradise,  but I think it is important to note that Beale has a ready crew of ground personnel and equipment for Chico and the runway is capable of taking large aircraft.

One of my friends sat up and start crying and pointing to the end of the driveway.  My other friend and I looked up and saw an object that looked like two bowls on top of each other with lights and gray squares (windows???) in the middle.  The lights spun around the object.  There was a very low hum coming from it.  We went into a panic and started trying to get into the house but it was locked because my friends parents were gone for the night.  So, we tried to think of a plan to get around the craft so that we could run down the street to my house which was two houses down.  But, we were to scared so we just climbed back into our sleeping bags and pulled it over our heads.  The dogs were going crazy in the house.  One kept on trying to jump through the window.  We stared at it for quite awhile.  It finally started hovering about 5 feet from the ground and slowly took off and hovered above the house across the street for about 10 minutes then it just took off so fast that we had a hard time following it with our eyes.  It went over the horizon and we booked it over to my house and never did sleep outside again that summer.

Baldy. I was coming down the mountain and was about 6 miles north of Alta Loma California when I and my partner observed the bright circular object appearing to maintain both it&apos;s altitude and position. We pulled over to the side of the road and I inspected the object with 10X50 binoculars, but could dicern no further detail because of the extremely bright &quot;reflection.&quot; We initially thought the object was a weather or scientific balloon and that it was reflecting the sun - over the horizon. Given the approximate 2000 asl of the hills I estimate the object to have been about 3500 to 4000 feet above sea level. As we watched the object we were perplexed to see how the object could have been reflecting the sun which had already set. Additionally, we were viewing an object which was south-west of our position. Which should have minimized if not eliminated the potential reflection. After deciding it &quot;couldn&apos;t be a UFO&quot; we proceeded down the road and lost view of the object. I am very familiar with the area as both a resident and private pilot, having flown throughout the local area from Brackett airport in Pomona. Such an object would be a hazard to airmen in the area, especially at that time of night. I returned on the following day at about 1900 and observed the object again. This time I only watched it moving for about 20 minutes, then proceeded along the mountain road in an effort to gain a closer vantage point. Once I moved to a point that should have been directly east of it, I was no longer able to see the object. I returned to the prior vantage point (north-east where I lost visual contact) and could not relocate the object. There was a period of about 20 minutes from the point that I moved south-west to get closer to the object and when I returned to the initial vantage point. I am a former California licensed private investigator with over 15 years of surveillance experience as well as a former Marine Corps Intelligence Analyst assigned to the Air Wing. I am very familiar with most objects/craft including fixed/helo military and civilian and I could not identify what this object was. I continued to be struck by the brillant light eminating/reflecting from the object. If it is (i.e. the sighting report on 11/10/98 at 1138) a &quot;metallic weather baloon&quot; there should be some known data collection location. I was unable to locate one through my contacts with the FAA control tower at Brackett airfield.", "My wife and I were on our way home from San Diego late at night when I noticed an aircraft flying over head.  The craft was very bright and when we got closer it was actually hoovering over the desert with a very bright light illuminating the ground.My wife and I were on our way home, Phoenix, from San Diego.  We were approximately 1/2 hour east of Yuma, Arizona.  She was sleeping, and I noticed this bright light flying above the desert off in the distance.  I didn&apos;t think much about it, not being familiar with the area, I just assumed that it was probably a crop duster or something of that sort. As we got a little closer to the object, I noticed that the lights were much brighter than that of a crop duster! The entire desert was being illuminated by this craft.  I woke my wife up, asking her if she believed in UFO&apos;s!  She was upset at being woken, and smarted off to me &quot;Why?&quot;  I simply told her that I was not a big believer, but that what ever I was seeing off in the distance was certainly making me believe.  When she looked, she too was shocked. We were getting real close to the object which was black in color.  We noticed that it was not one bright light, but a series of bright lights shining down.  The craft had one in each corner, one in the middle, and several others red, possibly amber, surrounding it.  A semi driver that had been in front of me this entire time pulled off to the side of the road, as did we.  The craft was actually hoovering over the desert with the middle light shining down bright on the ground.  It was as though it were looking for something.  The craft would then move very slowly twoards us, and as it got to where the highway was, all the lights, except the amber lights, would go off until it crossed over the highway.  Once on the other side all lights would return.  The craft was not moving incredibly fast while over the desert but, as it crossed the road it would do so in a hurry.  It concentrated most of its time on the south side of the highway and it passed directly over us severaal times.  It was a very warm Arizona night and we had our windows down, yet heard nothing.  We did not realize this until we were driving away.  My wife was very scared while we were parked there and she begged me to continue driving.  We co! uld see this object for a few miles as we drove away, then it just vanished.  Both of us agreed to tell no one what we had just seen, for fear of being laughed at.  I had to tell someone so I told my parents the next morning.  Yesterday, February 28, 1999, I was golfing with my cousin who was talking about the Phoenix sightings and explaining what the craft looked like.  I told him what my wife and I had encountered so he sent me via email your web address, as well as some pictures that he pulled off the internet.  The pictures that he sent me are very similar to what my wife and I seen, the craft was not huge, but not small either.  The lights were very bright yet, not blinding.  The whole experience was kinda nerve racking to say the least.  Yet, I have no doubt what I seen over that portion of the Arizona desert.  I now believe in UFO&apos;s, but I believe that it was a millitary craft given our location.  Yuma has a large millitary presence.

We observed a brightly lit, numerous colored object that seemed to be burning.  It was giving off all the colors of the spectrum.  Could of been something reentering our atmosphere, that would explain the burning.  Always puzzled me and my friend. I don&apos;t recall hearing about anything from in the news about it.

Around Naperville road I noticed a line of lights in the distance about 20 degrees off to the right of the highway. It was very low in the sky. It was not in the flight path of either O Hare or Midway airport. As I continued west bound I realized that what ever it was would be passing directly over head in a few moments. As I came closer to it, I noticed that what seemed like a line of nine lights was a series of three triangles with three sets of lights in each. I slowed to 25 to 30 miles per hour as it passed directly overhead. There was no sound as it passed over the highway. The lights were to bright to allow any sighting of the craft itself, although the outline of the configuration of the lights suggested that the craft was V shaped wing. The altitude is only a approximation. If it were higher in the sky then it would be of a larger size, if it were lower it would be slightly smaller. I have flown ultralight aircraft and no a little about determining altitude from the ground level persective. Other cars had slowed down and were also looking up as it passed dircectly overhead.

Although we were told not to stop anywhere in the Everglades, unless absolute;y necessary, I said &quot;pull over! Let&apos;s go take a look! We got out of the car. and I cannot remember walking forward, but when we got up ahead of the car about 20 yards, the objects were NOT in front to the left of us, but up higher and absolutely  due West! They were 3 round clouds stationary, and I remember when I looked directly at them, they exploded like a flashbulb into 3 orangish-red ovals and started to move. No sound, no trail. I can still see myself looking up at the bottoms of the objects, and then, at the fastest  (warp?) speed I&apos;ve ever seen shot straight up....leaving 3  spidery-like whitish lines in their wake.", "Three boomerang shaped objects seen going north,had glowing lights on tipsWas watching stars when I saw three boomerang shaped objects traveling very quickly across the sky.The object was approximetly one mile from the ground.The object had glowing red lights on its tips.It was very large.I saw it for about fifteen seconds.", "MY BROTHER AND I WERE DRIVING SOUTH BOUND ON I5 ABOUT 1 1/2 MILES NORTH OF ANDERSON, CALIFORNIA.  A HUGE WHITE/BLUEISH FIREBALL WAS SEEN AT ABOUT 400-600 FEET ABOVE GROUND AND WE FOLLOWED IT BELOW THE TREE LINEAs I was driving my brother and I to work, southbound on Interstate 5, we saw a very large fireball to the south east shooting straight down in to ground.  It was very weird to see.  It started out like a small flash then as the flash stretched out downward a fire ball was forming.  I&apos;d say it looked like 400-600 feet up when we noticed it and appeared to be about 3/4 of a mile away. It feel very slow in comparison to a meteor and appeared to look like an airplane falling out of the sky and burning, it fell that slow. It was close enough that I could see the &quot;boiling&quot; of the &quot;flames&quot; off of the fireball.  We tried to gauge the distance and size in comparisons to cars or trucks on the highway as we continued to work.  It was much bigger then a semi truck coming at you at around 3/4 mile away.  It was similar to a meteor color of white with a blueish tenge to it.", "Driving east toward Danbury on I-84, near the Taconic parkway, myself and a passenger  noticed a bright &quot;glowing&quot; orange sphere in the eastern sky, we watched this for a moment and noticed that thise sphere was beginning to pulsate...It pulsed inward and outward for a few moments and then splintered into what appeared to be a swarm of white lights that moved eratically.... It was like nothing we&apos;ve ever seen", "A group of approximately 50-70 adults watched 5 white lights, the apparent size of bright stars, maneuver in the night sky.The sighting occurred during the banquet and closing ceremonies of the 8th Annual International UFO Congress, being held in Laughlin, NV.  I had been a speaker at the event on the prior morning of the sighting reported here. At approximately 2130 hrs. (Pacific), a friend approached me in the hallway of the hotel and urged me to run outside immediately, stating that a UFO sighting was in process.  I was skeptical, but since I know the individual well, and know him to be a serious-minded person, I responded to his request. I went out to the east side of the hotel, and found approximately 50-70 individuals looking to the east over the Colorado River, generally in the direction of Bullhead City, AZ, which is directly across the Colorado River from Laughlin, NV.  I looked in the direction that they appeared to be looking, approximately 80-90 degrees (azimuth; true), and quickly spotted 5 small, luminous objects, which at first appeared to be prominent stars, approximately the same magnitude and &quot;size&quot; of the stars that form the &quot;belt&quot; in the Orion constellation. Three of the lights on the right, approximately 45-50 (est.) degrees above the horizontal plane, were in a formation that made me believe initially that I was looking at the Orion constellation, but the &quot;lights&quot; were in the eastern sky, and the Orion constellation is located in the southern sky at that time of night. Approximately 2-5 degrees above the three lights, and approximately 5 degrees to their left, were two more, similar, &quot;lights.&quot;  Just a few seconds after I had begun looking at the two lights on the left, I observed that they were moving relative to one another.  They were turning, accelerating for a second or two, slowing suddenly, and then changing direction again.  Their movement seemed almost random, although they clearly were changing position, circling one another, etc.. At this point, I was intrigued by the display, given that it was profoundly bizarre and anomalous.  The display was like nothing I had seen in 51 years on this planet!  I then looked back at the three lights on the right, and was even more intrigued to note that they no longer formed a straight line, but they were moving, and within seconds they were beginning to orient themselves relative to one another in a triangular formation.  Within an estimated 5-10 seconds, they had formed into an isosceles triangle, and all of them were moving generally to the southwest, or south-southwest, at a very slow (angular) velocity, e.g. approx. 1 deg./sec..  That is, they had reversed their course from generally south to north, when I first observed them, to north to south. The entire group of witnesses stood in place, watching the lights slowly drift in that direction, for approximately 6-8 minutes.  All of the lights passed &quot;below&quot; an almost full moon, becoming fainter, it seemed to me, as they moved to the southwest.  Finally, the lights were no longer visible to me and they became progressively fainter until they were no longer visible to any of the witnesses.I have no idea what the objects were, but they CLEARLY were not meteors (!!), conventional aircraft, birds, insects, satellites, or any other object of terrestrial origin, with which I am familiar.", "((NUFORC Note:  Date and time are approximate.  PD))Tumbling, white object which appeared to be disintegrating.I have attached another report which I came across, which is the reason I have submitted this report. I was struck by the amazing similarities between the experiences, right down to the geographic area. In the summer of 1989 or 1990, I don&apos;t remember which, I was driving with my then-girlfriend north on State Line, near 89th Street. It was probably no later than seven o clock, because it was very light. She was first to notice what appeared to be a tumbling, white object. It appeared to be disintegrating, but was not throwing off light. It was traveling S-N and seemed to be on a near level path. We were in busy traffic and lost sight of it. My girlfriend noticed it because she thought it was a plane crashing! But there was no report of any crash that day, and I was aware of no one else who witnessed the phenomena. I would have loved to have watched it standing on that road instead of navigating a car through busy traffic at 40 mph! I was amazed how similar this report was to mine, and was especially intrigued by the geographic proximity of the two sightings. I had always chalked it up to a meteor, but the lack of light and the fact no one else seemed to have seen it (it was really spectacular) always puzzled me. Now I don&apos;t know what to think! Occurred : 11/30/1997 19:11 (Entered as : 11/30/97 19:11) Reported : 12/1/1997 07:05 Posted : 12/15/1998 Location : Kansas City, MO Shape : I witnessed what was obviously a single object entering the atmosphere. It descended from north to west at a 45 degree angle at about 30 degrees above the horizon. It burned a very bright white and I witnessed sparks flying off of the object. I have witnessed many meteor showers, and while this object was similar it seemed lower in the atmosphere, very large and extremely bright as I was in a brightly lit part of the city.", "while exiting a mardi gras parade at pensacola beach we notice a red light in night sky that brightened to white then faded to redon tuesday 16feb99 at about 1900 we were in a queue that was exiting pensacola beach by way of navarre bch which is at the other end of this island across from gulf breeze. after leaving the city lights behind there are few lights, just dunes on either side of the road and no homes until you&apos;re in navarre bch itself. so stars are brilliant. after driving for about 15 minutes i said to my husband who was driving. what is that crazy helo doing boxing up there? my husband said he noticed it too. i asked him whether he&apos;d every seen a helo go from red to bright white light the fade to red again.we thought this helo was from localTV covering parade so we weren&apos;t too excited, but we noticed that boxing was stationary over this specific portion of sky and that there were 3 other lights in sky doing similar patterns. we were able along withrest of line of cars to come almost under these light but we found that 2 lights were over navarre sound and 2 were over the gulf. there are alot of curves on this road so untilwe got closer we thought they wereover land. also EglinAF base was to the NE of us and NAS pensacola was nearly NW of where we were. Convinced these were helos we rolled down our windows, but heard no sounds other than roar of traffic. I have lived on military installations for about 15 years and never have witness these types of manuevers. myself, husband and my 3 children witness this from our car. even as we approached gulf breeze we could see these 4 lights but they moved so that 2 were over pensacola sound and 2 were over 2 navarre sound so direction they moved was north. again we were almost onvinced that these were helos but after rolling down windows we heard no sound.", "Two black helicopters following possible object near Parkway entranceTwo black helicopters flying about 200 feet above the ground went across the valley very quickly. I may or may not have seen an object- there was a brief orangish flash that might have been the sun behind the mountian. There was no reason for those helicopters to be in this specific area in this time- I&apos;m reporting this mainly to corraborate an earlier report of black helicopters pursueing a UFO.", "Silver sphere flew overhead at high altitude with two delta-wing fighters in pursuit.Time is late summer of 1968.  Afternoon.  Observer location at the Eastern end of Manor Road, Church Hill, PA (located on US 322 between Reedsville and Milroy). Visual angle on the object was about 85 deg above horizon.  Object appeared to be silver sphere, moving from North to South.  Sighting started &amp; ended about 45 deg to either side of zenith.  Two delta-wing fighters (considering the year probably F102s) trailed yhe onject (in terms of flight path), with distance between the object anbd the fighters increasing -- ie, object appeared to be faster than fighters. Object was *not* a reflection from a conventional airplane.  The angle between the sun (cloudless day) changed markedly between beginning &amp; ending of sighting, but the appearance of the object as a silvery sphere did not vary. Also, the fighters were always visible as conventional aircraft throught the sighting. The question, of course, is:  what was the actual altitude of the UFO? If at the fighter&apos;s altitude or greater, it was going faster than the fighters.  If less than the altitude of the fighters, it could have been slower than the fighters -- and if enough lower, could have been a balloon. At no time during the sighting did it *feel* like it was a balloon, however.", "While walking with three other witnesses at about dusk, I viewed a contrail headed toward me from a direct West compass heading.  The object looked as if it were decending from a long way out (very long contrail) and as it approached to about 90 degrees overhead the familiar offing of bright &quot;sparking&quot; which might normally be viewed coming from the nose of a missile or Space Shuttle upon re-entry into the high atmosphere.  When the contrail hit 90 degrees, it vanished indicating that any object (unseen) might have entered or exited friction points.At the same time the contrail was being observed, a Boeing 747 was in a landing patern bound for Los Angeles Airport.  This aircraft was flying at a ruduced speed at about 12,000 feet along the same direction nearly crossing the path of the higher contrail.  The object creating the contrail was clearly moving at four to five times the speed as the 747 from our vantage point.((NUFORC:  Sighting occurred at the time of an airlaunch of a Pegasus missile from an aircraft located approximately 70 miles to the southwest of Monterey, CA.))", "Craft of undetermined shape with a single strobe light hovered in the area. One had a white strobe, which turned red, then white again. Other remained red.Craft of undetermined shape with a single strobe light hovered in the area. One had a white strobe, which turned red, then white again. Other craft had red lights which did not change. The one with the white light moved horizontally and vertically in a fairly quick manner. The others did not move a great deal. Other aircraft, with normal lights on wings and underbelly could be seen in the sky. The white strobe was brilliant; definitely not an aircraft I am familiar with. I used binoculars to get a better look. The craft seemed to be a dull white color, similar in shape to a flying wing (large and rounded in the front and narrowing to a thin edge towards the back). It was north of town, then moved to the southeast, near the area of the Capital City Airport in New Cumberland.", "sphere seen right on  the outside of boise, idaho.last summer i was going on a trip with my brother and my mom to salt lake city, utah, from boise, idaho. as we wee right outside boise, i saw a sphere shape, not moving or anything. the object was slightly blurried, as if the edge was not smooth. as we came closer to it, it appeared to get slightly larger but not much, as if it was heading the same way we were. it was definately metallic, because the sun reflected off of it. then, the object changed and became smooth lookingwhen we approached it more. then it started to move in front and then behind a cloud. it did this very rapidly for about a minute, then went behind the cloud and never came back. i know that we were near the airport and the military, but it was not an airplane, because it made no noise, and it was not a helicoptor, because it was smaller than a helicopter. i have never seen it again.", "Commercial Airline Flight From Juneau AK to SeattleI was sitting on Right side window seat,Plane was on approach to Seatac at approx. 5000 ft. looking out the window noticed an object approaching plane heading north at a high rate of speed about 1000 ft below plane.

WE STOPPED AT A STOP SIGN. I LOOKED OUT THE WINDOW AND SAW A UFO. SHE ALSO SAW IT.IN APRIL OF 1974,IT WAS 11:00 P.M., I KNOW BECAUSE I WAS STILL IN SCHOOL AND THAT WAS MY CURFEW WITH MY PARENTS. WE WERE ABOUT 2 BLOCKS FROM MY HOME AND STOPPED AT A STOP SIGN. I LOOKED OUT THE PASSENGER WINDOW OF THE CAR (I WAS IN THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT AND MY FRIEND WAS DRIVING), I SAW A DISC SHAPED CRAFT WITH A DOME ON TOP. THE CRAFT WAS ABOUT 50 FEET IN THE AIR HOVERING OVER A TREE TOP AND MAYBE 100 FEET FROM US. THE DOME HAD BRIGHT LIGHTS OF RED BLUE YELLOW GREEN AND WHITE FLASHING AROUND AND AROUND THE DOME. THE CRAFT APPEARED TO BE SILVER METALLIC. I TOLD MY FRIEND TO LOOK AND SHE SAW IT TOO.  I OPENED THE CAR DOOR AND SO DID SHE, SO WE WERE BOTH STANDING OUTSIDE THE CAR WATCHING IT. THERE WERE OTHER CARS ON THE STREET THAT WE HAD TO STOP FOR, BUT IT SEEMED LIKE NO ONE ELSE NOTICED IT BUT US. BUT IT WAS SO BRIGHT AND COLORFUL, LIKE A CARNIVAL RIDE LIT UP AT NIGHT. THE CRAFT MADE NO SOUND AT ALL. IT FINALLY JUST ROSE UP HIGHER AND DRIFTED SIDEWAYS TILL WE COULDN&apos;T SEE IT ANYMORE.THE ODD THING IS THAT WE DIDN&apos;T TALK ABOUT IT AND I TOLD NO ONE AND I DON&apos;T THINK SHE DID EITHER. IN 1976 I SAW THIS FRIEND AGAIN AND I SAID &quot;DID WE SEE WHAT I THOUGHT WE DID?&quot; SHE SAID &quot;YES, WE DID&quot; AND THAT IS ALL WE SAID ABOUT IT. I DIDN&apos;T EVEN HAVE TO MENTION THAT IT WAS A UFO TO HER, SHE AUTOMATICALLY KNEW WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT. I HAVE EXPERIENCED THREE MORE SIGHTINGS IN THAT GENERAL AREA, BUT THEY HAVE BEEN YEARS APART AND ALL THE CRAFT ARE DIFFERENT FROM EACH OTHER.  I BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE SO MANY OF THEM THERE BECAUSE THERE IS NO ONE TO CALL IF YOU DO SEE ONE AND THERE ARE NO MILITARY BASES ANYWHERE NEAR THERE.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.", "Saw small cone shaped object near Fort Jackson army base.My neighboor and I were driving home from the RC Aircraft Field, at fort jackson. We were approimately 5 miles on interstate I-20 (west bound) out of fort jackson looking toward the city of Columbia. I noticed an object in the air that I could not identify. (I am a licensed Pilot) I attempted to look at it further to identify the object as I do often to practice (scanning technique) for flying. The object was cone shaped with what looked like a flare on the top 1/5 of the object. Silverer in color and seemed to be vibrating (car was stable so this was ruled out)Car = Nissan Maxima. It was also near dust so an aircraft should have had it&apos;s lights on. I do know there was helicopter activity in the fort jackson area due to an over flight of an apache attack helicopter earily at the RC Field (gave us a little scare). But this object did not look like a helicopter. The object did not appear to have any kind of velocity. We passed the object, it was on the drivers side I was in the passenger seat, I leaned over to see the object from the back seats and it was gone. The other witness is a RC Pilot and grew up with airplanes his father was a light bird in the army who flies to this day. I am sepectical of this object, I am thinking about calling columbia&apos;s approach control and asking them if they had anything on radar for that area.", "Object appeared from behind mesa, ascended at about a 70 degree angle, taking maybe a minute to ascend 8-10,000 ft, passing into cloud.  Object resembled  typical comet with rounded head and long vaporous trail.My wife and I finally had our first UFO experience while visiting relatives in Phoenix last weekend. The event happened about 6:15 PM just at dusk as we turned off I-17 and drove west on Happy Valley Road on the extreme northern edge of Phoenix.   The sky was partially overcast but clear to the west. I first spotted what I thought was a comet just above one of the local mesas.  I don&apos;t know its name, but it forms the northern rim of the little valley just north of Thunderbird Park. The object had a rounded head similar to photos of comets and as it rose from behind the mesa its &quot;tail&quot; also appeared.  The tail flaired out slightly as a comet might and even appeared to have a stream of particles &quot;glittering&quot; inside it. Being just at dusk, it was difficult to judge size and distance, but from where the object disappeared into the cloud (lighting it brightly as it passed through) it&apos;d guess it was between 10-20 miles away.  From our perspective the object was about the size of my thumb extended at arms length. It took about a minute to reach what I&apos;d guess is an altitude of 8-10,000 feet before disappearing into the cloud.  It ascended at about a 70 degree angle.  It appeared a  whitish blue color to me and was brightest at the &quot;head.&quot; I cannot explain what it is we saw.  I have a  knowledge of astronomy, spent 9 years in the airline business, hold a private pilot license, and regard myself as a rational man.  This didn&apos;t resemble a rocket trail or anything else with which I am familiar.", "Saw a glowing fireball plunge through the sky towards earth.I witnessed this on my way to work at approximately 6:40 Monday morning. In the sky to the north I saw a huge fireball flying through the sky headed downwards. I assumed at the time that it was only a meteor entering the atmosphere(what with leonid and all), but have seen footage of an object identical to mine, and anlysis of the footage of this other object said it could not have been a meteor. I am an IT professional w/ a very prestigous Global company, and have never seen or reported anything of this nature before.", "While driving east on I96, at 3:40 a.m. I saw a green fireball with a gold tail moving downward at a 45 degree angle. After approx. 3 seconds it was out of sight.It was a vividly bright green object with a goldish color tail moving at a very fast speed. The object traveled 4 to 5 degrees in a downward direction at a 45 degree angle until it went out of sight approx. at 4 to 5 degrees above the horizon. I am very familiar with aircraft off all types and I am an amateur astronomer with 20 years of experience of celectial events. This was not a shooting star or meteorite. I am a professional driver and I have worked nights for the last 4 years.

All three of them witnessed it (this is a friend posting this for the mother).  The object was metallic and silvery, and on one side it was spherical, and the back(?) side was flat and in the shape of a diamond.  The object was rotating on an axis that went through the center of the diamond side.  The rate of rotation was estimated at 1 revolution per 45 to 60 seconds.  Initially the object was moving away from their vehicle.  It went a distance away, and then the direction of its rotation changed, and began to move back towards them.  Soon there- after, the son (age 4) became very upset by its coming to them, and then the object just disappeared...no sound or anything.  On the flat diamond side of the object there was a black (amorphous) pattern around its center.  In the center of this side was a steady blue light. The total viewing time was about 5 minutes. After the object was gone, all three individuals went back inside the house and in separate rooms drew what they thought they saw.  The drawings agreed with each other. The father was disbelieving, and disheartedly, the mother ended up throwing the sketches away.  The 8 yr. old daughter still remembers seeing the object, but doesn&apos;t think much about it. The mother still thinks often about it.  There area at the time used to have a lot of air traffic, but there was none at the time.  Size of the object was estimated to be about the size of the &apos;bubble&apos; of a small helicopter.", "light hovered at low altutitude area close to mo/il border and shot upward at high speed.A was taking a friend of mine home when we witnessed a light behaving as though it was a helicopter hovering at fairly low altitude with different, brilliantly, colored lights when it immediately shot upward at a speed which made it very hard to imagine it being a conventional aircraft.  At the time we were both high school students and dismissed it as something that was strange and interesting, but probably explainable.  The more we have talked about it, the more we feel it is worth consideration as a possible ufo. The main reason behind this posting is to see if maybe someone else observed this event.", "I saw 5 UFO&apos;s this night, thanks to my girlfriend at the time who was connected to them. This was 1981.  She took me out to watch them...I saw 35 in total over 6 mo. I was taken aboard twice, once conciously. They said &quot;we always welcome you&quot; as I went in. I was taken out of my body once and taken aboard also. Since then, I have had many dreams of them....Now,  am a well paid professional, and this is the first time I have discussed this outside of my family. I am very paranoid that this is a govt site. Im taking a chance, I have had many experiences with them.First event: My girlfriend took me to see them. A large triangular object that flew over our head..It was huge and only a few hundred yards above. It was totally silent...I only saw &quot;running lights&quot; along the edges and triangular shapes along the bottom of the ship. Afterwards, I saw many circular globular objects that were gold in color, that flew perpindicular to the other craft. My girlfriend at the time was connected to them and always knew when they were around. This was 1981 She took me to the desert soon after,  and told me I would be taken aboard consciously...not unconsciously. We camped there. I saw appproximately 17 UFO&apos;s fly over this place. They were landing on the other side of the mountains, We were in a van...they came about midnight. A fog descended around our Van, and I looked out the window and saw aliens walking,,,I totally panicked..I was begging to go asleep.... The next thing I know, I was awake the next mornig, My girlfriends&apos; first words were &quot;did you enjoy yourself last nite&quot; I remember the dream though. They floated me aboard, and as I was going in they said &quot; we always welcome you&quot; I was in a dream state...and in a small room...I was thinking to myself...&quot;.they cant keep me here&quot; so I walked out the door and around the perimiter of the ship which had windows all about. there was no one there... I kept thinking that when I came in it was such a small ship, but once inside, this ship was huge...I came to the bridge, and saw two chairs, and lights all around. Then I went to another room with a large crystaline object with tubes coming out indifferent directionss. someone said this was the propulsion device. Then, I found myself in front of a screen of sorts, with a female alien next to me. On the screen, were objects and symbols that were flying by. I asked her &quot;why are you showing me this, I dont know what it means&quot; She said &quot;you will need it later&quot; I asked her is there going to be nuclear war, and she said &quot;no, we will prevent it&quot; Remember, this is 1981. And I saw myself watching  medical procedures...they were taking people from campsites and impregnating women, and mixing the husbands sperm with theirs...creating pregnancies. I  left her a year later and have not seen a UFO since....that was 1982. whatever they wanted  with me,, they must have accomplished. I have kept this a secret beyond my family fo 15 yeas I have other experiences, but I am so afraid that this is a govt site....I am a well paid medical professional, with a family and a nice house. This is the first time I have made my experience known beyond my family since  the 80&apos;s....Even my family doesn&apos;t believe me except one  brother who has had similar experiences.

It was about 20 degrees above the horizon SW of my position. The sky was about half overcast in light cloud formations. I was the first one to see it,so I got the binoculars to take a closer look. It was a bright glowing blue,red and white object,looked like it was spinning.I then called my daughter and wife to take a look to see what they thought. It was obvious that it was not an aircraft,because both fixed wing jet,and helecopter flew over and the object remained for awhile longer,untill the helicopter approached too close,then the object drifted off in a westerly direction.The object looked to be kind of round.I went outside to get a picture,which I did!at this point the object drifted off in the distance,but still in sight. When I went back in the house the object returned,thats when the helicopter approached too close and the object left.", "Saw what I thought were 2 military planes flying in formation--both had anber/yellow light. Ones light was solid and others was flashing.I was driving around the parking lot of The community college here when I saw 2 lights in the distance to the NW.  Being in close proximity to a military installation (Ft.Huachuca) that seems to be constantly practicing night aerial maneuvers, I thought this was merely two planes or helicopters flying in formation, one a little bit in front of the other.  However, as I continued to watch, the craft in the rear seemed to be getting closer to the lead craft (the one whose light wasn&apos;t flashing). At this point I parked my car and watched because I had never seen maneuvers like this before. It was as if one was chasing the other. The flashing (not really flashing like a strobe but rather like turning a very bright light off and on slowly and seeing the bulb fade as it cools)craft continued to get closer to the other one until the lights almost seemed as one. Then the flashing light was gone and only the constantly lit craft could be seen. While this was happening the 2 lights were traveling in a counter-clockwise direction from northwest to west and ended up directly over the Fort here. I still thought at this time that I was looking at 2 planes or helicopters and one just blacked out all its lights--they seem to do that a lot around here. When the light that was still visible got directly over the fort it ended its circular direction of travel and headed due-east torwards where I was parked.  It was not traveling very fast and I could still only see the one solid light.  As it got closer I again saw the flashing/pulsing light along with several more. I was amazed at the absence of sound as it approached. From the silence and the odd light clusters I could now see I thought perhaps this was one of the unmanned aerial vehicles they test here or maybe a balloon/blimp of some sort.  It wasn&apos;t. It was not flying very high and (luckily) passed directly over me and the entire campus here(there were several people in the parking lot and milling around the campus but I don&apos;t know if anyone else was paying attention).  As it passed I was amazed at its size and the silence (a faint rumbling/humming almost like a jet very very far away could be heard). I could not make out a shape because it was dark but, I could clearly see an unusually high amount of lights on its underbelly. Their were several small almost incandescent-like amberish lights clustered about what I&apos;ll call the nose section. The mid section only had a few lights grouped in pairs of two close to the nose, and then the rest of the mid- section was dark and very long. Towards the back, or tail-end, was the flashing light I saw earlier with a few other non-flashing lights.  Looking at the arrangement of all these lights reminded me of a stingray-like fish with a large head/body, and a long skinny tail with a point but I can&apos;t really say what shape it was only what the light configuration reminded me of. What I originally thought was one plane chasing or just gaining on the other was really the lights on the front of this thing and the flashing light on its tail. As it turned it created the illusion of one going faster and closing the gap on the other. After seeing this I still wasn&apos;t sure that it just wasn&apos;t a military excursion umtil about 5 minutes after it passed over me. It was at this time that I saw several small planes and/or helicopters flying at very low altitudes over the Fort. They seemed to be spaced out pretty far and just circling small areas as if they were looking for something or waiting for something. One large commercial-like jet could also be seen but it wasn&apos;t circling, it and two helicopters headed in the same direction as the craft did and all three passed directly over me as well as if they were following but not necessarily chasing whatever I had originally seen. These planes and helicopters around and directly over the Fort for at least an hour.", "Formations seen from Mt. Charleston, Nevada, at very south end of Nellis Air Force Base.We watched these lights, 6 white - 3 red ones create formations over an area 2 miles or more long. One broke away and came clear across the valley (several miles) to were we campefired - and hovered approx. 1-2 minues and  went back to the &apos;others&apos;. It was incredible bright, white - no distinct shape in this light. Typical non-terrestrial hover. &gt;From our look out point, we had free vision northwards over Nellis AFB - no houses or other residential lights except due west a small village. The lights seemed to switch off and reappear elsewhere, creating new formations. We left at near 03.00. Came back 5 other occasions over the following 3-4 weeks,  had sightings on three more of them. Always more than one ship - always more than one witness. One time we had one in front of us ascending Mt. Charelston. This one was red. It appeared and dissapeared a few times as we made our way up. Then later - an hour maybe, (23:45) - we saw it &apos;sitting&apos; down below our vista point, on an area no roads are. In the middle of wilderness. This evening we also saw formations over the valley on the south side of Nellis Air Force base. 6 objects. Observation time this event was ongoing til we left at 03:00 and they were still there when we left. This is totally non restricted air space.", "Swirling mass of approximately 12 red to amber lights.It was just after dusk and I was facing West when directly above me I saw a swirling mass of approximately 12 abmer colored lights.  They were slowly moving to the South at approx. 5-10 mph.  I could not identify a specific shape or size, but the lights seemed to move independently of each other.  The size of the lights were very small and circled one another in a counter clockwise direction.  It was a very clear night with no clouds in the sky.  I cannot estimate an altitude, however, I feel that they were fairly close to the ground; less than 2000 feet?  There was no sound eminating from the objects. At first I thought it was a swarm of birds, yet these objects were illuminated and slowly disappeared from sight to the South.  It was very strange and I&apos;m curious if others have observed this phenomenom.", "500-600 ft.chevron shaped craft moving to the NW fast at about 3500ft elevation craft had 12-16 dim white lights to the front of chevron craft moving at about 700mph then disapeared out of field of vision.I&apos;m a 47 year old painter,ex-military.at 21:15 hrs. 03/23/99 witness to a large chevron shaped craft(500-600ft.in length) traveling at aprox.700mph at an elevation of 3500ft.In a NW trajectory.Physical characteristics were as follows to the front and flank of craft 6-8 dim white lights other wing of craft the same.(12-16 lights in all) Behind lights craft seemed to have a charcoal or black color.Craft could best be described as a charcoal colored boomerang with 6-8 white lights on each wing.Craft also made no sound on approach and departure from observation point.", "Circular object, moving slowly, straight line, aprrox alt. 5000 ft. Slighty Illuminated in a dark orange/burnt sienna color, no blinking lights/silent.Approx 12:25 am on Feb. 28th 1999...I was a DJ for a local party. After the party had ended, I was loading my equipment and jst about finished when 7-8 people were standing in the parking lot of the restaurant looking up at the sky directly overhead. A few a the men and women(mixed crowd) were continually saying in amazment, &quot;what the hell is that&quot;??? They kept saying that for a few seconds and when i looked up it was directly overhead moving from southeast to northeast at a very slow pace. Newark Int. Airport is approx 5 miles from the sighting area and the object was witnessed crossing against the local approach pattern for incoming aircraft.The object was witnessed moving at a very slow rate of speed...slower that any aircraft on approach to landing Approx. moving at a speed of 100 mph or less. the object was observed for approx. 45 seconds and was circular in shape, however, looking up from belore it may have been round. There was a very subtle cloud scatter of very ligyt nature but even with the clouds visibilty was about 90 percent. The object was deep orange in color and almost had a transparrent look to it. there were no blinking lights or strobes and the object made no sound at all.after we veiiewed it for 15 seconds or so..one of the men ran inside to some of the others whom had remained at the party a little later.Several more people came out and witnessed the object for the 20 seconds or so, but by that time it was quite out of range for the human eye to see. from the direction it came from...it had to have passed over a very busy Meadowlands Horce race track the was still in session at the time. It also may have passed over the southern tip of New York City&apos;s Lower Manhattan before making it&apos;s way across the Jersey Border. That&apos;s about all I can tell you at this time. what an experience..!!!", "Search lights??with no apparent origin from ground.Early evening my daughter arrived at my house at 6:30pm. She called me out to see what appeared to be grand opening spot lights but there was no beam from the ground and no such local event. My granddaughter and I came out and the 3 of us thought it looked like a spinning disc that may have been up to a mile wide above the thin cloud cover. There appeared to be 4 individual lights evenly spaced that were moving in a circular pattern one time around then moved toward the center and appeared to cross over each other then back out to the perimeter and circled around again in a repeating pattern. We watched for about 5 minutes then went back inside.When my daughter checked again around 8:30pm they were gone. Had it been a grand opening it would have been still going on. We were not going to report this, but I recieved an E-mail from caus.org about Dec.7 or 8 in which a very similar sighting occured in S.Carolina on Dec.5. I found it strange that we witnessed what seem to be the exact same thing 2 days earlier.", "When I looked up a bright white light appeared. It began moving to the left and changed to a faint yellow. The light dimmed to the point where I could barely see it then suddenly reappeared.I was walking my friends dogs in the park that night. Hale Bopp was behind me to the right, low in the sky. I looked up at the stars and a bright white light appeared high in the sky. It slowly began moving to the left and at the same time dimmed to a faint yellow. The light became so dim that I could barely make it out. It came to a stop then it suddenly reappeared as a sharp point of white light. The light began rotating around in a circle a yellow light then appeared opposite of the white. As  both lights were spinning clockwise a blue light turned on giving the impression of a multicolored ring. the glowing ring then quickly rose up towards the stars and dissappeared. My friend asked me if I had seen that and I couldn&apos;t reply. I didn&apos;t want to blink. The lights made no sound so the noise of an approaching jet blinking in the distance startled me.", "Moving extreamely fast, no sound, changed direction. &gt;From one end of the night sky to the other in 11 seconds.---------------- my first U.F.O. sighting ----------------- 27th December, 1998. approx 4:38 am. Christchurch, New Zealand. I love astronomy and often have a good look at the Stars on a clear night. I&apos;m not a fanatic about religion or UFO&apos;s and never thought I&apos;d see anything like it. My girlfriend witnessed it briefly, after I woke her up quickly. There I was lying in bed at 4:30am awake, but feeling content. As usual spotting a satellite here and there in the sky. Sometimes looking out the window behind my pillow, sometimes not. -------------------------------------------------- Then I saw a flash of bright white light. as bright as one of the brightest stars. Although, it was more like a pulse. There was no sound. It seemed very high up. But it moved really fast ! 3 pulses, each 2 seconds apart, while moving fast in a straight direction. Then a pause of about 3-4 seconds and two more bright white pulses going in a slightly different direction. ====================================================== Not a satellite... Satellites move much slower, and reflect constant orange light. And move in a straight line. Not a plane... No sound at all, moving too fast, and no red or green tail lights, wing lights or head lights etc. It was traveling almost at the speed of a meteorite or object (like a falling star) entering the atmosphere. Traveling from one side of my large window view to the other, in the space of 10 - 11 seconds. But, it was a pulse like a spot light, quickly pulsing in different directions. Not a window reflection... There was nothing electrical plugged in or switched on in our bedroom. I could almost see it when it wasn&apos;t &quot;pulsing&quot;. Black and much larger than any satelite I&apos;ve ever seen. I yelled at ((Name deleted)) to wake up, not taking my eye off the sighting. she woke up in time to see the last pulse. She said &quot;wow a bright flash ! &quot; ==================================================== That&apos;s all. I felt like running outside, but I was stuck staring in the direction of the last visible pulse. Talked with ((Name deleted)) about it for 20 - 30 minutes. Then she fell asleep about 45 minutes before I did. I have no conclusions. Just, that it was the most unusual thing I&apos;ve ever seen in 20 - 23 years of night sky watching. And happened exactly like I say here. Faithfully. ((Name deleted)).     ( age 33 ) P.S.  this is true. I would never ever make up a story like this. ( unless someone was going to give me a million dollars :) Sorry.... bad joke.

One blueish light in the center, one &quot;pearl&quot; colored light at each end. No lights were flashing but pulsed?.  I thought it was an airplane but when the plane listed to the right, it went left and when it listed to the left, it went right, the opposite of what a plane would do.  It moved to to the left behind a church and some trees and that was the last I saw of it.  I was approximately 300 yards away from it. It appeared to be no more than 50-75 feet in the air! Very curious!Added to the above information: It was dusk, very slight star sightings.  The sun was setting behind me.  Object appeared to be over farmland.  Object color was black.  Due to the distance, no sounds were heard.  Once it went out of my line of sight (behind the church I was parked next to), I got out of my vehicle and walked towards the back of the church to see it and it was no longer visible.", "Triangle Shaped object, Glowing red outline.About a month after a previous sighting (reported already) I saw a triangle shape object traving at ultra high speed pass overhead (it&apos;s edges glowed reddish-orange).  Even though it was just above tree-top level, it made no sound.", "Strange light doing 3 90 degree turns.we were going down Wells Rd., which goes west, as we went down the an object proceded over a recreation center on my right to a Hops restaurant on my left.  It had made a 90 degree turn to make that left turn.  Then made a 90 degree turn towards the Mall and descended into the distance.", "I was driving home on the freeway going north and i looked out the drivers side window and i saw a bright red light over down town Reno.At first i thought it was an air traffic light but i noticed it was not blinking.I put my arm out and pointed up to the light so other people would look.I took the first exit off the feeway and parked so i could watch it.It stayed in one place and then just faded away.Later that night ,i heard about it on the Art Bell show.", "My mother says she went out to put the horse in, and she saw a flash, looked up and saw 4 groups of lights flying in formation fly over and disappear behind the trees.I know this story is a little old, now, and sorry we cant remember the exact date. My mother came in late one evening about 11:30 and told me she saw a UFO. She went out to put the horse in the barn, and she saw a bright flash from behind the trees to the east, which made her think of shooting stars. So she looked up to see if she could see any more. She noticed something moving in the big dipper, and initially thought it was a meteor, or satellite, until she realized there were 4 groups of either 2 or 4 starlike lights, in a rhombus formation, with 1 group in front, 2 on each side, and one trailing.              :         :        :          : Each one &apos;waggled&apos; or yawed a bit in mid-flight, and then carried on until she lost sight of them behind the trees to the east, roughly where she saw the flash (the flash was like a flare that descended and dimmed, but she could not see the source for the trees). There was no noise. It was travelling at a pretty good clip, faster than a typical airplne, slower than a meteor. If it was a plane/jet, there would have been sound and colored/ blinking lights. Left no trail. Very clear sky. The whole thing she estimated to be the size of a dime at arm&apos;s lenght, or smaller. Each group of lights was as bright as a moderately dim star, no brighter than one of the big dipper stars. Whole time from flash until the craft disappeared behind trees was probably 15 to 20 secs max. The fir trees to the east are tall, and obscure the sky up to about 45 deg. I have noticed similarities in this story to the one from the man in Knoxville, TN, also in your database. I hope the diagram I drew above will work.

I&apos;m now 46.  My father was an NCO in the U.S. Army stationed at the NATO base in Baumholder, and I was his dependent. I&apos;m sure this story is of little use to you save as a curiosity at this point, but I&apos;ve never written it down or reported it to anyone prior to this. This was a very clear, bright day.  There were not haze or clouds. I was between classes after lunch. A friend and I were looking out the class window over the town of Baumholder. I observed a rather bright object coming towards the school.  It was curving in from what must have been the NNW heading towards the SW.  Because of its arc I was able to see at different times its port and starboard sides as well as it&apos;s bottom. There was no way to gauge altitude, so I couldn&apos;t tell you what its size was.  Likewise, couldn&apos;t estimate speed, although it seemed to be in no hurry. We thought at first that it was an airplane.  We began to joke about the Russians (remember where I was, and that it was 1962). As it came closer, nearly overhead the school, I began to realize that it was not a plane and that I had never seen anything like it before.  We gradualy became silent with out joking. It had no wings, empenage, or markings.  It made no vapor trail and had no exhaust.  I saw nothing to suggest an engine, cockpit, or windows. I&apos;d seen a lot of planes and helicopters in my young life (Army brat).  It was not a plane or helicopter.  Neither was it a blimp, balloon, kite, gyrocopter, or droud. It made no noise that I could hear.  It seemed quite graceful.  It looked like nothing so much as a flying florescent light.  It was long, but cut off very cleanly and abruptly on both of its ends.  It&apos;s lines were exceptionaly well-defined.  It seemed seamless. It did not seem metallic.  It did not seem to reflect the sun.  It had a very curious dull, off-white, glow to it, not bright, but very steady and uniform. It looked as if someone had taken a cookie-cutter and stamped out neatly a portion of the sky. I lost sight of it when it eventually flew beyond the vantage of my window. I can attest that I have never seen anything like this since, and I&apos;ve looked.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We have assigned an arbitrary date so the report sorts to the spring of 1962.  PD))", "Driving I saw something in the sky, I looked up abit, then it sort of flashed away, and was gone.My mother was teaching me to drive on the country roads surronding the town which i was living in (Casterton). I was driving allong, when i noticed something in the sky. There wen&apos;t many clouds around and this looked like a funny shaped cloud. I know this sounds unconvincing but it had the shape of the Enterprise, from star trek. I thought what could that be. I was staring at it trying to figure out what it was, it wasnt dark, it was getting near twilight. Then all of a sudden it kind of flashed off and was gone. I yelled at my mum and sister to see if they saw it, but they were too busy looking at the country side", "2 &quot;stars&quot;, wobbling &amp; dancing in unison, separated, but 1 above the other. Also alternately brightening &amp; dimming. 1 object would dim &quot;out&quot; &amp; become a small cloud- only to reappear &amp; brighten minutes laterApprox. 1.5 hrs. after sundown at Cathedral Rock in Sedona, AZ on 2/19/99, my girlfriend and I observed 2 objects in the sky that appeared unusual in that they wobbled &amp; danced together (very unlike stars). We observed the objects facing SW from Sedona to the right of a crescent moon that evening. We watched incredulously for approx. 45 min. while the two objects would alternately brighten and dim- one at a time! The lower of the two objects would dim-out and become a small cloud- only to return a few minutes later. We joked that perhaps they were UFO&apos;s who were &quot;playing star&quot;. We took 3 photos and at the exact moment the camera flashed we each saw thousands of little beams or particles (like the old Asteriods screen-savers). The photos DID NOT develop when we returned home to Sacramento. These three exposures were in the middle of a known good roll of film (everything else obviously developed) and we&apos;re attempting to have the film company try again developing. We were quite surprised 2 nights later when we sighted these 2 objects again after leaving Boynton Canyon at about the same time in the evening. Once again we observed the objects for about 45 minutes before leaving the area to return to Sacramento. A few hours later we were too tired to continue and spent the night in Laughlin, NV. While there we seemed to be drawn to what was the UFO Congress event by sheer synchronicity so we spent another day there. We didn&apos;t think our experience unusual as we had both experienced strange energies the past 4 days and had spiritual experiences while at the Sedona vortexes. I heard Peter Davenport and Roger Leir on Art Bell the other night so I faxed the report to Art and he read it on-the-air. Somehow, neither of us seem the least bit surprised about the sighting you had described there. My girlfriend is an admissions counselor at UC Davis and these were her first UFO experiences. I am a musician on The Chapman Stick (and I performed twice for the Intl. UFO Congress on Monday 2/22). I have had two other sightin! gs in my life before this weekend.

I observed two objects in the western sky emitting different color light flashes.  These objects were stationery, then began movement.Looking to the western sky, I thought I saw a red flash.  I kept looking and saw two objects, both stationery, emitting blue flashes and occasionally a red flash.  I kept watching and noticed some movement in a back and forth direction, first to the east, and then back to the west.  After further observation,  I saw some very erratic movement by these two objects.  The object on the left moved in a southerly direction and then an easterly direction.  The object on the right moved first  northerly, and then began a circular motion.  During this circular motion it would make occasional very fast darts to the east and then back. These objects were very high in the sky.  The one on the left was as bright as a star, the one on the right somewhat dimmer.  These objects were way to high to be any kind of helicopter or other aircraft that I am familiar with.  After 50 minutes of watching this, i saw some kind of green flash of light go across the sky, much lower than these two objects.  At that point, I went inside my house.  I went back outside 12 minutes later, and the objects were no longer there. I am a 39 year old male.  I have a BBA in management and have worked for the same company in sales for 16 years. I have never seen anything before I believed to be a UFO and frankly did not believe in them.  Tonight I witnessed something that I can not explain.  Again, these objects were not any kind of commercial aircraft.  I do not believe any kind of military aircraft could make these erratic maneuvers.", "Bright light shining directionally out of a cloudy shape or object, got bright and smoky and then disappered.It was well after sunset and I went to the window of my hotel room to see the lights of the city and I saw what I first thought to be a helicopter shining a searchlight. As I watched it I realized I could not really see and object but a very bright light shining out of a smoky or hazy shape, moving west to east, light pointed to the north, not at the ground but horizontally to the north. It was almost as if a door or hatch was opened and a bright light inside was shininh out of the opening. It seemed to be emminating from a small cloud (sky was clear) or just a patch of haze. The was smoke billowing all around it which was illuminted by the shining light. THe light then got brighter and the whole area just disappeared leaving a clear sky, no smoke, no haze no cloud ,,,nothing, it was just gone, I had the sensation that it had collapsed into itself", "Late, cloudy night in Moca, Puerto Rico.  I saw immense, pulsing lights of varied colors slowing passing above the clouds.  Could not make out a shape but object was at least 2 or 3 footballs fields in size.  It moved very slowly from east to west by southwest.  After several minutes, I saw and heard two fighter jets roar past in same direction.  This pattern was repeated on at least 2 or 3 other nights sometime between 11pm and 2am.This happened sometime in November in Moca, Puerto Rico.  I came up from New York on vacation and was staying with an uncle on route 110, close to the town square.  It was cloudy and happened between 11pm and 2am.  I would see bright, colored lights pulsing above the clouds.  The object(s) moved in a west to southwest direction.  It moved very slowly.  I was facing south and saw the lights from the east as they passed overhead to west.  It took about 30 -60 seconds for it to pass and seemed immense because the different colors would pulse sporadically over a wide area as it moved west.  Several minutes afterward, 2 fighter jets would roar by in the same direction.  This went on for 2 or 3 nights.  I found out that this had been documented in November of 1997.  A friend lent me a book about sightings in Puerto Rico.  In there, to my relief, I saw a reference to the sightings.  It helped to reaffirm what I saw.  The book is in spanish but I don&apos;t know the name of it.  This is the second incident that I have submitted and will be submitting others.((NUFORC NOTE:  Date is approximate.))", "Witnessing what I saw that summer day in Sacramento still leaves me in awe.  My sisters and I saw an immense object hovering very close to our back yard.I remember this incident so vividly.  It was a clear, hot summer day around 5 or 6pm in Citrus Heights, when my sisters and I were socializing in our back yard.  I was 17 and my sisters 14 and 19.  Out of nowhere, a VERY LARGE saucer (50 ft or so)descended and was partially over our back yard--at the southeast corner approximately 70 feet away.  This saucer was a medium gray metallic color and had bright white lights that traveled in a circular motion around the perimeter--it was so immense and so close!  We couldn&apos;t see the top of the saucer because we were basically looking up at this object.  At first, we thought that it could be a military aircraft, but it was eerily silent, especially since it was stationary and hovering so close to us for some time.  Living in Sacramento for 16 years with four military airbases close by, I have seen every possible military aircraft that you can imagine--this was not an aircraft!  My sisters and I were hysterical while scrambling to get our polaroid camera; the picture  we attempted  to take came out blurred (strangely, it was still light outside and usually does not get dark until 8 or so during the summers in Sacramento).  We watched as the saucer slowly ascended and headed south.  Why am I reporting this story so late in life?  First, I didn&apos;t think anyone would believe me even though I have two sisters who could corroborate my story.  Second, there was a program on last night about UFOs (2/17/99) that compelled me to investigate after seeing an interview of an Ohio policeman who saw a saucer and described that it was so close but made no noise.  This was the first time I have heard a witness recount their experience which was somewhat similar to mine.  Finally, when a person experiences something of this magnitude, its disturbing; when there are so many people who have experienced this, but no real answers, it is extremely disconcerting.  I am not a &quot;spiritual&quot; person but a discerning individual who comprehends by facts. I felt the need to share my experiene in furthering the research of UFOs.  I want to know what I saw that day. My sisters and I are college educated, well read, successful and very normal people.  I am a vice president of a large high tech firm based out of Philadelphia and have been an executive in the high tech field since graduating from a university at the age of 21.", "Jet breaking sound barrier folowed by a bright green fireballMy wife had stopped by my place of work to meet me for my break.We stepped outside to have a cigarette. We heard a sudden sound of a jet breaking the sound barrier.(this is not very common in this area) I looked up in the sky facing north and said to my wife &quot;they are probably going to spray us (con-trails) at that instant the jet sound went away and I saw a brilliant green fireball shoot coming from the south to north, and from very high in the sky towards the ground and over north mountain range.It was partly cloudy and I could see it come in and out of the cloud cover, it lasted in my view about 2 seconds. This is the second green fireball I have seen in this area. In September I saw one in approximately the same place in the sky, except it came out of the east heading west and went over the horizon this was at dusk and it lasted about 3 seconds and was more parallel with the ground. Very awsome sight!!! Hope we can be of some help, and I appreciate all the hard work you do. I listen to Art every night and hear all the reports, just didn&apos;t think I would ever see anthing like this, now I have seen two. There is sure something to this, and with you and Art I believe we will find out someday. THANKS", "It seemed to be flying very low, without making noise. It was very big and it seemed to be that the front of the saucer was lighting up &apos;caus of the resistance with the air . So the front lighted up (quarter of a) moonshaped .It moved very smooth thrue the air.We (me and my girlfriend) were walking home , we were looking at the hyades, when suddenly my girlfriend shouts and points out to something I could not identifie. I could get a good look at it when it slided thrue the air  There was no tail(like a comet) it was too big to be an airplane flying so high that we couldn&apos;t hear the engines. It wasn&apos;t an airplane, it wasn&apos;t a comet, it wasn&apos;t a sky tracer nor a sattelite. I&apos;m very sceptic about this all and I really didn&apos;t believe in et&apos;s but now I do. I am sure that it was something we don&apos;t know , it might have been a strange nature effect, But I am sure that it is unknown. I already have read a lot of books about weird things in this life on earth, I know alot of weird nature effects, but this one is unknown!", "CIGAR-SHAPED CRAFT DISAPPEARED BEFORE OUR EYESI was at my friends house visiting with her and her daughter and son-in-law we were out in the back yard the sun was not quite setting the sky was very clear I looked up and noticed a cylindrical object that seemed to reflect the setting sun so that it stood out in the clear bluish sky. I pointed it out to my friends and as we watched it slowly glide over we thought at first it might be a blimp but it had nothing under it and it wasn&apos;t the same shape(it was thinner) we also noticed no sounds and since we seen planes earlier that we could hear we just stood there dumbfounded especially after it got to the area over their garage...it just started to disappear like it was going into a cloud but therewas no clouds in the sky at all.After it disapeared I said &quot;look there&apos;s another and it was followed by a third one that also disappeared in front of us. All we could do after this was look at each other in disbelief...we never heard anything on the news the next day or after that until a month or two later some people had spotted some strange object over Lake Erie.", "Travled very fast north to south. Lights on all points. Very little sound.The triangle traveled from north to south very fast.  I have a view of the sky of about 100 degrees and I live in a rural area of Santa Rosa. There is an airport about 10 miles west of us, and every departing plane can be heard. The object had four lights, one on each point and one in the center. The lights were red and blue as the object came toward me and while receding were white. None of the lights were blinking. The object also made little noise.  It sounded more like wind rustling through trees than anything else. And the object was traveling very, very fast.

The color shifted from red and blue while coming toward me, to white while receding.  There was also a fourth red light located in the center. The object traveled from the north toward the south (San Francisco) and was traveling fast.  In a view of about 100 degrees of the night sky, the object traveled that spanse in about 3 to 4 seconds.  There was very, very little noise.

The shape was fluctuating until after it crossed the road Then it appeared to have the shape of a &quot;Bird Of Prey&quot; (the Klingon warships fromStar Trek) is the only way I could describe it. then I realized it was being flanked by a regular jet airplane, military in nature, following to the right and just behind the object. They both disappered over the mountainous horizon.

PD))Possible abduction from my room.I had just laid down when I heard a high pitched whirring sound.Then a extremely bright light came through my window. I can remember grabbing my bed and trying to hold on because it felt like I was being absorbed into the light. The next thing I remember I was lying on a bed or table. The feel and look of the table was cold and had a gray porcelan look to it. It did not have legs but the base came from the floor. I was covered with a thin silver blanket it did not feel as if were made from cloth. There were several beings standing beside the table I believe 2 on one side and 3 on the other. On the side with 3 one stood by my head and tried to calm me as the others performed the procedures. He seemed to communicate to me telepathically I do not remember him speaking to me directly. I&apos;m not sure of the color but they were medium hieght. With two elongated eyes and a slit for a mouth.  He informed me that I would not remember this, that I would not be harmed and they would try not to hurt me. I remember this light above my head, it started at my head and slowly and extremely painfully moved down my body. It felt like I was being rolled by a rolling pin. When it got to my feet it stopped I was in alot of pain. I remember feeling like I was going tp puke as I was being told that they were going to make one more pass back up to my head. At that point I began pleading to be let go that it was to painful I could not take it. The being at my head then said something to the being that I took to be in charge thay seemed to have a little heated arguement. He turned to me and told me that I had years earlier ask them to come and that I would not resist. Then I remembered yelling into the sky years earlier with a friend that I wanted to meet and would be willing to be examined by a UFO. Now that they were doing it he said I was whining about it. A few more words were exchanged with his boss and the light began its trip back up. The one comforting me said &quot;We are sorry if we harmed you and scared you&quot; I lost it. I remember feeling  the beam place me in my bed and as I looked up the light left my room. I was scared ((word deleted)) I ran to my parents room crying and then I went to some of the windows in the house to look outside. My parents dismissed it. A few days later on the news a UFO was reported to have been seen in a city close to where I live. I have told only a few people but we joke about it. However I am tired of joking about it because it did happen. I remember it and I have tried to avoid reading or watching anything that might embellish my abduction. I trie! d to be calm and remember as much as I could because I knew no one would believe me. I think they put me back before they had finished. I was 21 or 22 years old.

I noticed what appeared to be two planets VERY close together in the sky at about 25-30 degrees above the horizon, one directly above the other above the other, about a finger nail&apos;s width at arms length apart.  Top light was bright and white, bottom was less bright and orange.I noticed these objects from a second story bedroom window at approximately 1945 on Feb 23 1999.  I had a clear, unobstructed view, the sky was clear and the moon was about a quarter full, fairly high in the sky, with a large round but fairly dim halo around it, but the objects did not display this halo. I believed them to be a planetary conjunction at first, but was surprised that I had not heard about this occurrence ahead of time, because it was very unusual and dramatic, and hadn&apos;t noticed anything like this the night before.  The objects appeared to be stationary.  The top light was bright enough to cause a starburst pattern in my glasses, which frankly annoyed me because I wanted a better view and could not get one because of the distortion.  The bottom object appeared to be a planet, I assumed Mars due to the orange coloring, and the top object was what I thought might be Venus, except that it was substantially brighter than I recall seeing it.  Neither object flashed or twinkled in any way.  I watched for approximately five minutes and then returned to work on my computer. My wife arrived home at about 2015.  I asked her if she had seen these objects and she stated that she had, just prior to pulling into the driveway.  I went back to the window to get another look, and both objects were gone.  I went outside to see if they had somehow moved out of view, which seemed unlikely if they were planets, but could no longer see them.  While I was watching, I noticed what was probably an airliner with an unusually bright pattern of flashing lights traveling west to east.  Ordinarily, I am not able to see aircraft structure at night, but in this case there seemed to be a wide body visible even when the lights were not flashing.  I do not necessarily believe that this aircraft was related to the other two objects, but it was unusual enough to catch my attention. The following morning (today actually, 24 Feb 99) on my way to work, I turned on the radio expecting to hear about the objects of the previous night and was surprised to hear that at approximately 0630 there were wide spread reports of fireballs and bright lights seen in various locations in northern Michigan.  I did not witness these objects, although I was awake when they occurred.  State Police are saying that these objects were probably meteors.  No mention was made of the objects of the previous night.", "A Bright red light in the southwestern sky approx. 45 degrees above the horizon.While driving along the highway about 60 mph I noticed this bright red light in the sky I would estimate to be as bright as Jupiter of maybe even brighter. As i drove the object did not seem to move in relation to the background terrain. I must have continued for 15 or twenty minutes before I stoped the car to get out and have a look at this thing. I stoped in the middle of nowhere on this desolate road and stared at this bright red light for few minutes when suddenly it began to slowly move about in the sky. First one direction and then another. I was with a friend and we both were in awe of whatever this was when the most extraordinary thing happened. Five jets began closing in on the object from seemingly out of nowhere. when they came to within about a moons distance from the object it just vanished into nothing. I returned to Las Vegas a few hours later and called Nellis Air Force Base to report the incident. They denied any knowledge of any sighting and said they knew nothing about any planes chasing anything. This I knew to be a lie, as no air force base could possibly be unaware of 5 jets chasing something within 50 to 100 miles of them. I have never been able to explain what this could have been and still have no idea. i", "While camping at the Burlingame State Park, Charlestown, RI, in August of 1964, my friend, Tommy, and I were looking over the pond at the campground. In the far distance, over the nearby ocean and near, I would guess, to Block Island, RI, a very bright light, like a bright star, came up out of the ocean at a 45 degree angle; it continued to zig-zag at 45 degree angles upward for a few seconds, as if gaining speed to get out of the earth&apos;s gravity, then shop straight up and out of sight.  We both looked at each other, amazed. No one we told believed us; I am 50 now, so we were about 15 at the time. We just happened to be looking in the right direction at the right time. I would imagine on a nice summer night, others saw the same thing, particularly people on Block Island, a tourist resort.  I would estimate the object was about 10 to 12 miles away, putting it very close to Block Island.", "Two craft near Camp Misery ranger station one large triangular one small, very small, cone shaped.Before midnight last night we saw one large triangular craft with no lights a few hundred feet off the ground. It was moving slowly through the valley down towards Big Fork Montana. One small, tiny cone shape with a yellowish orange top and bright white bottom zigzaged over the radio towers above camp Misery. The small one seemed to be going in and out of the valleys up and down the side of the mountain and darting around the large triangular shaped craft. The large craft turned and started moving north over the mountains and we lost sight of both of them. No lights were ever seen on the large one. It was kind of a purplish black glow. No sound from either of them. The smaller one went into a cloud and it looked like small lightning the way cloud lightning looks and reminded me of those things globes you run your hand around and the electricity follows your fingers around the globe. The lightning made no noise. We heard a faint rumbling sound a little time later. And heard aircraft about 30 minutes afterwards. Gary took pictures but don&apos;t know if they will come out said he got a shot of both of them around the radio towers together and a closer one of the smaller one as it went in the clouds and of the lightning.", "First appeared as a bright white light like an approaching airliner,seen from a vehicle traveling S.on Randall Rd.

Description: wing shaped (chevron),black, running lights on front edge of wing (red), larger than a single engine plane, smaller than jetliner. As I slowed the car down to pull over, the object appeared to be stationary (not moving forward) and did not make any sound at all. A friend later said that it must have been the stealth bomber here for the air show. My question is &quot; why was it hovering over a residential neighborhood in St Charles at 12:30 at night.

It was about the size of the moon on a clear night, but this night was partly cloudy. As I watched it it stayed there for a few min. and then seemed to go off into the west and disappear.

I was watching the stars as it was a very clear night at that time. I was looking at the moon which was about three fourths full, and also seeing some aircraft in the distance. I believe i was facing south east or east looking at the stars just below the moon when an object went from my right to the left, at level flight, no noise whatsoever, no lights of any kind traveling  above the speed of sound at a very low altitude ( a few hundred feet) above the trees in a residential area. I believe the ONLY reason I saw it, was because the moon was almost full and the object passed brtween me and the moon, the angle of the moon caused a reflection to shine off of the skin of the object. Same reflection as polished metal. The object left no trail to be seen (such as a shooting star) I&apos;ve seen shooting stars and all types of aircraft and this WAS NOT either one of them.", "I saw the object in the sky about 2 miles away, I pointed over and told my dad that he would see it once we passed a group of trees, but when we passed it, it was no longer thereas i said i saw it about 2 miles away while i was in the car with my father, I see a garbage can shaped object in the sky It was white and was moving in a strange way. First it moved up, then down, then all around like an apple in water. I pointed at it and said &quot;dad do you see what I see?&quot; He said no so i said &quot;wait till we pass these trees&quot; because we in like a rural area.

The night was clear, and in the sky in front of us a light appeared, followed by four more lights, all the same distance apart, all in a row.  They stayed stationary for about 3 min.  then they all went out, at the same time.  My husband and I were trying to figure out what we had seen, when the lights appeared again on the far left of where they had been before.  They appeared in the same manner, they came on one after the other.  Same distance apart and in a line.  Off again, and almost instantly, they were to the far right of us, in the same line, same distance apart.  The lights were a golden color, not like a regular color of light. While they were in the sky they were stationary.  I would have told someone about this earlier, but it was just to strange.

No noise, no trail, flying very low.  Possibly gray/silver in color.Around 2100 hrs I was sitting outside and saw a grayish/silver cigar like shape flying slowly across the sky going South to North (opposite of the flight path of aircraft going to Lambert Field).  It was flying very low and I could see obvious framework on the front end in a protruding triangular-like shape with an &quot;elbow&quot; on the side where I was viewing.  Similiar to placing a cigar into a large triangle and the bottom of the triangle being horizontal so it would be a stand if it were to land.  There were 3 large port- hole windows (that I could see) which illuminated bright white light.  There was no noise coming from it or any vapor trail.  It moved at a steady pace and kept going in a Northerly direction til out of site.  It really drew my attention not only because it was low but you never see any aircraft flying in that direction over my house because of the circling pattern of all of the aircraft waiting to land at Lambert Field.  Have also seen a bright green light falling to earth but it burned out right above my privacy fence so maybe SOME of the reports of the bright green glowing fireballs are just meteor showers even tho I must say I have never seen bright aqua-green meteors before.", "The craft resembled a large balloon.

All of a sudden my radio went dead and I glanced down at it to see what happened.  When I looked back up at the light a chill ran down my spine.  I still don&apos;t know what it was, but it scared me and I stopped my truck to look at it.  I don&apos;t know why I did this because I was so scared that I couldn&apos;t move.  It was above the field next to my truck.  It was a sphere that was glowing a blueish-pink and it was moving real slow.  I could hear this intense humming that I assume was coming from the object.  Then a beam came out of the bottom of it and it almost looked like it was searching for something.  The beam was just kind of combing the ground to the left and right below the object.  I decided to get out of my truck and look at it closer, but when I opened the door the beam went out and it stopped so I got back into my truck.  All of a sudden it just shot straight up into the sky and just kind of disappeared from the inside out.  When it disappeared my radio came on full blast and my windshield wipers turned on on high.  I was so scared that I drove the rest of the way home as fast as I possibly could and ended up sitting in my truck in the driveway for about 2 hours because I was scared to get out of my truck and go into the house.

It was heading down,right to left at a 45 degree angle until it went behind a mountain (Utah Hill).  It caught my attention just before it went out of sight.

Unfortunately, I was driving and it only caught my attention just before it went out of sight. It was heading downward, right to left at a 45 degree angle. The only characteristics that were different from a falling star were the color (bright green) and the time of day (sun up). Just last year, many citizens from St.George reported strange lights and contrails in the same location and direction of what I sighted today.  Those turned out to be missiles that were being tested over a test range which is near that same location. I&apos;m trying to seek a logical explanation for what I saw.

Over the trees I saw a large craft hovering noiselessly. It had a gray &apos;hull&apos; with a large white glowing dome on the top. There appeared to be portholes around it. The glow was so bright it illuminated the trees underneath it. I should have stopped because we were passing by and my sister was in the car reading and did not look up until I  started yelling &apos;Did you see it?!? Did you see it?!?&apos; By that time, the saucer was obscured by the trees, but she did see the very bright light. I turned around as soon as I could to come back for a second look but it was gone. I know other people must have seen this. There was quite a bit of traffic on Route 2 at the time.

First I have to say that I NEVER believed in any such thing as a UFO. Never - until last night. It was about 1:30 am and my husband and I were getting ready for bed. My husband decided to let the dog out to do its business before we went to bed. Thats when he saw a bright white light (similar to a star) in the sky. He began yelling for me to immediately come to his side. When I came he asked me to look up in the sky and tell him what I saw. I was in complete shock. There was a light flashing at approx. 1 second intervals with a red light on the left and a green light on the right. The red and green lights were also flashing but not in unison with the white light. My first thought was that it was a dying star, but why were there red and green lights? Then the object began to move in quick speeds, first moving vertically up and then vertically down. The speed of the light was simply amazing. It was not something humanly achievable. Then the light began moving at an angle (approx. 70 degrees NE) with quick speed and again resuming back to its original location. Anytime the light would resume back to its original location, the light would slightly oscilate until stability was reached.  At times the light was at a stand still and did not move. It appeared that the light was not in our atmosphere, but slightly above, hovering over it. Then the light began to move in arch like motion across the sky with great speed and again returning with great speed back to the original location. This was no airplane, helicopter, or any man-made craft. The speed of this light was very quick and swift. There are no airports near me, nor any lakes (this was not a reflection of any kind). I must also add that NO sounds were emitting from the light.  It was silent. The light maintained this pattern for approximately 3 hours. I would also like to add that I was not drunk, under the influence of anything, nor am I an insane person. I know what I saw - believe what you want.", "My 11 year old son and myself driving north on Military Trial saw bright light in sky.my son and myself saw a bright light.

The light then accellerated very quickly past the radio tower and made a &quot;checkmark&quot; turn back to the NW at a very high rate of speed.  There was no sound comming from that direction.  The object was about 2 miles away (guess).  We were both shocked and ran inside.  I immediately called the Sheriff&apos;s office to see if anyone else reported it.

No blinking lights, no sound (too far away), just a steady fireball-like trail, off in the horizon, set against a beautiful sunset.  It was really quite pretty. I don&apos;t know what it was and I couldn&apos;t identify it. I taped about 30 seconds of digital video (jvc digital video camera) and have no idea how to get a copy of the video to you (if you&apos;re interested).  Whatever it is, it&apos;s my only experience with seeing something I couldn&apos;t identify and therefore I&apos;m very proud of my little video!

It was seen again that night, see full descriptionMy boyfriend and I were &quot;parking&quot; close to my house when we saw a very bright light hovering extremly close over some trees. My boyfriend flashed the car headlights at it and it stopped it&apos;s movement which was very slow and started moving closer to us swifly. The aircraft followed us aprox. 1 mile then flew away very fast. We pulled of on a side road for about 5 min. When we gathered enough currage we begane to drive back to my house. On our way still shaken up I noticed a bright light small enough to be a big star. Within 30 seconds it was hovering right above us. The craft wasn&apos;t so bright when it was directly above us and I could see the siloette of it. It was oval with sort of a buble in the center. The monuverability of this aircraft was unlike any thing I&apos;ve ever seen it was as if it changed it&apos;s whole appeance. The craft then flew towards the south at a quick speed. Aircraft made no sound.((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what &quot;26:00&quot; hours means.  PD))", "Saw 2 points of light moving slowly across sky then after 11 minutes, 1 of them streaked off towards the east and was gone in 10-12 seconds.I was taking a lunchtime walk around an industrial area in Poway, CA on 02/23/96. At approximately 12:40 pm, I was heading in a NNW direction on Stowe Road, 1/4 mile north of Scripps-Poway Pkwy.  I looked up into the sky and noticed a white point of light about 60 degrees above the northern horizon.  It was slowly moving toward the south.  The weather conditions at the time were as follows:  mostly clear skies, scattered cirrus clouds, temperature about 65 degrees, winds from the SSW (both at the surface and aloft), with wind speed about 10 mph at ground level.  By 12:43 pm, the object became stationary at a position about 70 degrees above the northern horizon.  It appeared to hover in that position until 12:45 pm, when another similar object &quot;blinked on&quot; just to the east of the first object.  At that moment, both objects began to move fairly slowly towards the west, with the first object pulling slightly away from the second.  Both objects appeared to pass under the cirrus clouds in the area.  At 12:49 pm, the first object changed direction towards the SW.  The second object continued to move toward the west.  The distance between the two objects continued to increase to the point where I could no longer keep both of them in a single field of view.  At 12:51 pm, the first object was approximately 50 degrees above the western horizon when it suddenly streaked across the sky from west to east and disappeared over the eastern horizon.  The elapsed time of this high-speed exit from the area was 10-12 seconds.  I immediately looked back to where the other object had been, but it was gone.  I did not see it leave. I have made the following conservative altitude and velocity estimates: 1.  Scattered cirrus clouds at approximately 25000 feet 2.  Both objects were below the cirrus clouds. 3.  Distance travelled by first object during high-speed exit from the area assuming altitude of 15000 feet = 25-75 miles 4.  Estimated velocity of first object during high-speed exit = 6000-18000 mph It is clear to me that these objects were not conventional airplanes, balloons, meteors, stars, etc.  They moved against the wind, hovered and displayed high-speed characteristics beyond anything that I&apos;ve ever seen or heard.  At no time did I hear any sound from either of the objects.  There was no sonic boom during the high-speed maneuver.  Both objects appeared as white points of light with no other details observed.  They were both clearly under intelligent control.  The sighting took place in an area where there were frequent flybys of Navy F-14 and F-18 fighters returning to Miramar from training exercises over the Pacific.  However, no military or civilian aircraft were seen in the immediate area over the entire duration of the sighting. I believe my estimates of altitude and velocity are conservative, my gut feeling is that these objects may have been at an altitude closer to 25000 feet and the velocity during the high-speed maneuver may have been more like 20000-25000 mph.

It left a contrial and moved across the sky at about the same speed as a passenger planeAt 6:15 on Wednesday, 3/24/99, I was taking out the garbage. The sun was still shining. I looked up and noticed, what I thought was a very strange looking aircraft. I have an Air Force Intelligence background and I have never seen a plane like this. I ran inside and got binoculars to get a better look. The UFO, jet or whatever it was, was flying at about the same speed as a passenger jet, but was much larger than a regular jet. The object was a very highly polished silver. The only way I can describe it is like a cylider with what appeared to be two smaller cylinders attached to it slightly below. It looked like the fuselage of a jet, without wings and the jet engines (much larger than normal)attached to the bottom with a small piece of connecting material. It appeared to have a small canopy at the front of the craft. I observed it for at least 5 minutes until is flew out of view. There was no sound at all. I think it may have been an experimental aircraft.", "A very large yellow-orange disk hovered above the trees before appearing to degrade to a small round white light as it flew away. There was a time lapse involved between first sighting and take off.I was starting first grade, and remember this story well. Not knowing what i had seen, I described it to my classmates in full detail the next day, thereby I believe committing the encounter permanently to memory. I have not related this story to anyone else because, just telling my brothers about it, received so much skepticism that i allowed myself to just &apos;forget&apos; that it ever happened. I am now 28 years old, have a BS in Computer Engineering, and am a partner in a Computer Engineering Consulting firm. I feel that any public knowledge of what i am about to relate could be damaging to my credibility, and wish to keep this account anonymous as far as the public is concerned. But, i also feel i must finally relate this account to an authoritative source whom may be able to quell my concerns. In retrospect, I finally identified the time lapse that took place. This concerns me more than anything, taking into account my current state of mind. I feel that this encounter, as long ago as it was, may have changed my life significantly without even recognizing it, until now. It was late summer, 1975. My parents used to let one of my three brothers and i stay up an hour later than the rest once a week. We were all within a few years in age. That night, I was not the one, and was sent to bed at seven-thirty. It was just before twilight. The sun sets later this time of year (of course). The way the bed faced, i could see outside through two large(4&apos;x5&apos;) triple pane windows. I was almost asleep when something drew my attention outside. I opened my eyes to see what appeared to be a very large yellow-orange disk hovering above the trees. It was hard to say how far away it was. I stared at it. It made no noise, but again I was inside the house. The disk had two, relatively speaking, small bumps or turrets on the top and bottom. The sunset was beginning to turn the sky a pale red, pink color. The next thing i remember, it was pitch black outside. The disk degraded to a small round white light. At the time, i described it to my classmates as a &apos;headlight&apos; (as in a car headlight). The headlight zipped away at tremendous speed, and was out of sight within seconds.

I have not disclosed this information to any other source.

At the southwest corner of the valley, in the Santa Cruz range, sits Mt. Umnum.  Mt. Umnum was the sight of a very large and powerful US Air Force radar station. One clear cold autumn morning, I was sitting in my car, at the foot of Mt. Umnum, waiting for the rest of the crew to arrive, so we could begin our job of landscaping a new housing tract.  As the sun slowly began to ascend over the Hamilton range to the east, turning the sky above the still shadowy valley a bright blue, I noticed what appeared to be a morning star, or lingering planet above the fog enshrouded peak of Mt. Umnum.  As my gaze lingered upon the brightly shining object, I noticed that it appeared to be oscillating back and forth ever so slightly.   This immediately grabbed my attention, and as I now gazed intently at the object; it began to grow brighter, and appeared to get larger as it continued to oscillate ever so slightly. this process continued for about 2-3 minutes until the brightly shining object descended to the same altitude as the fog enshrouded radar station, and hovered there, still visible, about a half mile away from the station.  It hovered in this position for about 5 to 10 seconds, at which point it changed direction and headed directly for the radar station.  As it entered the fog bank, it literally burned a hole in the mist.  This hole lasted for several seconds before finally converging in on itself. This sighting leads me to believe that this particular fireball may have been of U.S. military origin, as the radar station was supposed to have a landing strip in it&apos;s proximity. The radar station has since been decommissioned.", "Cone shaped object,flashing colors(green,red,white,yellow),slowly moved to different locations in the sky and seemed to be huvering there, then disappeared in one hour.((NUFORC:  Report is not inconsistent with the many reports NUFORC receives of celestial bodies, I.e. &quot;twinkling&quot; stars and planets.

I never saw a shooting star like that and never thought of it anything more then that.

In the NW, I saw a blue-green fireball with a tail descending at a steep angle (on a clockface it would have fallen through 7:00).  It disappeared behind the hills above San Ramon Valley to the W and NW.  The object was the size of a large star.  With the arm outstretched and fingers on top and bottom of the tail, it would measure about 1 inch.  It&apos;s light was about the same brightness as planes flying overhead.  It was very visible though it was late dusk.  (It was only slightly smaller and much brighter than Hale-Bopp appeared in the bay area.)  My sense was that it was headed for the bay, which would have made it 13-17 miles away.

The light was really a jet ..since the air field ONLY supports CARGO airplanes...then this would mean that what i saw was more then likely a &quot;Covert&quot; Aircraft that was not supposed to be here.2). Training Manuevers with the idiot pilot not following safety regs. And had his lights off... but then this would bring me to the first anwser and since this craft is not currently under support in this trainign enviromment the question remains what exactly were they (the military) doing endangerering the public..as every one knows that it&apos;s agaisnt FAA Regs. to fly ANY type of AIRCRAFT without running lights!! 3). What i saw was really something unknown ..(wouldnt hold my breath any time soon!!) as a small note ... i called the operations NCOIC and he informed me that he was not aware of anything being out of the ordinary....but concidering what i was describing no running lights, my familiarity with diffrent aircrafts etc, he informed me that he would notify the tower and see what was hoing on&hellip;((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

In that show, Peter described (and played a tape of) several sightings of lights in the sky that were seen to apparently shoot out tracer-like light pulses. On about August 1 of last year, (I didn&apos;t record the date.) my wife and I were sitting on our front porch enjoying the evening, chatting and looking at the stars. I spotted a white light moving very high in the sky and remarked to my wife that I wondered if that was a very high aircraft or perhaps a satelite. There was no sound and, for that matter, I didn&apos;t expect any as it appeared quite distant even though it was moving across the sky fairly rapidly. We watched it for 2 to 3 minute during which time it progressed steadily moving approximately eastward. The direction and speed seemed to remain constant. The color and intensity of the light remained stead as well. Then, while we were watching, there appeared to be 3 or four streaks of light, very much tracer-like, extend out ahead of the light. The streaks were fainter than the light of object and extended directly in the direction of travel a distance corresponding to a distance that the object would have traversed in several seconds travel time. This occured twice. Both my wife and I were looking at the object and both of us saw the streaks. The two bursts of streaks occurred approximately 2-3 seconds apart. Shortly after the second burst, the object vanished as though the light were extinguished. The area of the sky that we were watching at that time had no obstructions or other fixed elements that could have come between the object and our line of sight. We watched the area closely for another minute or two, trying to see the object again or anything else, but nothing appeared. We saw nothing more that was out of the ordinary that evening.

When I looked up at approx 21:05, the object had vanished.When driving home from a cclass in the town of Eagar, AZ, I looked up to see a very bright light, almost exactly the same brightness as Jupiter, which was somewhat nearby. I slowed down to look at the object, and I saw that it was flashing and not moving perceptibly. However, it may have been moving toward me and I would not have known. I repeated this twice, each time noting that the light never moved. In the space of approx. fifteen minutes, I glanced from the object to the road and back every fifteen seconds on average. At approx 21:05, I looked up and observed the object again. I glanced down at the road and approx. five seconds later, I looked up and the light was gone. I slowed the car again and looked out of the windows in every direction, but could not find it.

As of two years ago (including tonight) I see at least two/three bobbing bright lights that I know are related to what I saw as a child. My husband and I last saw them July 1998 until tonight.  They gradually disappear out of view as if they just vanish in an instant.About 7 p.m. I was walking from the frontroom into the kitchen area.  I noticed through the window (facing the West) a very bright light that I have continuously seen all through my life.  I didn&apos;t want to scare my children so I had my husband look into the night sky. There were two of them off into the West sky, one close to the other. They were turning around and around and the lights of the two were a bright white and then green sparkle shimmer.  They were constantly bobbing around which I assume is because of communication. We watched for a while and after about an hour they started to phase out of sight and eventually were gone. They always appear in that area and have since I&apos;ve been a child. My one child claimed to me that in the middle of the night he was awoken by bright lights by his window. I don&apos;t want him to be scared like what I have been all these years, so I told him it was just probably car lights coming off the road.

I told my mother who could not see them, at first.  I waited until another plane was taking off. Just as the plane was to the left of where the crafts were I told her to look to the right of them.  She then saw them for herself.  I observed them for several minutes as they flew overhead at a very high altitude.  I hope these next dote show up as I would like them to .

I was driving down 67th avenue, going towards lakewood, when I saw this big fireball type object in the sky.  There were many cars on the road and they all slowed to about 5 mph gazing at the sky.  The object resembled a type of firework, yet much much much larger, about as big, lengthwise as two 747&apos;s, and as wide as two of the bodies.  the fireball was by and large all red and went down towards the ground very slowly.  At this point I thought it was a crashing plane or some new spectacular firework.  My view changed when the fireball suddenly began to rise again almost like a dragon during the celebration of the chinese new year.  A week later a person that I worked with explained that he had seen the same thing while working that evening and nobody believed him.  This is an extremely likel;y scenario because i had seen the object over fircrest golf club, where we both were employed at the time.  He said nobody else saw it because they were emptying the trash during the sighting, and during the summer months, the trash is done right around 10pm.  The sighting left me speechless, although I do doubt that it was an alien craft because it seemed to be ablaze, and totally unfit for life.((NUFORC:  A sighting somewhat reminiscent of this report was reported to us regarding an incident on 04JL98.  In the latter case, the report was accompanied by a video of the phenomenon.  In the latter case, the peculiar &quot;stream of fire&quot; turned out to be a helicopter with a type of sparkler, or spark generator, attached to it, and it was doing abrupt, aerobatic-style maneuvers.

The object was white, no lights, and appeared kite like,  the absolute shape was not identifiable because it didn&apos;t appear symetrical. At the distance I was at, the object would have appeared about a half an inch in an outstretched hand. It went round and round the cone in a sort of strange floating motion. The movement had characteristics like paper falling with that rocking back and forth motion or side to side motion, except this object wasn&apos;t falling. The object remained in a relatively horizontal flight path as the mean, but deviated up and down from the mean.

This was repeated 3-4 times then it disappeared.At about 17:45 on January 10, 1999, I was parked on Lake Lewisville just north of Dallas looking west. Just after sunset, there was a lot of air traffic as usual (I do this very often) and two high flying jets flying straight with long tails from southeast to northwest. These continued on their path for the full event. Just above the horizon at about 3 degrees, I noticed what I thought was another airplane with an orange reflective tail moving from northwest to the southeast. Looking at the map and from my previous experience, this craft was flying over Flower Mound and disappeared just north of DFW Airport. This one was very different from the other two. I got out my binoculars and followed it across the sky for about 15 minutes. It began zigzaging to the east and then back on course. During the zigzag, the tail got much larger and brighter. Then suddenly, during the last five minutes I saw it, a bright white light &quot;jumped&quot; in front of the tail (at least a few hundred feet or more) with the tail becoming much shorter. The light jumped in front of a rapidly dissipating tail at least 3-4 times and then it was just a light which suddenly disappeared. This event was not at any angle -- horizontal though it rose a bit as it got closer.", "I&apos;m an Engieer and former Air Traffic controller. I spotted a Green Fireball. I waited to hear someone else report this but none els has stepped forward. So I&apos;m reporting it myself.I Teach Swimming on Tue &amp; Thurs. I was leaving the Aquatic center ,headed north. I was stopped at a red light when I looked up anb spoted a Green Fireball. I have bee a sky watcher all my life. Shooting stars/metiors tend to &apos;burn out in about 1 second. This fireball lasted a lot longer and  never did &apos;burn out&apos;. It was huge (about half the diameter of the moon). It was in the north.westernn sky. It had a trajectory of due north. It appearded to be decending until it finally switched off. (it did ndeminh in intesisty) It just went out like a candle. It was Green in color but the perimeter was red/orange.  It did not change directions or make any manuvers to indicate a controllable aircraft.  I could not acertain altitude. However It was not a natually occuring item/event. I will include my personal info. However, I make my living in the technical community and do not wish for you to publish my name or personal info. fcontact you i", "Our dog was barking so I went to investigate. While watching the dogs outside I noticed a very bright light that seemed to be coming towards my home from about 10 to 15 miles away. I thought nothing of it until it started drifting slowly up then down then around but generally in the same spot. It began quickly flashing orange lights then dimmed into the darkness but quickly lit up again w/a bright white light. It continued w/this flashing pattern for the duration of the event. It never got any closer or further away until about 6 a.m. then it slowly lowered below the treeline out of sight. I woke my husband after watching it for the 1st min. or so. He was intregued enough to watch the entire event. The event occured in the western sky at varying distances above the neighborhood treeline. We couldn&apos;t detect a shape for sure. Only flashing lights that seemed to surround the object.", "Similar to a Shooting Star, but not! Brillient Bright Green in color with sparkling long tail.I just heard you on the &quot;radio show&quot;, and would like to offer you &quot;My Experience&quot; with a most elegant sighting. I actually live in Central Washington State, but I was in California at the time visiting my Mother.  The date was specifically October 5th, 1998 and it was in the evening, about 8:00 PM California time, and it was dark. I was in the parking lot at my girlfriend saying good night when her little boy of 10 years old said &quot;Look at that!&quot; I turned and viewed one of the most elegant things I&apos;ve ever seen! With my wide span view between the trees I saw very long streak in the sky moving on a horizenal plane. It was moving similar to a shooting star, with an extremely long tail, and it was the most brilliant &quot;Green&quot; color I&apos;ve ever seen. The front was much larger and brighter than the trailing edge, and I noticed that it was moving slower that a shooting star, but still a a great speed. Surprisingly, it appeared very low in the sky. (About 20 to 30 degrees above the horizen.) It had a &quot;flat&quot; trajectory (no movement up or down) and the sight lasted at least more than 10 seconds in clear view. Along the trailing end, which I repeat was very long, there were tiny (but fine) speckles of white &quot;glitter&quot; like from the a ferry&apos;s wand. The actual tail of this thing appeared to be over 20 miles long. It was identical to the one the lady described when you played her voice recording on the radio show. I had a 90 degree clear view horizonally of this thing and it was simply remarkable. As my back was facing the ocean, I viewed this as it was moving from my left to my right side. This means I was facing a easterly direction. (with a little North added) I was actually in &quot;Dana Point&quot; California one block from the ocean, facing towards the approximate direction of San Antinio Peak which is located about 20 miles NE of Ontairo. (I&apos;ve done a lot of flying in this area.)  So this thing was coming from... a Northly direction, and going to a Southerly direction. Almost the opposite direction of the Lady&apos;s sighting. Now this lady I dicribed above just had her sighting tonight 12/18/98, while my &quot;identical&quot; sighting in California was on 10/5/98 . Over 2,000 miles of seperation! I am a former Deputy Sheriff and former Police Officer. I also have a Commercial Pilot license, and I know what I see, when I see it. I hope this sighting helps. Thank you for being there!", "Briefly observed black, silent, slow-moving object low enough to reflect ground lights from bottom, convex surface.On 10/31/89, I observed an anomalous object in the fully dark night sky above El Jebel, Colorado (Eagle Cnty.). My family and I had just stepped out of our car after parking at the curb in a residential area that we intended to canvas for the purpose of trick-or-treating. It was fully dark, and a completely clear evening with no clouds. As my wife was getting our two boys&apos; costumes in order, I looked up into the night sky. Immediately, I observed what appeared to be a moving area of the night sky directly above me, through which the stars were totally obscured. I could not estimate the shape or size of whatever caused this phenomenon. There was no sound. There were no lights that seemed to be associated with the cause of the hidden stars. The only suggestion of the object&apos;s shape and altitude was that the bottom of the object appeared to be convex because I could see groundlight from the homes around us reflected from its surface. There were no lights in the neighborhood brighter than a streetlight or a porchlight. Therefore, I surmised that a dark object must be fairly low in altitude to reflect dim lights in such a manner. It moved steadily, and if at low-altitude, slowly from the NE to the SW (generally in a line from El Jebel, CO towards Mt. Sopris, a 12,900 foot mountain that serves as a handy landmark for residents of the Valley). The sighting lasted for approximately 5 seconds. Although I pointed and yelled, &quot;Look!&quot; no other member of my family saw the object. Observer background: 37-year-old male. B.A. in Anthropology. At the time of the sighting I was a part-time real estate salesperson. My vision is good with eyeglass correction, and my hearing is normal. I was familiar with the neighborhood in which the sighting ocurred as I had lived there for a period of 6 months two years earlier. I revisited the exact spot in the daylight to determine if there were any overhead powerlines that might account for my impressions, but there were none. I had never seen anything like this before that time, and I have not seen anything like it since. I did not report the sighting because I regarded myself as a &quot;bad witness.&quot; I have read about the subject extensively, and I had heard a re-broadcast of Orson Well&apos;s &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; earlier the same day. However, I must report that if I had had to describe what a UFO looked like earlier that same day, it would NOT have been as a silent, black object.", "Triangulation radar fix (USAF, civil, Navy).  I ordered intercept by SAC B-29.  B-29 tracked object. Central fire control system locked on, armed itself, prepared to fire.  Object then left area at estimated 4,000 knots.At the time noted I was a S/Sgt. in SAC, 2nd AF, 6th Air Div. assigned as ((position deleted.)). Was &quot;volunteered&quot; to join a Captain as investigator of UFOs.  Capt. handled off-base sightings (they were more fun) and I was stuck with military cases. This occurred at MacDill AFB, Tampa. About 9:30 p.m. one night in Aug. 1952 I received a call from the Base Operations officer (a Lt. Col.)  He was a little miffed to be re- porting to an enlisted man but such are the curiosities of the military. The Captain was out of town. The Lt. Col reported that a UFO was cruising over the base at 40,000 feet, 400 knots.  This was serious; we had A-bombs at MacDill. I de- termined there was no civil traffic within 300 miles. The object was being radar tracked by MacDill, the Navy, and Tampa civil. I de- termined there was a B-29 (ours) on a downwind leg to land. He had 5 hours fuel left. I ordered the pilot to up his gear and take a look-see. At midnight the Pilot reported that he had tried to close with the object. He was at 20,000 feet; the object at 40,000. Of course, the B-29 was woefully slow but as he turned toward the UFO his central fire control system radar-locked on the target, armed itself, and prepared to fire.  At that moment the UFO changed course and left the area at an estimated 4,000 knots. Next morning the pilot reported to my office.  He was a full Colonel, a command pilot with 27,000 hours in the air. One of the top men in SAC.  He gave me his preliminary report and said he would send his waist scanner, a M/Sgt., down to supply details. The whole crew saw it....a bright white oval light. A hard radar target. Since I had no orders to the contrary, I printed the story in the base newspaper and offered it to the Tampa newspaper. Believe it or not they turned it down, refusing to print it because the M/Sgt was black!  A.P.  found out and was furious. Sent a man out to get the datails. Another oddity.  Just before the Colonel came to my office I received a TWX from the Pentagon. From a general. It said: &quot;Any of our people who see flying saucers have holes in their heads.&quot;  That Colonel yelled &quot;b((deleted))t&quot; in the loudests and most authoritative tone I&apos;ve ever heard. Eventually the Captain wrote a report of the more than 1,800 sightings we handled. A large number (more than 280) were absolute un- knowns. That report stated that &quot;In our opinion we have no option but to conclude that we are under surveillance by intelligent life of extraterresrial origin,&quot;  I also signed that report. I remember the Captain said: This report will never see the light of day.&quot;  He was right. For the record I served three years in USAF, later worked as a reporter/city editor, and spent 7 years with NBC-TV. I was a reporter/producer of news documentaries and won six national awards including three Emmys.  I&apos;m not a kook. Yet. -((Name deleted))((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

There was a very small glowing blue flame behind the object resembling a road flare.  The object didn&apos;t appear to be traveling in an arch or at a speed greater than sound.  After a few seconds, the object seemed to break apart slightly finally become consumed by the bluish glow until it simply fizzled away.", "saw a dark triangle shapes craft with very large white lights on the rear corners and also on the front all light were on the bottom of the craft. I had never seen an airplane with such large lights, 3 feet accross. I do not know how large the craft was. But it was at least 40 feet and less than a quarter mile away. as it proceeded to clime I noticed several red lights at the rear. They were not blinking.", "The disc was acompanyed by two other craft before it flew off at high speed and it was a reflective silver with lights around the rimMy friend said hje was woken at about 1:30 by a loud huming noise looking out the window he saw a sliver disc shaped craft hovering about half a mile away from the house it had a ring of flashing lights around the rim of  the craft it it hovered there for about 3min  then 2 black helicopters flew over the house towards the disc. the disc accellerated rapidly northwards from the helicopters and and dissapeared over the horrizon.", "Clearly observed a triangular craft outfitted with three bright lights.  Object made no sound and floated perfectly still for around four minutes.As a Police Officer for the North Little Rock Police Department I once held a part time security job for a large apartment complex on the North side of town.  I was compensated with a free apartment and was required to secure three different one-level professional buildings  as one would occasionally be accidently left unlocked. In July of 1996 my wife accompanied me to help check the doors, shortening my required walk.  Coming upon the last building my wife and I again met up at which time we noticed an unusual type of light reflecting on the pavement 50-100 yards in every direction.  The light closely resembled the light emitted from late model Lincoln headlights  (a new type of halogen bulb) and had sort of a purple tint.  In total amazement we both looked up to observe some sort of craft hovering in total silence  around 300 feet over our heads.  The craft had very bright white lights placed in a triangle and no other lighting.  The brightness did not seem to correspond to the level of light hitting the ground as if it were diffused on its way down.  The craft remained motionless until we could get to our apartment (approx. 1 block) in an attempt to get my binoculars.  We observed the craft the entire way to the apartment and actually began to feel uneasy about the ships presence. Unfortunately the ship was gone when we came out of the house with the binoculars and we were never able to observe the ship moving. I grew up within a mile of an airport and have seen every type of aircraft and its lights and this was not a conventional aircraft of any sort.", "Clear night.  Wife and I saw circle of lights, green, bluish on stationary object about 200-500 feet.  Suddening object moved right and upwards at unbievable speed and disappeared", "Watched a strange light for about an hour. During its flight, it made numerous odd flight changes, including bouncing up and down like a ball. It also changed shapes, including separating into 3 individual lights. At one point it seemed to change into a mist like form, but was still illuminated and visible.While on a fishing trip at Heron lake in Northern New Mexico, I witnessed a strange light rise very quickly above what appeared to be the Taos area, in the East from where we were. The light was constantly changing colors from green to red to white to blue. I thought it was a military helicopter because they are always up in that part of the wood, but then it shot straight towards us, real fast like. We&apos;re talking 100 miles of ground between Taos and Heron, and that thing zipped it in thousands of a second. It stopped like almost over the lake, but must have been up around 8,000 feet or so. It continued to hover in place and change color for approx. 10 minutes or so. At this point I woke my daughter to see the UFO, cause it was almost 3am by this time and my fishing party was all bedded down for the night. We sat and watched and even tried to wake the others, but they dismissed me as being drunk or tired or something, which I was not. I continued to fish and to watch this THING, and we began to talk about it, when it started to change. It slowly seemed to vaporize. It turned into a cloud, but was still illuminated and was quite visible. It stayed in this form for about 5 minutes or so and then became one solid light again. At this point my daughter got scared and went back inside the camper, she&apos;s only 8yrs old, and this was something that really struck her as odd. I reeled in my fishing line and just sat there letting the fire die and watching alone when the thing started bouncing up and down at a very fast rate. It resembled a rubber ball, just bouncing up and down for at least 4 or 5 minutes and then stopped. Then it started to go from side to side, back and forth, at what seemed the same distance of travel each time for about the same duration of time as before. Now I was becoming scared, and was putting my gear away, when it stopped and then split into three separate lights, and formed a triangle and remained motionless for what seemed 15 minutes. I smothered the fire and sat in the door way of the camper and watched as it re-shaped into one solid light again. Now it was close to 3:30 am or so and when I got up to go inside, it shot off towards the West towards Dulce New Mexico, about another 40 miles or so. That was the last I saw of it, when it positioned over Taos before I went to bed. This is the 3rd strange object I personally have seen in this area, and is the longest viewing and strangest of all my encounters while in this wilderness area.", "saw 3 triangle craft followed by regular small prop plane. these craft made no sound,had marker lights, no strobesOn the above date and time while in route to flagstaff az. I was alerted by my passenger mrs.bobbie sue cahhal. that there were some strange lights outside the left side of our vehicle. At that point I saw three crafts of some kind approaching. I was looking out my driver side window,which would be looking north west. I saw 3 craft with a steady red light on the left and a steady white  light on the right . I thought this was strange due to the fact that faa regulations require a strobe on all aircraft. I estimate the craft were around 300 ft and moving around 40-50 mph.as the craft went over head I pulled to the side of the road. It was a large moon and as myself and the passenger looked up we observed the triangle shaped craft fly to the north east. these craft made no sound .at that time I observed a small prop plane following these craft at a safe distance.I ((Name deleted)) saw the above craft and swear that the above statement is true and correct.2-12-99", "i witnessed 3 crafts, in the sky, with strange lighting, and suspicious movements, tonight at about 9:00pm over dyer mountain, near Lake Almanor, CA.At 9:00 pm, out for an evening walk, i noticed what appeared to be an airplane flying southeast over dyer mountain. It was moving quite slowly, white and red lights flashing.  i then witnessed it to completely change directions, suddenly, headed back towards where it came.  two more craft then appeared, towards the north, with red lights, not flashing. they moved suspiciously together, then apart, moving to and from, not in straight lines, neither vertically or horizontally.  the first, seemingly larger craft then &quot;joined&quot; the two others, and they flew off slowly over the mountain.  for about an hour afterwards, i noticed a remarkable number of planes flying over the area, about 1 every 60 seconds.  the sighting of the craft lasted about 60 seconds before they flew out of sight.  just an ordinary evening stroll turned quite curious.  this was the first sighting of this type i have ever had.", "Witness a oval/diamond shaped object 40 feet in front of us that was pink and appeared to flash.A short distance from our house, (down the road) my mother and I witnessed an oval/diamond shaped object surrounded by a misty pink light that seemed to have &quot;flashed&quot; .  It was hovering approximately 40 feet above the road in the northeast region of Knapp Road in SherburneWit. We watched it continue in that direction until it disappeared.  My grandparents told us that they heard a sound like someone was &quot;blowing into a bottle&quot; at the time we saw the object.  We did not hear anything because we were inside the car.  We heard strange &quot;howling&quot;/ &quot;air-movement&quot; sounds for the next few hours but it was not windy out.  Our family has witnessed two other sightings in the past two years, in the month of October.  Both times there were three yellow, oval/diamond shaped objects in the eastern sky around 9:30 pm and lasted for about three hours.  Each object moved separately and sporatically, but kept the same distance between themselves. They moved at very high speeds. We did not see them leave.", "1st sighted a bright white flashing lite about 6 times the size of the surrounding stars. A mile further observed a 2nd separate, independent lite. The 2nd lite split and became two lites moving together, with no sound I could hear. The 1st lite remained constant. Pulled over and stopped again, and the 2nd lites turned and became three lites in a row with the  middle one flashing. It turned more and I saw a fourth lite creating a diamond shape. Then the object moved behind the hill I was parked by. I continued to drive up the mtn, and observed the 2nd lite occasionally through the trees. I stopped a third time on top of the mountain when I could see the 2nd lites again. It made a deep rumbling sound and was in a diamond shape with a darker blackness between the lites which blocked out the stars behind it. It moved to the south.At 19:15, while driving N on Hwy 70 at the Hwy 191 exit to Paradise, I observed a flashing white lite, brighter and bigger (maybe 6 times bigger than the surrounding stars), in the sky above Paradise. I looked at the digital clock in the car. About one mile further, I saw a 2nd lite NE of the 1st. At first I thought it might have been a reflection in the windows, so I pulled over, stopped  the engine, and rolled down the window. It was a dark clear cold nite. The 1st lite was still constant in the same place in the northern sky above Paradise. The 2nd lite split into two lites, fairly horizonal in the sky. There was no sound. I proceeded to drive NNE on Hwy 70, sighting both the 1st and 2nd lites the whole time, and turned W on Pentz Rd. Here, (4.8 miles from the Hwy 191 cutoff) I pulled over a second time, turned off the engine, viewed the 1st lite in the same place in the sky, now left of my position, constantly flashing on and off. The 2nd lite seemed to turn and the left lite split into two, making three lites in a row with the middle one flashing. It continued to turn, while hovering in the same place, and I saw a fourth lite creating a diamond shape, with the middle flashing lite of the first three slightly ahead of the other two. It was now 19:25, I was parked facing WNW and was viewing the lites by ducking my head a little and looking out and up of the passenger side front windowshield to the N. I held up my hand, and the four lites, if they were at the outside corners of an object, would make the object about as long as my thumb (maybe 1.5 inches). The object then moved behind the little hill I was parked beside. I continued W on Pentz Rd, nearly driving off the road to keep the object in site! Pentz Rd then turns and heads NE, up the mtn. I lost sight of both the 1st and 2nd lites at times as the road climbs the mtn. On top of the mtn on Pentz Rd, (at 6.2 miles from the Hwy 191 cutoff on Hwy 70) I again sighted the 2nd object. I stopped the car (third time), turned off the engine, and rolled down the window. The car was facing N, and the object was in the sky to the W of me traveling in a S direct! ion. Now I could hear the wind in the trees and another deeper rumbling sound that seemed to be coming from the object. It was about three inches wide in the sky and there was a darker blackness between the lites which blocked out the stars behind it. I viewed it for perhaps three minutes before it went behind the trees. It was now 19:40  and I continued on my way home to Magalia. On Jan. 9th, my husband and I traveled the route again at the same time as the sightings on Jan. 8th, and took the mileage readings. Unfortunately, there was a pea-soup fog in the valley, so at the first two places I stopped we could not view  the sky.", "Two stars in west sky about 30 degrees above horison were moving back and forth. Then I saw only one. It was moving in a strange way up and down and then up and down. I noticed them because I was looking at some strange contrails in the sky on my way home that night. They were very strange. The contrails were at night lit up by the full moon. They were also very wide, low to the horison, and crisscrossed in loops, mt least 4 or more that I could see. Then the contrails got very wide and stayed in the sky a longer time than usual. Then the clear sky became full of many small clouds. Just filled the sky. Where did they come from I don&apos;t know.

Another object appeared, similar size and shape, shortly after and merged, combined (as if liquid form).  The objects separated once and the lower portion decended once again.

The light was seen while motoring west on U.S. highway 78 approximately 2 miles east of Stone Mountain Park, GA. This area is a densely populated suburb of Atlanta, GA. The local temperature was approximately 38 degrees F with clear cloudless skies and a brisk wind from the north. The light was approximately 20-25 degrees above the local horizon, was mostly circular and yellowish at its center fading to orange at its perimeter. It had no noticeable irregularities in shape, had no visible tail or contrail, was approximately 4-6 times the diameter and brightness of the brightest star, and was visible for approximately 15 seconds prior to its sudden and silent explosion. Upon exploding, the object split into two fiery fragments which rapidly descended toward the ground. Smoke was visible around the area of the original object and behind the descending fragments. The smoke appeared dark against the dusk sky and expanded in an irregular inverted triangular pattern. The two fragments descended southward toward a line of trees and disappeared from sight prior to reaching the horizon. This event was observed by one adult female and two adolescent male children.

The object appeared without sound, jumped to two different locations and then disappeared.The object was approximately the size of two 747&apos;s one on top of the other and had muted lights going around the center of it, in this sequence red, yellow, green,blue.The object made no sound and hovered for about 10 seconds, jumped to another location for about 2 seconds, then again for the same duration and then disappeared. It was an overcast evening, the ground was covered with snow and it was in a very well lit park at the edge of Carlton University campus. The park was deserted but there were cars driving directly under the object. The conclusion that my friend and I made was that it was undeniably extraterrestrial and could not possibly be an experimental craft or any other form of illusion ie: balloon.  When the object jumped from one location to another it was an approximate leap of 500 feet.", "A very bright green light traveing  vertically VERY fast ,, then dissapearedWhile traveling west bound on I-80 ( ohio turnpike )  past ravenna , Witnessed a bright green  round object  traveling  vertically. It was very fast, and dissapeared before the  horizon ... It did not fade out  when it dissapeared, it just vanished... Had to be a good 10 miles away from my vehicle I was traveling in ( IMO )  It was much too fast to be an airplane, and I have seen shooting stars before,, and they  fade through the sky,,,, this DID NOT it just vanished!  My buddy in a vehicle behind me  experienced the same thing", "Large, motionless, thimble-shaped object radiating bright light from big windows, 1000 ft. over I-5.My UFO sighting began when I noticed an extremely bright light in the night sky over I-5 in northern California on or about 9/21/96, between the towns of Willows &amp; Maxwell.  I was driving to work about 9:30 p.m. and saw what I took to be a CHP helicopter illuminating the freeway with a searchlight about 5 miles ahead. (This area is flat and the freeway lies in an almost straight line for miles.)  As I drove closer, I  realized the light was not circling the freeway but remainded absolutely motionless, and that instead of a searchlight, what I was seeing was radiated light coming from inside some type of large craft or object.  It was hovering about 1000 ft. above the freeway and as I drove almost directly under it, I could see it had a &quot;thimble&quot; shape (larger end up). I could view it clearly because of all the light that was coming from the large windows that surrounded it. I thought about stopping for a better look but didn&apos;t have a camera (naturally), and also thought to myself, &quot;Sure, get a real good look, like Travis Walton did,&quot;  so I kept going. I tried to watch it with my head out the window as I passed under it, but almost lost control of the car so I focused on driving and lost sight of it--nothing in the rear view mirror to indicate whether it was still there after I&apos;d passed. There was normal traffic on the freeway that night and I regretted not having  a CB radio, because the truckers sure must have been hollering about it...", "Heard airplane, looked up and saw silver sphere.I was playing golf at the Auburn public course, with a co-worker and another twosome.  I do not recall the names of the other two.  The sky was high and clear.  We had not heard, or at least had not taken note of, an airplane all day.  While waiting to tee off on the 16th hole, our conversation was interrupted by the loud noise of airplane engines. We all looked up to see if the plane was in trouble.  It was a DC-9. The plane was about 5000 feet(guess) climbing and banking hard left to the ENE.  I was studying the silver ball, that the plane seemed to be trying to avoid, when my co-worker said, &quot;Hey!  There&apos;s a UFO!&quot;.  The object was perfectly round, bright silver, and its diameter was about 1/4 of the length of the fuselage of the aircraft.  The object was moving very slowly toward the nose of the plane.  The plane missed the ball by approximately half a mile and flew away safely.  None of us noted the carrier&apos;s name.  The ball did not follow. It changed direction to E, increased altitude.  We assured each other that we all saw it. We played on, checking it every few minutes.  It continued to move slowly to the E. After several minutes, we lost track of it.", "Myself and my wife while sitting at a traffic light saw what looked like a green fire ball, slightly smaller than my pinky finger if held at arms lenght.  appeared to have possibly burned up, may have been a meteor. but not sure.", "a little ball of light making little circles in the skyI was in the batchroom and I thought I was seeing things, maybe that is still the case but I looked out the window and I saw the little ball of light and it wasn&apos;t too far up in the sky.  It was making circle motions fairly fast and then it would stop for a second and then start up again and I went outside to take a better look.  Well, it had started moving slowly toward me and when it passed over head I saw that there was a red light on it and I could hear it but it was a very low sound.  Not something that a plane would make I don&apos;t think.  So it might be my eyes deceiving me or it was indeed an unidentified flying object.", "Looked up into night sky and saw a light that at first we thought was a helicopter with a spotlight until the object left but the light slowly faded away.It was at a local soccer field after dark.  The field are well lighted and there were 12 possibly more witnesses. We were talking when someone motioned to look up at the sky toward the southwest.  There we could see a small bright light just below the cloud covered sky.  It was sort of a cigar shape and had a larger light fanning out from it toward the north.  At the tail end of the fanned out light was a blue-ish round light with what appeared to be a tail or streak of red behind it. It made no sound and never approached any closer. I estimate it was about an eighth to a quarter mile away from us. We at first thought it was a helicopter hovering a distance away then the small cigar light disappeard into the clouds yet the fanned light and blue streak remained to fade out slowly over a 5 minute period.  Moments later a real helicopter came into view but it was of a different shape and we could hear the noise of the propellers.", "Green Fireball along side auto.  Changed direction, and seemed to accelerate at great speed and dissappear within seconds.Sighting corroborated by local radio station KSFO 810 AM.Feb 11, 1999, Driving home from work in Sunnyvale CA. North on highway 680, to Antioch, CA., I could see Saturn, Jupiter, and Venus all lined up out of my car window to the west. Every few minutes, I would take a quick peek as I was driving. It was finally a very clear night and could not wait to get home to take a look around the night sky with my 4 inch binoculars. As I drove East on Highway 4, at the top of Willow Pass in Pittsburg, CA., at 7:20 PM. My attention was caught by a very bright green light flying next to me. My Corvette is very low, so it appeared to me (after looking at it) that the green fireball was less than a mile away from me to the North, and maybe 1000 feet high. My stereo was on, but I thought I heard a noise more than the wind rushing past my window. I was driving at about 85 mph, in the left lane, in traffic, so I know others saw it. I was able to look at the fireball for only a few seconds at a time, because I was driving. The Green fireball was not as bright as a welders arc, but had about the same sharp clarity with a lite green tint. It appeared kind of egg shaped overall, white in the middle, and a difficult to percieve tail of green flame. It was bright enough to where it was hard for me to see detail. Its size could be compared to a small pager (beeper) held at arms length. When my attention was first drawn to the bright clear green light, it was at the rear of my drivers side window. Because of my speed, I looked for 2-3 seconds, drove, looked 2-3 seconds, drove, looked 2-3 seconds. Because I thought it was right next to me, it appeared to be going about", "It was a long light, blue with a purpleish tint.  Resembled a shooting star, but appeared and disappeared but ended before the horizon.", "I work in a suberb of milwaukee ,Wi and it is not really that unpopulated , however i get off work at 2:30 and about 5 min into my ride home i saw what looked like a diamond or a arrow head and it scared me so bad i had to pull over to the side of the road it was really low and it was as black as the sky however i could see the outline of whatever it was . And boy was it moving fast .all i saw then  was a dim blue type outline as it went on a angle from low west to straight up and east toward lake michigan.it was then gone so i went to get gas at a station up the road and i just couldnt keep this to myself so i mentioned it to the clerk and he really did not understand me because i dont think he could speak english to well. He just looked at me took my money and said ,thank you. so i came home and sat here a few and i went crazy thinking who do i tell and who dont i tell. dont want to be in a rubber room .so i went to my web tv and used the search mode to find this site.i also want to say that i did drive past are airport just to see if i could see anything strange .we do have a base here but they dont have the stealth bomber as far as i know and that is what this object kind of looked like but made no noise and no lights besides the dim blue outline.", "i was driving on i49. when my tractortrailor started to vibrate vilently i stop the truck to see what was wrong. after i stoped i got out and a light hit the area it was like daylight i couldnt tell where the light was coming from.no noise was made the light lasted about a minute the vibration was still there like a earth quake mayby then the light and vibration stoped suddenly. thats was it then it was dark again.same story as summary", "We were looking up at the sky when my associate pointed out a dot moving across the sky, when I looked at it more closely it was moving in a wavey fashion so I knew it wasn&apos;t a satelite.

We returned one hour later with two more people and they witnessed one object moving very strangely across the sky.  Then this object dissappeared among the stars.The first description is as accurate as I can write.", "Aircraft looked like a 747 three times its size.  At each wing tip were much smaller aircraft. A probe went to the ground from the belly.I left work that evening between 8:00 pm and 8:30 pm.  I walked out the main entrance that faces South and saw a low flying aircraft that looked like a 747 three times its size on a slow approach.  Concerned that a jet craft was in trouble and was attempting to land I went back into the building.  As it continued to approach I got oncerned that it was going to hit the building so I went back outside to the parking lot to get to my car.  I heard an extremely loud hum from the aircraft and relized at that time it was hovering about 300 feet in the air approxiamately 1/8 to 1/4 of a mile from my position.  The main body of the craft had approxiamately 8 to 10 portals which shinned red.  At each wings&apos; tip, which spanned an estimated 250 yards, where red shinning lights.  From the belly of the main craft appeared a probe which dissappeared into the trees.  Eventually the wing tip lights separated from the main craft&apos;s wings and one flew East and the other flew West. A few minutes later the main craft flew South West and dissappeared over the mountains.  The entire form of the craft(s) were vague -almost opaque.  The red portal lights were prominent.  It looked like a jet liner on approach in a fog, however, the evening was clear and most important was extremely windy.  Wind gusts in the mountain that day were clocked at 155 miles per hour.  Walsenburg, CO., our neighboring town to the East, made National news with winds gusting at 90 miles per hour.  The wing ends red lights which separated from the wings had no other form other than being a red light in the night sky much like a small Cessna 180.  Who in their right mind, military or other, would have been out flying the front range that evening in a wind storm I will not forget for a long time.  Four other individuals that evening witnessed strange aircraft activity about 7:00 pm in the evening.  One individual saw a bright white light North West of my sighting.  The other three individuals saw what appeared to be a very low flying jet hugh in size, one sa! w a probe from the belly with a red light at the end, the other two saw much smaller aircraft assisting the main aircraft at wing tips much like I&apos;ve describe above.  The craft(s) were flying North West of my sighting.

If you have any questions please email me at ssc@rmi.net. Sincerely, Sharon M. Corsaut", "A pair of lights joined by another light. They separate back into pair and single.Three craft, which I first thought to be satellites, forming a close encounter over the Sacramento/Marysville area - 50 miles to the South.  As I watched it was apparent that two of these craft were flying together as a pair up from the south, and a third craft was approaching the encounter area from the West.  Clear skies, some very high clouds, good lighting, about a half hour after sunset. The craft pair was arranged so the larger of the two was always to the left of the smaller.  All three craft went through continual complex fast changing lighting arrays.  Their lights weren&apos;t synchronized.  Quite bright, brilliant colors, or a brite white light disc.  Sometimes the lights would double or form arrays of four, all flashing differently, sometimes with different intensities. This didn&apos;t appear to be the light signature of the satellites which are visible here every clear evening, and their movements implied airplane, but on an out of atmosphere scale, which meant that the lights in their fantastic array were very brilliant. The smaller craft almost always was two tightly bound points of scintillating lights.  Often times there were four.  Only rarely did it become a single point of light.  There did not seem to be an structure associated with the light arrays, yet they maintained an integral formation as if there were a structure.  It appeared several times that it was presenting a changing profile to the viewer as it moved around, that perhaps a cause of the observed relative movements of the lights. As they converged the solo craft from the west executed a turn to the north and began flying with the two coming from the south.  I then thought I was watching airplanes, but there never was a sound, and the scale of movement was wrong for an airplane.  The solo craft cruises around the pair who turn to the east.  There is movement between the pair, but it is subtle and their overall position remains exactly the same to this observer _througout_ their entire flight!  The solo light is, what one could almost call, animated, especially as the scale of this encounter became apparent.  The solo craft flew north above a cirrus changing vectors a few degress several times, at one point appearing to reverse course as it circled back over an area - they were complex very large scale manuevers in a patch of sky the size of my hand at arms length - never leaving a contrail or noise.  As it did these high speed manuevers, it reached its highest point as it turned westward at about 10:30 as my arm would point to it.  As it slowly went into the west glow I could see that it was still manuevering but it was so far away that distance only indicated that this light or group of lights was not an airplane and was way off planet as compared to the usual couple of dozen satellite crossings.  Eventually this brilliant cluster of glittering jewels was lost in the evening glow. As I caught up with the pair they had traveled across the sky in an enormous turn from the east to north over in the Reno area. That city is almost exactly East from this observer.  They traveled north 15-20 degrees then I saw that they were just slowly getting closer together in appearance which meant that they were now traveling to the Northeast and they maintained that till they faded into the night sky a hands width above the horizon.  At their highest in the East they seemed at about 10:00 in the sky as pointed to by my arm.  There was never a sound. The scale of these executed movements would seem to require high altitudes.  This was a very grand encounter, very majestic, and it would seem, when postulating actual physical craft, quite an extraordinary expression of speed and power. During this 20 minute dance the land and sky were very quiet.  No jets and no local noise at all, it was quiet.  Any sounds caused by these craft would have been audible, if they had been aircraft, as exampled by similarly placed jet flybys. This happened at 5:10 to 5:30 pm Pacific Standard Time on 15 December 1998.", "Coming home from voting in &quot;96&quot; my wife and I noticed 7-8 craft off to the west. Flying very erratically, almost looked like they were playing tag or dodge ball. (Not staying in formation) It lasted while we drove 5 miles, then one by one blinked out.These craft were far enough away that a dime held at arms length would cover them,individually, not their formation,  but they were quite visible in a clear, night-time, fall sky. They were orange in color and moved vertically and horizontally in an instant. I called the Springfield, IL airport to report it and they gave me a number to call, which I did and left a message. A few days later, my call was returned and I was asked what I&apos;d seen again. I told them and they told me that and hour or two after my report over 300 reports, identical to mine, came in from the Chicago area. They said that someone else would contact me shortly. But nobody ever did. About a week later, my wife, her sister, my brother-in-law and I were in Peoria, IL at a luau by the IL River. We were right in town along the river when we saw the same thing my wife and I saw election night. Only this time, the duration was 5-6 hours and we also saw them flying slow and low above us (Without lights) Unlighted they were silvery in color and we could see them in the glow from the lights of Peoria. There was absolutely no sound on either occurrance.", "I was asleep with my mom and little brother when for some wierd feeling I opened my eyes .I was faceing a window and looked outside to see a glowing ball in the sky.I was scared stiff and tryed to awake my mother but I could not speak I screamed in my head but nothing came out.I guess by motherly instinct she got up and saw me looking outside.My family was in Cleveland for a wedding, staying at my aunts house in Lakewood.I was sleeping in a bedroom with my mom and little 4 year old brother.While sleeping I got a wierd feeling and opened my eyes, faceing the window I looked out and saw a glowing ball in the distance. It was a bright white light, like no light i have seen since. Scared stiff I tryed to call to my mother but nothing came out I screamed mom,mom in my head but my ears did not hear me say it.Then after 1 minute of so she got up by motherly instinct i guess.Mother looked outside and saw it comeing closer by now we could see it was a disc shape.My mom than got my two aunts up and my little brother.She tryed to wake up my unkle but could not.We all went out on the back porce to get a better look,now the disc was getting real close and we where all scared yet we just stood there watching the disc.The disc was bright white light and in the middle there was reflections all the way across and right in the center it looked like a plus font [+]or a cross maybee, it was real hard to focus.The disc stopped about 20 to 30 feet above the ground right over a tree and just hovered there size was 40 feet across.No sound no tree leaves moveing total silence.Now please understand the whole time I should have been wide awake yet it was all i could do to sta! y awake.My aunt walked under the tree and threw a stick up and thats all i remember .The next thing I recall is standing outside and the disc is gone.My mom called my unkle in Circleville Ohio dureing this event.He remembers the call.Whats funny is after all these years we are just now starting to talk about it agian.", "At least four bright objects hovered for several minutes, then randomly moved slowly up and down while becoming very intense when descending.  One object shot off at extreme speed.I am filing this report in behalf of my family as follows; Four white completely silent objects were seen northeast of 64th. St and Peak View Rd. Cave Creek, Az. at 6:40 P.M.  The entire sighting lasted approximately 20 minutes and was witnessed by 4 people ages 20,  (daughter)48(wife), 71(mother in law), and 72(father in law). The objects appeared approximately 30 degrees above the horizon and were initially spaced approximately 1 foot apart at arms length as they   moved about randomly in the same general area. The objects were at different altitudes initially then one object began to descend slowly. During descent the object became very bright (appeared to become larger).  The objects seemed to take turns descending and rising. While observing one object, another instantly appeared appeared next to it (seemed to come from knowhere). There were no other lights associated with each object (only one light source). One observer stated that when the objects lowered the light changed it shape to become somewhat pointed on the top and bottom and thicker in the middle. The same observer indicated that the size of the objects were about the same size as a standard household lightbulb at about 150 ft. distance. Another characteristic of the objects is that they would become dimmer when moving but becomming noticeably brighter when hovering or descending. Two of the observers reported that one of the objects shot off at an extreme speed almost too fast to follow at an approximate 30 degree angle upward and disappeared. No aircraft were in the area at the time of the sighting. All observers are of sound mind and have stated that they have never seen anything as bizzare as this.  We all frequently see aircraft landing lights for all types of aircraft since we are north of Scottsdale airport, Deer Valley Airport, and Phoenix Sky Harbor airport but these objects were distinctly different not only in appearance but movement. This writer is a company Vice President, Aerospace Engineer, and licensed pilot and very experienced with many different types of military and commercial aircraft and aviation technology in general. I interviewed each observer to obtain as accurate an account as possible.  I personally missed the sighting by approximately 10 minutes when returning from work.", "Saw a light in the valley moving back and fourth directly over the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. It left straight up when two F/A-18 fighters left the runway on take-off.On my way into work around 5am pst on approx. 12/15/94, I drove over a hill on a main road from Aliso Viejo, CA into El Toro, CA and saw a light in the valley moving back and fourth directly over the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. The point at which I first saw this thing was just before I crested the rise, I was angled to the sky and could not yet see the valley ahead. What caught my attention was this very bright but quite small light that was moving from my left field of view to the right, then instantly left again. The stars were clear and bright that morning I remember and there were no clouds. I first thought it was a police helicopter looking for someone close-by, not an uncommon sight in Southern California. Then I got to the top of the slight incline and the valley spread out before me with all the city lights intact. Directly ahead and just to my right (approx 10 miles) on the valley floor is the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS).I know excacly where it is because I like to watch the jet fighters take-off in the late morning and afternoons. They NEVER take off in early am due to residential noise abatement ordinances. Anyway, this light was NOT a helicopter and was maneuvering directly over the MCAS. I pulled over and watched this thing clearly for a couple minutes. It was not at high altitude and my best guess would put it at 1000 ft. It moved too fast for a plane, from the distance I was to it, it had to be going VERY fast to cover the arc it was maneuvering in. I have seen the Air Force Thunderbirds and Navy Blue Angels at this Air Station Perform and they never covered as much ground so quickly as this thing did . It made many 90 and 180 degree turns and stayed over the base. After only about two minutes of watching this light I could see fighters taxiing on one of the the runways. The light-object left nearly straight up (@85 degree angle to my left) when two F/A-18 fighters left the runway on take-off. As I said, the fighters NEVER take-off in early am. I watched them go airborne! , they quickly turned and accelerated in the direction the light was a few moments before then slowed and continued @ north-west and out of sight. I stayed about another 15 minutes but they did not come back, either plane or UFO.", "Denver, Colorado, March 17, 1977, at around 7:30 pm. Two objects seen up close. One hovered over our home, the other flew over at just above treetop level.  A third was seen in the distance as a red light falling from one of the craft to the ground.My husband, myself, and our 2 sons, ages 2yrs, and 1 year old were moving into our new house on March 17th, 1977.  I remember the date clearly because it was my younger sons 1 year old birthday.  I was in the house unpacking with my 1 year old, and my husband and older son were outside getting things from the truck.  It was dark by this time, but we had the porch lights on.  This was in the sante fe area of Denver, Colorado, which is a fairly heavily populated area of Denver. At approximately 7:30 pm, my husband came running into the house, and yelling my name.  He was very agitated, and nearly speechless,and he just kept saying my name while dragging me out to the back side of the house. I would say no more than 30 seconds had past between him racing into the home, and he and I going back outside.  When I got out there he began to tell me what had happened to him.  He said he was bending down in the cab of the truck to retrieve a box when it lit up like someone had placed a powerful flashlight over his shoulder.  He looked over his shoulder and saw a craft hovering, with no sound, right at treetop level over our home.  It had ice cube shaped lights on it, which were flashing in a circular movement around the object.  The craft itself was spherical in shape.  As soon as he saw it, he raced in the house to get me.  My 2 year old was left outside by himself, and he has no memory of the event. By the time I came outside, the object was in the distance, and it looked like a very large, bright star to me.  I had jumped up on the cab of the truck for a better look, and began to search the sky.  As I looked up and behind me, I saw another craft that was very low to the ground flying right over my head.  It was higher than treetop level, but not by much.  This craft was triangular, had 3 very large amber colored lights on the bottom of it.  It was close enough that I was able to make out some of the mechanical lines of the craft on its bottom part.  There was no sound at all, and it just drifted past.  I watched it until I could not make it out anymore. The other craft (the first one spotted) had now appeared to stop and hover over the far mountains.  It was blinking, and then appeared to change shape and color.  It went from white, to gold, to pale red, and changing shapes.  It was too far away to tell the exact shapes, but it did not stay spherical.  Then a round, very bright red light seemed to drop from it, and float to the ground, leaving a trail as it did. The main craft then turned bright white and circular again, and moved off toward Boulder, CO. We watched it until we couldn&apos;t make it out anymore. Approximately 3 to 5 minutes later, a number of helicopters and planes we suspected were military buzzed around our home.  They searched the area for about 5 minutes, then moved off. There were several cars that had stopped by our home, gotten out of their cars and watched the crafts as well.  We talked with them, but did not get their names.  I have never reported this incident until now.  The main reason I am, is to see if your organization got any other reportings of this event.", "I was outside at around 22:30 and i saw three circular lights in a triangle formation. They moved through the sky pretty fast, and then slowed down out over the water. The stopped, for a while, and then shot off towards the sky and were gone.It was the 4th of July of 1998, and i was outside waiting for my friends to come over to go to a party. Something caught the corner of my eye and i turned and saw three circular, blueish/white lights moving quickly through the sky approching the water, 2 or 300 yards away from me. I watched them moved very fast to the water and stop almost instanly. The floated there for around 15 minutes, staying perfectly still. Then, with no warning, a small ball, the size of a basketball maybe, it was too far away to tell. It hovered towards me at around 4-5 mph, and came to about 50 feet away from me, and then shot off towards the woods. Then as soon as the small ball dissapeared, so did the other three circles, moving extremely fast out in the same direction they came down.

From the east, a C-130 was flying in low toward the west. I commented on this to my friend, and we then noticed a small, flickering light in the general vicinity of the C-130, hovering stationarily. It appeared simillar to a star, or perhaps Venus. However, the time was approxamitly 5:10, much too early for any star to be visible or Venus to be rising. The object would flash very brightly, then dim in a flickering manner, and then seem to disappear. After a few moments, the object reappeared dimly, increasing in brightness, near where it had previously been. While visible, the object did not appear to move. But during its disappearing acts, the object would reappear in a different  but close-by location. During the event, three or four more C-130&apos;s followed on the heels of the first we had originally seen. My friend later informed me that he had seen a Huey about fifteen minutes prior to the sighting event. My friend retrieved a video camera and a set of binoculars. He filmed the object for about four to five minutes. Unfortunatly, due to the distance of the object (perhaps several miles), the focus was unable to lock in, and we have only  30-60 frames of a resolved image. Thru the binoculars, I determined the object to be metallic and spherical, like a ball-bearing reflecting the light of the sun. But a sphere would reflect the sun&apos;s light evenly and consistantly. Go figure. Within two minutes after the last C-130 had flown in low (and pressumably landed at Kirtland AFB very close-by), the object blinked out for the last time and did not reappear.", "1 light came from the south, hovered ,split into 2 new lights , series of maneuvers , remerged with the original light and sped offa bright point of light came from the south as i was driving home from cadets ,it appeared to move too swiftly for a helicopter or light aircraft. It stopped overhead at about 1000 feet approx, 2 more lights detached themselves from the original lightand began to circle it. This made it clear that it was in no way a normal object, as the 2 lights stayed precisely opposite to each other as they rotated around. The 2 lights performed what i could only describe as an infinity symbol like maneuver before merging again with the original and taking off at very high speed on a reciprocal course (to the south) The lights were all white with no indication of beacons etc as per an aircraft. I turned off my engine the whole time the three lights were seperated and could hear nothing ,much less a helicopter hovering none to far overhead! the lights all moved swiftly and smoothly There wasnt a cloud in the sky and i could plainly see the stars near to the horizon.", "3 unidentified craft3 orange &quot;fireballs&quot; traveling at high velocity, then slowed down. Two of them were flying in &quot;formation&quot; while the other one trailed behind. After slowing down to almost a complete stop, all three disappeared one after the other.

They flew by for about 3-5 minutes, i managed to get a few snap shots with my 35mm but who knows if they will come out. regards mark", "I own a Telescope as of a few days ago, tonight was the first night it was  clear since I bought it, anyway I as I looked off to the north I saw two very bright Gold lights, they seemed to be hoovering in the sky, I looked at them for a moment and thought to myself, that is very strange. Because I knew they were not suposed to  be there.So I figured they were just planes and went back to star gazing. A minute later, I would guess,I looked over the house and saw  one of the objects coming over the house, at a slow rate of speed. I had my telescope fixed on the Pleiades, I noticed the object was passing across the path of the Pleiades. Then I grabbed my 10x50 binoculars to get a better look at the object, once I got them up to my eyes I saw that there were three bright gold colored lights with one red slow flashing light in the center. As it continued moving slowly from the northeast to the southwest with the binoculrs I could clearly see it was triangular in shape,there were no stars visible through the objet.I took the binoculars away from my eyes again and I saw going in the same direction three other objects, only these I could distinctly tell were either planes or jets. Then I looked back in the direction of the triangular object and it was not to be seen anywhere. I have no idea what happened to it, it was just gone. I have never saw anything like this, I see planes and jets everyday and this was not what I witnessed tonight. As for the second object I mentioned I never saw it again, it never came over the house like the other, it must have took off in a different direction.All I can say is that what ever it was gave me a strange feeling and it was not a Airplane or a jet.", "I have seen several ufo&apos;s in the past 3 years.  I was stationed in NORAD Mountain Complex and knew that the goverment had information about UFO&apos;s when I was working there. I have never told anyone about that until now.  I&apos;m not someone looking for attention, the reason I&apos;m writing....I have been having dreams of late that are very strange.  Let me say that I don&apos;t watch si-fi shows..well I have seen old Star Trek shows, but that was years ago.  I&apos;m someone that believes that if you can&apos;t prove it logically why talk about it.  In fact one show I really enjoy is Arthur C. Clarks show.  Anyway back to the dreams..I have seen several different kinds of spacecraft and they don&apos;t look like any thing thats been shown on tv.  I have also seen them with military aircraft that have been retrofitted.  I know they have been retrofitted because I know military aircraft designs that exist, (due to the fact I lived on a military airstrip in Colorado Springs (Peterson Airforce Base).  The planes are working with the spacecraft in going after us.  To tell you the truth, I&apos;m starting to feel very stupid telling you about this, but what the hell..I&apos;ve already started.  I relized in my dream that the military aircraft had some type of spray comming from them that made myself and the people around me sick..I can&apos;t really explain why..it just seemed that way in the dream. Last night I saw a new type of spacecrat,again, nothing like I have ever seen on tv.  The dreams are starting to bother me, do a lot of people have dreams about ufo&apos;s?  Are my dreams a result of to much tv? Like I said before, I&apos;m not someone who is a si-fi nut. I can&apos;t disclose my identification due to the fact that it could cause me problems.  I will say that I am a CEO of a non-public company that does around 2.7mm in net revenue.  I will look again to see if anyone has responded to this posting.", "On Tuesday night at my job at the Barona indian reservation in Lakeside, Ca. another officer and I saw three white strobe-like craft racing across the sky in a zig-zag pattern; all were going faster than conventional known aircraft speeds. One went north, the second one went northwest, and the third headed west, during and after we saw military jets flying in the same airspace, one headed south and the other headed west. Earlier in the evening, and all evening there had been a noticeable increase in aircraft activity.While working as an outside security guard at the Barona indian reseervation on the night of the sixth of January I noticed earlier in the evening at around 6:30 p.m. shortly after I began my shift that there was increased aircraft activity in the airspace over that region of Southern California. There were military jets, heliocopters, and commuter planes. Later in the evening at 9:30 another guard that I was standing with saw the first white flashing strobe-like craft appear overhead traversing at a tremendous speed zig-zaging across the night sky; thats when he told me of it and I looked up startled at a white flashing craft zigzaging across the sky making pin-point moves seemingly defying the laws of movement, then at about 20 seconds into that another craft appeared but not overhead it was moving around up and down strait ahead north of us, then as suddenly as that had appeared a thrid one appeared just a little west of the second one. They all danced around the sky in strobelike fashion for around another minute, during which a military jet, with red and green lights on the wing tips, going at a fairly normal speed, which helped to compare speeds of the crafts, crossed the sky heading south. Then as suddenly as they had appeared the third one headed west, the second one headed northwest and the first one was still visible heading north and went out of range at around 9:34 p.m. Just as the first one was getting out of range we  saw another military jet heading south and then veering west. That was the first time I have ever witnessed such a craft going through space at such tremendous speeds, I would guess they must have been going in the thousands of miles per hour based on the time it took them to go from directly overhead to a point north of us in only around ten seconds time. This was much faster then conventional aircraft I have seen cross the same distance in time.", "While satellite gazing at night, three objects moving in the upper atmosphere stopped completely for a second, then proceeded in different directions.I was watching (with no binoculars) satellites go by in the clear night sky as I sometimes did when I was 15 years old.  Being the gadget guy that I am, I was fascinated by how humans had put into orbit such crafts.  I usually would observe 5 to 7 satellites a night before retiring to bed.  Then at around 9:30 p.m., I observed 3 satellites that were closely and perfectly equidistant from each other.  The trio caught my special attention.  I thought I was so lucky to have been witnessing a rare coincidence.  They were moving with identical velocities from North to South.  One object led the other two.  Then, without warning, they all STOPPED for at least a full second!  The manner in which they stopped really surprised me because they did not slow down to a stop but simply stopped dead in their tracks.  Then they moved again immediately with the previous velocities, but in three different directions: the leader continued southward, one went 45 degrees to the left, while the third one went 45 degrees to the right.  It was an amazing sight.  I watched them all until they disappeared into the horizon.  Even at that time, I thought about what technology, if earthly, could do that... or from which country.  But to this date, over 21 years later, I know of absolutely no air or space craft technology that could do what those three objects did.  I am a man of science with a Ph.D. and so I always try to find answers to the way things work, especially those that catch my interest.  For this one: extra-terrestrial.", "About 4:20 a.m. Tuesday morning in the Southeast sky a bright green light caught my attention from my livingroom window.  I saw one luminous green ball that started just under the clouds and fell like a falling star but much much closer.  It faded out in about 3 to 5 seconds, on this side of the horizon. It was about 1/3 the size of a full moon, and about as bright.  It reminded me of a roman candle in reverse.I&apos;m a small business owner and was up late doing bookwork in front of my french doors when I saw this.  We had cloud cover last night and we live in a rural area so it was very dark out side and I checked to see if it could be a reflection of any kind. No way.  I&apos;m just curious about what it could have been. Are meteors this color?", "I am a college student and a mother of a 5 and 2 year old. I had come home from a long day at school and discovered I had to run into town to pick up something to prepare for dinner. I got about a half a mile down the road and glanced up into the sky at my right and saw a bright shiney silver object suspended in the sky. Close enough I could tell it wasn&apos;t a plane or even shaped like one for that matter. It was shaped like a disk with a well rounded egg in the middle. I went home after going to the store and reported the event to my husband, and I was laughed at. So I summed it up to being delusional due to lack of sleep. It wasn&apos;t until a saw a special on tv last week on UFO&apos;S that I decided to tell someone. At that time they showed the exact same object as I saw, which in away convinced me I&apos;m not crazy. And ever since I witnessed the object hovering, strange things have been happening around my house electrical apliances coming on for no reason etc... E mail me if youre intrested in hearing more. I wouldn&apos;t swear this event happened in Oct. My life moves in semesters and all I know for sure is it was last semester.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "it was a huge triangle shaped object with a beam in the middle of it sort of like a laser pointer except wider.and blue lights on the sides of the object.the object was about 30 to 40 yards long it was triangle shaped and there was a red beam in the middle and the beam could be seen on the ground for it was only about 30 ft up in the air it also had blue lights on the sides. what i mean by that is 3 on each side of the triangle shape that means 3 sides so alltogether it had 9 blue lights. it seemed to be just cruising around and then all of a sudden the red beam couldnt be seen on the ground no more, like they have just turned it off but i looked up and it was still on it just didnt touch the surface of the earth.and then it just went off into the night it made no sound thats a fact cuz you could hear bugs making sounds while looking at the object", "enroute to las vegas  I observed a green orb from my rearview mirrior and the in my windsheild.

Observed a bright white light move rapidly from left to right, above and in front of me. (Could not judge size but appeared to be slightly larger than a plane would have been.) Approx. 10 - 20 seconds later, what I took to be the same object came back accross the highway in the opposite direction, only at much slower speed and was amber in color. I observed the object move slowly off to the left (to the NE) where it appeared to stop and &quot;hover&quot; in the sky. Object then suddenly changed to a bright red color. (As if someone had simply turned a light switch ..... it just changed color.) Lost sight of the object behind the tree line  as I continued South. No sound(s) were noticed.Not much to add from summary description above other than it was quite upseting. (Scared the &quot;hell&quot; out of me.) Somehow had the feeling the object knew i was observing it or that it was observing me. Didn&apos;t wait around to find out. Unfortunately traffic was very light at that late hour. I did not notice any other cars on the road during this time. As stated above the object appeared to be a bright white light, moving rapidly from left to right directly in front and above my location. given my direction of travel it seemed to be going from the NE to SW. My first thought was that it was a plane but was going much too fast. Only seconds later the light came back into my view over the tree line, now  going in the opposite direction (from SW to NE) only much slower than before.(Note, while briefly out of my sight the object appeared to have changed to an amber color.) As I proceeded along the highway for approx. anothr 2 - 3 miles I had the object in my sight off to the left. It seemed to stop completely, hover for several seconds, then changed to a red color very suddenly. I became quite frightned, never having seen anything like this. (And being alone on the highway late at night.) I got the hell out of there as fast as I could. I do not recall any sounds associated with the object. I did not think the object was a plane or helicopter. Light did not blink. Flight path seemed to be extremely straight ..... precise is probably a better description. No banking, bouncing, blowing in the wind, or sudden altitude changes, etc. Just a straight line .... first a bright light very fast from left to right. Then back the other way much slower .... now amber in color. Moving slowly, slowly slowly off to the left then stopping. Then BANG a change to red. It was, however, a long time ago. Incident is still quite clear in my mind though.", "white circle one quarter size of full moon appeared NNW, sky, disappeared SSEsky, no trail.At 18:42 PST my mother let our two small dogs out into the back yard and was standing on back porch waiting for them to come back in.  She looked up at the sky and saw a white circle about the size of a small pea held at arm&apos;s length or one quarter size of a full moon.  She said it suddenly appeared in the North to Northwest sky and was visible for about 1.5 to 2 seconds as it sped toward the SSE sky and suddenly disappeared.  There was only the one object and the sky was partially obscured by a layer of cirrostratus cloud.  She called to me and I went out to look at the sky.  The object was gone by this time but I did note the cloud cover and that I was able to see a slightly fuller than crescent moon and some brighter stars through the thin cloud cover.  She said there was no trail behind the object and it didn&apos;t look like a fireball.  My mother is a retired store manager and I am a  librarian.  She informed me the following day that the new space station was apparently visible in the sky during the time she saw the object.  This brings up many questions. It moved from the NW horizon to the SE in under 2 seconds.  If it indeed was the space station she saw, is it capable of such speed?  Is it tumbling which would cause it to reflect the sun&apos;s light and then seem to disappear?   Is it&apos;s orbit in a NW to SE direction?   My mother feels that is what she saw--the new space station.  But I am not so sure.  About 2-3 minutes before she saw the object the was a loud rumble like a sonic boom.  It definitely was not thunder; the sky was basically clear and here on the west coast of British Columbia we get few thunderstorms mainly from April to early September.   Thank you for your time.", "Bright orange sphere in southwest quadrant of sky which appeared to be at an altitude of approximately 40,000 feet close to Atlanta/Birmingham commercial traffic zone.On that evening I was outside observing the stars on this clear night when I noticed in the southwest quadrant of the sky a bright orange object (about the size of Venus) moving in an up and down motion maintaining it&apos;s vertical alignment. I rushed inside and told my family, got 2 pairs of binoculars and my family and I went out to observe. At that point the object was moving up/down and side to side for a distance of approximately 1-2 miles at each movement. My wife, son and daughter witnessed this with amazement for a period of about 10 minutes. Commercial traffic could be seen passing in close proximity of this object, however the object made no effort to &quot;track&quot; with the plane. I could clearly see that this object was moving by triangulating it with nearby stars in it&apos;s proximity. The object became stationary and was observed for approximately 30 more minutes noticably not maintaining horizontal alignment with nearby stars verifying it wasn&apos;t a star decending on horizon. The object seemed to pulse orange to white at higher intensities from time to time at intervals of approximately 5-10 seconds. Then suddenly the object disappeared as if to &quot;wink out&quot;. The following night I located the same cellestial bodies for verification of the objects location and indeed the object was not there!", "Silent, very large, one white headlight, red lights around edgesA rural road, no street lights or houses, high elevation, ridge between N.H. and Maine.  Just going for a ride one evening when we noticed a very bright light approching us from the east, we were traveling north. It got so bright that we stopped the truck, shut off the engine and got out to watch.  We saw a triangular thing with a bright headlight and red lights round the edges. It was so very close to us and it had no noise what so ever. It stayed above us for about 15 seconds and then with amazing speed, still silent, was gone in maybe 3 seconds.  My only thoughts were &quot;I&apos;m never going to see my children again.&quot;  I was scared.My husband and my friend didn&apos;t report it because we were afraid of ridicule.  Who would believe such a crazy story?  On thursday night Art Bell replayed a tape of a man who had wittnesed almost the same thing in Phoenix 2 years ago. I thought you might be interested to know this sort of thing happens in rural New England too.", "Triangular craft hovering over bridge then moving downriver.In 1994 I was coming home from my job as a registered nurse.  I was driving on Idaho highway #3/12 near what is known as the Arrow Junction. I noticed lights about 1/2 mile ahead of me that appeared to be stationary and located on the side of the river valley.  The night was very overcast with no stars or moonlight visible.  I thought for a moment that someone must have installed new lighting on the outside of their house because there are many new homes in that area.  As I approached the bridge, however, I saw that the lights were moving down the river towards me.  The lights turned into a triangular shaped aircraft that was probably about 150-200 feet above the river&apos;s surface.  It was moving very slowly downriver, over the center of the water.  I assume that the craft was triangular because the lights that were shining down were in a triangular pattern like this: 0 &lt;--&quot;front&quot; of craft Lights---&gt;   0 0 0 0 0  &lt;--rotating beacons between these lights I think that there were only 5 lights on the craft, but I don&apos;t remember for sure.  There were two rotating beacons in between the last three lights.  This struck me as odd because most aircraft marker lights that I&apos;m aware of nowdays are strobe-type lights.  Another odd thing was that this really large aircraft seemed to be proceeding at a terribly slow rate of speed.  It seems to me that it must have had to have been a helicopter because the forward speed was so slow.  The lights were all white, even the rotating lights.  Since the sky was overcast and totally dark, I couldn&apos;t make out the actual form of the craft.  I always said that if I ever saw a &quot;UFO&quot; I would stop, get out, and watch it.  But this was so different than anything I&apos;ve ever seen before that I could not bring myself to stop and get out of my rig.  I do not have an estimate of the physical size of the craft although it was very big.  I used to be a paratrooper and was in Viet Nam so I am familiar with a lot of the military&apos;s aircraft and I can say that I haven&apos;t a clue as to what this thing was, other than it was big and slow.  The second witness referred to above was another nurse who was driving her car ahead of mine.  The Arrow Bridge is at the intersection that we both took to get home and when I talked to her the next evening at work she said she saw the aircraft and that it appeared to be hovering directly over the bridge when she turned to get on the highway that would take her home.  This correlates with what I saw because I could see her car ahead of mine, turning on the bridge about 1/2-3/4 mile ahead of me and the lights at that time were directly over the bridge and appeared to be stationary.  She had no other information to add about what the thing looked like.  The aircraft passed by me and I continued to the bridge, then made the same turn that the other nurse made and continued home. Additional: The lights had the same brilliance and color of airplane landing lights.  I don&apos;t remember any other unusual factors about the lights other than that they were very white and very bright.", "object seen traveling from south to notrhi was traveling north in a car.

When I came to my senses I got my camera out of the glovebox and started shooting in the direction of the craft, still driving. The saucer zipped across the desert and way to the west I could see the late day sun glint off the object as it now hovered over mountains in the distance.

As I looked up I witnessed a jet banking hard to follow a sphere to a higher altitude then to the east.This evening I was looking at the Orion Nebula when I heard a strange noise over my head. It sounded like a short burst of claps or compress- ions.  As I looked up I noticed several aircraft before I viewed the source of the noise.Tha aircraft I observed first were a passenger jet heading West towards Love Field and a helicopter heading N/NW. As I looked  straight up I saw a military jet making a severe bank up into the sky following a sphere that was about 60 foot in diameter.The jet followed the object East to an altitude of at least 4000 feet(yes it was that low) Then the sphere was gone,into thin air. I watched as the jet leveled out and climbed gradually heading south as it slowed it&apos;s speed.Within sixty seconds two helicopters were in the vicinity,both hovering about and scanning the area it seemed.", "Triangular formation of lights in the skyWhen I and my friends left our house to go to a party I saw a triangular formation of lights in the sky.

One light was in the &quot;front corner&quot;. The object made no sound. It made a circling motion. The axis of this motion was close to one of the &quot;sides&quot; of the craft. After ca. 2 min it vanished either by turning off the lights or disapearing behind the clouds or both. ( the sky was semi clouded ). The size of the object ( it&apos;s altitude was at cloud layer ) must have been that of a passenger aircraft at least. I don&apos;t remember if the white lights were blinking.

At first I thought it was a satellite so I informed my friends who began to observe it as well. We quickly concluded it was moving to fast, was too bright, was way to low, and as its path started to change from a straight line to an arc we didn&apos;t know what to make of it. We observed it for another 15-20 seconds before it went above the clouds. Just as it dissapeared we saw a plane moving very fast from the opposite direction. It was on a direct path to possibly intersect the bright light some distance ahead but it too  went above the clouds. Their paths would have made an &apos;X&apos; in the sky. We saw nothing after that, the cloud cover obscured the sky for the next half hour or so. I probably would have dismissed the incident but the fact that a plane was in the area too makes it weird. Whoever was flying that plane might have seen it too.", "We were  driving down a dirt side road in Golden Valley when we spotted in the sky over the hills a ball of light with a fan shaped beam of light coming out of one side of it. It was not moving but just hovering over the hills between Golden Valley and Laughlin. We stopped the car and  got out and started taking pictures. suddenly the ball of light dissappeared behind the fanned shaped beam of light. Then both the ball of light and  the fan shaped beam of light dissappeared leaving a misty light slowly faded away. We got back in the car and drove about a 100 yards when we spotted another ball of light with a trail of light behind it moving fast towards the ground behind the hills until it vanished.On 3/4/99 around 7:00 P.M. my girlfriend, her brother and girlfriend and myself were driving down a dirt road in Golden Valley Atrizona on our way to Lauglin. It was completely dark at this time. Clear sky. I was in the passenger seat and my girlfriend was driving. The hills between Golden Valley and Laughlin were on my right as I looked out the passenger window. My girlfriend noticed an object out the passenger side window over the hills. I looked and saw the object. My girlfriends brother who lives in Golden Valley immidiately screamed to stop the car. I jumped out of the car. Over the hill hovered a large  white ball of light with a large fan shaped beam of very white lite coming directly outwards of its right side. The white fan shaped beam of light looked as if it had some sort of mist spraying in it. The ball of light that the beam was coming out of was a lighter white. It seemed to be round shaped but it was hard to see its form. As I began to take pictures it looked as if the ball of light suddenly moved behind the fan shaped beam of light. Then both the ball and beam of light vanished leaving a misty looking afterglow. This all happened in about 1 to 2 minutes. The object made absolutely no sounds at anytime. Then we noticed what looked like a fast moving plane flying towards where the object had dissappeard. We got back into the car and drove about a 100 yards when we spotted another object. This one was farther east over the hills. This was a large ball of white light with a white tail of  misty white light coming out of it. It appeared to be moving fast downwards towards the ground until it dissappeared. I am a Quality Inspector from Tukwila Washington, my girlfriend is an employee at Boeing worker and my girlfriends brother and girlfriend live and work in the Golden Valley area. None of us have ever seen a UFO before and are completely certain of what we saw.", "late nov. &apos;98, wife observed x3 nights lrg ball extreme bright light w/ radiating green&amp; red light emanating from &amp; around the main white center. saw said object 3 nights @ same time of evening.  first time it glowed very bright white &amp; colours radiated around it x45 seconds, then it glowed very bright white &amp; simply dissapeared.  obsereved twice more on consecutive nights in the same western sky. the first &amp; second week of december, husband observed the same phenomenon @ his work place.  two other workers also saw it, but it was observed in the eastern sky.  they descibed it as pulsating red/green light around a very large bright, white light.  my husband called me to go out &amp; check it out, but i was unable to see the phenomenon from our house.  the object was about 1/4 the size of the moon &amp; was high in the sky &amp; was not a star or a planet.  i sit out alot &amp; observe the night sky..never saw anything that bright or gaseous looking before. it appeared THREE evenings consecutively to me  &amp; my husband;  once to me, twice to him.   thank you", "8. PAGE-LAKE POWELL ARIZONA  AUGUST 1997 ((This is the eigth and last to date of several of these experiences, all of which I now feel are connected. If visitors to this site have any questions I&apos;ll be glad to answer if I can. If anyone has any further information or explanation on them I&apos;d appreciate a reply. I&apos;ve copied these experiences from a past journal.))My then 14 year old son and I moved to the gloriously beautiful Page ~ Lake Powell in the extreme north-central Arizona, and camped a few days on the awesome beached of the Colorado River...in a place called Lone Rock ~ technically in Utah. While our trip was filled with wonderful events, and a fabulous experience being &apos;stranded&apos; in Roswell during the 50 year festival, and meeting Derrel Simms, David Adair,  Dr. Lier, (I&apos;d been their waitress at the restaurant where they dined on the last Saturday of the festival), as well as Whitley Streiber, Stan Friedman, Robert  Ghostwolf,  and many others, we had still had money struggles and I was upset and nervous we&apos;d be REALLY stranded. Once we reached Lake Powell, however, things changed for the better. We set up &apos;camp&apos;, ate, and later when we turned in, I&apos;d said a little prayer and apologized for having an earlier tantrum (ie: lack of a little faith in the &quot;Bigger Picture&quot;) and just after the prayer, I&apos;d seen a shooting star. It filled me with hope and I asked for some sign that all would be okay. I gazed out thru the mesh window of my tent at all the zillion sparkling stars and the glorious canyon backdrop for another 5 minutes when I saw one of the &quot;stars&quot; begin to move quite erratically across the sky. It had a steady, straight path but every &quot;inch&quot; perspective-wise, it would light up to a bright white, then fade back to a dim star (almost going out) and jag across the sky another inch or so, on and on until it had crossed the sky and disappeared from my range of vision. Its motion was like a zig zag, and at each alternating &apos;point&apos; it would stop, light up, zig, stop, fade dim, zag...etc. It had been high enough to be similar to a satellite, but too erratic. It was too high for a plane or jet. The same thing happened again the next night, but both events were about 8:30pm. On the first night, as I watched it zig zag across the sky (over a period of maybe 15 minutes), I became aware, in a sort of &quot;singular&quot; fashion, (as in, this had been my only thought and seemed to take over my bouncing thoughts and steady them to this one) that they were our neighbors; but more, that they are the Watchers, and had done this (appeared this time)  to let me know all is as it should be. It&apos;s real and there&apos;s no reason to wig out about it...(this trek to AZ had been part of a higher calling that suddenly seemed to go awry) and they are always there. They show themselves when requested to do so to those who need to or have recognized the &quot;Path&quot;, and will either assist in the Awakening, or lead the Waking into knowledge and experiences they need for individual purpose, as well as a collective one. The second night I seemed to &quot;understand&quot; (about them) as tho they were telling me that  now that they&apos;ve proven themselves as I asked,  I won&apos;t see them much in the near future, but will eventually begin to encounter them more often ~ things (for me) would now change. And they did. For the record, from August end 1997  until this date of posting (Dec. 20, 1998), I have gotten pregnant, moved from Arizona to an island off the Virginia coast, been flooded off the island, returned to Arizona over a &apos;vacation&apos; journey thru New Mexico and Arizona, situated in west central Arizona,  had a beautiful baby boy, bought another computer, been introduced to Art Bell (the program), become a  webpage designer (actually getting business, that is!), lost one car, got a new car,  and returned to Louisiana...having wonderful holidays and feeling like this is the calm before something extraordianry takes place; I have no idea as to what. Since August of &apos;97, and this event, I have seen no further &quot;lights&quot; in the sky, on the ground, or anywhere else, nor  had anymore of these experiences. If anybody has any ideas about any of these posts or would be interested in more details, please contact me. hrc@ciai.net *** I have posted the other events here also. Look for: 1.

SOUTHERN BOSSIER PARISH   MARCH 1997", "An aircraft of some type was seen in the sky with approximately five lights flashing in sequense in a straight line, possibly in a circle. The object was closer to us at first then went straight out into the sky and became like a star to the human eye. The object continued to move closer to the earth than far out over the course of the night.  The lights continued to flash in repetition.", "I was surprised to noticed a large black triangular-shaped-wingless object cross the road directly in front of me flying about twenty feet from the ground.I was travling northbound on Hwy 99. The road curved ahead of me and it was at this moment when I noticed what I thought to be a falling star. I glanced at this object briefly and then turned my attention back on the road. Out of curiosity, I looked back to where I first noticed the object and did a doubletake when I noticed that it was still their. Not only was it still their, but it appeared to be even closer than before, and I was given the impression that it was travling at an enourmous volacity. As I observed this object with a keen interest, I noticed a long blue contrail behind it. This contrail appeared similar That of NASA&apos;s proposed Ion propolsion system, exept for one thing; their now appeard to be what resembled orange fireballs shooting out the back of this object, and through the contrail. This was very unsettling because I thought I was witnessing an airborne tragedy, A plane on fire, plummeting to the ground. Indeed this object appeared to be loosing altitude with great abandon, and I was surprised once more to see the object bank hard and change directions approximately 180&ordm;&apos;s changing from a South-easterly direction to more of a North-westwardly direction. The object&apos;s speed increased greatly after It had modified its waypoints. I past an orchard and momentarily lost site of this object. I thought that was the last that I would see of this object, until it the road directly ahead of me flying about twenty feet from the ground. The triangular object was now flying very slow, and its distinct triangular form was highlighted by small red lights along what appeared to be the sides of the object. These small red lights were alligned in rows along two opposite sides of the object. Their were three small bright white lights, one on each corner of the object. In the center of the object was a large red glowing light about three feet in diameter, not typical of any aircraft I know of. It crossed the highway heading twords an open residential area with many houses. I crossed over a bridge and tur! ned off of the highway onto a small sidestreet. My investigative nature becconed me to fallow this object, which is exactly what happened. I was driving along the small sidestreet, and the object was positioned completely parellel to me. I clocked it with my speedometer, it was travling at approximately 25 MPH. I rolled down my window to observe the sound which I was sure an object of this proportion (about 60 feet long) would make flying at such a low altitude. I was stunned as I concluded that this object made absolutely no sound. It did not rumble or make any vibrations. I could not hear the wind whistling through its wings, because it did not have any. I lost site of the object as it again changed course and ducked below the tree line. With the information which I was able to acertain from this encounter, I can conclude that what I observed was not an airplane. It was certainly an object, It was flying, and I failed to identify it with any object which I am familiar with. It is with sound mind and being, that I certify everything stated above as truth, and the facts stated heriegn reflect the best of my knowledge and recolection of this encounter.", "A huge multi-lighted object hovered stationary over the eastern part of DFW airport.I was walking my dogs at 9:45 pm local time.  Heading east along the backside of my apartment complex.(This faces DFW airport which is approx 4 miles away)  I walk my dogs this direction on a regular basis and am quite familiar with the flight paths of the airport.  I noticed a multi-level bank of lights approx 500-1000 ft above the ground.  At first I thought I must be seeing a top of a building.  However, I realized that there was no building of that height any where in that location.  As I continued to observe the object I noticed that it had some kind of blinking lights.  I attempted to climb a fence to gain a better vantage but was unable to gain any better view.  The night sky was clear.  I continued to observe the object for several more seconds.  At no time did it move.  I would estimate it was 20 times the size of a commercial aircraft. At no time was there any movement.  At the time I was unable to really comprehend what I had observed.  I began to return with my dogs to my apartment.  Before I arrived I began to shudder and sweat. Realizing that I had witnessed an unusual occurance I return to the location where I had observed the object and it was gone. I walked around the complex seeking to find anyone whom might have observed the same thing.  I couldn&apos;t find anyone.  I spent the next hour or so returning to the site where I had observed the object, I also drove to the area I felt it had been located to see if by chance there was a building or anything to explain what I had seen.  There was nothing.", "I used to sit on our deck,on summer evenings and look at the stars. This was on a farm south of Saskatoon. Infrequently, these lights would appear in the southern sky always orange in color, flaring very intensely, going out, reappearing. I would guess their height at 1000 feet. The funny thing was they would totally disappear if I went and got anybody, except once when my nephew witnessed them with me. I am not a nut, I don&apos;t drink and I don&apos;t do drugs. I&apos;ve been off the farm for ten years but I&apos;m confident that if I sat and watched for them again out there,I&apos;d see them again.", "Witnessed three circle of lights, pulsating at times and stationary at first, when moving moved at tremendeous speed and erratic movementsServing as Officer of the Day at US Army NG camp in MN in 1975.  Guards asked for OD to go to their location in the North part of base.  They pointed out over the northern sky three brigthly lit white circles that pulsated slightly.  They were stationary at first and then moved at fantastic speeds, movements and speeds that I have never seen nor can I explain, moved in triangle type patterns.  No noise, altitude was very high, in sky 1/2 distance from horizon to straight ahead.  Left area by shooting straight away from us in an instant.  Lights moved independant of each other, they were not attached and appeared to be three separate vehicles.", "round white lights in a slanted row.It was approx. 9pm and my son and I were comming out my mother&apos;s back door to get in the car to leave. We both happened to look up in the western sky and saw round white lights at a vertical slant in a row and they appeared to be sort of jumpy and moving downwards when they all of a sudden vanished! I yelled for my older brother and before he got out the door, they vanished. I didn&apos;t know what to do or who to call. When I went to work the next morning, approx. 7am,I called the local sheriff department, and reported it, and he didn&apos;t take me serious at all. I later that day, saw it on the news and people from other states saw the same thing, and somebody captured it on video, so I knew it was real.", "Object southbound, displaying three white lights, slowed, hovered, quickly accelerated and made a low, banking turn to the east and then sped north until out of sight.Witness #1 saw three white lights in sky at approximately 19:20CST.  The lights appeared stationary and witness thought the lights were an inbound airliner at a distance thus accounting for the lights seeming to hover.  At approximately 19:40CST, witness #1 and witness #2 were traveling in a vehicle together when the object was again seem southbound over the southwest part of Lubbock.  The object slowed, hovered, and then accelerated to the south, making a low sweeping turn to the east, completing the 180 degree turn to the north and sped out of sight.  When the witnesses pulled off the street to look at the object, they heard it making a pulsing humming sound.  The radio in their automobile was tuned to an FM station.  Something else came over the radio at a louder volume.  Mixed in with the FM broadcast was a louder voice speaking in English.  It seemed to be one side of a two-way conversation, not unlike a telephone call.  The object was very dark or black.  Witness #1 is very familiar with civil and military aircraft and stated that he had never seen anything like this before.  I am reporting this incident for my daughter (witness #2) and her fiance (witness #1).  If you want to contact me call digital pager 806((number deleted)).  I will return your call as soon as possible.

I stopped my car to releave myself on the side of the road when I saw a fairly medium size object, which was sphere shaped, come out of a valley region of the canyon.  There was a haze around the objact that reflcted it&apos;s gray-silver color.  A humming sound was coming from the object and the sound resonated in my ears to the point where I felt some pain.  Note that the area was very dark and the only light that orginally was there was from my headlights.  The object slowly began to rise from the valley and then suddenly accelerated when it became level with me.   It shot straight up into the sky and then it was gone.  I was fairly calm but was still troubled by what I saw.  Later when got to my dorm in la Mirada, I had much trouble sleeping and had a tremendous headache.  I woke up the next morning ok but still a little shaken.  Just for the record, I had not been drinking and in no way have I ever used drugs.", "((NUFORC:  Report not inconsistent with the many &quot;twinkling star&quot; reports we receive.))my girlfriend and I had returned from dinner and were preparing to retire.  we had been looking casually at the sky out the bedroom window when I noticed a very bright object in the northern sky that I first thought was a plane.  I pointed it out to my grilfriend who immeadiately got her binoculars and after looking at the red, aqua, and blue colors it emitted along with changing the placement of these colors she said it was definitely not a plane.  We watched it for about 30 minutes and it moved only slightly during that period.  After another 1/2 hour it had moved perhaps 5 degrees higher in the sky and then abruptly disappeared.", "thought we saw a satellite going over,it changed direction 80 deg.in 1/4 sec, then again. Had a transparent triangle shape around central lightAs an ameteur astronomer I was entertaining a friend with the telescope,then we quit and just looked up at a nice night sky,and saw what we thought was a satellite, a single white light, travelling over Spokane from n.w. to s.e., but I thought this light was moving a little faster than the average satellite,(which I observe regularly, and can often identify the type of satellite). It continued straight for five seconds, then made an eighty degree left turn to the n.e. in about a quarter of a second, continued in a straight path for another four or five seconds, then made another quarter second right turn to due east. We observed it for two or three more seconds, then it appeared to vanish. As it passed through several star fields, my friend noted he could make out what appeared to be a sort of transparent triangle shape around the central light, which I did not notice. He said it was rather large,as large as the full moon. We guessed the craft was quite low to the ground.((NUFORC Note:  A satellite in low earth orbit almost certainly would not be visible from the ground at 0330 hrs. (local) in November.  At that time, a satellite would be on the side of the earth that is shaded from the sun&apos;s illumination, so there would be no ambient light for a satellite to reflect.))", "There were three of them, they were heading south, it was early morning and the sky was clear. two of them were flying side by side as the other one was flying below the second one. they were round or oval shaped and they seemed to shine really bright. the color was almost between a yellow orangey.It was morning and I had gotten up to go to the bathroom, I always look out the back window as this is my habit of doing. as I came back from the bathroom, I took a second glance and thought that it was a airplane with bright lights on, when it was flying side ways I knew it wasn&apos;t of that sort. I opened my back door to get a better glimpse so as not to make a mistake about what I saw. There was no sound. I watched as it stopped and then move again. if only I could of gotten closer wow.

The object flew over lake Michigan which usually has a cumulus cloud layer over it in the winter, curved downward, dissapeared into the clouds, came out the bottom, headed downward towards the lake, when I lost it behind the tree line. I assume that it splashed into the lake.", "It was a clear night on Sunday,May 4 &apos;97 at 10.20pm. The craft approached from the sea, the west, and made a slight change on course to the northeast. From our position 100&apos; south of the Newport Beach pier it looked like a giant F-117 (bigger than a football field). Triangular in shape and flying at about 4000&apos; and 250mph. 5 lights on each leading edge of each wing like small stars, the body could have been translucid toward the back. It was totally silent. At that moment on such busy air space there was no other aircraft in sight, as if the airspace had been cleared for it to pass..the object was as dark as the night sky, you could say it looked like a cutout of it. It just flew cruising along turning slightly to the left exposing its dark bottom and it could have been somewhat translucid. I fly private airplanes and are very familiar with all flying models I have never seen such a craft before", "Saw an unidentified aircraft flying at very high speed while landing at San Jose Int&apos;l Airport.I was seated on an aircraft landing at San Jose International Airport, I looked out the window and saw a white, oval-shaped aircraft flying above the community at a very very high rate.  It was about the size of a house.  I saw it from above and during the afternoon, so I could not see any lights from the craft.", "Craft traveling SW in sky across van nuys, CA.  Had stobe lights on top and bottom.  With lights across the middle that changed color with bright flashes.6:30pm to 6:45pm a round object was slowly moving and decending towards the SW in Van Nuys, CA.  It was south of the airport.  A great deal of air traffic, but they did not seem to notice.  I was traveling west on Saticoy ST to work to lock up.  Noticed the craft and tryed to follow it.  But it was to far away.  It had strobe lights on the top and bottom.(centered)  Across the middle there were 3 or 4 lights that changed from red to orange in bright flashes.  It also would blink out and then only a white flashing light.  It just seemed to be meandering along.  Very weird.  Wanted to get a better look but did not have the time.", "Four oval lighted shapes, flying rapidly in circle, coming together in single center point for a few seconds, then apart again.Just found your site, and found a description already posted describing what I saw on 12/3/98.  Left my office at 6:15 pm, located behind (east of) Wolf Rd. in Albany.  Immediately noticed lights in the sky which I first thought were search lights.  There were four oval, translucent, white shapes, flying very rapidly in a circle, evenly spaced from each other.  After several seconds, they flew together into a single oval shape in the center of the circle, for about three seconds, then the four separate objects flew back out and into the same circular pattern. I watched this same pattern of circling, coming together, and separating repeat probably a dozen times.  The timing seemed consistent and precise. When I drove out to Wolf Rd., where the street lighting, neon, etc. is very bright, the lights were not visible from there. The objects were strikingly low to the ground, and over an empty field between the office complex where I work and the Wolf Rd. Shoppers Park strip mall.  This location is very close to the Albany Airport, just southeast of it, and is on a flight pattern.  The next day, I stood in the same spot in the parking lot and watched a plane coming in over this same area; the distance of this plane from the ground seemed to be about the same as the objects.  These lights had to have been seen from the Airport control tower.  If there is a known explanation, they should have it, and I sure would like to know what it is.  (I didn&apos;t attempt to call the airport or notify anyone officially.) I work as an information systems director, am college educated, was not particularly interested in or opinionated about UFOs before this first and only possible sighting that I had.", "white oval craft travelled east to west over Spokane,estimate 10,000 ft,speed aprox 200mph,seemed to be dark line around edge.Standing on a loading dock at work looking east, two of us were talking about UFO`s, and noting neither of us had ever seen one. Just then I said what`s that? and we looked up in a clear blue sky and saw a white oval craft cruising over town, travelling slowly east to west. It looked about a quarter the size of the full moon. We noted it had no wings or discernible features other than a thin dark line around the edge. It made no sound,and left no contrail. We noted it kept going straight in the direction of the long axis of the oval, and made no turns. Guessing, we estimated 10,000 ft. high, speed 200mph.

I thought this might be a flare or something similar, then as it moved horizontally, almost in line with the fly over connecting the station to the main side of town , i said to my husband it must be a bike or some one walking across the bridge.Islowed right down and then it became apparent that the light was above the bridge and much higher than it had first appeared. the light (about the size of a football in relation to us on the ground) then started zig zagging jerkily in a north easterly direction for a further 600 yrds (approx) then rose more quickly and dissappeared . At this point fire &apos;dropped&apos; away from the base of the ball not large amounts, it was just trailing off for a second before it dissappeared.", "Object appeared from the south/west, moving parallel to and pulling away from a low-flying small jet aircraft, flight path of both was straight and both were traveling at a high rate of speed, but sub-sonic. When first viewed we had the impression that the object resembled the spot of light formed by a search-light when shone on clouds, however there were no clouds of any type in the sky at that time and no light beam was visable from any direction, including none from the jet aircraft. This was the only aircraft that flew over this area at a low altitude during the 5 days we were at this location. I asked my son, who has many hours of flight time from his 5 1/2 yrs. as a Black Hawk helicopter crew chief with the U.S. Army&apos;s 160th Special Ops, if he knew of any natural cause for what we saw, his answer was &quot;no&quot;.

Due to the low altitude of both the object and aircraft they were out of view in about 90 seconds. The object appeared to be about 1/2 the size of the aircraft.

Drove by familiar watertower; a red, flashing light caught my eye--to bright for the tower light--looked up and saw a two-tiered vessel--very clear because of low cloud over--big as a house, close, tipped slightly toward me. Did not blink, stopped car in middle of street, got out of car, stared.I was working at Boeing at the newly opened space center. The red, flashing light first caught my eye, outside line of vision.  It was VERY close--just above the water tower, clearly outlined against the low cloud cover: two tiers, one smaller on top with large, red, clearly defined lights revolving clock-wise; the bottom, larger tier, with same-size green (traffic-light &quot;go&quot;) lights, also revolving clockwise, but a little slower than the upper, red lights. As big as a house; no sound. As I watched, without blinking, it slowly moved in my direction, and after 1-2 minutes it disappeared--no sound, just poof--gone. It was about 02:00 at start; 02:10 when I arrived home about a mile away.", "Flying home from England, I looked out the window to see the sights.  We were flying well above the cloud cover.  It was a glorious, sunny day.  Some distance away, I saw a small dark sphere that seemed to hover above the clouds.  Upon closer inspection, it almost seemed to be bobbing and weaving, maintaining its position relative to the cloud deck.The object seemed distant, yet it was about the size of a pea as seen through the aircraft window.  It was perfectly round and dark, with a dark reddish-brown cast to it.  It was perfectly outlined against the brilliant white clouds, and did reflect sunlight back from its edges as if it were very reflective but part of it was in shadow. (?) There was only one object, and it remained relatively motionless, just sort of bobbing and weaving.  On several ocassions, the object seemed to drift too much in a vertical or horizontal distance, then it quickly and smoothly returned to its original position. It stayed in full-view for as long as I could see as the airplane progressed.  My seatmate was asleep, this being a flight from Birmingham, UK to Newark, NJ.  So, there was no one else for me to confirm the sighting with.  I don&apos;t know what it was, but it seemed strange.  Do balloons of any kind ascend to that height?  I seem to recall the pilot saying that we were at about 38,000 feet.  And the little inflight video screens noted that we were over the Atlantic Ocean, somewhere near Iceland. I am a marketing professional with no prior sightings of this kind. I was returning from a major trade show in the UK.  I am a 35-year-old male American.", "Witnessed strobes of light spinning in a circle and then leaving our atmosphere.We were camping on a ridge that overlooked a canyon. Right at sunset while we looking at the view a bunch of lights came together and started to spin around like a strobe light would look. The object had no real definition it reminded me of a chameleon. I looked at my boyfriend and then in an instant it took off. Dark set in shortly and then the real show began. The object danced in the sky in three different locations before it left. The whole event lasted over three hours. Almost a year after the incident my boyfriend heard a radio show where a woman was describing the same three point location of the object from the previous summer. She was calling from Reno, so she would have witnessed the same sky we were looking at. No one has ever believed my story. Even the people in the camping group dont believe. But I do. This wasn&apos;t my first observation of unexplained objects in the sky. When I was 10-12 years of age I witnessed two lights in the sky go to one light and then took off out of sight. This all happened in Mendecino Co.", "My friend and I saw a triangle made of smaller triangles fly over us at a low altitude.My friend and I were sitting outside one night and we saw a unique bright light shining about 45 minutes. We were watching it. It did not make any noise or anything at this time. It just looked like a star for the longest time. But it was moving so we know it was not a star. We talked about it and forgot about it. After about 45 minutes it began getting larger and larger. Then it was about 100 meters high and on the other side of a hotel that it at Spencer and University. It was very loud at this time. It was black. It has about 10 lights (It looked like what I would call navigational lights). It was triangular in shape overall. It looked like it was made of about 4 triangles. It had beams holding it together. Kind of like a jungle gym that made a big triangle. Each section was distinct. The lights were placed on the tips of each corner, and on the &quot;torso&quot; of the craft. At this time we thought that it was a strange type of plane going in for a landing. Then it occured to us &quot;Where the hell is it going to land? On the ASU campus?&quot;. Then it flew behind the hotel. The noise went away. Then about 15 minutes later, it emerged from the other side of the hotel. It proceeded in a declining angle of projectory and went behind a parking garage and we never saw it again. Once again as soon as we could not see it we could not hear it. It was loud enough that you could have heard it at least a mile away. It was LOUD. The lights on the craft were slightly blurry or hard to focus on. So I am checking the aura/haze button below.", "I saw a green fireball in the sky and there was definitely an aircraft behind the ball of light.At about 3:55 a.m on December 19, 1998 I was outside of my work on break. I look to the east and saw a green ball of light flash on in the sky. I saw a video of a green fire ball on TV a few months ago and this was the same thing. Right above the tree top I saw the green ball of light &quot;come on&quot; and for a split second I could clearly see an aircraft either producing or behind the ball of light. It slowly went down behind the tree top and disappeared. About a minute later I saw it come up from behind the trees. It did not &quot;come on&quot; this time it was already on. It stayed above the tree top for a few seconds then went back down. I then saw a flash of red light from the same direction. At that time my break was over so that was all I observed, but I clearly an aircraft behind the ball of light. The ball of light was the same color as the green light from a &quot;red light&quot; it looked like an artificial light not a &quot;fire ball&quot;. This incident was observed from Thomas and 33rd Avenue.", "Quickly moving bluish/green light w/ tail. Meteor?I was walking my dog. I noticed my shadow on the snow like there was a quick flash of light. I looked up to the basically clear sky and saw a blue-green fireball with a slight tail moving N to S very quick. I don&apos;t think it was a shooting star because it was too low. No noise. No arc like a fire work. Completely straight line. It was about at a 45 degree angle from me and about the length of a pinky finger at arm&apos;s length. Entire event from flashing to light extinguishing was about 1.5 seconds. I saw it for over .5 sec before it extinguished. It seemed close. I dont think it was any craft but probably a meteor, just thought you&apos;d be interested.

I have been interested in UFOlogy for about two years now and attended an event in Seattle last August attended by Mr. Davenport and Dr. Greer. I am not 100% sure what I saw was of unexplicable orgin, it was however like nothing I have ever seen before. I was driving north on the 101 freeway, 85 miles south of San Francisco, in a very wilderness area.  I was on top of a hill and had a clear view of the sky obstructed by very few trees.  I was momentary startled as a bright flash of light streaked from the top of my wind shield towards the nothern horizon.  It moved through the sky at incredible speed and flashed twice before disappearing beyond the horizon.  The streak of light was whitish-yellow in appearance and had significant thickness giving the perspective of something that was realitivly close to the ground, three or four miles would be my unfounded impression.  Also the light was very bright especially in the two instances when it flashed, the drama of the effect resembled a lightning flash close then resembled any meteor I&apos;ve ever seen, with exception that the line traced in the sky was straight and there were no clouds in the sky. Also the object did not appear to burn our and fade away as meteors do, rather it just appeared to vanish at a point 20 degrees above the horizon, as if moving away from me a great speed. For some odd reason the second flash the object made, reminded me of the intro scenes to star trek the next generation where the enterprise makes a flash before going to warp. Nevertheless, in summary. The object had a large apparent size given the thickness of the trail. The object made two flashes as it streaked across the sky. The object traved from south to north. The object traversed at least 70 degrees of sky in 1/4th a second. The object was very bright, and had the effect of startling me.", "Craft had 3 bright circular white lights and flew WSW (against final approach pattern to Pearson International Airport) at roughly 2500-3000ft at a spd of ~200 knots.I was sitting at my computer looking out my window at the University of Guelph looking West. I watched as a craft flew over the residence bound West South West. The craft made no sound and proceded on a straight course at roughly 200 knots. The craft was triangular shaped with a bright circular light at each corner. No other lights were visible and the craft itself was dark (the triangular shape is a guess based on the position of the lights). Another interesting point is that the aircraft pattern to land at YYZ (Pearson International Airport) is ENE so this aircraft was headed against the commercial air traffic (I am an amatuer pilot).", "I was driving west on rt.33,i noticed there was a lot of stars out that night and very clear.When i got to the exit i wanted to go home, i noticed above the overpass,their was something blocking out the stars,but it wasn&apos;t a cloud,as i slowed down to watch it, it didn&apos;t move,it just hovered there,and i rolled down the window and didn&apos;t hear anything either.As i was driving on to the road(Rt.117 North) from the exit ramp,i kept looking at it,and behind the cloud shape there was a huge orange fire ball . when i got home a few minutes later i grabbed my camera and headed back to the overpass to take the picture,but it was gone.The shape did not have any lights.other than the fire ball behind it.", "we saw a bright yellow-blue-red light in the sky very high and a very high speedwe saw a bright light changed yellow-blue-red color in the sky very high the object varied its speed, the altitude and the direction of its fly suddenly.

I though it was a CHP car coming up from behind me because the flash was about the color of a police car light.  When I looked out my driver&apos;s side window, I saw a very bright blue-green light about 45 degrees above the eastern horizon.  It moved straight downward for about six seconds then appeared to burn out.  It didn&apos;t have a tail and it seemed to move slower than a shooting star or meteorite. It was about 1/4 to 1/3 the size of a full moon.  It was distinctive because of it&apos;s blue-green, almost bright cyan, color.", "a star-like body that moved very rapidly across a long distanceWe were star watching as we had done for many nights.

This area is known as bear caynon and the mountain ridge is at about 9,000ft ASL,  I would say the object was at approximently 18,000ft ASL. The sun was back lighting the mountains as it was rising, at first I thought it was a weather ballon, because we witness them all the time in this area of the sky in similar light conditions.  The only problem with this is the object simply disappeared, no movement, just poof, gone.

The distance between the lights appeared to be about 1/4 inch to me. It was way up in the sky - that I know. I do not know the shape of the object but only the shape the lights formed - either a square or triangle. Sorry but I simply can&apos;t remember if it was three or four red lights. I think it was four red lights in a square shape. Also I am not sure of the date.  I know it was either 12/15 or 12/16 between the hours of 11pm and 12pm.  If I had to pick a date I would say 12/15.

So i got my husband to look out the kitchen window,out to the backyard..up into the sky.i showed him, and he was amazed.I was scared. I watched this thing, this light that had no sound, no body,lightly float over my house.my kitchen lights were Off.I ran into the next room, following it, and it continued on,till out of sight.it was so low, and no sound. it was about 100 ft above my house.My husband now denies seeing it,says there is nothing we can do.i see this still. and i close my eyes and walk away... Fearing looking out my window at night.Now.. there is 1 more incident that is fresh in my mind.the incident i just described happenes often.But this incident i am going to explain next.. happened in August/98.

But, i do remember the light facing twords my house.like, when a helicopter with a light flickers when it moves. this did.but not that you could really notice it.i swear it was something.I know it was a ball of light with no body,No sound, and dissappeared in seconds.the end.", "Witnesses saw a bluish-white-light emitting spherical object on the ground a few feet from the edge of a feeder road alongside IH45 So.I was driving north on IH45 So. from Galveston to Houston the first Sunday in January 1975.  My mother, 12 yr old brother, 6 year old son, and 3 yr old niece were with me.  We had been visiting my grandparents and had left at 10:00 pm.  (THE TIME IS VERY IMPORTANT.  WE ALWAYS LEFT AT 10PM BECAUSE THAT&apos;S WHEN MY GRANDPARENTS WATCHED THE 10:00 NEWS AND IT WAS OUR SIGNAL TO GO HOME.)  At that time I always drove in the right or slower lane.  It was clear - no rain or fog.  We were coming to the exit to Ellington AFB which was approx. 2 miles to our right or east of the freeway.  I saw a well-lit object on the ground to our right and pointed it out to my family.  I pulled onto the shoulder and was trying to talk my brother into getting out with me to take a closer look.  My mother became hysterical and insisted I get back on the highway and so I did.  No one else stopped during this time, although I could see cars coming in the opposite direction from Houston and on the exit overpass. At that time, the area was not developed as it is now.  It was mostly used for cattle to roam about and feed on.  An almost continuous barbed wire fence about 4 ft high ran alongside the feeder road about 10 feet from the curb.  The fencing had been there for years.  The object was in front of a small grove of trees on the opposite side of the fence from us.  We could see the upper part of it but not the bottom and I am assuming this was because of the uncut grass and bushes that usually grew up alonside the fence.  The object was about 20 ft wide and 10 ft high.  It emitted a bluish-white light from the entire object.  I could tell it was round because the light was rotating in a counterclockwise pattern (my left to right as I viewed it), reflecting off the treetops when it got to the most extreme right of the object and before it reappeared on the left.  The best comparison I can make is that of a lighthouse.  I could make out rectangles set longside down, rounded edges rather than squared off, and set within a thin frame.  Each was the height of the object and several feet long.  The entire object emitted this light and in addition, each rectangle got extra bright in the counterclockwise sequence, one after the other.  This was also apparent when the light was reflecting off the trees.  We didn&apos;t hear any sounds, but we had our windows rolled up.

I do not remember going to the bathroom at all because of the very large red and blue orbs that appeared one on each side approximately 50-100 yards apart from us. The intensity of the orbs blinded us like a paralyzed deer in headlights. Slowly thay came together directly in front of us and merged they shot straight into the sky.

We went outside and stood facing the south in our driveway.  At the end of our driveway, there was something that had to be huge, because it blocked out the stars in the sky.  It was just above the treeline and we could not make out a shape because of treetops coming together over part of it and also because of an outside light behind us that made it hard to get our eyes accustomed to the dark.  It had three large white lights (like spotlights) that strobed in a regular series one after the other and repeated this over and over for the twenty minutes we stood and watched.  There were several red and green lights which did not blink in a row. There was absolutely no sound, but there was a faint feel of an electrical charge in the air.  No smell.

The Ball of light was traveling North.  The light appeared to have landed 3 to 4 miles away, but due to the treeline, we could not see it actually land.  It looked much brighter than a meteor.  In fact it was the brightest thing in the sky.((NUFORC:  Please seen related report from 2nd witness for same event.))", "This is the second time I have seen a black spherical object in this  general area.The sky was clear the weather was nearly perfect. I was standing on West Commercial near the corner of Main Street here in East Rochester watching a centenial parade when I noticed this black sphere slowly moving NNE fairly slowly. My view of it was obstructed by the buildings across the street after only a few seconds and never saw it again. It seemed to be void of any features. No lights, wings, or protrusions of any kind could be seen. Due to the parade, I could not tell if it emitted any sound. I am not a good judge of size and distance so I&apos;m sorry to say that I have no reliable reference. My guess would be that it was maybe a half mile away and maybe 20 feet across. Again this could be so far off due to my being blind in one eye and not having any depth perception what so ever. I was standing with a friend, but didn&apos;t ask him about whether he saw anything until after it was no longer visable. He had not seen it. I didn&apos;t hear anyone else nearby talking about it. This is the second time in about two years that I have seen an object like this. The first was not far away in Rochester NY and was not too far east of the Monroe County International Airport and was certainly in one of the normal flight paths. That one was much higher and farther with no sound being heard from it. I did see another just like it on a TV show (on FOX I believe) last year and recognized it as the exact same thing that I saw. No doubt about it, it was exactly the same. The one in the TV show was video taped from a car and I think it was out of the passenger side window.

We were camped near Stampede Lake which is about 20 miles NE of Truckee, CA and 30 mi. due West of Reno, NV as the crow flies.  I got up to relieve myself at around {maybe one a.m. or so}and was looking up to enjoy the unfiltered view of the stars. Sometimes you can catch a satellite moving overhead. I then spotted what at first to be just that coming from the north, but noticed that it was just a little brighter than the average satellite. It looked kind of like a star in the sky would. Anyway, I observed the object for about 20 seconds and it continued to travel in a straight line to the SE. But the object stopped overhead and blended in like a star in the sky for several moments then began moving again. The object then picked up speed [it was quite phenomenal] and then made an abrupt 90 degree turn to the NE and continued to pick up speed.

The family consists of two adults and three children ages 13, 12, and 8.  I, my wife, and my 12 year old son observed an unknown moving green light.  The strangeness of this sighting impressed all three of us, and I immediately dictated a few notes on our observation. The disc of light was larger than the pipoint of light usually seen from a star or meteor.  The visual angles subtended were similar to what one would see from a green stop light at a distance of about a quarter of a mile.  We viewed the object when looking out the left-side van windows while traveling at about 50 mph in an east-south-east direction.  Since the disc did not appear to chane size and moved in a left to right direction as we looked in the north-north-east direction, this lead to the perception that the object was moving roughly in the same direction as we were, but of course falling as well as moving forward.  Although we could entertain guesses as to distances and speeds, I don&apos;t believe there is any objective basis for doing so. The trajectory swept a path from a elevation angle of 30 degrees to an elevation angle of 10 degrees, while the azimuthal angle swept through approximately 20 degrees.  The visual duration was between 1 and 2 seconds.  Both my wife and my son reported the path as being curved downward.  The duration of the image was so short that I am not sure whether I perceived the path as a straight line or curved. The color was distinctively green, much like a stoplight green with not as much blue in it.  The sighting took place approximately a mile west of tyson&apos;S Corner.  The sky was partly cloudy and although some stars and airplane lights could be seen, there were none in the vicinity of the unknown object sighted.

We had seen them before and knew what they were---a light white in color that looked like a star way up there moving much faster than a jetplane in a straight path across the sky. Anyway all we saw at first was stars--the sky was clear--no clouds.... This was on a night where us kids had school the next morning and although it was just after dark, we were stretching our time outside before our parents actually made us come inside for the night. The kennedy Space Center is not terribly far as the crow flies and when the sky is clear, we can easily see the space shuttle shortly after it is launched. But back then there was no shuttle. We could hear a single engine plane landing at the Gainesville airport less than five miles away. I was looking off to the north east and one of the other kids excitedly said &quot;Hey! Look at that...It&apos;s as big as a Battleship!!!!&quot; (Well, it wasn&apos;t as big as a battleship, but there was a large dark object coming our way just above the trees probaly no more than 100ft up at the most and 50-60ft at the least.) When I first looked over to my left to the north the first thing I noticed was some Red glowing lights moving towards us thru the trees. As this thing came out from behind the trees to the clear area over the road we were standing on then we got a clear view of it. Looking at it from directly underneath, it was a dark solid triangle and from my memory thru all these years, each side was of equal length. there was a round red softly glowing light on each corner so that if the lights were not exactly ! on each corner they were very close to the point of each corner. These lights were no more than three feet in diameter, possibly a little smaller 1-1/2--2ft in dia. They were not reflecting off the underside of the object. There was NO SOUND. We were not afraid, but I said &quot;Lets get your parents&quot; and we started running south down NW9th street (the same street we were at the north end of---The same street that my friends lived on) We were able to run ahead of the object so it couldn&apos;t have been moving more than 5mph...It was coming the same direction (south) not directly over 9th street, and not directly over the homes on 9th, but between the street and their front yards. By the time we ran the distance of about 5 homes and quickly got my friends parents out of the house to observe this, this thing had reached our position. The Two parents saw it too as it came over us again. After we raise a fuss over this thing it seemed to rise up higher and level off at maybe a hundred feet or mor higher than we first saw it and it continued on. It never went any faster, but the farther away it got it simply blended in with the sky-- the farther away it got , the harder it was to see until we coult not see it any more. although with binoculars it would have been observable for longer.I could type more details.... but I&apos;m getting tired for now-- I could answer more details easier in person, because there is more to this story as it continues 11 years later-- not with me but someone else and about 60 miles away in Ocala National Forest over State road 19.", "My husband was standing in our living room when he noticed two objects in the east, he called me to come see. There were two strange crafts, not moving and had yellow, red,green and orange lights on them. Suddenly another appeared to the left  and as it did the one on the right moved swiftly to the south followed by middle one. The last one hoovered for about a minute and swiftly followed the other two. This was very strange because of the location and the direction they went out of our sight. We were using our binoculars when they finally started moving and the speed of them was scarey. We stood there wondering if anyone else had witnessed what we had.  The sky was very clear.", "object had sections like a large tootsie roll only more squared, no lights or noise,lit by city lights moved smoothly in straight line overhead.got a good look but could&apos;nt explain what made it fly.I.m normal blue collar family manI like to look at the sky, I see things ,this is one .

Thank you.", "Faint disk travelling parallel to I495 southbound in Littleton MA.I was driving south on I495 (in Littleton?) 10 to 15 minutes south of junction with Route 4 in Chelmsford MA. I saw an object come into view at my right through the top center of my windshield travelling approximately the same direction as me but faster. It dissappeared behind hills or trees on the right side of the road. It was visible for less than one second. It appeared round, but this was difficult to judge. It very dim, not much brighter than the night sky. I saw no running lights. When I reached my destination I tried to simulate what I saw by reflecting light from my flashlight in my windshield. I wasn&apos;t able to do this without also creating other bright spots inside the passenger compartment which I would have noticed.", "Greenish-blue fireball at approx. 45 degree angle, moving east to west, first observed at highest point approx.one o&apos;clock position, moved downward at 45 degree angle and disappeared at horizon.see above", "After a concert given in the small town of Palmira, Colombia,  a group of people accompanied the singer to the town square to talk with the artist. While this group was there a large circular object (like a full moon) appeared near the hills and then came and hovered over the square for nearly an hour. This happened on a Saturday night in the middle of October in 1947. It was seen by approximately 65 people in this small town.This event occured in October of 1947. A vocal concert was given in this small town of Palmira, Colombia, S.A. It is located near to Cali, Colombia. The U.P.S. was notified of this incident and sent reports over the wires at that time. After the concert a group of people (approximately 65) followed the artist to the town square to talk and get autographed pictures.  While at the square the group noticed a large object that looked like a full moon near the mountains.  It was neon blue-green color.  It made no noise other than a very low grade electrical hum.  The object came and hovered over the square for nearly an hour. It did nothing but hover above the square pulsating brighter and darker in the same blue-green color. It was about the size of a football stadium, and completely covered the square. After hovering. it slowly zig-zagged away from the square and then took off at a high rate of speed straight up.  When it did the zig-zig movement it left a trail behind like the tail of a comet.", "ON THE ABOVE DATE,MYSELF AND THREE OTHER BOYS HAD ENTERED THE BACK GATE OF THE CARLINS DRIVE INN THEATER TO SEE A MOVIE.

Afterwards, a bright glowing object moved from my right to left, jitterd and dissapeared.I was inside my apartment, looking outside the window that faces south over the city of Columbus.  It was about 4:30 AM.  I was watching the stars and the moon.  I looked up about 75 degrees, and I saw a formation of lights.  The lights were not a brilliant in their luminicity, and I assumed that it was rather high in the atmosphere.  When I first saw it, I thought the stars were moving...impossible...then I realized what I was seeing.  It looked like a large arrow in the sky, and it moved about &quot;one foot&quot; across my field of view, then it hovered and just stayed there.  To demonstrate what it was, make an equalateral triangle with a 6 dot pattern...then attach a smaller square, using 5 dots.  There should be a total of 11 dots.  (I don&apos;t remember exactly how many lights there were)  I assumed I was seeing many craft, but now wonder if it may have been one craft with many lights.  I wastched it for about 20 seconds, just hovering in the sky (it &quot;pointed&quot; upwards at an angle of 45 degrees.)  I walked away from the window, amazed, and went to the bathroom and looked in the mirror.  I came back, and the lights were gone.  Off to my right, there was a bright light.  I didn&apos;t hear any noises and it seemed to move quite quickly across the sky, at about 1 foot per second.  I expected for it to go off into the horizon, but it did not.  There was a tree near my window, just off to my left.  It flew &quot;between&quot; two branches and slowed down.  Then it moved upwards quite eradically and blinked out.  I think this was all meant for me to see for some reason.  There is more to tell, about myself actually...and it leads to conclude that I may be a subject of theirs.  I would like very much to be contacted about this.", "Witnessed an immense, triangular object moving from North to South at a rate of speed never before seen while star-gazing.While standing in a friend&apos;s backyard star-gazing, we noticed an object moving across the sky from North to South about 50x faster than an aircraft flying well above the cloud layer.  The object was immense, perhaps 2 inches from point to point, from where we stood.  No sound. No explanation that fits any aircraft, satellite, or meteor that we have seen on multiple occasions.  Our first sighting of something we could not explain after many years of star-gazing. We are both teachers, well-respected members of the community, and have a hard time trying to explain this one to others.  The shape remained unchanged as it shot across the sky, only to disappear silently.  Our only difference of opinion was whether the lights on each point were blue or white.  Since my friend is better at picking out colors of stars, I have to submit to his sighting of blue lights on the points.  Just plain bizarre.  Can&apos;t explain it better than how we saw it.  I probably wouldn&apos;t have posted it here, since I didn&apos;t know this site even existed, until my friend e-mailed me the similar sighting in Ohio on the same night.", "My wife was walking to the driveway to leave and called me outside. We spotted a large blinking white light moving in a zig-zap pattern.Approximately 9:00 P.M. Monday, March 22, 1999 my wife was leaving to pick up our daughter. When she got outside she called me to come outside as fast as I could. She pointed out a large white blinking object moving from west to east. The said that it had moved from side to side very quickly. I ran inside to retreive a pair of binoculars and spotted it again. I did observe it to dash to the south faster than any aircraft that I had ever seen. Then it zipped towards the northeast before continuing it&apos;s west to east heading.", "I was watching for the leonids meteors before going into work. I saw three lights (dim, like distant stars) in a triangular formation. I watched them pass from east of overhead to the southwest horizon. They did not burn up, leave a trail, or anything meteors usually do.I&apos;m a federal employee.  I tried to convince myself that these were simply meteors, but the fact that they moved horizontally without losing any apparent altitude, combined with the duration of time I witnessed these lights, as well as the unchanging distance between all three lights throughout the event, tells me that these could not have been meteors.  The odds of THREE meteors having the same speed, and direction in a formation that makes a perfect triangle, at the exact same time... God, that&apos;s got to be one hell of an unlikely event. It was also completely silent.", "It was the same night that a triangle was seen over Pheonix Az. Summer 1996 I beleive. I heard about it after I saw this thing. I was laying out in the back yard observing the stars and watching for sattelites. The moon was pretty bright and had not long been up. I noticed two stars to the south that I had never seen befor. Then I noticed they were moving south to north and east of me. I then realized that there were three stars moving S to N. I first thought it was three sattilites or possibly aircraft moving. There was no sound.. and I had never seen three sattilites move in the same area like this befor. I called for my wife to get my binoculars. She did. By this time the three lights had formed a triangle east of me and were low on the horizon. I could not put all three lights in the field of view of the binoculars. I had to go from light to light. I then noticed that the triangle was really dark in the center and blocked out other stars as it passed S. to N. I then lost it as it moved to the north. It was not three objects. It was one BIG object.I am a private investigator. I have been a policeman. I have been a cowboy and a mule packer, accoustomed to watching the sky for signes of weather. ect.", "Formation of stationary lights - most turning on and off and VERY similar to the infamous March 13 Phoenix sightingsAt approximately 9:45 my father, who lives about a half mile from me, called and said he had been watching these lights go on and off for about 10 minutes and that I should meet him outside to check them out. I arrived to see a stationary yellow light (which i&apos;ll call the &quot;main&quot; light through the rest of this description) which was at least twice the magnitude of the brightest star in the southern sky.  The light was flickering somewhat like a distant light on the horizon would.  This light was located pretty much due south from our vantage point (Bell Rd. and Reems Rd.).  We watched the light for about 2 minutes and noted some lights on the ground directly below it for reference to see if the light moved east/west and it did not.  Soon another identical light appeared slightly below and to the west of the first light.  The distance between the 2 was about that of 4 fingers held at arms length.  From our location we could also see the lights from Luke AF Base which is about 2 miles east and 6 miles south of us.  So this seemed to put the lights about 2 miles west of the base. At this point we jumped in the car and began heading south to the end of Reems Rd. (1 mile south of Luke AFB).  During these 7 miles heading south, the main light was straight ahead, just barely west of the center of the road.  It went out a few times but came right back on.  The second light however now had a few companions right next to it that continued to come on and off in about 1 second intervals - VERY reminiscent of the famous sighting of March 13, which I have seen on video clips many times. The distance between each light in the &quot;set&quot; of lights to the west of the main light was about 1/4 fingers width apart held at arms length. They would turn on and off in random sequence, usually side by side with a slight arc if they had been connected with a line, and at one point came on and off in a sequence which, had they all been on simutaneously, was in the pattern of a greater than symbol.  At any one time, there were up to 3 lights on at the same time in the &quot;set&quot;. Had they all been on simultaneously there were about 7 or 8 lights total, assuming they were all stationary. As we got to the end of Reems Rd., we headed west about 2-3 miles to Highway (&quot;Loop&quot;) 303 and turned back south.  At this point, the main light was now slightly to the east of the road.  This told us that the light was a lot closer than a star, for example. And by using triangulation, the light main light would be located south and somewhere between these 2 roads. We traveled another 6-8 miles south to Broadway Rd. and stopped and got out of the car. From the time we left the house, it was approximately 30 minutes and the main light had NOT moved, while the others inconsistently but continually came on and off in the same area of the sky.  We had travelled a total of about 15 miles south and were still seemingly quite north of them.  Finally, the main light disappeared only to reappear about 15 seconds later with another light of the same magnitude RIGHT next to it.  Both of these lights then went out.  I was low on gas and my dad hadn&apos;t even told my mom he was leaving the house so we just left perplexed.  We looked back quite a few times but saw nothing. I just want to make it clear that NONE of these lights ever moved.  The &quot;set&quot; came on and off way too rapidly and continuosly in the same spot to be flares.  As for the main light, I don&apos;t know of any flare or plane that could stay in the exact same spot in the sky for 45 minutes. There was no audible sound, no smoke, no activity from the Air Force Base (i.e. no incoming/outgoing aircraft) or anything other than the glowing yellow lights - and the altitude was about that of those in the videos of the March 13 sightings.  This whole incident was just remarkably similar to what I saw on those videos.  If you would like additional information, please feel free to contact me.((NUFORC:  These same lights were observed by many individuals in the general vicinity of Phoenix, AZ, on several nights during mid-November.  We have one report that they may have been related to a military exercise, but this assertion is unconfirmed.

The others looked normal.  I brought this to the attention of others as being strange, at the time I had no idea as to the oddity.  I was listing to G.

Again I am not to sure of the time frame because I did not know what I was looking at.", "I saw a wedged shaped craft with very bright lights, approx. 150 feet above the street near my home on December 3,1998 at 11:30 pm.On Thursday night, December 3, 1998, I was driving alone toward my home.  At approximately 11:30 pm, I turned right onto my street, heading south toward my house.  Just after going through the stop sign at the next intersection. I saw three large, bright, round headlights very low in the sky ahead of me.  Two were very bright, white.  The third, in between the white ones and slightly lower, was bright red.  All three were at least three times the size of a standard car headlight.  Two smaller white lights were to the rear.  In spite of the glowing brightness of the lights, the street was not brightly illuminated, considering that the lights appeared to be  just above the tree tops.  From my vantage point, they were behind and slightly to the left of the next intersection. I slowed down, turned off the radio and stopped the car, for the briefest moment, in order to have a better look at what was happening since I was heading in their direction.  Instantly,I realized that the lights weren&apos;t moving, there was no engine noise, the pattern of lights was not like an airplane and there were no blinking lights such as an airplane would have,  plus it was much too close to the ground-maybe 150 feet or so up.  This was something different. Since I had stopped just short of the driveway of the house before mine, my next thought was to hit the Genie button and head for my garage.  As I accelerated and drove toward my driveway, in the direction of the lights, I saw that the lights were moving toward me; very slowly and noiselessly, staying at the same height and now parallel to the road.  At this point I was very anxious to get into the garage.  As I turned left into my driveway, I saw that the garage door had not opened so I pressed the Genie button again and paused at the bottom of the drive in order to make sure that the door was opening. (My driveway is gravel, on an uphill slope. I can&apos;t stop halfway up because the wheels spin in the gravel and the car can&apos;t safely make it inside without swerving.)  I looked up to the right and saw that the lights were slowly approaching where I was stopped.  They were so close that I could see the under-belly of a triangular, wedge-shaped craft, somewhat like a Stealth Bomber.  It was a clear, windless night and the shape was a black sillouette against the night sky, but there was no noise.  At that point, the craft was at the far corner of my front yard, up above (approx.150 ft +-) the telephone pole which is about 80 ft from my driveway. I stepped on the accelerator and drove into the garage with just enough clearance to get under the door, which was still rising.  Immediately,  I hit the Genie button and remained rivited to my seat until the door closed. It was then I realized that the engine was still running.  Next, I shut off the engine, ran into the house, shut off the alarm, waited a moment so I could reset it and immediately ran to the nearest window.  The craft was gone.  For the next few minutes I ran around the darkened house looking through various windows but the only other thing I saw was a shooting light over Lake Washington at about Laurelhurst. I called the friend I had just dropped off before heading home.  And then by 11:49, I had called you to report what I had seen. For the record: There were no other cars driving on the street.  There is no through access from my street so there is very little traffic.  I have never seen a &quot;UFO&quot; before.  My friend and I were coming home from the Symphony, after which we had stopped at Barnes &amp; Noble and Starbucks to get  lattes.", "I was looking into the bright blue sky wathing a trail from a high speed us aircaft.  When I was looking I saw a bright circular item stationary looking towards the the north west sky and I was looking up at about a 65% angle.  I saw the bright white object in the sky.  It looked like a light from an aircraft pointing straight at you. then the light went out.  I could see a faint silver object still staionary.  Then it just vanished.  No jet trails no flashing lights.  I looked al over the sky to relocate it with no luck.", "Craft was triangular in shape.craft was black with no reflection of light off of it, about 25 feet across with one red light on each side in the back. we first noticed it hovering over a water tower by a factory about 3 to 4 miles from the airport. before we reached the area it was in it headed toward the airport. We would catch up to it as it hovered over different areas such as woods, or fields only to have it take off in a different direction. Once as we watched it slowly fly above a wooded area it came to the end of the trees by a field ,it slowly tilted and followed the contour of the landscape. As it came to trees again on the other side of the field it tilted upward again. After reaching the tree tops it took off(every time it took off it was at an extremely high speed)and we had to search the area until we would spot it again. This craft made no noise at all and once when we were looking for it my husband looked in the rear view mirror and saw the glow of lights. we stopped the 8888 88", "In twilight a disk shaped object &quot;about the size of a dime held at arms length was seen by a husband and wife.

There were no overcast conditions and my attention was drawn to a lighted object which looked like any other star except that it moved in irregular patterns.  These patterns were a continuing sereis of short movements up, down, left and right with 90 degree turns.  Occasionally the object would move in a semicircular fashion.  When viewed through an 8 power binocular the object appeared no different than any of the many stars visible nearby.  The object first appeared approximately 40 degrees above the Eastern horizon.

While driving North on Hwy 101 in California, 5 miles So of Gilroy (about 40 miles So of San Jose), a bright light attracted my attention. Was about 45 degrees above horizon and slightly on the left of the road, traveling from right to left but descending at about a 15 degree angle. It first appeared as a very bright trail which quickly formed a blob with raggedy edges about four time the width of the original trail. Looked like it was exploding. Then everything disappeared. There was no residual trace forward. Seen at arm length, the trail (tail?) was about 1/2 inch in length, the &quot;blob&quot; about the same in diameter. There was some light clouds but the object light was very bright and could have been seen through them.

At one point during the space walk the robotic arm or some other part of the shuttle was in the center of the screen.  This separated the screen into black (outer space) areas on the right side of the screen and a black (outer space) area on the left side of the screen.  In the black area (outer space) on the left side of the screen, I saw a small white circle move quickly from right to left.  It seemed to appear out of nowhere; maybe it was just entering the light of the sun-I don&apos;t know.  It lasted about 1 second.  Immediately thereafter the view on television switched from the camera to the prepared graphics, and some astronaut guy started babbling.  I could still hear the audio of the astronauts, but I don&apos;t think that they saw this thing.  They were still talking about their work.It looked like a perfect circle; white in color.  I&apos;m sure somebody must have the entire space walk on tape to confirm or disconfirm what I saw.  It is only 1 second out of 4+ hours of space walks.", "Green flaming ball streaking from north to south with tail behindWhile driving along in my car I saw a burning ball, greenish in color, streaking across the sky from north to south.

It had a tail that made it appear as one would think a comet would appear, but then it went out of view.", "this is the forth or fifth time i have seen the green balls in sky at number of locations in northern mn green circle glowing brightly and some times changing directions east to west altitude also has variedmy girlfriend and I were on our way home from here job and when we got out of the car I happened to be looking up and noticed the strange light heading east to west in the ski kindof zig zagging back and forth. This is I beleive the forth instance that I myself have seen this same object my girlfriend has seen on two occasions. Some nights it appears to be much slower and more erratic in its trajectory although it has not been low enough to get a close look it is fairly obvious that it is not a airplane/jet for there is no sound at all and the manuvaers are so erratic that any normal aircraft pilot would have lost his flight privlages.

Then I saw it out another window just to the left of original location.  My wife saw it too this time, we both went outside and viewed it directly (it was behind some trees at times) and could notice rotation and also was disappearing and reappearing.  Overall we viewed it for about 20 minutes.  No sound whatsoever.   Maybe no more than 300-500 yeards away. We did not see movement, only disappearing and reappearing in same general location.  It was about 1/10 the size of a full moon.At about 2040 AKST North Pole Alaska area toward the NorthEast my wife and I witnessed a &quot;Orange Sphere&quot; hovering low on horizon just to the east of where I viewed and videotaped two similar objects on September 24th 1998.  I first saw it at the kitchen window of our cabin and  called for my wife, who was on the couch to come to the window, but, it was gone before she could get to the window,  I went to get my coat and go outside to get more firewood when I saw the object.  I then saw it again through another window, it appeared to be left of original location.  I called for my wife again and she watched it, saying oh that&apos;s probably a light from a house, I reminded her that no houses are over where the light was, she then said I am going out and stood at the kitchen window watching it as she put her coat on.  I went outside before her and watched it.  It was spinning and had bright orange fire encircling it, about 1/10 the size of a full moon, it then disappeared so I went back in and said it was gone.  My wife  said &quot;No it&apos;s back&quot; as she was still at kitchen window.  I looked out and saw it then she went out as I went upstairs to get the video camera.  She was at slough (overflow of the Chena River) and viewing it clearly (before it was behind some trees at times) while I was getting the camera, I turned on the camera as a walked out the door,  It disappeared as I walked out.

It resembled a rocket lauch contrail and I suspect that is what it was. Unlike other rocket lauches I have seen it was traveling horizontally at a relatively slow speed (200 kt est) and the contrail was fully lit up with a bright white light uniformally.  At the front was a single point of bright white light.  As we got close to the dissapating contrail we thought that possibly an aircraft in front was dumping fuel and the residue was being lit by the city lights below.  We asked PHX tracon about this possibility and they were very unhelpful and almost argumentative.  The only known traffic was another aircraft 15 miles ahead that we also had in sight. The object was in view for approx. 2 min from a point I would estimate over Goodyear AZ traveling WSW originating at 15000&apos; and climbing to possibly 18000&apos;.  Several aircaft reported it and queried ATC.  We flew through the extreme tail end of the contrail with no odor.  The object faded from view after approx. 2 minutes and the reappeared after another 1-2 minutes at a point I would estimate as 20-25 miles SW of PHX again traveling WSW at an estimated 18000&apos;.  It was in view for approx 2 minutes at that time also and at least one other aircraft reported it.  We were then in contact with ABQ center ATC and queried them about the object. They had nothing on radar they reported. I have seen rocket launches before and this was different in several regards.  First the point that would be the rocket and the contrail were both uniformally bright white.  Not bright at the origin and fading to orange as would be expected.  Second the contrail was very wide and had the shape of a fan or as I said it had the shape of a comet but was very large.  Third and very unusual was the fact that Air Traffic Control had no knowledge of a launch.  They always give prior alerts to any such launch. I would appreciate any feedback on this object.", "Shape of a foot-long ruler.  Seemingly semi-transparant.  4 glowing spots (not blinking) arranged evenly accross bottom.  High and extremely fast or low and totally silent.  Vanished after 15 seconds.My wife and I were lying on our backs on the top of our condo watching the stars and satellites. We both saw this object, with the shape of a foot-long ruler heading directly north up the coast.  It seemed to be semi-transparant, that is it appeared to be a bit fuzzy, although the edges were sharp.  There were 4 glowing spots (not blinking) arranged evenly accross bottom. I say glowing spots, rather than lights, because they appeared similar to glow-in-the-dark luminescent spots. The object was either very high and extremely fast or else low and with a reasonable speed, but totally silent. It completely and suddenly vanished after about 15 seconds. We couldn&apos;t sleep that night;-) I have e-mailed a PhotoShop reconstruction of the object.", "An unidentified flying object sited over Carbondale Illinois.  The object travelled from North to South in a direct path at a speed that I could not define, maybe over Mach 3.  The aircraft was out of sight within ten seconds from beginning to end.   It was orange  to orange white in color.  There were three other witnesses.  I witnessed a meteor shower only a few days before, an event created by  mother nature that I never thought could have been topped.  However, the event I witnessed tonight had no trailing particles and traveled as fast as I have ever seen  within our atmosphere.  The event seemed to be &quot;man made&quot;, not a natural annomoly.At approximetaly 10:30 P.M. on November 23, 1998, myself and three other witnesses saw an unidentified flying object travelling in a direct path from North to South at a very high speed slightly to the West  of us.  We were standing outside behind the house at ((address deleted)) Street in Carbondale, Illinios.  The craft appeared to be glowing orange to orange/white in color, and had two distinct sources of light.  One light possitioned on the West side of the craft,  and the other on the East.  Both balls of light seemed to be connected to each other, but there was no distinct divider or connection between the two.  However, the two sources of light appeared to be illuminating from one distinct aircraft.  The incident from beginning to end lasted about ten seconds.  Also, from my point of view, the object was traveling at a height of between 20,000 and 40,000 feet.  I am a private pilot with almost 200 hours of flight time, and am working on my instrument rating.  I have been to the Oshkosh Air Show and have seen F-14 jets flying, as well as F-18s taking off from Springfield, Illinois, as well as one F-18 flying over Carbondale a short time ago.  However, I have never witnessed any aircraft traveling at the rate of the one seen tonight.   I am convinced by the speed and  peculiar light arrangement that the aircraft witnessed tonight was either military or totally unidentified.  I must also say that while almost directly over head the ball of light on the West side of the Craft changed positions with the ball of light on the east side of the craft.  That is,  two balls of light were connected to each by no divider.  The most miraculous thing that we saw, was the ball of light to the west pass infront of the ball of light to the east and change positions with it at full speed.  In essence, the aircraft spun horizontally 180 degrees while traveling in a straigjht line, as if the craft suddenly spun around backwards, but continued to fly in the original direction of flight  at the same speed.  The craft ! never altered directiion, and flew in the same flight path, but turned around directly above our position on earth as if it could fly forward and backwards with the same flight characteristics.  The lights of the craft were of one color which does not  satisfy Federal Aviation Regulations of having anti-collision lighting systems, stroble lighting systems, or landing light systems as required on normal civillian aircraft.  As a Private Pilot and an experienced person of the flight environment, I feel that what I have witnessed tonight could have either been a Military flight or an Unidentified Flying Object, but under no circumstances was it a civilian flight.  I called Collumbia Flight Service first to see if they had any knowledge of the aircraft that I had just witnessed, and they gave me a negative response.  However, they directed me to the number for the U.F.O. Reporting Center where I left a recorded message.  I also attempted to contact Scott Airforce Base and  Kansas City Flight Center to inquire about the incident.  There was no answer at either of these facilities, but shortly thereafter I came in contact with Peter Davenport, the Director of the National UFO Reporting Center in Seattle, Washington.  He returned my message.  I have three other witnesses who saw the incident and have there own account of the story, but I was the first one to notice the event.  I am fully willing to cooperate to the best of my capabilities regarding this matter, and can be reached at any time at my Carbondale address or telephone  number.   Please contact me for further details or specific information.  This has already been a fulfilling experience, one that I will never forget.  Thank you for your time and understaniding regarding this  matter.  Hopefully, everything we have encountered tonight will only serve to further the human race.

The report from Mosinee,10/1/98, describes the same type object seen by my wife. She had the objects in view for approx. 7 minutes. The three discs remained motionless for the duration of sighting. She exited the highway still observing the three discs. Her view of the objects was momentarily blocked by trees upon turning onto the road to our home. When her view was unobstructed she looked back for the objects but they had vanished. My five year old daughter also saw the the objects. She asked if they were ghosts in the sky.

I was the only one facing the ocean, and the sun had gone down.  We were talking away when suddenly I saw something following the downward trajectory of a shooting star, kind of an arc.  The strange thing was that it was green.  I remember it being in about the 10 o&apos;clock position, if straight up were 12.  Maybe more like 9:20.  Anyways, before I had a chance to say anything, though that was my intention, the thing suddenly shot straight up very quickly and vanished like a firework. It just was gone.  The whole event was strange, but I was definately struck by the almost simultaneous shift from a downward arc to a  shooting straight up with what appeared to be 4 jets or flames shooting out from below.  Of course, the color change was unexplainable also.  By the time I had my hand in the air pointing to the spot it was gone and I had to explain the whole thing to my friends, who were chatting away.  One of them, sitting facing me, is an avid UFO guy, and felt resentful that HE was not the one to witness this event!  While I have listened to him in the past, and assume a general attitude of &quot;why not?&quot;, I kind of stay away from this subject for the most part.  I think it makes people paranoid.  I don&apos;t remember for certain in this happened in August, but it was last summer, and I remember it being a particularily windy evening.  I had never heard of these green lights before, but later my UFO friend recounted to me other stories of them.", "Fall of 1971 or 1972 between 1pm and 4pm.  Place:  North Tarrytown, New York.  I was 10 or 11 years old, playing in yard with younger brother.  We were called to front of house by mother to see &quot;something in the sky&quot;.  We saw a metallic, disk shaped object with dome and portholes.  Each porthole glowed with lights that were colorful and bright.  It was hovering at a height of 10 to 15 stories high.  Suddenly, it started to rise quickly and then took off north.Sometime between fall 1971 or 1972. It was a cloudy day sometime between noon and 4pm.  I was 10 or 11 years old and my brother 8 or 9.  We were playing in yard when our mother yelled for us to come over to the front of the house to see &quot;something in the sky&quot;.  We ran over and saw, at a height of 10 to 15 stories high, across the street, and slightly to the right from our position, a smooth, metallic, disk shaped object with a dome and brightly lit portholes.  It was stationary but seemed to be slowly rotating and did not make any noise whatsoever.  What impressed us about the portholes is that they had bright, pulsing colors emanating from them. At this height it seemed a little over shoulder width in width from my vantage point (I am 6ft tall with jacket lenght of 42-44). After a minute or so, it rose straight up until it seemed the size of a dime and then took off in a northerly direction.  It was out of sight in about 10 seconds.  This happened when we resided on 138 Beekman Avenue in North Tarrytown, New York.  The residence was right next to a police station.  We were on the sidewalk looking up and slightly north.  My mother recalls the event but refuses to talk about it other than remark that she does remember it as I described it.  My brother remembers it clearly.  This memory resurfaced winter of 1992 and at first I thought it was of a dream until I checked with my brother and mother.  My mother seems scared about that incident, my brother has an interest in the subject and I have been staring at the sky and reading related information ever since.  I would like to know if this sighting has ever been documented by others and if there were any newspaper reports in the local papers.

A light appeared at 10 o&apos;clock which caught my attention because it looked to be an aircraft coming in for a landing. The problem with that was that Cleveland Hopkins Airport was 10 miles west of my position. I was traveling at 60 mph and the light maintained its 10 0&apos;clock position throughout the sighting. It was a clear night and having lived within 5 miles of Hopkins Airport for the last 33 years I know what a plane looks like at night. As the craft passed overhead I heard no sound and could only make out six perfectly round, bright lights arranged in a circle. I did not see it land, but in 33 years of watching airplanes I never say a light configuration like this.", "Strange, projectile-firing light over northern california.I am a college student majoring in computer science here in the Northern California Bay Area. At 6:27 this evening, as I sat studying in my room, I glanced out my window and noticed an unusually bright light moving rapidly across the sky, heading north west. Thinking it might be something unusual, such as a satellite, meteor, or maybe the space shuttle, I went outside for a better look. I followed it closely as it moved the night sky. It made no sound, had no flashing running lights of any sort, and appeared to be at a very high altitude. I was about to go in, thinking it was probably a satellite, when it began to fire what I can only describe as missiles or rockets! I could not believe my eyes! This thing let loose seven bright projectiles which traveled away from it and down, leaving a bright tracer. There was a pause between each one. Certain it was not a meteor breaking up, I phoned the coast guard, local air traffic control tower, and the local paper, but no one else had reported a similar sighting.  I have never seen anything like this before, and would like to know if anyone else on the West coast witnessed this.

At first I thought it was a tower light or perhaps an airplane, but there were no lights where other tower lights would be.  The light did not move in the sky, but stayed in its position as would a star.  However, no other stars were visible as the sky was cloud-covered.

The three lights were at each corner, and it made absolutely NO sound.  It was going South East at about 35-55 km/m.  Very slow, (not fast enough for an aiplane with wings to fly properly).  It seemed to defiy the laws of Physics AND gravity. Completely soundless, it just seemed to travel nice and calmly away from me until I couldn&apos;t see it anymore.  It had to be some kind of aircraft whether it be alien or American.  I was amazed. I could only hope that someone else saw this thing or anything similar.", "Event was a meteor shower.  5 meteors spotted in one hour plus 6 regular shooting stars.My occupation is a secretary.  I was surprised to see the below-described meteor shower (of Dec. 13, 1998) because it was not announced on the news but was more visable for me than the highly-talked about Nov. 16 meteor shower.  In fact, I never saw ANY meteors during the November meteor shower, but I saw 5 on December 13.  It all began at 1:55 am when I woke up from sleep and was laying there looking out the window.  I saw a bright, very large &quot;shooting star,&quot;  it was about 5 or 6 times larger than a shooting star and way brighter than the brightest star in the sky.  The color was different than the rest of the stars too.  It was the same color as the moon when it is full and bright.  A few seconds later I saw a &quot;typical&quot; shooting go by just east of the path of the meteor.  A few minutes later I saw a second meteor shooting through the sky and another shooting star a few minutes later.  At this time I phoned the UFO Reporting Center because I thought it was unusual to see 2 meteors and 2 shooting stars in such a short time.  Then I went back to sleep and woke up again at 3:00 am.  I no sooner looked out the window and I saw yet another meteor go shooting by in the sky.  This really got my interest, so I decided to sit up and count how many I saw.  I grabbed a tablet and made a column for &quot;shooting stars&quot; and one for &quot;meteors.&quot;  Within an hour (3 am to 4 am) I saw 3 more meteors and 4 more shooting stars for a total of 5 meteors and 6 shooting stars.  I just think it is curious that the public was never told about THIS meteor shower and it was much more spectacular than the one in November that all the news stations covered.  The stars and meteors were all traveling from north/east to south/west.((NUFORC NOTE:  Sightings correspond to Geminid Meteor Shower.))", "A large phlorescent green oval shaped object moving at a strange speed desending on the horizon ended in a large flashA large bright floresent green ( oval in shape )object suddenly appeared in a totally clear sky at 22:38 on 1/8/98.

It did not appear to be traveling fast enough to be a comet or a meteor. Nor was there any trail following it.", "A formation of a constant group of 1 dozen metallic/lights near DIANoticed unusually heavy bird activity in and around back yard and was bird watching with binoculars from hot tub. Looking at a distant group of dots that was thought to be a flock of birds revealed a dozen metallic objects darting around in the sky and occasionally creating formations. Girlfriend who also witnessed this thought they had lights but I believed they were metallic reflecting the afternoon sun. Other similar objects would dart in and out of group and come and go in a matter of a micro second. Some of these objects also seemed to trail some planes taking off from DIA. Objects disappeared after 5 - 10 minutes and shortly afterwards 3 military planes flew over.", "Huge disk with hour glass directly above (center) silver type ball, moving eractly, but in some sort of sync with each pattern different colored lights would react accordingly,and above the ball a gigantic looking skyscraper.

Did anyone else see it?", "Pulsing light over the Gulf of Mexico changing color, frequency, and intensity moved in an erratic pattern across the clear sky.  The motion stopped for a few moments as the object hovered and glowed dimly pink and then accelerted at an astonishing rate.I stood on the beach with my wife watching the stars and occasional planes and helicopters move across the sky over the western Florida coastline and the Gulf of Mexico.  I saw a distant object, approximately 40-50 miles away pulsing from bright white to red to blue randomly and exclusively.  I pointed the object out to my wife, who then pointed it out to another couple walking on the beach.  From my perspective, the object first appeared due west of my location and was moving toward the coast south of me.  Over the next few minutes the object&apos;s flight path looked like the pattern of angles that can be found on the side of a car key.  The object occasionally doubled back and retraced its steps.  When the object was directly south of me (possibly just west of Ft.Myers over the Gulf) it hovered in place for a few moments at what looked like about 20,000 feet, held a red color that slowly faded to a dim pink, and then accelerated faster than anything I&apos;ve ever seen.  It took the object approximately 350 milliseconds to move from its hovering perch about 15 degrees above the southern sky through a path directly over my head toward the north until it faded away.  From my perspective, the acceleration path was a straight line that went between Orion and the Seven Sisters, fading in the vicinity of Polaris.  I witnessed a similar event the next night at midnight.  The only other time in my life I saw anything remotely similar to this was in late April, 1996 in Eureka Springs, Arkansas.  The 1996 event was also witnessed by a truck driver traveling I-70 between St. Louis and Kansas City.  Perhaps at some point I&apos;ll take the time to write a summary of this one as well.  These are the only unexplainable aerospace events I have ever witnessed.", "Object seen hovering nearby. Very bright lights through ports.It was a nice fall evening, My two youngest children were in the house with me, my teen age son was in the garage working out. He came into the house and told us to come outsede, there was an object in the sky and the animals were making awful sounds. We hurried out and saw the object, hovering quite close to the ground and I realized that I didn&apos;t hear a s ound. It had very bright lights shining through the  ports. I was aware that none of my dogs were at all concerned and were quite. I went in and tried to call my husband who was at a Kiwanis meeting but didn&apos;t get him. I went back out and it was still there, Next I went in and called the local troopers and told them to look in our direction and they might see it. I returned outside and it was still there. Next thing I knew, my son had gone into the house and was returning with a gun, as he was frightened. AT that point the object came toward us and rose quickly into the sky and just disappeared. As it left, it appeared to be triangular in shape. I actually made another call, to a friend after I called the troopers. Itold her the horses were making noices. Later she asked me why I said horses, because we had only one, and I told her it was because all three of the children were hearing noice from the nearby hill, which I did not hear. This object was large and I would estimate about the size of a football field. I was not frighened, just excited.", "While camping on top of a moutain me and 2 friends saw a star start to come at us.

Bright light, followed by blue/red lights.I noticed the object to my left, I was driving south on US 101 and the object was on the Eastern horizon, but appeared very close.  It lasted only about 30 seconds.  It was strange because it was flying very low to the horizon, just above the ground fog.  I thought of a missile launch from Vandenberg AFB, but the object was travelling SSE and most launches from VAFB travel WSW toward the Marshall Islands.  I mentioned this when I got to work, but no one else appeared to have seen it until someone spoke up during our staff meeting.  He was traveling East on Hwy 46 and the object appeared toward the south, out his right window, also travelling in a SSE direction.  He checked the time at 06:43.", "Witnessed cigar shaped objects with tails streaming behind them. Some were going up, others going down, some criss-crossed each other, others were simply horizontal. In front of the streams were golden, very bright, metallic cigar shaped objects.It was about 6 pm and my mother and I were driving on Route 422 in Niles, OH, to go to the Eastwood Mall. I looked up and noticed these streams in the sky. They resembled the streams that jets produce in the sky as they fly. That&apos;s what I thought it was at first. However, there were so many of them...about 8-10, and planes would not fly that close together. Some of the streams were going up..some down...others were cris-crossing...some were horizontal. I also thought that maybe they were meteors, because they had tails that looked like comets. When we got to the parking lot, we got out and were able to stand in the parking lot and get a good look. That&apos;s when I noticed that in front of the streams were cigar shaped, golden metallic objects. They were so bright. There were no wings, so these were NOT airplanes. They were all in the same area of the sky, except for one of them. I noticed that one when I turned around to go into the store. It was behind us, quite a distance from the other objects. This was the lowest one in the sky, and I was able to see the cigar shaped object much more clearly on this one. There were other people driving through the parking lot who were also staring over in that direction and pointing, so we were not the only ones that noticed these objects. Now, I have a law degree, so I like to consider myself to be a very rational person. But I&apos;ve never seen anything like this before in my life. I think I should point out to you that I live in Trumbull County, Oh...the same place where police officers chased objects in the sky a few years back. This story was chronicled on the NBC special &quot;Confirmation&quot; a couple of weeks ago. We do live near the Vienna Air Base, so that may be relevant. Also, back in November, my mother and I also saw some strange lights in the sky, and my uncle, who was about 10 miles away at the same time, reported seeing objects on the same night as well. There were three of them. They didn&apos;t move at all. They were lights, but you could tell they weren&apos;t stars. They were too big.  They never moved. While looking at them, all of a sudden, they just disappeared out of the sky. Thank you.", "Myself and my friend observed a cigar-shaped craft hovering in a field. We observed the phenomnon for twenty minutes the left the field.This encountered occurred about thirty years ago.  However it left an impact on the both of us to be not forgotton.  I and my friend were playing in a Large field in Rosemead Ca.  It was a place we went frequently to play and as we were riding our bikes to &quot;our fort&quot; we had built in the field. The time was in the morning around 0700.  As we were riding our bikes we both noticed something &quot;hovering&quot; in the field before us.  The distance I can approximate to about 500 yards away from us at a 15 degree angle from horizon.  The size of the object was approximate three inches (as I would see it from my view).  The object was cigar in shape with red lights around the length of the Object.  It appeared to rotate on the longer axis, slowly. Both my friend and my self looked at each other to confirm what we were looking at.  We both agreed to what we saw was the same.  We continued to watch the object for the next 15 minutes(5 minutes or so had transpired).  We noticed that the object made no noise that we could hear (at that distance).  It continue to rotate and hovered there.  We then both looked at each other and again reaffirmed what we saw and be came shakened, left in a hurried mannner to our perspective homes.  My mother noticed I was visable shakened and scared.  I told her what had happened to us.  She preceded to call my friend&apos;s mom to confirmed my story.  My friend&apos;s mother told her that he (my friend) had reported the same to her. Both parents dismissed the occurance. Since then, I have spoken to my friend after the occurance (twenty years later) He still affirms the events of that fateful day.  To this day It has bothered me and will always remember.  By coincidence,  Years later,  Southern California Edison has built there corporate office over the very site.

About height of low flying plane, but massive in size -slowmoving, very steady and absolutely no sound--moving from northwest to southeast. Not usual flight plan for local military or non military bases.Had gone outside just before 2am in hopes of seeing remnants of the Leonid meteor event of the 16th and 17th--and unable to see any. In searching the sky my first thot was seeing a flock of geese as moving objects in a V formation began to be visible... the &apos;objects were at fist visible as tho separate-but lighted --- obviously not geese, but in that type of formation.  As it approached slowly, keeping its shape I realized it was a craft of massive triangular size; the V-shaped forward moving sides were lighted--steady,spaced, white lights--almost like lightbulbs.The back side of the triangle was unlit--and the craft itself had an almost opaque shadow quality of color--even at night, that was more discernible as it passed beneath some brighter stars and away from the street lights.  It appeard to be flying at about the height of a low flying plane, but much more massive in size than a plane would be of the same height. It moved somewhat slowly, very steady and with absolutely no sound. Moving from northwesterly to a southeasterly direction.  This is not the usual flight path usually observed in this area for local military or non military bases.  An airplane traveling at a similar height observed three days later, at the normal size visible at that height, appeared much smaller and made tremendous sound.   It&apos;s an image that stays vividly in mind. I grew up in the air force, and lived on base much of that time -- and observed a lot of planes coming and going, and I am aware it could very well be a military craft, possibly not well publicised--but its size, lack of any sound and the pace at which it was moving were out of the norm usually visible in this area.  Is there currently a stealth-type craft that would fit this description?  And how would I find out if there actually was one in this area on that morning?", "1 craft, slow moving, less then 70 mph, appx 300 feet off of groundWhile traveling north on US 93 about twenty miles north of Ely, Nevada about 1900 HRS I saw two bright lights coming south following the roadway.  I pulled over and it was extremely dark.  The craft appeared to be either chevron or triangular shaped.  One vehicle passed me going south bound and from this i estimated the speed of the craft.  As I was parked there the craft turned away ( towards the east slightly )  I must note that the exact shape is not known.  It appeared to have a bright light at each wing tip, one in the middle, a red blinking one behind it, which was not noticeable until it passed by and about six square window  like lights on the bottom surface of the wings.  It made an jet like noise but at a much lower decible level and the noise did trail the actual craft.  Shortly after I noticed the two light pattern moving northward at a very high speed, turn towards the west, then south then east over me at a much higher altitude and continue east.  It might just be an airplane, posibly a shape simalar to the B-2, the the extrememly slow speed is the main reason I am reporting in hopes to some insight as to what it was.", "sitting on ground in urban area.  layed back to look up at orion area of sky, towards the east.

Bob! Get out here right now, you have to see this!&quot;  I lagged in answering about five seconds and he repeated with great urgency.  I ran out just in time to see half the event remaining.  It was a very bright object passing through the outer atmosphere, at very high speed, going perhaps southeast to west.  Whatever it was had two sets of streamers coming off it, one was a series of superheated lines of atmosphere or perhaps particles, which streamers looked very much in configuration like the lines coming off a plastic badminton birdie.  The second was a SHOCK WAVE perhaps fifty miles in FRONT of the object, of super compressed air which also was forming streamers, but of a much larger diameter, like pushing a large flat serving bowl.  The intensity of the object did not diminish, and it passed right on through the atmosphere and out again, into space.

They were in the southern hemisphere, about 30 degrees from horizontal.  They were very far away.  They looked similar to 2 airplanes flying directly towards me.  I could not see any distinguishing features. The sky was clear, but since I couldn&apos;t see as many stars as usual, there may have been a thin layer of clouds. The clouds were thick enough to block out all but the brightest stars.  Very few stars were visible. The 3 stars on Orion&apos;s belt were visible but dim.  I was able to watch the 2 objects on my way home from work. I drive south on the Hutchinson River Parkway in Westchester.  They were in my field of view the entire time. I stopped at a golf driving range on weaver street because I had a clear view from there.  I saw several very small and faint objects moving in the general vicinity.  These objects had blinking lights.  They also seemed to be moving faster than they should have been for the distance they were from me.  When I arrived home, the 2 lights were still in the same exact relationship to each other and appeared to not move in the 30 min it took for me to get home. Once home, I observed their position for about 10 more minutes.  I could not detect any movement.  I left the room for about 30 minutes and when I went to check up on the 2 lights, they were gone.  I looked around the sky there was nothing that even slightly resembled their intensity or proximity with respect to each other. I showed my wife the 2 lights and some co-workers had also seen them. Since it looked like from my vantage point that they were over Manhattan, someone suggested it was 2 blimps. But their distance between each other never changed for the hour I observed it.

First, He noticed the &quot;black&quot; Huey w/ no markings on it very low to the ground a little ways off the highway. Then, on the Highway Just behind it, was a convoy of two(2) Humvees w/soldiers(?) in all black uniforms w/m-16&apos;s traveling just ahead of a tractor trailer flatbed. On this flatbed was an object covered by a tarp, which was flapping in the wind.

Faster than any jet. I would stop, move, disappear, and reappear. This went on for 15 minutes. I turned off the hwy. to my sister&apos;s house. While parking, a hoovering sound startled me. A triangular craft moved slowly over my car. It was gray/silver with three large white circles in a triangular pattern on the underside. The circles looked like lights that were not on. The lights took up most of the underside. It was sleek and aerodynamic looking. It dissappeared and the only sign of what direction it took were the bent trees 100 yards away. Two children playing next door upstairs saw the craft also. As it left the house trembled. We live near Warner Robins AFB.

This happened in broad daylight.  I thought I was familiar with most aircraft types since I have always been interested in flight and I spent 3 years in a Navy fighter squadron.  This &quot;vehicle&quot; matched nothing a had seen to date.  I thought at first it was a stealth fighter not having seen one at this time.  However, this craft was dull silver metallic in color and was shaped similar to a heart with all rounded contours. It had a small rounded nose like a pencil eraser that extended out from where the point of the heart would be.  It appeared to be made of one piece of &quot;metal&quot;, no windows, no vertical stabilizers, no apparent openings or exhaust ports of any kind.  It flew from north to south at approximately 1000&apos; elevation and was about 1/4 mile away from us.  My wife and I both saw it as the same shape and size.  I would say that it was about the size of a small airplane perhaps with a 30&apos; wing span.  It left no vapor trail and I could hear no sound, although I was driving in my vehicle at the time.  After about 2 seconds the trees hid my view of the craft and by the time I was clear again it was gone.  To this day I have never seen or heard of any craft including the now famous &quot;stealth&quot; jets that resemble what I and my wife saw that day.", "We saw a round object hover about 200 feet above the cooling towers of the Sequoia Nuclear facility.

The object hovered in this spot for about 5 minutes.

The topic was local politics, when a man called in &amp; said &quot;Hey, there&apos;s a UFO out here! It&apos;s hovering over the water, there&apos;s all these lights..&quot; The show host cut him off saying &quot;does it say &apos;friends of Art Bell on it?&apos;&quot;  The man says &quot;Huh?

I left for work at this time, leaving Peters Creek heading southbound on Glenn Highway towards Anchorage.  As soon as I hit the highway my attention was drawn toward a very bright light, about the size of Venus (Venus was clearly visible to my left).  It was still for about 1 min then began to move slowly to the right (west).  At the same time I noticed 3 &quot;red flashes&quot; moving towards the UFO.  The red flashes were in a V shape the point closest to the UFO. The flashes came from the left (east), from Anchorage, while the UFO moved towards Elmendorf AFB.  The UFO accelerated swiftly, faster than the average aircraft, but not fast enough to leave tracers.  I easily left the flashes behind, then blinked out.  The flashes, now seemingly directly over the AFB, appeared to hover.  I got the impression the flashes were some kind of helicopters.  All this occured during a period of about 3 min.  I had been watching this while driving in the snow at 60 mph, almost going in the ditch several times.  After the UFO blinked out I intended to hurry to the next overpass &amp; stop, to watch in safety.  Glancing to my left (east) to merge, I saw the/another UFO, very near to Venus.  Looking forward again I saw the red flashes heading towards it.  At this point I decided to just pull over, &amp; noticed another car on the shoulder w/a man leaning out the open window watching the UFO.  By the time I had pulled over the UFO was gone, I didn&apos;t see what happened to it.  The man smiled at me &amp; shrugged, &amp; drove off.  I proce! eded to work.

It was a clear night; this object blocked out the stars where we were in the country around New Albany, Indiana by Highway 111. The lights were not bright and the object moved slowly without sound. The only movement we noted was the sway of the trees a thousand feet above us on the bluff. This object travelled west across the Ohio River and proceeded towards Ft. Knox, KY. I myself observed the object for one and one half hours, even using my binoculars. Note my father was a loadmaster in the airforce at the local base at that time, and commented to me, &quot;Oh, they&apos;ve had that thing for years and years.&quot;this craft has been seen by many other people as well but i do not know what happen to them . i have seen many ufos high in the sky eraly day light hours as well as nite time.

These happened in the mid to late 1980&rsquo;s in Lost Park near Jefferson Colorado. We camped in the area for quite a few years on a regular basis. We moved our campsite to the Lost Park area from the Tarryall reservoir area. Lost park is about 10 miles or so from the reservoir. We found a road that went up and around to the top of a small hill and were camping there for 5 or 6 weekends in a row. The first time we saw them a friend of mine was looking at what we thought was a campfire on a ridge about 1&#x5C;2 of a mile away with my telescope. The telescope was a 900 power at maximum magnification. As soon as he got the scope focused in on the campfire he said the fire went out! Then about a minute later the sphere that we thought was the fire went up in the sky! As we watched it in awe it went up and joined two other lights. The next several weekends as soon as it got dark there were three UFO&rsquo;S in the same general place in the sky. They would move slowly around in the same area sometimes close to each other sometimes further apart. At times one of them would be down low enough to be below us from our vantage point. Their behavior was always the same every time we saw them (i.e.: slow and deliberate and random). They were bright red spheres and always three of them. This occurred for 5 or 6 weekends both Friday and Saturday nights, enough that we got tired of watching them. They were about 1/4 to 1/2 mile away (approx). We were crossing a forest service sign to go up to the hilltop. It was the kind they put right in the middle of the road and it was plastic so you could just drive over it and it would spring back up when it came out from under your vehicle. The last time we went there the forest service had put a permanent sign up that you couldn&rsquo;t just drive over. So we moved our camp to where we thought we would be right under the objects but we never saw them again. I have camped in the area for years and never seen the three UFO&rsquo;S again. These trips were usually at least 4 people sometimes more. Depending on who went as we went in a group of close friends. These reports are all old because we didn&rsquo;t know who to report them to and we didn&rsquo;t think the police or forest service would do anything about it or even believe us.

I went out for a closer look and saw &apos;something&apos;, and it appeared to be above the clouds moving around.  I only saw it for a slight moment before I left for my sisterPlease be aware this could have been a misidentification.  I have a few possiblities as to what I saw. 1. It could have been a effect of a searchlight maybe above the clouds or below (I didn&apos;t see any visible &apos;beam&apos; (like a search light) going to the illumination in the clouds). 2. Maybe a helicopter above the clouds (account for the searchlight). I really don&apos;t know what it was.  Im not rock-solid on the time.  I know it was near 11pm.. but still 10pm.  The skies were overcast.  I could see maybe 4 stars to my southeast.  I was about to go in the house (from a short walk.. few days ago my step-mother mentioned a bright light outside, though this might not have anything to do with this whatsoever) when I saw a helicopter to my west.  I ran out near the bank and I noticed it had its searchlight on.  It looked like it was looking for something on the ground.  I looked up and noticed that there was a &apos;circular&apos; form of light either above or below the clouds (I thought it was above).  It was moving smoothly with no jagged movement, but fast.  I noticed that as I sat there, just after I looked, it nearly stopped to a halt.  I couldn&apos;t believe what I was seeing so I ran for the house to get my sister.  When we got outside the &apos;circular light&apos; was too far to our east.  We could still see &apos;flashes&apos; and the helicopter.  We both noticed about 4 flashes.  They were very fast, and very bright.  Kind of like lightning, but faster.  I thought, at the time, the flashing was coming from our east, where the helicopter and &apos;light&apos; were.  I thought I saw this &apos;light&apos; above the clouds a few times, but by this time they were miles away.  I really wish I had stayed outside and not ran to the house, I could have deffinately in my mind determined what it was... I wasn&apos;t given enough time.  The light above/below the clouds was about the size of holding an orange at arms length... and I remember it moving, but not the exact movements.  I don&apos;t know exactly how fast it moved because my &apos;sighting&apos; wasn&apos;t given enough time.  Me and my sister drove up onto Wickiup to see if it would return, but till&apos; 2:02 am we saw nothing.  It seems like the object was heading east, near the Columbia river, atleast relevant to my area.  I must also note that during the duration that the helicoter was visible we were talking about it, so we didn&apos;t keep constant eye contact with the area where th! e &apos;light&apos; or the helicopter were.  As I said, a few times I thought I saw the object moving around in the clouds ahead of the helicopter.  And once I thought I saw a &apos;beam&apos;, but I was unsure (in the vicinity of the helicopter).  I want to know if anyone else saw it so that I can understand it better.  I would also like an explanation for the flashes that my and my sister saw.", "Dark triangular shape against the darking sky. The object had great speed and no sound or light was evident.Over the past few days 1-25-99 until yesterday 1-31-99 I&apos;ve seen some interesting things in the sky over north Scottsdale in AZ. I wont speculate on what I saw but I will provide this brief explanation. The rear balcony of my 2nd story apartment faces east - north/east overlooking Stone Creek Golf coarse so I&apos;ve a very clear view with little or no obstruction. The other day I was relaxing on my balcony just enjoying the sky as I am an amateur astronomer. Then I saw a streak in the sky low on the horizon about 10 degrees. This streak was black against the darkening sky, and triangular in shape. The time was around 6:30 pm and the sky was turning a deep low saturation purple as is does here in the desert. The shape almost reminded me of an orderly flock of birds but it was clearly not birds as the speed was way to great and there was no variation in its shape, it was solid. The object covered at least 45 degrees horizontally in about 2 seconds. I estimate the object to be approximatly 2 to 4 miles distant making it quite large about the size of an f-15 or larger. At first I thought this is what I must have seen but there were no lights and no reflected light the only way I saw the object was due to the fact that it obscured the darkening sky. The sky was dark but the object was much darker. There was no sound and what seemed to be a dark streak or trail behind the object. I noticed that I could more clearly see the object by not looking directly at it. As all astronomers know when looking at very faint objects it is best to not look directly at the object due to the make up of the human eye, rods and cones. I&apos;ve a very clear understanding of aircraft, speed, size and action. Just to the north east of me is the Scottsdale Airpark, an airport that can handle many types of jets up to small passenger jets. It is a very busy airport and at any time you can see 4 to 6 jets on approach from the north. I know how fast a leer jet looks as it takes off and lands and this object was approximately 5 times that. Well after this first sighting a couple days ago I didn&apos;t give it much more thought, I don&apos;t need to dwell on such things as I&apos;ve seen many unexplained things in the sky. Well yesterday I saw  2 more such objects in the same place at the same time with 2 friends who also saw something. This time I saw the object for a good 90 degrees horizontally it was not quite as dark so I could see it more clearly. This occurred just after the full moon had cleared the mountains in the distance. Again there was no sound and the shape was triangular. I saw one and then within a few seconds another one. I could clearly point at it and follow it across the sky telling my friends as it crossed various reference points such as houses and the moon. I&apos;ll be watching the desert skies at dusk in that area everyday now with my camcorder in hand.", "it was a revolving light. It would change from red to green to whitea revolving light came down from the sky and stopped over the trees.It moved to the left and stopped.It set there for approx 20 minutes and got real dim and then a clear light came out of it and made a half circle into the woods from where i stood you could see it move into the trees for approx an hour and the clear light came back out of the trees at a half circle and made contact with the revolving light. Then the revolv light got real bright again and then it started moving across the sky. It did not move in a straight line though.My wife saw it the next night. It was still in the same place the next day as it was when it faded away on me. It was just kinda hanging there. It was the wildest thing I have ever seen in my life.You hear about it but you never expect to see something like that.It then went away and we have not seen it since. It acted as if it was getting charged up from the power lines in the woods where I live.", "Glowing Green UFO seen by myself (mom) and my 4 children very low over our car on a Friday night in Alabama in 1973.I was listening to Mr. Davenport on Jeff Rense&apos;s show tonight, (3/19/99) and heard him say that he does want &quot;old&quot; UFO sighting reports to add to the data banks.  I thought of calling in to the show, but decided to write it down instead.  I thank you for this opportunity to tell what my children and I saw over 25 years ago. On October 12, 1973, our family consisting of me, my husband, our sons aged 14, 13 and 9 and our daughter aged 7, were nearing the end of our 4 year residence in Birmingham, Alabama.  We were packing for a move to Scottsdale, Arizona, and on that day my husband was away on a trip to Arizona to set up details of the move.  It was Homecoming for my oldest son&apos;s highschool and he and his next younger brother wanted to go to the football game.  Just after 7:00 pm I loaded all four kids into the LTD station wagon for the 2 mile drive to the stadium.  My daughter was in the front seat with me and the 3 boys were in the back. Our street was a long one-block cul de sac on the side of a hill.  When leaving the street you have to climb up a steep incline, south, to the main cross-street at the top.  The 2 streets form a &quot;T.&quot;  Across the intersection from our street was a heavily wooded area with no visible houses or lights. Our duplex was about halfway down the block on the east side of the street. Shortly after I pulled out of our driveway and headed up the hill, a huge, green-glowing hamburger lifted out of the trees across the intersection and slowly moved toward our car.  Because of its low altitude and the steepness of the hill, the sight seemed to fill up our whole windshield.  I called it a &quot;hamburger&quot; because that best describes the shape of the craft as I remember it.  It appeared to be a solid dark metal ship with a row of lights and/or windows around the middle. The whole UFO was surrounded by a luminescent green mist.  As it moved, some of the mist was left behind. As you can imagine, we were stunned and terrified.  Thankfully, I did not lose electrical or engine power in the car.  I turned left into the closest driveway, whipped that station wagon around as fast as I could, and headed for home, all the while screaming to the kids, &quot;Is it following us?!?&quot;  They were as hysterical as I was.  This thing was monstrously close. Within seconds I had pulled into our driveway and all of us got out of the car to look at the UFO.  It had risen a bit higher in the sky and changed direction from its original northerly path.  It was now slowly drifting to the southeast, leaving green mist in the sky as it went. There was NO sound. I ran to the duplex to the south of our building and pounded on the back door.  When the young woman tenant came to the door I excitedly told her to come out and see what we were witnessing.  Of course, by the time she came outside there was nothing left to see but the green mist.  My kids had been keeping it in sight and told me that it just suddenly disappeared. The mist stayed suspended in the sky for several minutes before dissipating. I do not know if there was anything of substance that might have fallen to the ground for collection.  I certainly saw nothing the next day in the daylight. I herded my children into our house and attempted to calm them (and myself) down.  I gave them all paper and pencils and instructed them to draw what they had seen.  (Those drawings were long ago destroyed, but I do remember that they were all remarkably similar.) I got out the phone book to try to find somebody to tell what we had seen.  Nobody. In 1973 I knew nothing about MUFON or any other UFO research entities. So, I called the nearest municipal police department in Vestavia Hills, Alabama.  (We did not live within the city limits of Birmingham.)  The polite, but obviously amused officer who answered the phone told me that he had had no other reports of odd things in the sky, and that what we had probably seen was &quot;an atmospheric gas bomb set off at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida.&quot;  I did not buy that explanation then, and I don&apos;t buy it now.  I cannot imagine that such a thing would have obvious solidity and lights or windows. Within a couple of weeks we left Alabama.  Because I was so busy with the details of our move I did not have time to do any investigation of the wooded area out of which that thing rose. I was nearly 7 years old at the time of the Roswell crash and remember my mother telling me about it at the time.  My interest in UFOs began then, but there was always a bit of doubt in my mind.  That doubt was erased on the night of October 12, 1973.  I remember that the first thought that popped in my head when I saw it was, &quot;They really DO exist!&quot; Our children each reacted differently to the adventure.  My youngest son was so traumatized he will not talk about it to this day.  The other boys and our daughter don&apos;t mind UFO conversations at all.  My oldest son has been known to tell about the experience at the drop of a hat.  Our daughter was affected the most by the incident.  She had encounters with UFOs and/or ETs after that time, and may still be experiencing strange incidents to this day.  She has some conscious memories that are very disturbing. We had no &quot;lost time&quot; that night.  After we had calmed down a bit, I actually put everybody back in the car and took the boys to the game.  I don&apos;t know how I did it.  I told them to ask people in the stands if they had seen anything, but of course they didn&apos;t do it. sure they didn&apos;t do it.", "I saw a triangular aircraft moving slowly and noislessly East to West.On the evening of 3 JUL 97, I was taking out the trash. I walked basically south from the back of my home and placed the trash in the herbie. When I turned around, facing north, I could see a traingular shaped craft moving slowly east to west. I was able to tell its shape by the way it blacked out the starfield in the sky. It had a row of soft green dashes down the forward two edges, three on each edge. It appeared to pass in front of the house, but I was unable to get a sense of depth, so I could&apos;nt tell if it was a large craft far away or a small one close. There is an airport about five miles from where I live, so we&apos;re used to aircraft noise. There was no noise that I could hear, not even that soft blowing sound of a high flying jet. It moved slowly westward until it disappeared behind the treeline. Th whole thing lasted less than two minutes. I attended the Thunder over Louisville air/fireworks show the next day. They had the 117-A Stealth Aircraft on display and the B1-B Stealth Bomber made a pass over the crowd at the event. Perhaps what I saw was the craft flying in for the show.", "My family and I were flying from St. Peters FL to Winnipeg MB. We had been in the air for about 1.5hrs. I looked out my window on the right side of the plane when i saw what looked like a smaller plane with no paint on it about 1000 feet below us. I watched and looked close at it and saw that it looked more like a diamond shape. it was moving away from the plane then slowed down and it shot in the other direction to fast for it to bee a plane and i lost track of it right away.There was only 1 object that I saw. It was a diamond shape and silver. There were large clouds around it but none of them blocked my view any time during the sighting. I never told anyone on the plane that there was something out there to avoid embaressement. I&apos;m uniware of anyone else witnessing the object besides me.

It flashed like a strobe light at about 4 second intervals.We were prospecting and camped at the base of a canyon (Painter spring). We has eaten dinner and had gone into the tent. We began to hear a low rumbling sound off towards the desert floor. It continued and became louder. It sounded like a 2 1/2 ton truck approaching. Since the only way to our campsite was the road from the desert which no large truck could take, we went outside to see who was approaching. We looked west towards the desert and then there was a bright flash in the sky - almost like a flashbulb. It lit about 1/3 of the sky. After about four seconds, it flashed again. It continued this strobe light effect all of the time that we observed it. It was a dark night with stars. We never did see an outline of the thing (I guess that our eyes never got a chance to adjust). It moved from the west deseret, overhead, and on up the east canyon and over the ridge. The whole event lasted for about 1 minute. It moved very slowly and rumbled. After it had gone over the ridge, we looked back towards the desert. We saw two sets of lights coming towards us, following the path of the other object. They were moving about as fast as private airplanes move. They didn&apos;t make any sound. There was a red light in front and a green light in back (in a straight line). We figured that the lights were on the nose and tail of the crafts. They were flying in staggered formation (about 8 seconds offset). The two sets of lights passed overhead, up the canyon, and disappeared over the eastern ridge. We could never see the shape of these things (not even when they passed overhead). We could only see the lights. One of these things came back over the ridge, made a large sweep over the upper canyon, and returned over the ridge. We looked around for about a minute. We then saw two sets of lights coming from the desert towards us. They were moving fast. As they got over us, we could hear the sound of jet engines back on the desert floor. Their outline was clear. They were two military jets flying in offset formation (one was about 3 seconds behing the other). They went overhead, up the canyon, and over the ridge just like the other craft. About a minute later, we saw a small light (looked just like a star) up in the sky to our southeast. It was moving in straight lines i.e. it would go one way, and then change direction left, right, up, down, in straight lines. It kept in an area of the sky that covered about an inch at arms length. We saw one of the red and green light things come over the ridge and move quickly towards the moving light. When it got almost to the light, the light simply went out. This thing made a circle over the area and then went back over the ridge. That&apos;s it - never saw anything else.", "My wife and I arrived home late one evening and got out of the car andlooked up in the sky and saw a bunch of bright lights.

That&apos;s all I recall.  I saw no movement in the object.  I saw it in the sky, looked at it, and got VERY frightened and ran inside.  It was immense in size, because it was high enough to be partially obscured by cumulonimbus clouds that were present, but those clouds offered excellent reference as to the object&apos;s size.

( it was white, no plates, 1 black window on the side) it was approx 1000 feet ahead. as we approached it started to drive off( making no noise even though the path was covered w/ leaves) we rounded a corner and lost view of it for approx 10 seconds when we came around the corner it was gone. the path about 10&apos; wide at the location of the van but either end of the path was WAY TO NARROW for the van to exit the woods.  and the ground was muddy where the van was driving off to but there were no tracks. i was never a ufo believer ultil these 2 days. i am a scientist by heart and practice.

Next I saw the jets they seemed to be coming from the same direction actually my direction and  the one on the left was a little more to the left of me like they were split off and were merging on the same point (the objects).This is when I pulled over and started watching them, I could tell that, well at least from my vantage point they seemed to be a lower altitude and were going up. The objects were yellow orange color ,I don&apos;t think this was there true color , because from where I was at they they were high enough that since the sun had just set, that they were still high enough that the sun was still hitting them. I couldn&apos;t really tell , but I don&apos;t think the jets were reflecting any light. I still wasn&apos;t sure if the jets were going after the objects or just moretypical passenger craft until, the object on the right jumped rather quickly higher and way to the left and it was not possible by any jet I&apos;ve ever heard of because the jet on the right veered hard up and to the left and thats when I could finally tell the shape of the craft and 2 tight contrails, the jets were giving off contrails the objects weren&apos;t by the way, and being an aircraft buff, the only thing I could thing of from the contrails they were giving off was that they were fighters, maybe a Leer jet could. but when this ting veered it had to be doing some major G&apos;s so that pretty much ruled out a leer jet. So clearly they were chasing it and gaining ground , but then within about 30seconds time they seemed to take off not really upward(not sure) but, definately away from me and finally out of sight, and the jets continued on in pursuit and it took the about a couple of minutes to get out of sight. The objects were spherical but at the distance I couldn&apos;t be sure because of the glow they were giving off. I also know cause I&apos;m about 45 mile from the knoxville airport , and I can see planes all the time coming and going from there and know what passenger planes look like at that distance, and fighters look like and if I had to guess they of F-15 or F-18 shape, cause when the one veered off i could see more of the top of it.As far as the weather it was pretty clear, well there wasn&apos;t any clouds in the sky where this was happening, and the sky was a typical orangish color like after any sunset. I don&apos;t know how possible it is, but I kinda would like to know if anyone else saw it , cause no one I know saw it, and my daughter who was with me is only 5 and she just kept asking me what I was looking at. I hope you find this useful and hope it might help support someone else if they saw it also.

The lights were about 200 yard away. The lights got bright and started to change colors. Eventually the craft came over to our boat and followed us back to camp.It was April 2,1994. Daylight savings time.  A buddy and I from work decided to go for a fishing trip on the boat he just bought.  We picked Lake Sonoma , and you had to get to the campsites by boat.  We set up camp friday night just by dark, then decided to cast a few times off the shore and ;ended up staying up all night.  The next day we did alot of trolling around. caught and released a couple of small mouth bass.  Later we ate and went back out to the marina. (we are camping aprox. 4-5 miles north of the marina which was near the dam) It took about 20-25 mins at top speed-25 mph-.  We We saw this guy working on a houseboa and we all talked for a while.  Later we went to the boat ramp to catfish.  I was looking east from the boat ramp when I was A flash in the sky comming from just behind the mountains, then a second later two more quickley repeated flashs.  It seemed only slightly odd but I told my friend what I saw.  It was about 11:00 pm.  We ran out of worms.  My friend had alot more catfish bait back at camp.  It was a long ride back but we figured it was worth getting the bait since the fish were bitting.  We started heading back and noticed the fuel was almost empty, so we changed tanks.  We headed up, north from the dam.  All we had for light was my 5-cell mag light.  There were stumps protruding from the water so we sere going to have to be careful.  We rounded the corner up the north fork toward Cloverdale. The wind was so strong that water was coming over the front of the boat, we reduced our speed to 5 kph.  After we passed the public boat ramp, my friend noticed two lights up on the hill and said,&quot;Hey, look at the four wheeler up on the hill.  He&apos;s really moving throuhg the trees.&quot;  I said,&quot;Are you sure, how could he be going sideways like that.&quot;  All we could see were the lights. No object. It would sometimes come in front of the hillside and then be behind the treeline.  Then I shined my maglight up at it and it went behind the hillside.  It had followed at our pace for about 8 min.  W! e weren&apos;t sure what it have been and didn&apos;t really think much about it after it disappeared.  Then it came back and instead of dodging in and out of the trees it was above the ridged of the hill.  It was about 200 yards west.  This time instead of two bright lights it was two bright colored lights, each changing a different color randomly. The colors were beautiful almost hypnotic. It was as if each color had its own vibration. I could feel the light touching my body.  Then my flashlight went out.  It felt like some one put icey hot and electricity all over my arms.  Then we looked up and it started getting brighter.  It kept getting brighter and brighter.  Then a colorful rainbowy mist fanned out from underneth it.  It beacame a glowing ball of light.  So illuminesant that I thought the hill had caught on fire.  At that point we decided not to look at it any longer.  As if ignoring it, it would go away.  I still had to look at it every few minutes.  Then it finally left.  It had followed us longer that time about 15 minutes.  It still hadn&apos;t clicked in our heads what was going on.  I was afraid to talk about it, afraid if I did it would hear us and come back.  The after a few minutes my friend said he thought the lights looked like an angel.  I didn&apos;t think the lights looked like an angel but they were awesome. We talked about it for a couple of minutes then we stopped talking.  We wanted to concentrated on getting back to camp.  It was pitch black without my flashlight.  About 5 minutes later my friend tapped me on the back and said look at this.  I said no way I&apos;m not looking at anything anymore.  He said, you have to see what I&apos;m looking at.  I turned looked back up on my left facing southeast. I noticed an incredible looking craft slowly coming down the hillside, then after centering itself begind us it then closed in comming with in 100 ft.  At first sight my whole body just colapsed, I was paralized in disbelief.  It couldn&apos;t take my eyes off it.  Then I could just say, &quot;Oh my fucking God&quot; Then the ! only thing that came out was air. My friend told me not to look at it,to turn around.  So I did.  We both started praying aloud, I followed my friends lead.  We could still tell it was there by the reflection of it off the water.  The ship was blackend like tarnished silver and shaped like a jelly doughnut.  There was a dark band around it horizontally.  There were lights inside the band, rectangles with rounded corners.  We couldn&apos;t tell if the light was coming through a window or not but the light was pouring out like lumminescent fog.  We could see about seven lights around it.  It was about 30 ft. tall and about 200 feet wide?  The ship so close to the surface of the lake that we couldn&apos;t see under it.  After about 10 mins we saw the fork that lead to our campsite.  We started to head that way when we realized it was a dead end.  My friend turned without having to face the craft and we made it around the next corner when we saw two campfires.  Then the ship was gone.  In the sky over head a hugh comet seemed to take off from our direction.  It started from one color and went through all the colors of the rainbow.  With each color picking up speed.  Then it was gone.  We went back to camp.  My friend immediatly fell alsleep.

I drove a few blocks and parked across from the mostly dark cemetary. The light grew brighter as I attempted to determine if it was a large jet coming in from the south. Then the light appeared to stop and grow brighter and a heat ripple was visible around the light. I watched closely for any side movement to indicate a plane was coming at me on a direct heading with a landing light on. I saw none. Then the object moved sideways or at a slight angle away from me as the light dimmed after 3 minutes. I could now see small red lights at the tips of a triangle and hear a slight air whooshing sound. No tail assembly was visible. I thought it might be a B-2 bomber but then for a second I could see it was complete triangle with the red lights at the tips and a large stubby silo shaped front ahead of the triangle. The bright white light was now clearly positioned on the bottom middle of the triangle and quite large. The craft then proceeded straight north at about 100 mph. and maybe 600 feet off the ground.  A few years ago I visited the control tower of the C.R. airport and was given a short lesson of a half hour in the radar room and know what the flight paths are.

I watched it for a few minutes wondering where the individual was who was flying the kite when it tipped over, and became a sliver of black, perpendicular to the ground.  It appeared to circle around the city but was very hard to follow because it was so thin.  I got to my car and tried to drive to where I had last seen it so I could get a view from underneath but I was never able to do so. When I first saw the object it was angling up into the sky.

I watched cross the horizon in about 30 secs from East to West in a straight line.  It was metallic and it had a trail that disappeared very quickly, but was visible constantly.  When I enlarge the photos that I took with my digital camera(bought 2 days prior was in my pocket) the tail looks very large, the ufo is so small you can barely see it. A couple days later I noticed weird wavy or ruffled clouds covered the entire sky.  I saw the clouds were like that two seperate times.  I look forward to clear days now.  I know an airplane when I see one, there is a nearby airport.", "Looked up lastnight, surprised to see (stars) when the weather had been rainy most of the day.  My attention was directed to sudden movement of a (star).  It zipped along, then stopped dead in the sky. Lights blinking.

They were circling around eachother very close and at a high rate of speed.I looked up in the sky at around 4:00pm, and towards the west, I observed 6 or 7 spherical objects moving north in a tight cluster. They looked very small, though it was hard to tell because I&apos;m not sure how far away they were. They were circling or&quot;dancing&quot; around eachother in a very tight formation, and at a very high rate of speed. It appeared to be some kind of figure 8 pattern they were making around eachother. Then, they just kind of disappeared, one at a time. It was a clear blue sky in broad daylight. That was the background. My girlfriend also witnessed the event. I called to her to come &amp; look, because at first I thought it was a smudge on my sunglasses, or my contact lense. Then I realized that smudges don&apos;t move and pulsate like that. We tried to think of anything we could that would identify what we saw, but, we knew it was something that could not be identified. Anything man has made would&apos;ve crashed doing what they were doing. I&apos;m surprised they DIDN&apos;T crash!", "Craft flew out of the east at about 600 feet moving west and then turning to the north (not a regular flight pattern for this area for any aircraft). Had thre bright white lights in the front (creating a triangle shape) and one in the back giving it the look of an elongated diamond. Had one bright red light in the very center of the underbelly of the craft.My daughter and I were driving home from church on Wednesday March 24, 1999 and @8:00. We say an odd looking craft come out of the east flying at about 600 feet. As we turned to gead west toward home, the craft was running parellel to us (but not following us or anything). It was moving at about 50-60 miles per hour. The craft has three bright, non-blinking white light on the front underside giving it a triangle appearance, but there was also a bright white light at the back of the craft giving it a kind of long square or elongated diamond appearance. My daughter said it appeared to be square shaped to her. The body of the craft was not visible, so we determined the shape by the placement of the lights. There was also a bright red, once again unblinking, in teh very center of the under- belly of the craft. We followed it in our car heading west, and then it turned sharply to the north and continued on that wasy. We trie to follow it in the car, but traffic was unusualy heavy for that time of night (even on the side streets) and we lost it after a few minutes.

It was heade North in the sky north of Phoenix, after the trail had ended I thought the object had burnned up in the atmosphere, but I kept looking in the area where the trail ended. Then a short distance where the trail had ended I seen a object going straight down. As it came closer to the outer perimeter of north phoenix I could see a object shaped like a socket, round with something on the bottom. There was also several compartments on the object that was gliding through the sky no sound or spinning, just moving straight south. Then it moved over the mountains and disapeared.", "((NUFORC Note:  The following description, though excellently well prepared and extremely detailed, we observe is not significantly different from MANY reports we receive, that ultimately are identified to be celestial bodies.  We may err in our preliminary assessment in this case, but the unusually long duration time (75 minutes) makes the case seem more like a &quot;twinkling star&quot; case, of which we receive MANY.  We apologize to the witness if our assessment is incorrect.))I first spotted two objects west of my position.  They were 1000 feet above ground level in the night sky.  One was greenish blue and another was reddish yellow.  I took 15 pictures of objects of which I do not yet know the quality.  I followed objects for 10 miles to see if they would appear closer to me.  They did and as I continued I spotted a third object which was much closer.  It had a circle of white lights with a red light circling the object and constant.  Lights were not blinking like a plain.I had just walked my girlfriend to her car. I came back up to my 3rd story apartment, got a glass of water and glanced out the window.  West of my building I noticed an object with greenish blue lights.  I thought at first it was just a satelite or plain.  But as I continued to look at it I noticed the object changing color within seconds -  going from blue to green to blue to white.  The lights appeared to have a circular sequence around the object and as they made one complete cycle around the object they would then change color.  I continued to monitor the object through two large branches on a tree outside my window which extends to the top of our apartment complex.  I used the branches as limits to see if the object would move above or below a branch.  It did as if it was bouncing around in the sky.  Then I noticed a flash of light north of the object I was observing.  A second object appeared.  This object appeared to be higher up and was reddish yellow in color.  I could see a haze around this object and it appeared to be farther away or just smaller.  I then was convinced that something strange was up. So, I grabbed a camera (disposable from a wedding I attended) and ran outside.  I wanted to see if the images would appear closer to me if I drove west.  As I went 1 mile west of my complex I pulled into a parking lot where a man was laying dirt.  I got out and asked him if he thought those two objects looked strange.  He was startled but admitted that the blue green object did seem rather strange.  So, I got back into the car and drove 40 MPH down a suburb street that connected several counties of St.Louis.  The road went directly west towards the objects.  The reddish object seemed to be leading me.  In fact it gradually moved directly in front of me and as I slowed down it almost seemed like it would slow down.  So then I would speed up and it would seem farther away.  I felt like it knew I was following it.  Meanwhile the greenish blue object remained on the left of the road and was still twice! as low to the ground as the reddish object.  After 10 miles on the same road heading west towards the objects there was no doubt in my mind that the objects were unidentifiable and moved very freely unlike a plain or a baloon of any kind I had ever seen.  I was running out of road after 10 miles and decided to pull over into a neighborhood street to take pictures of the object.  The lights in the area I was now in were more scarce then where I started following the objects.  As I got my camera out and closed my door, I turned to see a object flying maybe 500 feet off the ground and maybe .25 miles away from me.  The object was so low that it&apos;s image was constricted when it passed behind the houses I was standing in front of.  I quickly snapped off two pictures of this object and ran back to my car to follow it as I had lost sight of it behind more houses.  When I pulled back out to the main street I could not see the object.  Also, I noticed that the reddish yellow object was no longer high in the sky.  In fact I couldn&apos;t find it.  Therefore, the object that was low to the ground could have been a totally different object or the object I followed earlier.  This object that I flashed two pictures of was oval in shape it was circled in bright white lights and had several red lights on its front ( I think it was the front because of the direction it was heading which was north of me).  It did not make a single sound and when it flew it seemed to float move effortlessly.  Also, it&apos;s flight pattern was very irratic as it decended and ascended several times within 10 seconds I had a good look of it.  Finally, the object was not moving fast at all.  In fact it seemed to be slow which may have been what caused it to look like it was floating. After getting back in my car to follow the object I realized that the greenish blue object was no longer west of me but was now east of me and still on my left side.  I raced towards a local highschool parking lot in order to park my car and get away from the trees.  I was able to get a fairly good look of the sky.  I waited for 10 minutes and did not see the object that had previously flown close to me.  So, I continued to watch the blue green object which seemed to be stationary in the same position I described earlier.  Then, out of know where I noticed this object moving at the same speed fly from behind my position - yet not directly over me towards the blue green object.  In fact, the blue green object seemed 500 hundred feet above it.  The object continued but again was low enough that objects such as houses and trees seemed to restrict my view.  I got in my car and drove back on the same street following the blue green object. It seemed to be moving higher away yet I kept a clear visiual of it. At this moment, I was 5 miles away from my complex and the sun was coming up directly in front of me.  The stars were no longer visible nor were the satelites.  Yet, I could still see the blue green object.  I drove back to my apartment and looked up to find nothing left in the sky. I am currently working as a engineering consultant with a focus on pneumatic fluid power.  Our company is familiy owned and distributes a full line of pneumatic automation equipment.  We work with plants and OEM&apos;s throughout the Missouri, Illinois area.  I have a BA in finance and economics.  I graduated from a top private university.  I have a series 7 and I have complete certification as a fluid power specialist.  In addition, I volunteer for the Lukemia Society of America and I am a practicing Catholic.  I believe the experience that happened to me was a coincidence.  If I hadn&apos;t glanced out my window at that time I believe that I never would have witnessed the occurence - so no I dont think they were looking for me or that I have ever been abducted.  I am not into Star Trek and Science was my least favorite subject in school. I believe what I saw were UFO&apos;s.  However, whether they have aliens on them I don&apos;t know.  What I do believe is that whatever I witnessed seemed to tempt me to chase after it.  It was a strange sensation, kind of like I was spying on them - I don&apos;t know.", "walking to my car in the driveway  I saw a contrail ,  visible because of the full moon.....the object resembled a satellite ...a faint star like ball but moving fast.....the contrail was not from a jet...this contrail had pulses to it.....like the motor was going on and off ......no sound...but it was very very high in altitude.......it faded once it crossed the sky from north to south .......", "2 triangle shaped aircraft with red, green, and white lights on each corner of the crafts moving irraticly and hovering.As my wife and I were driving home from a friends, I looked out my window and saw a red and green light  out my window.

They traveled together due North, parallel to the base of the hotel and the strip.  Each were about the size of a beachball, traveling together but there was no structure between them. They had their own light source and traveled about 25 mph and grazed the top of the Luxor hotel which I was told is 360&apos; tall.", "I saw a triangle craft, huge, black, white light in each corner, red light in center, hovering above me at about 200-300 feet altitude.I exited the Doubletree Hotel, on IH 35 north, central Austin, looked up and saw the craft. It was motionless, silent, huge (like something 8 inches across, held arms length).I stared at it for about 3-4 minutes, awestruck, then became afraid, ran to my car to leave. I felt that the occupants knew I saw them, were aware of my thoughts, &amp; that scared me. The sky was still dark but it showed up well, the white lights were so bright and reflected on the body of the craft. The red central light was a little smaller that the corner lights. I don&apos;t know how long it was there, since I left after a last glance at it from my car window. It was real, very real, and I never forgot it.", "The overcast north-eastern sky was flashing like a strobe light, lighting up the entire horizon.This is not a report of a craft sighting, rather, it is a report of an unusual event seen in the sky.  The event was witnessed from San Jose, California, just north of the Almaden Valley.  It was exactly 8:20 pm, Pacific time, on Saturday, February 20, 1999.  The sky was overcast. I was inside the office in my house, and I happened to glance out the office window, which faces due East.  In the nort-eastern sky, I noticed that the entire sky was flashing quickly and regularly, like a strobe light, only slower.  The flashes were bright enough to have been lightening, but I doubt they were, because they were too frequent, and too regular in frequency.  I would estimate the frequency of the flashes to be around 4-5 flashes per second, evenly spaced in time. The entire duration of my sighting was approximately 10 seconds.  The entire portion of the sky that I could see was lighting up, but it definitely appeared as though the source of the flashing lights was in the north-eastern sky, which happens to be the approximate direction of the Mount Hamilton observatory (I think that&apos;s the name of it -- during the day, the telescope is visible on the mountain top).  Just for reference, the San Jose airport is north-west of my house, and would have been roughly at my back at the time of this incident.", "On my porch my friend and I saw a  round, white light in the sky it moved  acrossed the sky faster then the average plane.

It had distinct lines, there was as I said, no twinkle and the light did not appear to be relected from any other source. The speed and manner in which it moved was astonishing.

It amazed me. It was a wonderful birthday present.I was taking my kids to school, on the morning of 10-20-94, as we crossed some railroad tracks, I looked up in the sky to the north and saw a small silver saucer shaped object, I said to my children look up there and pointed to the saucer, at this point we were amazed. I turned north at the next street which was across the tracks, tried to follow it and then it disappears into thin air.", "Driving down road my family noticed object above trees that I could not imediatly discern, as I started to turn onto our street it came into my view, I finished turning and pulled pratically underneath it, It was at treetop level right above us,my family was hysterical &quot;afraid&quot; screeming. I put the car in park and realized it emitted no sound, I therefore turned the car off and still could here no sound. I then got out of car,&quot;family still screeming hysterically&quot; and walked directly beneath it and could only discern a slight whirring noise.

This occurred on Atlee street &quot;was willow st.&quot;aprox. 6-7 miles from gulf of mexico in somewhat rural area. I reported to sheriffs office, they thought I was a nut.I did not know who to report to who would take serious. Me, my wife and my children know what we saw, and there is no craft in existance that could hover or fly in this manner without any discernable noise to my knowledge. It has made me a believer.Hovering at tree top level, slightly off edge of roadway, triangular arranged lights with point aiming due south, hovered for at least 5 minutes with no detecktable sound except for very faint whirring. Distance between lights 40-50 feet, my best example of size would be a double wide mobile home cut into triangle. Body was not visable, but should have been!! Allthough it was night time, at this distance it should have been visable. My wife, myself and 3 of my children were present and witnessed it allthough my youngest son at the time was to young to remember the physical aspects he remembers the screeming. After hovering for aprox. 5 min. it started drifting south and steadily gained speed, giving chase I could not catch it traveling up to 50mph on a dirt road, it abrutly climbed about 50&apos; banked hard left and disappeared over the potberg ranch territory.

WALLACE NEWS-PRESS STAFF WRITER After more than a month of delays and 10 scrubbed launch attempts, the first satellites built by Denmark and South Africa were boosted into orbit Tuesday from Vandenberg Air Force Base, with both nations gratefully heralding the start of their own space ages. On the 11th launch attempt, the Boeing Delta 2 rocket burst into a clear sky at 2:29 a.m. Tuesday. The rocket carried into orbit the Danes&apos; Orsted satellite, the South African SUNSAT and the ARGOS, a global environmental and military space project that is the largest and most sophisticated research satellite ever taken into space for the United States. The rocket&apos;s fiery ascent through the stars could be seen by onlookers for more than three minutes, as the booster reached speeds of 10,000 mph. &quot;Thanks to the people of America, this is the first small step of ours into space,&apos;&apos; Garth Milne, SUNSAT project manager, said at a January press conference. It was a long road for the foreign satellites. The launch, originally scheduled for early January, was continually delayed because of bad weather and various mechanical problems. The launch was a highly anticipated international venture, but the more than 100 dignitaries, industry leaders and students from South Africa and Denmark who spent the first half of January on the Central Coast returned home weeks ago. South Africa&apos;s satellite quest began in 1991 at the University of Stellenbosch. Initially, 14 graduate engineering students were involved &Ntilde; a number that grew to more than", "Another sighting of the triangular craft with logo.Hello again: I would like to report yet another sighting of the black triangular craft of Feb. 15, 1999, that I reported a few days ago. Last night, Feb. 20, 1999, my wife and I were sitting in our sunroom at 11:40 PM.  We sit out there quite often to watch the animals in our yard, three and a half acres in rural Rhode Island. We were watching a fox feed on bread we had put out when the craft appeared heading in a southerly direction.  We stepped out to the porch for a better look.  The craft passed over us silently, slowly, steadily.  The underside of it was dimly lighted by a hazy white light, thus making it possible to see the logo.  The logo was a triangle edged in yellow containing the Earth being struck by two red lightning bolts with a number &quot;1&quot; in the right hand corner all on a black background. As it approached, a feeling of serenity and calm came over us making it a wonderful feeling to watch as it passed overhead.  I estimate the speed of the craft at approximately five to ten miles per hour. The size approximately forty feet in length and forty feet wide at the rear of the craft with the nose of the craft forming a point. The craft looked very similar to the Stealth fighter, however, it was much larger than the plane.  The altitude of the craft was approximately one hundred feet.  I repeat, there was not a sound from the craft and it did not even create a breeze. I will email you a copy of the logo we made. I would appreciate any answers you might have as to what this craft is or who it belongs to. Thank you.", "Bright glowing objectMy friend and I were about to enter a buliding when I looked up to the evening sky (overcast in areas,) and notice a bright light move VERY fast across the sky (heading north-west.)  We then notice something shooting from it, in a downward direction.  Then both objects disapeared shorty after.  I feel that the object was a metoerite but I cannot be certain, I have never seen one so bright before (both objects.)  I thought I would mention it for what it&apos;s worth. Later....", "3 to 7 red lights in the night sky, moving independantly of eachother. Many miles away at a 60 degree angle from horizon.It has been several years since the event so my memory of the specifics, such as date, time, and number of objects, is not clear. I was up in the Bremerton, Wa. area on a crystal clear night. It is not a big city area so there aren&apos;t many city lights to detract from the view of the sky. I was on the balcony of my apartment with my girlfriend just enjoying the evening and chatting when we both noticed several solid red lights in the sky about the size of 4 or 5 intense stars put together.  They were very far away in the sky. I would say many miles away. They were far up in the sky, probably 60 degrees off the horizon.  I do not remember the direction. And do not want to guess as it would be just that. They were, at times, in formation where they would be close together and then in a split second they would shoot off in different directions of no certain pattern or common distance.  They moved with amazing speed, with no tail, and stopped on a dime and then would change direction effortlessly. It seemed they were covering great distances because they seemed so far away and would cover 10 t0 30 degrees of sky in a matter of a few seconds. Then as quickly as they&apos;d separated they would one by one, in no certain order, come back together (not touching) again as if to huddle. They did not pulsate. They did not change shape or color. They did not seem to move any closer in our direction but for the most part seemed to travel on a constant plain of distance.  They did however seem to move both longitudenally and latitudenally. Meaning that if someone a hundred miles away from my position was directly under them they may have appeared to have a change in depth perception. My first impression, as I mentioned to my girlfriend, was that we were witnessing and extra-terrestrial event. We were obviously surprised and in awe but not frightened. I am very much a pesemist when it comes to this sort of thing and tried in every way possible to figure a logical explanation (planes, helicopters, lasers,...etc.) but nothing I! &apos;d ever whitnessed made sense. I&apos;ve only mentioned this to maybe 2 or 3 people and never reported it or followed up because I figured it was pointless. But I have never forgotten it. I&apos;ve often wondered if there were any other whitnesses and only report it now because when I typed in &quot;UFOs Washington&quot; last week and found your site and saw the story about the mother and daughter and the red fireball it blew my mind.  I felt like I should let you guys know. I don&apos;t know what you will do with this information but I hope it helps.  I also wonder how you are able to determine if someone writing to you is telling the truth or fabricating a story. Please take this as the truth. I work in mainstream society and am very busy (I don&apos;t have time to write fairy tales on the internet). I would not share this with my associates as they would probably think I was nuts. I only do this now because it has always been stored in my memory since then and I never forget it and also because of the account I read in your site. I don&apos;t know if they&apos;re related but if they aren&apos;t it is a hell of a coinsedence.", "I was out side with my friends and we saw f-18s and two circle like shapes in the air.

I was driving home on route 4 west when I noticed to my left on the east bound side of route 4. An object that i thought was a helicopter at tree top level it  was a cigar shaped craft.I was driving home to New York State from River Edge New Jersey. I got onto route 4 west about 1:30 - 2:00 am I just pulled onto the highway when i noticed on my left side on the east bound lane I saw what i thought was a helicopter i slowed down to look at it and i took a good look at it and i knew it was&apos;nt a helicopter. I rolled down my window to look at it and i did&apos;nt hear any engine sound it was silent. When i noticed it was cigar shaped i got scared and steped on the gas to get away. It was odd that when i stepped on the gas it sped up the same instant as me  and when i slowed down it slowed down the same instant that i did.It was like they knew what my every move was going to be. I went up the highway looking out my window and it was still on the other side of the road following me and going the same speed as i was driving. I was approching route 17 north which was the next road for me to take to go home.Just before i got onto route 17 i pulled over to the side of the shoulder and stopped. It stopped and hovered in silence across the other side of the highway.I got out of my car and there was a dead silence it moved from the tree tops down to the front of the trees and i could see inside the windows on the side of the craft and i saw two figures that did&apos;nt look like human beings and when i saw that i jumped into my car and sped off to the on ramp of route 17 north i looked behind me and it was following me and i don&apos;t remember getting on route 17 north the next thing i remembered was i was pulling into my driveway in Middletown New York and it was daybreak the sun was starting to come up It was about 5:00am. The odd thing about it is that it takes 1 hour to get from River Edge to Middletown New York. I have about 4 hours of missing time. To this day Im still bothered about what happened to me. The next day it was in the bergen county news paper that there was alot of sightings of ufo&apos;s over paramus new jersey the same area i was driving my car. The police station was swamped with calls of alot o! f  people that saw the ufo.

Thought it was strange it headed East towards Lake Michigan turned completely around and headed straight West. Just before it went over there were 4 airplanes traveling east together and then this craft came from the east. I am a skeptic and always thought people were exagerating when they told of sightings, so when I saw this I was in awe and it actually took my breath away. I am still trying to find an explanation for it because as I said I am a skeptic.

Speeding up, slowing down, turning 90 degrees in an instant.We were coming home from a drive-in around 23:30 and there were alot of stars in the sky. I was 8 years old at the time but this has always stuck with me. I got out of the car and looked up at the stars when I noticed 1 light shooting across the sky from east to west very quickly then 2 other ones came up behind it like they were following the first. Back then I thought they were maybe playing tag. I asked my mom and dad what that was and they looked in awe then said probably a shooting star. But they kept watching. The first one slowed down made a sharp 90 degree turn very quickly to the south for about 1 or 2 seconds then made another 90 degree turn very quickly to the west. The other 2 lights chasing it did exactly the same thing. Like making the exact same movements as the first one by slowing down, speeding up and making the very sharp and quick turns. When all 3 were going west again they sped up and disappeared. Like someone shut off their light. They just had 1 bright light. I think this sighting stayed with me all these years because of how my parents just froze when they were watching them.", "It was a very Bright light and it was hovering for about 7 minutes (approx) and then it shot out in the sky with excessive speed and then returned about 1/2 an hour later for about 3 minutes.It was a very bright blue and green light and it was farely large and it had lights flashing around the UFO it was a blue color.", "Saw formation of 5 translucent lights coming out of the southAs I looked up in a southern direction I saw 5 translucent lights in a half chevron formation coming straight at me, very fast and no sound.

The 5 lights on the other hand were a little out of focus and not the same color as the stars.  Being color blind I&apos;m not sure exactly what color they were. Perhaps bluish.

It was a large circular object encased in fire, with a tail extending behind. It moved slowly and as it crossed in front of us, it started to extinguish its fire and afterwards I was able to see the outline of a small craft with a singular blue/green light.My friend and I were returning from a UFO conference in Laughlin Nevada and at 2:30am we saw what looked like a flare or shooting star like object, traveling due south as we traveled west. We watched with amazement as this object just took its time, flying approx. at an altitude of 6000 feet. It was shaped like a ice cream cone, but flying on it side, with a stout tail and all blazing at the same color temperature of rich fire gold. As it crossed right in front of us it started to extinguish its flames, in much the same way your furnace turns off, showing hues of blue, green, red and gold. It seem to crackle, I didn&apos;t hear anything but the way the fire went out it was uneven and there seemed to be sparks. When it was just to our left, it was completely extinguished and I saw the outline of a craft, which appeared small and circular, with a single blue/green light.

As I was turning into my driveway I noticed 2 bright lights over the field a couple of hundred yards away, at first I thought it was a low flying airplane, but as I watched I realized it was much to close and low to be an airplane, also there was no sound. I walked down to the end of the driveway, as I stood there the lights started coming closer, very slowly the object came towards me until it hovered motionless about 100 feet directly above me. I would approximate it to be about 100 feet long, not quite as wide as it was long, I suppose &quot;cigar&quot; shape would be close. The underside was very black, it was difficult to make out the outline, there was a deep red light off center on the underside, and bluish-white lights shining outward from each end and the sides. There was a low pitch humming like sound, no down draft that I could feel coming from it. As I looked around and realized there was no one else around, a panic came on me, I ran up the driveway and crouched down behind my car, (this seems almost funny to me now) as I looked back at the craft it began to move slowly off down the road. I ran back down the driveway to see where it was going, it stopped and hovered just above the tree tops about 60 yards away, it slowly rotated and made a high mechanical whining noise, it&apos;s difficult to describe because I have never heard anything like it. It then began to move off towards the main road. Where I got the nerve, I&apos;ll never know, but I got in the car and headed after it. When I reached the main road the craft was just on the other side of the street, right at tree top level, I got out of the car and stood on the hood of it and just starred at this thing, it was close enough that I could have hit it with a rock. From this angle I could see three lights blinking along the craft, one green, red, and a blue one, also a row of dim lit lights that looked to be windows. As I stood there for about a minute it began to slowly move away along t! he road heading south, I followed along at about 60 mph as this craft flew along just above the trees along side of the road, after about a mile I lost sight of it. Three miles from home I pulled into  the parking lot of a closed store and got out to look out aver a big valley, as I stood there it came out across the valley in a big arc and went out of sight. At this point I was very wound up and excited so I headed home to call some one about this. As I was driving home, I saw it again in the rear view mirror, I stopped and got out of the car and watched it again fly off out of sight. After I got home and was getting out of the car it came over the tree line at a fair distance away and flew off out of sight. I sat out on the deck for about an hour but did not see it again that night. The time from when I first saw it until I got home was about 45 minutes. A strange thing was that while this was going on there where no cars on the road, after it was over the were quite a few. I made several phone calls over the next several days, but no one could tell me anything, some people laughed, the was some ridicule from others, and some people said they believed and a few even shared sighting of there own.

This object caught my attention immediately, because an airplane wouldn&apos;t be flying that close near a residential area.I found a parking spot 150 yards up the road, and got out to observe the object. It was only one pale red light that maybe twice faded to a dim and then returned to it&apos;s original brightness. There was a telephone pole right next to the object, so my girlfriend &amp; I could actually observe the object&apos;s ascent to approx. 1500 feet. As it ascended, it swayed very slighty to one side &amp; back to the other. It reminded me  of a Chinese Lantern, as it was a pale red color and the swaying it did. It proceded to move towards our direction after about 10 minutes of ascending. It was NOT an airplane or any conventional aircraft I have ever seen in a night-time setting. The light made no noise. The evening was calm &amp; crystal clear that night. As it proceded towards us, I became a little nervous, and watched it move to the south-east (in our direction), so I decided I had seen enough (40* F outside), but when I looked back in the object&apos;s general direction 5 minutes later, it was gone.

Two of the lights shot off from the others going in opposite directions (west and east).  Then they just disappeared.

WE HAD DRIVEN ABOUT 5 MINUTES OUT OF GREEN BAY WHEN I NOTICED 3 HUGE, BRIGHT, WHITE LIGHTS IN THE SKY TO OUR LEFT. I POINTED THIS OUT TO MY BROTHER. AS SOON AS WE BOTH HAD OUR EYES LOCKED ON THE LIGHTS, WE REALIZED THEY WERE CONNECTED TO AN ENORMOUS TRIANGULAR CRAFT. THE CRAFT WAS NOW TRAVELING FROM OUR LEFT TO RIGHT DIRECTLY OVER OUR VEHICLE. I OPENED MY PASSENGER WINDOW. I HAD HALF OF MY TORSO OUT THE WINDOW STARING UP AT THE OBJECT.IT MADE ABSOLUTELY NO DISCERNABLE SOUND WHATSOEVER. SOON THE OBJECT WAS ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY. WE WATCHED THE OBJECT SHIFT DIRECTION SILENTLY IN MID-AIR SO THAT IT&apos;S &quot;NOSE&quot; WAS POINTED IN THE SAME DIRECTION OUR CAR WAS HEADED. THE OBJECT SIMPLY FLOATED IN THAT STATE, ABOUT 45 FEET  ABOVE THE GROUND. IT SEEMED TO TAKE FOREVER TO PASS IT ALTHOUGH BY THIS TIME TRAFFIC AHEAD OF US SLOWED TO ALMOST A CRAWL. WE WERE BOTH SO ASTONISHED TO SEE SOMETHING SO HUGE AND SIENT. IAM ALMOST CERTAIN THAT OTHER TRAVELERS NOTICED THE OBJECT BECAUSE OF THE SLOWDOWN IN TRAFFIC. WE NEVER GOT A CHANCE TO TALK TO ANYONE ON THE HIGHWAY THAT NIGHT. AS SOON AS THE OBJECT WAS PASSED, PEOPLE SEEMED TO RESUME THEIR NORMAL SPEEDS. I PLACED A CALL TO THE OUTAGAMIE SHERRIFS DEPT.

I was out filling my bird feeder in the back yard. The night was mostly clear and being an amatuer astronomer I alway look at a clear sky. The lights appeared to be shining through the misty clouds, not on the clouds. Most aircraft in the area can be heard from about three to four miles up since I often measure time seen over time heard  parameters using my ears and eyes. There are about 10 to 12 lights total making up the object with half of the lights(5-6) making up one line of the V and the other 5 or 6 making up the other line. The angle in the V would be closer to  90 degrees than 45 degrees. The lights very much resembled typical 3 to 4 degree magnitude stars and each light remained equidistant from one another suggesting they were fixed upon a structure. They did not flash.    I would estimate the wing pattern to be about the size of a typical  727-737 jet at about 6,000-7,000 feet high which do fly overhead during the day and early night in the area which are always clearly heard.

During my viewing, I contacted the local (1 mile away) air force base (a satellite tracking station) and asked whether they could view it, either by sight or by radar.  The individual who answered indicated that they had no radar for that purpose but agreed to go out an view it himself.  After a follow-up call, he indicated that he did believe he saw these.  I contacted the local airport&apos;s sherriff&apos;s office to ask them to call the tower to see if they could view this craft.  No follow up with the airport.  I also contacted an airforce base some 60 miles south but the tower could not view it. The shape was difficult to acertain..it simply looked star-like. During the last ten minutes of viewing, the object moved off to the right. Having contacted the UFO Center, it was suggested that I get a tripod and film it.  After 5 minutes search, I found and set up the tripod but by the time I returned, the object had moved off.", "Saw 1 UFO hovering over Mountain Creek Ski Resort.

Craft rotated slowly and co ntinuously in a 360 degree clockwise direction. Belly of craft was not illuminated at all, but couldn&apos;t get cear view of it due to white light brightness.  Ends of craft were not illuminated at all.  No noise was detected. My car was parked on the southbound side of RT. 94 in Vernon Township, NJ across from main parking lot of ski resort. I stood in parking lot to view craft. After 10 to 15 minutes of this, the craft simply vanished.  There was no discernable take off, so I can&apos;t say what direction it went to The craft was located in an easterly direction when viewed. I have never before seen a craft like this.

They were not moving as slowly as an airplane nor as quickly as a shooting star -- somewhere in between, but again, they looked as far away as the stars did so they must have been going relatively very quickly.

This made me look harder due the fact that it was so low and not on the usuaul flight path of the planes coming from the New Jersey Airport (the flight path brings the planes straight towards my house not from the side as this thing flew). I paused and looked closer and noticed as it passed it blocked the takeoff lights of the planes from a distance and the treeline on Staten Island.  I yelled to my 7 year old son to look and he stated he saw it too.  We watched as it flew over the horizon towards Coney Island.

The lake area in early spring was usualy rife with animal and insect sounds and we became slightly alarmed. A few seconds later my freind saw the object. It was roughly the size of a house and glowed a yellowish white light that pusated. It&apos;s shape was triangular. It made no sound.

It was almost on top of my truck.  They were observing me and had forced me pull over.One Sunday evening in the winter of 1970 about 7:pm, I had decided to go to my fathers house which was only about 6 or 7 miles away.  I turned left off Hy. 60 which led me south on a rural road.  I had proceeded no more than about 100 yds. when I was stopped by what ap- peared to be police lights.  Having pulled over, I looked back and was perplexed not to see a police car. (I thought it was the local pol- ice because I was now in the city limits of town.)  I thought per- haps I had been speeding or something.  At that moment, the interior of my pickup was flooded with light.  I then realized that a ufo had pulled me over by using simulated police lights and that they were now observing me.  The craft was by now very visible and exceedingly close.  It was about 50 yds. off to my right and about a telephone poles&apos; height from ground level.  It was very luminous and quite large; as big as a football field.  It seemed to be constructed of a shiny material somewhat like aluminum and was the typical saucer shape.  (Like two saucers put together.)  I observed the craft for a few moments and left as I had read of abductions and I didn&apos;t want to be in that category. (scared stiff)  I saw no aliens. There were several things about this sighting that to me were peculiar.  The first was the use of police lights and the second was the fact that this happened in a well-populated area (a church and hospital were nearby) as well as in a residential area.  Also, the craft appeared suddenly and disappeared just as quickly.  (It didn&apos;t just fly in or out, it literally disappeared.)  There was absolutely no sound of any kind. I would like to point out that I have never been prone to hallucinations and have always been a very moderate drinker. (At this particular time I didn&apos;t drink at all and in any event I have never drank so much that I would see things like that.)

Traveled from N - S.I think this was a sattellite, HOWEVER, I don&apos;t think it was one of the Iridium sats. They are geostationary.  I saw a brilliant white flash out of the corner of my eye and looked up to see a white light with a corona at extreme altitude. It had a corona.  The light appeared to make a slight &quot;J&quot; turn, but I am attributing that to atmospheric distortion. The object remained brilliant for 4 seconds, then faded rapidly. I was able to track it with the naked eye from approx 70 deg azimuth to 55 deg.  It died out and I was no longer able to see it after 55 deg. There was no red or blue shift to the light.  It did not twinkle or shimmer. It was harsh and brilliant white.  It did not illuminate the surrounding area, nor did it hurt to look at it.  It was at extremely high altitude, possibly in orbit/space. Hypothesis: This must have been a sat, however it went from N - S.  Sats move in an equatorial orbit.  Possibilities:  Russian BrightStar: sat that tried to illuminate remote areas?  Killer Sat Victim:  Derelict sat being destroyed by new orbital weapon?  Space Craft: making turn in high-altitude sunlight?((NUFORC:  Iridium satellites are in low earth orbit, and are not geosynchronous.

But maybe looking toward the East at approx. 75 to 85 degrees from horizon, we saw 15 to 25 objects at first star like in appearance, also seemed to be at the same distance to us as the stars. Upon closer examination these objects were moving, side to side{appox, 40 degrees either way} &amp; up and down. Their movement seemed nice &amp; fluid sometimes in a flying wing then changing direction &amp; slowly fitting back into a flying wing. They did not seem to be flying very fast but if our perceptions of distance were anywhere near accurate they had to be going astronomically fast. Their changing directions often, yet staying in a certain grid seemed to make no sense either. One of the brothers went in to get their parents, they came out &amp; watched with us, and to the best of my recollection we all described seeing the same thing. I think one of the parents went in to call some sort of authority. We watched for quite a while 30 minutes maybe more, honestly do not remember if they stopped or we went on to something else as this was very strange, but not threatening in anyway. I did not keep track of the Brothers or their parents, but their parent were solid middle class or better judging by their house and area of residence.

I am a private, recreational pilot and take an interest in everything that flys overhead. On this February 21/96 evening it was dark (9:05 pm) and a thick overcast of cloud was overhead--the cloud base was at 1,900 feet (because of the sighting--I immediately upon arrival home checked our local weather channel for cloud ceiling data and winds and wrote down the details of what I saw). Anyway, during our walk I looked to the west and saw an unushual glowing object, luminous but not glaring bright, no navigational lights or strobe. We stopped walking and I pointed the object out to my son. Its track would have it fly almost directly overhead. As it approached I said to him that this was weird--no sound, speed about what a small aircraft would fly at, 100 mph or so, but it was relatvely low as it went over--estimate based on known cloud base (1,900 feet) and the object was about one hundred feet below the cloud layer. Though it was night the  overcast was bright because of the glare of city lights but I could not detect wings or any form other than that of a sphere, illuminated in a yellowish-white light (the object was close enough that wings would have been detectable). I figured the object to measure about fifteen feet in diameter. The west to east course was more or less straight (winds were NW - 11 KM/H), it did not weave or change altitude though I thought there to be slight oscilation--I did not sense that it drifted with wind direction. All this seemed odd but it was not until the object had passed overhead and was about 4 miles east of our position that we were amazed. At this distance the cloud changed from a solid defined layer at 1,900 feet to dropping right to the ground. I said to my son that if this were an airplane it would not fly into the cloud at this altitude because there are many mountains less than a mile to the north that rise to 4,000 feet. No aircraft flying IFR would fly this ! course. The object, seconds before entering the cloud dropped what I can only describe as sparkles--just like the flickering white/blue flashes one would see from a halloween sparkler. These sparkles descended from the still illuminated sphere for a time span of about four or five seconds, dropping about 1,000 feet below the craft. We let out a collective &quot;whooo.&quot; Then twice more it dropped these twinkling bright lights in identicle fashion to the first then immediately entered the cloud and the illuminated sphere went out as if a switch were turned off as opposed to being obscurred by thicking cloud. We were pretty puzzled by what we saw and immediately upon arriving home I jotted down the details, it was only upon listing to your report on the Art Bell show and your invitation to submit both recent and past sightings that I felt compelled to dig out my scrap of paper with the details contained herein.

There was absolutely no noise whatsoever. There were no aircraft in the vicinity.  My daughter&apos;s first impression was that she was seeing moths, as she described the motion as &quot;fluttering&quot;.", "i was the third witness on the scene.i saw 1 craft only .5 craft were seen by the other witnesses.  it started almost directly overhead, it hovered and changed colors from white to red to invisable, it then just desended over the horizon at a high rate.The event occured about 15 after noon on march 3rd 1999 in San Antonio, texas.  I was delivering pizzas and just stepped outside the store to make a run.  I noticed two gentlemen looking up at the sky and i looked also.  I saw at about 1 o&apos;clock high a intermittingly flashing object.  I thought it was a bird at first because it seemed to be floating on an air current.  But it appeared to be reflecting light.  It was changing from white to invisable to red.  It was angular in shape. But i got the feeling that it may have been a sphere with angular panels on it and that it may have been spinning and reflecting light from the sun.  It reminded me of when I have held a rock in my hand and turned it over and the different facets catch the light and reflect it back at me.  It just seemed to hover for a few minutes then began to descend.  This is the tricky part.  It appeared to descend but it did not change size.  It just dropped from 11 o&apos; clock where it started to about 9 o&apos; clock on my left then went across from my left to my right across the sky and continued to descend to about 3 o&apos; clock where it went below the horizon line.  I wwas told the entire event lasted about 15 minutes.  The part i witnessed lasted about 5 minutes.", "we saw about 4 strange lights about 200-300 feet above the ground near a section of woods in our city we see this all the time. i can get video of the incident the photos we took didnt turn out for some strange reason. the lights were green,blue,and orange.every night we would go to a park near a section of woods and we would all get very strange feelings at the entrance to the woods. we would get massive headaches. we have entered the woods only a few times with about 7 people each time, once inside we would all see a strange set of lights hovering abouve the woods and would sometimes see a white person like being staring at us  in the woods. we have had several sightings here in janesville almost too many to mention. Some of us feel that we can track whatever it is that is watching us. in some cases we have noticed a few lights folowing us. i don&apos;t know if it would concern u to know that we may have found a secret military base in one section of woods.it was rather dark in the woods but light enough to see each other most people we tell this too doesn&apos;t believe us but there are about 30 of us that get together for a yearly meeting about what goes on in this so called peacefull town. and thanx for having this nicely done page so people like us can give a report.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "Friend saw and alerted me and my wife to an object that moved eratically in the sky.it was around 1:00 am and we had just gotten into our sleeping bags after fishing untill late friday night at tarryall reservoir. Just as we were settling in my friend jumped out of his sleeping bag and yelled for us to get up and see this thing in the sky. As we sat up this bright white sphere came around the lake. It started at the inlet end of the lake and we were near the spillway end. The sphere bounced eratically moving up and down in a zigzag motion with the zigs covering at least 50 or 60 feet as it traveled from the inlet end past us to the outlet end and then around us and back towards the inlet end but as it went back the way itcame it just gradually went higher and higher untill it disapered into the clouds that were above at a higher altitude. We talked about what we had seen and we all had seen the same thing. It was about 20 feet in diameter and it was between 200 and 300 feet in altitude untill it started to climb as it left the area. It was the most briliant white light i had ever seen but it didn&apos;t put off much light to the ground or the water that we could see. i haven&apos;t seen anything like it since then.", "Sighted at the intersection of Preston Hwy. and Gilmore Lane on the saturday before Halloween around 10:30 to 11:00pm. Large dome-shaped object with lights on the underneath side.I first sighted this object along with two other witnesses after a Halloween party on the saturday night before Halloween 1976. We saw the object over Alder Ave. moving silently and slowing east and then hovering over the intersection of Preston Hwy. and Gilmore Lane. It hovered there silently for several minutes befoe moving east again following the path of Gilmore Lane toward Poplar Level Rd. The object appeared to be 100ft-200ft in the air. It was a large dome-shaped craft with a dull metalic finish that was visible due to the ambient light. It was flat on the bottom with a large center light and smaller lights rotating around the center light. The smaller lights were moving slowly in a counter-clockwise direction. We reported it to Standiford Field (our local airport) and questioned if anyone else had reported the same. Three years later in July, 1979 I saw the same object in the same area (I lived 2 blocks form the original sighting). On this occasion I was with my neighbor and we ran to Preston Hwy. and once again it hovered for a couple of minutes before moving eastward toward Poplar Level Rd.", "Work at Microsoft Redwest, was crossing to Cafe for coffee break, and looked to east at Cascades, suddenly saw 2 objects coming north to south, rapidly decending, flat dome shapes, very close formation, between hills and Cascades, blinking white light on tops, appeared to be landing or crashing.  I believe they are NOT alien but definitely secret UFO&apos;s being possibly tested.  I truly expected them to crash due to speed but nothing. Just disappeared behind mtns. and never flew back up from behind mtn.  It seems inconceivable that they landed at this speed.   See below for details.I discussed with my husband as this was nothing I&apos;d ever seen and believe possibly others have seen the same and not know what they are.  I do NOT believe they are alien craft despite how they flew and looked.  If I had a ruler in front of me, each craft was over an inch long+ in the sky that many miles away.  They were flying nose to tail, one slightly above the other, but again, ruler in front of my eyes, about 1/16&quot; apart.  Both were bright silver metalic, no visible wings, tails or other flying parts.  Both were blinking at the top, a single white flashing light, rapid pulsatings.  They were not truly saucer shaped nor cigar shaped, but more like a flatter saucer shape, rounded at the top, flat bottom and elongated on each end but not pointed as a plane appears in the sky. Their speed was incredible, as fast as jets, and too fast for such a desent.  They were both coming from directly north, but far higher up to a lower southern spot behind the mountain range before the Cascades.  It reminded me of how the Blue Angels fly to perform stunts, but this was NOT what they appeared to be doing.  It was not a stunt flight. They appeared to be landing OR going right into the earth. When I discussed this with my husband last night, he advised me that I might be right that it was something secret we were testing, as he believed there was an old military base over behind Issaquah somewhere near that mountain range, that Boeing used to test military planes they build. I then discussed this today with a friend at Microsoft over lunch, and he asked if I&apos;d contacted you yet.  I told him since he supported my thoughts this was &quot;ours&quot;, I would send you this information tonight after work. He also mentioned that he&apos;d seen another green ball of light and we began to wonder if all these sitings were corrolated and not alien, but just our own government&apos;s secret projects.  Remembering an incident in the CA desert in Aug. &apos;79 near Boran, which later was exactly like the &quot;Harrier&quot; we saw (but without wings) at SeaFair, I realized that we had the technology of hover craft, rapid speeds, and wingless flights without it being a helicopter.  Because of so many sightings up here, and elsewhere, the more we report the unknown as precisely as we can, the closer we will all get to truth.  This technology could well have come from alien technology long ago, but it does not mean what I observed was alien, despite its appearance. I am in the hopes someone else has reported this same incident or a like one which you can compare the data with and see if there is a possible connection.   You&apos;d phoned me back when my husband &amp; I observed a bright orangish light near the I-405 near SR520, after we reported it, as being observed by others as well as a military helicopter watching it, too for some time period.  And it disappeared very rapidly.  It, too could have been observed by the military to see how it performed, a test, and if it caused folks to be alarmed.  I am seriously beginning to wonder about all the UFOs I&apos;ve seen over the many decades and why I see them, over others.  Possibly because I do love this world so much and love to look at it and the magnificient sky.  I find it refreshing for my soul, but it is why I believe that I see more than others do.   It is a daily ritual to stop and look over at the Cascades to view these majestic mountains through the seasons. So, it did not surprise me that I &apos;happened&apos; to see something that did not belong in the sky at that moment.  Had I not been refreshing my soul, it would not be reported now.  I wouldn&apos;t have seen it.  Maybe the desire of humanity is now stepping more as I learned to step, and maybe this is why sightings are being reported in more numbers.  Who knows!", "silver cube with rubic cube like centeri was driving to work on rt 87 south (northway) saw square shaped object sitting over city at about 1000 ft size approx 100x100 ft looked like a rubic cube with silver balloon frame. was is sight till got closer then disappeared((NUFORC NOTE:  No other reports were received regarding this alleged event.

Stopped, and then moved away from me VERY fast and then just disappearedThis was a very very bright circular light seen in the morning sky, just a few minutes before sunrise.  It was a beautiful clear morning and they sky was unusually light.  The brightness caught my eye as I was driving.  At first I thought it was a helicopter but the light then got much more intense with a reddish glow around it.  It then seemed to move backwards away from me extremely fast and then completely vanished.  I knew it could not be a helicopter because you don&apos;t see the helicopter headlight if it is moving away from you, and it moved way too fast.", "I was looking out to sea when I noticed a light flashing constantly, but in different positions out to sea.  I continued to watch the object and it then started flying towards us when it got closer we could see that a slugish aircraft was following it.  The craft then went from travelling at some speed to stopped in an instant.  It then waited for the plane to get close again and the left it standing as it pulled away again.All info. is above.", "I was driving home on freeway going north and looked out drivers side window when i see a bright red round object in the sky right over down town area.I exited freeway,parked, and watched it until it faded away.", "Four silvery disk objects observedI was returning home from a night at the horse races when I spotted four large stationary objects in the sky overhead at Mexico, PA. I stopped to see exactly what these things might be and encountered another couple who had also stopped for the same reason. We did not converse with each other. Since it was Decemeber 10th, it was quite cold and clear. I stood on the side of the road and observed the four lights/disks for some time. To the naked eye, they appeared slightly larger than the moon. They were motionless, hovering at what appeared to be approximately 1,500-2500 feet. A more precise calculation was impossible, since there was no way to gauge their true size. As I recall, some 21 years later, the four &quot;disks&quot; changed formation while I was observing them. Since I had been at the racetrack, I had my trusty binoculars along, a pair of 7x35 magnification. Looking thru my glasses, I could only discern one thing of any interest: these objects, whatever they were, had a colored lights on the outer edges of the diameter; the colors were different; one was red, the other blue. The interior of these disks had no definition whatsover. They just looked light some sort of self-illuminating disk. They did not seem to illuminate the ground below, as far as I could tell. The one thing that was curious to me was that they were overhead in the vicinity of a small, part-time radion station, WJUN, which is comprised of a small cement block building and a transmitter tower. I stood there silently watching this phenomenon for some 10-15 minutes and finally departed due to the inclement weather and lack of any appreciable &quot;activity&quot; from these objects, aside from their changing of formation. They were still overhead when I left. The following day, someone (the couple on the side of the road?) wrote to the local paper, The Lewistown Sentinel about this event. The nitwit at the paper responded that they were probably helicopters. Whatever these things were, they were NOT helicopters. There was no sound coming from these o! bjects. As a footnote to my experience, I noticed several weeks later in the Sunday paper supplement, Parade Magazine, that folks in Australia has sighted the EXACT same four objects down there! Coincidence? Maybe, but I doubt it. This is the first time I have recounted my 1978 experience for publication. I have absolutely no idea what those four silvery objects were.", "Brilliant orange/gold fireball moving EXTREMELY slowly - almost inperseptably at first, west to east, with a trail, for about 45 seconds, then vanished. It made no sound.On February 10, 1999 at 11:40pm I was leaving my friends&apos; apartment buliding in the Pe&ntilde;esquitos area of San Diego near I-15, walking east in the parking lot toward my car. It was a crystal clear night with no clouds, and excellent visibility of the stars. My intuition told me to turn around as I walked through the parking lot, and there directly over my friends&apos; apartment building was a large, brilliant, orangish gold fireball, seemingly hovering. As I watched, I realized it was moving -- albeit very slowly -- from west to east. It had a trail of what I would describe as &apos;sparks&apos;. It took about 45 seconds to go from over the apartment building to over the parking lot... an incredibly long period of time for something &apos;flying in the sky&apos; to go such a short distance... at which time it was directly overhead and simply vanished. It made no sound. I have seen many many meteors over the years, and am a seasoned star-watcher. I have never, ever seen anything like this and it left me in awe and in wonder. It was extarordinary.", "A fireball travelled north to south, from horizon to horizon, due east of our location, at an elevation of about 45 degrees when due east of site.The object appeared as a very bright meteor, a brilliant white head, obviously exfoliating burning material, creating a burning tail approximatelly 2 or 3 degrees in width. The tail was not as bright as  the head, and burned with yellow and red colors.  The speed of the object seemed slower than that of meteors in showers I&apos;ve seen, and it did not fall.  It appeared to  maintain a constant altitude throughout the view time.

WE followed, it moved rapidly and had multi colored lights.  It would disappear and re-appear.  We followed it and tried to keep it insight. It traveled rapidly along the eastside of I5.  We aren&apos;t totally positive, but it didn&apos;t seem like a plane or helicopter.  It just hovered, and would move rapidly from one location to another.

Clouds were thick and low. It was dark. First I noticed a bright light shining through a small break in the clouds just north of my home which overlooks the water. I assumed it was a plane and gave it no further thought. Then I saw a second light of equal size east of the first light and a third light just north and inbetween the other two. The space between the two nearer lights, when I held up my hand, was four fist-widths. Each light was about the size of a full moon but appeared eliptical in shape, always keeping the same horizonatal axis. This triangle of lights was about 60 degrees above the horizon. My next thought was that it could be helicopters launching a search for a missing boat on Possession Sound, however the lights did not descend over the water. The lights rotated clockwise about every 20 seconds and with each rotation, all lights appeared to converge with the northern-most light. It was like a laser show, except there were no visible light beams. The lights were only white, and the pattern of motion was unvaried. I tried to spot the source through my binoculars, but could not see through the clouds. There was no sound. I scanned Possession Sound for boats but could see none. I went outside and checked many times, but the lights and the activity remained the same until 9:30 PM (21:30). At that time, the lights were further north at aproximately 45 degrees above the horizon. They were dimmer and appeared more distant. At 10:00 (22:00) the lights had disappeared.

The objects were close together and faded after about 6 seconds.While myself and 3 friends where hunting for racoons one night between the towns of Big Cane and Plaucheville LA. we saw a series of lights. They traveled from the east to the west and looked to be very low.  The first light was about as bright as the landing lights on a commercial plane.  The second light followed close behind and was green in color and waving up and down like it was being pulled by the first.  It left as short green stream behind it.  The third light was simply a white light about half as bright as the first and following the green light. They decended at about a 20 degree angle and faded after about 6 seconds.  I heard a swoosh sound after they passed in front.  This may have been the wind.  The flight path looked like a small plane decending for a landing if one was standing at the end of a runway and about 50 yards to either side of it.  I was facing north at the time so I would have been to the south of the lights. I would like to know what these were.  Do meteorites leave green trails? I did not hear an impact, and the area was woods surrounded by corn fields.  It may have been flares. but the decent angle was wrong.

I looked out my window to the backyard and saw this, I guess cigar shaped object hovering over the Petroglyphs.  I went out the door to get a better look.  My first thought that it was a blimp, due to the fact that I was from Los Angeles and they were seen many times in the skies there.  The object had colorful lights, which was not in step with the airplanes or helicopter lights.  The object was just hovering, and then it struck me, THERE WAS NO SOUND COMING FROM THIS OBJECT.  I was still on the phone with my friend and was telling her all about what I was seeing.  I started getting concerned and moved back into my home as I have two small boys.  I continued to watch this object and when it started to finally move, it moved very slowly and then it went away in a flash.  I called the police and asked them if Kirtland AFB was testing some prototype and they said they had no knowledge.  Meanwhile, my friend was still on the phone.

I&apos;ll preface the above statement by the fact I live near a military airbase and see many aircraft daily. However, this &quot;aircraft&quot; was not flying and/or adhering to any of the air traffic patterns or speeds I was accustomed to.  I will also add that the pattern of lights (they were white)I mentioned, which seemingly defined the object(s) leading edge, did not blink or even appear to twinkle due to any atmospheric distortion (it was a very clear night though). Furthermore, I never heard a sound.

In fact, I only came across this site trying to find some information for a friend who is interested in UFOs.

They were traveling in a capsuale sitting vertical position as they moved from east to west. They evetually disappeared into the western horizon. Nothing Real dramatic in there apperance or movement other than they were moving very fast, and they were defintely not airplanes.First I saw one capsuale shaped object. It was silver color, like when the sun shines on an airplane. It was traveling from east to west. What really caught my attention was that this capsuale shaped object was traveling east to west with this capsuale shape positioned verticle. I was walking to my vehicle where my friend was waiting, still watching as I walked to my vehicle. My friend and I proceeded to watch and have a discussion about this object, and the possibilities of what it might be when I got in my vehicle. Meanwhile it had traveled closer to the horizon. Suddenly there where two more of same objects that are eyes had now been drawn too. They were almost at the edege of the horizon. They were traveling even with each other side by side. They were also traveling east to west like the first one. Which was sitll traveling in same direction towards the other 2 in the western horizin. They were all traveling very fast .What we both saw next Immediately Eliminated alot of the possibilities of what we thought these objects might be. It was another capsuale shaped object dropping straight down into our atmosphere. The reason I can say this with confidence is that it was sparking, and it was red hot in color. It appeared to then just stop moveing momentarilly. It cooled quickly as I saw it change color from this red hot look to the silver color like the other three. Once it changed to this silver color it started moving east to west in same direction as the other 3 objects. Same speed very fast in a straight east to west direction. We watched them all move straight from the east into the western horizon untill we lost site of all four as they dissapeared into horizin. I am a Tool and die maker. My friend is a printer.

Proceeded NNE until I guessed it to be somewhere near I-40 at which point it appeared to stop and remain motionless for about five seconds and then darted to the west at a high speed, stopped again, then disappeared.I don&apos;t know the exact date but it was the night the Bulls won the NBA championship in 1997. The game just had gone off at 11:00p Central time and I was laying down. At 11:05p my dad came into my room and said, &quot;Ryan, get up! You have to see this!&quot; I went running outside thinking I would finally get to see a tornado because it was storming that night and the wind was really high. But as I stepped onto the porch everything was really calm. I said, &quot;What is it?&quot; He said, &quot;Look!&quot;. I looked to my right which was SSE. There was a clump of trees about 40 or 50 feet tall and through the branches I could see two lights. The lights appeared to be relatively close and about the size of dimes. As I kept on watching these two lights came directly over the trees heading NNE...right at me. As it came across my field of view it was moving really slowly. I realized that it wasn&apos;t making any kind of sound at all. From the corner of the deck the object was in front of us maybe as far away as the highway(about 100 yards) and maybe only 75-100 feet in the air. REALLY low and REALLY close not to be making any noise. The object appeared to be short and fat. It continued on its current heading until it reached what I figured to be almost to the interstate(I-40). There it stopped. Stayed motionless for at least 5 seconds, then darted to the west, stopped for another second or two. Then disappeared. The whole time we could see the lights. Even as it traveled away from us. Dad called the Sherriff&apos;s Dept. and asked if anyone else had reported seeing anything like that. The person told him that a guy in New Middleton had called just before we did and told the same story. New Middleton is right off the interstate about 6 miles from where we live.", "I saw a black craft floating in the air, no noise or anything.  When I got out of my car to see what was going on, it left.I was on my way back from delivering a pizza, when I saw a quick flash of light.  I looked out the window because I thought that a plane might have been going down.  I saw two lights about 250 yards away in the sky.  I got out of my car to see what they were.  I still don&apos;t know what it was, but it was triangle shaped object with two bright lights towards the front.  It just hovered there, moving slowly forward (towards me).  I was struck with fear, but I couldn&apos;t seem to take my eyes off of it.  It seemed to be a black or very dark blue color.  It got within 175 to 150 yards away from me and then it was gone, it went straight up, moving so fast it just seemed to vanish.  I don&apos;t know if it was the object or what, but that was the only time I remember any noise, it sounded like a whoosh.  The whole thing lasted about 90 seconds.  I know there are two airforce bases close by, or were then.  I didn&apos;t know if it was a new kind of plane or something until it took off.  I called Williams AFB and they said they had no planes flying in that area, and the man on the phone all but laughed when I told him what I saw.  He said that I was making it up, and I should call someone else. I was 22 at the time, married with a daughter, I lived about 10 miles southeast from the location.  I haven&apos;t seen anything else close to that before or since the event happend.

From the way it was going on and off, we thought it was someone walking through the trees with a flashlight. Then the light became steady and started rising into the sky. It then began moving quickly to the North-East. Suddenly it stopped as if it had hit a wall. It remained motionless for about two seconds then the light changed to orange remaining motionless for about two more seconds then resumed the same course at a very high rate of speed. After a short time the light changed to red and the object appeared to double in speed. Within a few seconds it was out of sight.

A neighbor also saw the object. the light would go off for about 15 secs. and then come back on for about 30 secs. There was no sound  and not even the slightest breeze. 6 or 7 other people in our neighborhood related that they had observed it above our home.

The Petaluma Argus Courier Newspaper came out with the event the next day with my name.  I was ridiculed for years. Several months later I received a call from a Control Tower Operator in Oakland who would not tell me his name but verified what I saw was viewed on RADAR at the Center.The objects ere circular in shape and the sun reflected off the material. I and my two class mates were working in a venitian blind company just outside of town when the event occurred.  We were all in our teens. Subsequently I had observed other phenomena througout the years. My girlfriend (eventually my wife) were parked on a hill overlooking the Burbank Airport one summer night in around March of 1956.  A cirlular object floated over our heads and just sat there.  We were sitting in a convertible and just looked up and saw a huge cirlular object with several lights underneath.  It hovered there for about 20 minutes.  Planes were landing overhead above the object.  Eventually it sped off over the Burbank mountains. Soon after marriage driving from Burbank to our new home in Orange, California at about 2 am in the morning, we were tracked by a bright green ball type object that followed us over the organe groves until we reached out home. Then next day the papers were full of sightings over El Toro Marine base near by. Several years later while living in Villa Park, California (near Orange,CA.) I was awakened after midnight with what sounded like rocks on the roof. Then there was a brilliant white/blue light that came from our Patio and lit up our room.  I ran outside to the Patio and the light was not there. I looked up and saw an object in the Western sky that appeard to retract a bright light from beneath (like airplane landing lights) and up into the object.  It then sped off towards the ocean.  The next night I saw a bright light streak across the sky from North to South. Subsequently I was approached by a person outside of Reno, Nevada and had several years of education regarding UFO&apos;s. I met with Linda Moulton Howe in Oceanside, California about 5 or 6 years ago.  I related the story to her.  We communicated for a while and then lost contact.  Professor Hynek and his assistant was also in contact with me regarding this &apos;person&apos;.  But when I sent a tape recording to Hynek and the audio was completely erased including the emulsion, Hynek thought it best to cut off communications with me.  That was the last time I heard from him.  The year was about 1975 when I leved in Villa Park, CA. The original tape from the interview also dissapeared from my safe.  I decided to just forget the whole thing.", "light moving east to westAround 2150, 14Jan99, I was watching aircraft in their approach pattern to SeaTac International Airport.  The approach was from the north to the south.  I was watching a Boeing 737 on final when I saw a traffic signal green in color light directly over head.  The conditions were, light s/w winds, overcast sky.  The approaching aircraft were below the cloud base.  The light apeared to either be in the clouds or was bright enough to shine thru them (as a car head light would shine thru fog). The light was about the size of a pencil eraser and had difussed light around it about twice it&apos;s size.  I first observed the light at about 90 degrees above me and watched until about 30 degres to my front. The light was traveling on a 270 degree (west/true not magnetic) compass reading. The light did not fade out it just went out like a light would go out if you turned off a switch.", "I saw a light going across a field after dusk.

The light in the sky that we observed was oval in shape and silvery-blue in color.  The object was very high in the sky and appeared to be about the size of a dime held at arm&apos;s length.  It traveled much faster than an airplane or jet and traveled across the sky from South to North and out of sight in a matter of about 7 seconds.

The lights were coming over a mountain, to the north of my house, that is used for hang gliding. That was my first thought, a hang glider strung with lights.  But the lights were bright enough to show that they were not attached to a hang glider frame. A friend was coming to my house the same time I was leaving, so I pointed the lights out to him.  On my way to the store, I noticed my neighbers outside also watching the lights.  I stopped to talk to them about it, and we all came to the conclusion that what we were seeing was a UFO. The object didn&apos;t emit any sound, and flew from north to south.  I first noticed it above Shaw Butte Mountain (15th Ave. and Cholla) and last saw it around 13th Ave. and Mercer Lane.

As she watched it she noticed that it did not appear to be moving.  Then it suddenly shot straight up.  When she came in we were all skeptical so we went out with her to see what she was talking about.  After watching it for a while we all agreed that it could not be a normal aircraft as we know them.  We got out some binoculars and studied the object thru them.  It appeared like a prism with somewhat of a diamond shape but all you could see were the twinkling colors that changed like a kalidescope of purple, yellow, orange, green, red and blue((NUFORC Note:  We have no explanation for the sudden movement of the object reported, but the &quot;kaleidascope&quot; of colors is consistent with a &quot;twinkling star.&quot;))", "Looking out window of house and saw a massive object descending in a straight path to earth near the horizon in the far distance.Outside the window of my apartment, I sighted at 07:15, 12-9-98, a bright, shimmering, orange colored massive object(1)descending at a moderately fast controlled rate on a straight path to earth. Hard to judge size and speed because of distance (about 100-150 miles south of Humboldt County California) but very massive size moving at a high speed judging from distance.

Looked like a planet or very large star (about 8 stars together) at first but with binoculars sighted a tear drop shape(&quot;U&quot;) with hole in center descending at the speed that of a jet plane would in the distance or even faster. Before sighting, there were 5 jet planes going towards the location where the object was descending which directed my attention to that area. There were 2 more jets following the other five after I sighted the object (7 jets all together going on same route towards object within 10 min.) Object disappeared behind tree line and so did 5 jets except for the 2 which were still visible but then dissapeared behind tree line also. The sun was not quite over the hills yet, but the 7 jet streams were all pink and the sky was very clear with no clouds. The temperature was about 45 degrees F. outside. The moon was in its last quarter stage but nowhere close to the horizon. I was wide awake and had been up for about an hour and had a very restful sleep.

((name deleted))", "I awoke in a to a ball of white light in my hotel room in Long Beach, the object came towards me and I ran into the bathroom. The next day in the SeaTac airport I saw a strange skinned blond man looking at me.It was two years ago when I had my first private contact with biengs who I believe are very likely extraterestrials. It happened during a time in which I was descovering non-religious spirituality as a new way of thinking and living.  I was eighteen years old at the time.  The event took place while I was sleeping in a hotel room in Long Beach during winter break.  At approx. 3:00a.m. I felt something or someone awaken me. I awoke to see a brilliant white ball of light floating anD &quot;dancing&quot; outside the room balcony sliding door. It was about the size of a large grapefruit and moved through the closed sliding glass door. It came into the room and I had a strange intuitive feeling that this lightwas here to see me.  It moved towards the second bed and then to my  bed which was farthest from the balcony.  It came right up near my face (approx. 5inches away)as I sat in bed. I was not afraid but was worried that it might harm me so I ran to the bathroom and shut the door.  I stayed in there for about 20 min. and then I returned to bed and the light was already gone.The next day when my father and I returned home to Seattle in the evening I had another strange encounter at Sea-Tac airport. As I walked off the plane down the hall to the baggage claim ther is a mural on one of the walls of magicians doing magic tricks.  I had a strange feeling that someone was standing there waiting for me, so I looked at the several people standing against this wall.  I saw a young white male dressed in army fatigues who had unusually clear and radiant skin.  My initial reaction was that he was a manequin because his  skin looked like that of a porcelaine doll or plastic-like. He looked to be in his twenties and had non-U.S. fatigues. He was a bit over six feet tall maybe 6&apos;3&quot;.  He was waering a green beret and he had reddish-blond hair.  He had a very pleasent expression on his face, he looked happy as he looked at the blank wall across from him and then at me. Another thing he was doing was standing in the &quot;at ease&quot; position! .  I stopped for a short time to look at him. He stood in this position the entire timeand I left so that I would not get lost finding my father who was ahead of me.  I wondered if I should have went up to him but I wasn&apos;t sure so I didn&apos;t.  The thing that stuck me about him was his serene, happy expression. Usually total strangers do not behave in such a way and do not stand totally still with good posture. A few months later I happened to hear of a woman in Australia who had encountered blondish aliens dressed in army fatigues.  I also heard of another case in which a woman had telepathic communications with a blond alien who visited her in the form of a ball of light while she was in a hotel room during a U.F.O convention. Finding this out after the encounter made me think that this person might have been an alien.  Since then I have often felt that I am in telepathic comunication with some beings.  I notice that the more focused on spirituality I become the more these things happen to me. Recently on March 13, 1999 Iawoke to another ball of light in my bed room.  It was a bit bigger than the other one and it chenged colors from, white to lavender, to orange, to green, to yellow. It left my room through the window after about 15min.  Also when I am afraid to fly I feel as if someone takes all of the fear away and I know it is not me doing it. Unfortunately I do not have any photographs or video as I was unable to get to a camera of some kind. However, I could draw pictures of the events.", "((NUFORC Note:  This event occurred at the same time that a missile was launched over the Pacific Ocean.  In subsequent communications, the observer stated that he believes that what he and the other witness observed was not a missile launch.  However, it is the feeling that what the individual describes here is indistiguishable from the known missile launch.))Classic very bright to golden-orange fireballOn February 23, 1999, at 2:30 A.M., my friend Brenda and I were driving on the 10 freeway heading west towards Los Angeles, just east of the 215 freeway (see map of Pamona, California) when we noticed at approximately 8-12,000 feet at approximately 60-75 degrees above the horizon looking through the front windshield, a very bright golden orange fireball traveling from what appeared to be the North East heading in a South Westerly direction.  The very bright fireball appeared about as large as the end of one of my index finger. I was amazed because this supposed fireball or shooting star was moving very slowly and the tail was equally as bright at the circular shape of the object as it was bright at the very tip of the tail.  The tail was so finely pointed, as though it were as sharp as the tip of a needle.  The flared trail was clear and bright and did not flicker or have a smoke trail like a comet or shooting star does.  We both watched this in astonishment moving at what seemd like about the speed of a car on the freeway (70 MPH) although it was difficult to read speed.  This was very slow compared to a shooting star.  After about 20 seconds or so, the flared tail and the very bright golden-orange light cut out, as though a rocket or thruster engine was turned off.  Now the object appeared round or diamond shaped (and had the appearance of a solid structure) and had a few very small lights (2-3) on and coasted in a straight line in the same direction for about another minute or so before we lost sight of it on the horizon and behind a mountain. There were a number of airplanes in the sky not far from the object which must have seen it.  Because there were airplanes with their flashing lights on, you could clearly distinguish the vast difference in light and character of this extremely bright fireball/craft and an airplane. The airplane lights were not even comparable to the clear brightness of this fireball/craft.  There were a few drivers/cars on the road which we thought must have also seen the objec! t which was so striking in the night city sky.Additional information about my sighting.This is in addition to the report I just made.  I just received an e-mail from ((Name deleted))I, NASA&apos;s Head of Astrochemistry. While the orange fireball my friend Brenda and I saw moved across the sky for a minute or so, I estimated that it was traveling at a speed similar to our car (70 mph).  When you look at this letter from NASA, it is clear that meteors travel much faster than 70 mph.  It reads: &quot;Most meteors travel in prograde orbits near the ecliptic plane (this is up to + or - 23 degrees from the equator, depending on the season).  This means that any meteors that you see from outside earth should travel roughly parallel paths; most meteors have velocities greater than 20 km/s - some travel slower, most travel faster.  20 km/sec comes to 72,000 km per hour. As you can see, what I saw was traveling much slower than 72,000 kilometers per hour.  How then could it have been a meteor?", "Corrections Officer brother and sister have seperate events. I saw the triange 18 years ago!Dear Peter Davenport, One evening between Nov. 1981 and Feb. 1982 at around 8 PM., I was driving home from work, northeast on route 94 in Vernon, NJ towards home in Warwick, NY. I saw what I thought was a 747 ahead of me to my left. It had a red and a green and a white light. I paid it little attention. As I proceeded, I saw a huge solid triangular craft through the bare trees in the sky not far above the tree line. The triangle was traveling way too slow to stay up in the sky; I&rsquo;d say about 20 M.P.H. As the craft came closer (it approached at a position of about ten o&rsquo;clock) each of its three corners were now illuminated with only one white light. I rolled down my window to listen because it should have been deafeningly loud at that point. As it passed overhead, I could not believe my ears - it was completely silent and there were no lights anymore, just a dark triangular shape. I had never seen anything so massive. As big as a football field was how I explained the triangle&rsquo;s size to the police. The body was darker than the night sky behind it although I could not make out the craft itself. Immediately to my right was the steep incline of mountains. The craft rapidly accelerated in an upwards motion in order to clear the mountain range and lifted in a manner that I have never seen any aircraft maneuver - sort of like when you make your bed with someone and raise the sheet by all four corners quickly, then air gets trapped under it and it sort of floats down slower. My engine was still running, so I sped home where I immediately called the Vernon New Jersey Police Department. I gave them my story and asked how many others had called in, but to my amazement, he said no one else had called at that time. I never took UFOs seriously before. For years I kept this incident to myself because I had no explanation and I felt terribly alone and confused. Now, after reading Dr. J. Allen Hyneck&rsquo;s NIGHT SIEGE and hearing your reports on Art Bell, I know that others have seen exactly what I had seen 18 years ago. What I found out recently, was that in 1985, my brother had also seen a UFO. I asked him to write down his experience for me. Here it is: March/April, 1985, 8-10PM Main Building, Housing Unit 9-2, Fishkill Corrections Facility, Beacon, NY As I worked one night in Housing Unit 9-2, which is a dorm-style ward, an inmate approached me at my desk and told me to look out the window facing one of the facility&rsquo;s exercise yards. The window was open except for the bars. Directly over the yard and approximately 100-150 yards in the air I saw what appeared to be a circle of bright white lights which illuminated the yard below. As I watched for nearly 3-5 minutes, the circle of lights remained motionless and completely void of any noise. Eventually, the circle of lights began to move slowly over the unit in a northerly direction. It was then that I went into the hallway outside of the unit and watched there from one of the windows as the circle of lights moved slowly towards and eventually over Interstate 84. During this time trucks and cars traveling on Interstate 84 either slowed to a crawl or stopped altogether to watch as the lights passed overhead. When the other C.O.s and I questioned our supervisors about this, we were informed that what we saw was a group of planes out of Stewart Air Force Base flying in close formation.", "Fast point of light (no tail) decending rapidly towards the earth at a down angle of ~45 degrees of 45 degreesIt&apos;s 8:53 pm CST, traveling north on Interstate 45 just before the exit for FM 1488 (road), My spouse and I observed a point of light @ NNW enter our field of vision available from within the car (top of the windshield). The object rapidly decended from a approx 8000 ft to below the treetops in a perfect (not parabalic) line 45 degrees downward, appearing to head NE.  The object maintained its albeit small (point of light) shape for the duration of observation.  The light was white, it had no visible tail, no sparks, suggesting it wasn&apos;t a meteor.  Distance to object is uncertain due to small size of light.", "Red light seen in the eastern sky with a likeness of of a laser pointer. It hovered, made a bobbing motion and then faded away.I was standing in my back yard, I was facing east. The Light seemed to hover for a few moments, it made a bobbing motion, and it flared in and out couple of times. It faded in to a small light, about the size of a very distant aircraft navigational light, and appeared to leave at very high rate of speed to the north east.", "Saw two &quot;hovering&quot; objects in the sky that had different colored lights on them.At about 8:00p.m. on Mon. Jan. 4, 1999, my husband and I were returning home from the grocery store.  Just as we were about to pull into the driveway, I asked him to stop and look at a &quot;star&quot; that seemed to be flashing.  Once he had stopped the car, we could tell that the object wasn&apos;t flashing, but were lights that were changing colors.  We got our binoculars (we had just sold our telescope), and could see a circular object with four different lights on it: blue, green, red, and either orange or yellow.  Thinking that our friends may have a telescope, we called them to say we were coming over.  On our way over, my husband asked me to keep my eye on the objects, and that is when I noticed another one.  It was the same distance up in the sky, but seemed to be farther away because it was not as brilliant.  They were probably a mile or two apart.  When we got to our friend&apos;s house they came outside to look and saw exactly the same thing.  The brightest of the objects was slightly below the &quot;little dipper&quot; and lined up with one side of it.  The objects were not flying, but maybe hovering.  It was hard to tell because of the distance.  We all watched them for a while and went inside because it was cold.  We checked on them periodically throughout the night and they never moved, even though the &quot;little dipper&quot; did because of the Earth&apos;s rotation.  The next morning, Icould faintly see one of them, but it was much harder to see the lights because of the sunlight.  Later that afternoon, they were both gone.  The witnesses included myself, a college student on the Dean&apos;s List, my husband, a drafting instructor at a college, and our friend&apos;s who are a housewife and a computer programmer.  I also noticed a plane (not a commercial jet) fly very close to the brightest object about 30 minutes after I first spotted it.", "It was 11:33 PM on Wednesday 12/16/98 on our way home from Miami to Marathon Florida.  At about 89 mile marker,my wife said : Do you see that? She was looking out the very right side of the windshield. When she first saw the object it was very white and very bright. It was not as brilliant when i first saw it in the middle of the windshield. At first I thought it to be an airplane in trouble with it landing lights on , but what was troubling is that it looked like the lights were reflecting in a cloud or fog. It seemed to be coming more towards us,then started moving across our windshield to the left. A tractor trailer has stopped at the side of road and I pulled up ahead.I turned off teh engine and got out to see if we could hear engines,we heard nothing. It kept on going and it looked like it separated into at least 8 to 10 small white lights going in the same direction. My first thought was formation aircraft,then everything went dark over the ocean.I might add that it was very large and would think it was at an allitude of about 1 to 3 thoudsand feet. The dirction of travel was from northwest to southeast and then northeast when it disappeared. The night was clear cool, stars were out about 62 degrees. I will try to illustrate and mail to you a drawing of what we saw.", "The ufo appeared as a falling star except that it was falling more straight down instead of arching across the sky. It was blue W/Blue tail.appearing to the west starting about 60 degrees above the horizon before it diapeared  befor hitting the horizion.Later in the night at 02:10 I witnessed another ufo falling  from the sky. this time it was white w/ white tail. It was approx. 15 degrees further to the north from the last sighting. As this fire ball was falling, it made an arch in it&apos;s trigectory. A slight bend in its line if travel as it neared the horizion line. It disapeared before hitting the horizion. Four minutes later at 02:14 Dec 14, 1998 I saw a third falling fireball. it was white W/ white tail. It was falling at about 280 degrees. it too disapeared before hitting the horizion line. It fell in a straight line. and also appeared in the night sky at about 60 degrees to the horizion. these fireball appeared to be falling as I have stated through out this report. Most falling stars that I have witnessed arched all across the sky. These appeared to be droping more than falling stars. (meteorite&apos;s) The night sky was partly cloudy. But stars could be seen clearly.((NUFORC NOTE:  Sightings correspond to Geminid Meteor Shower of this date.))", "Shaped like an old fashioned oil derick-about 100 feet tall-stationary-made of pure light.  We watched it,along with two or three other cars, for about 15 minutes.  It was about 50 feet above the 50 foot trees along the river.  Made of pure ultra blue light, it went out like a light switch had been used.  It sat on the ground and there was no noise or movement.  The area along the river is still there with nothing there, although a lot of the trees are gone now.We were learning to play a card game and was on our way home from Parker Heights (outside of Yakima) and came around the bend in the road and I said to my then husband, what to he-- is that?  I don&apos;t remember seeing anything there.  It was very tall-I always thought about 100 feet.  It was made of pure light and was a color of ultra blue that I still have not seen since.  There was two, mabey three cars stopped with us, looking at it.  We goet out of the car and stood by the guard rail and just watched it.  We were parked on the oposite side of the road and the light emmitting from it lite up the night.  I havn&apos;t talked to my ex husban for over 30 years and have never talked to him about this since.  I got busy raising my two children, basicly alone, and kind of put it in the back of my mind.  I am now 58 years old and have thought about it very often for a long time.  I know there are others out there who saw it too.  I would very much like to contact them.  The first question below asks about lights &apos;on&apos; the object--this was made of pure light.", "A possible jet contrail ot other.At approx. 18:45 hrs, Feb 10, 1999. A co-worker and I noticed what appeared as a jet contrail in the Western Sky of Tucson.  The contrail was heading Sout-Southeast at a great rate of speed.  The sun was setting at this time which added extra light to the high objects contrail.  The craft itself could not be seen.  At first we thought it was a normal jet.  The contrail disappered after about the first 30seconds of viewing, then reappeared with the craft still in the same direction.  Within 1 min of viewing the object made a sudden turn and headed West, leaving a shrp U shape in the sky.  What was strnge about this was the abnormal speed. I have not seen Airliners fly this fast, so our initial thought was a fighter jet of sorts.   When the craft was heading West a small but noitcable puff of smoke or some turbulance affected the contrail leaving a bulge or bubble in its path.  The craft appeard to pick up speed and disappered into the horizon.  Again this might have been a normal airplane of types at supersonic speed.  The sunset though allowed for some spectaculer viewing. I am not a believer in so called &quot;extra terrestrisalas&quot; but I am sending this report as to see if any one else saw the object.  I do wish to stay anonimous((NUFORC:  This report, in several respects, seems to us to not be inconsistent with a contrail pattern that might be left by a military fighter aircraft.))", "Red/Orange fire ball, Baseball size with sparks, smoke, and trail.While driving in my truck going east on I - 76, directly in front of me appeared a rapidly moving red/orange fire ball. It was traveling in a south south westerly direction. It apeared to be baseball size, with a long tail, and it was emmiting a lot of sparks. It was very bright making a smoke trail visible.It was taveling at about a 30 degree angle.I dismissed it as the most spectacular meteor that I have ever seen , untill hearing a lot of people were seeing the same thing on the west coast, on the Art Bell show you were a gust on in mid Dec.", "&gt;     We saw three large lights in the sky----from West Elkton, moving &gt;towards Northern Road, heading for Hamilton.  My son and I both saw them. &gt;They had flashing lights (red, green and white), which seemed to pulse. Two &gt;of the lights seemed to dance with each other, and headed off.  The larger &gt;of the lights left behind, stayed stationary for 10 minutes, with lights &gt;pulsing around the middle.  Looking through binoculars the object was hazy. &gt;Then this light moved off in the same direction as the other two.  A faint &gt;hum was noticed.  Time: 8:22 p.m. Jan. 25, 1999. &gt;", "A Shiny (metalic) sphere was seen, by me, above a ridge. It was slowly moving away from my position at an altitude of apr. 500ft. The Sphere instantly vanished or moved faster than i could see.I was on a houseboat on Lake Navajo in New Mexico, June 15, 1998. At about 11:00am the weather was partly cloudy and very windy from the NW. I was watching an eagle soar over a ridge about 800 ft away. That is when i saw a shiny, silver, metalic object (perfectly round). It was slowly moving to my left and away, in a N to NE direction (against the wind!).I could tell it was moving because it was just over a ridge and i was stationary, the houseboat was moored. The object appeared close, about 1/8 to 1/4 mile, because it was in front of cloud formations. I watched the sphere for about 10 seconds. It was shiny on top and shaded below just the way a ball would be illuminated from an overhead sun. It also appeared to be spinning. Suddenly it vanished, so quickly as to give the illusion of imploding to nothing. If it moved, it moved to quick to see. As a side note: On our drive from Albuquerque to Navajo Lake my wife saw a simular ball but only for a couple of seconds. She too said it vanished quickly. I am including my artist rendering of the scene that day.", "a light appeared in the sky then slowly dissipated into nothing... exact same shape appears approx 2 mins. later and does the same thingAround 17:45, while watching the Broncos beat the Dolphins, I looked out the window to see a stationary light in the sky rapidly shuffling, not so much as blinking, red, blue and white lights.  It stayed motionless for around 2 minutes, then started to move from east to the south, and quickly dissapeared.  Approx. 2-3 minutes later, the same object appeared again, and agian in the same place, and in almost the same fashion, except within a shorter timespan, moved the the south and &quot;collapsed into itself,&quot; as my father put it.", "Moon shaped, reddish-orange sphere (sligtly obscurred by clouds) object quickly descended into the ocean water in the horizon in front of my windows.At 0112 hrs, on the 1/25/1999, my wife called me into our bedroom with windows (WEST) overlooking the Pacific Ocean.   She was excited at seeing a beautiful object which she thought was a moon.  I looked out and immediately noticed a reddish-orange glowing roundish object on the horizon.  I scrambled to put on my glasses.  We noticed that the object was very far and with its size about 50% larger than the sun when it sets down.  The object was slightly obscured (maybe it was its shape) by the clouds.  It was also quickly moving down into the water.  By the time I found my binoculars and a camera the object was 40% into the water/horizon.   It soon dispeared into the horizon.  The whole experience took about 3-5 minutes.   My wife claimed to have seen the aicraft extinguished its lights as it went over the affected area through her binoculars --- I can&apos;t verify that. We also noticed a great number of lights blinking on the ocean horizon, approximately 10-25 miles.  These lights were all evenly spaced between each other, covering most of the horizon visible from our window.  The lights were all white with the exception of the two lights, one green and one red, between which the object disappeared.   These lights were also the closest between each other.   In all there were approximately 8-9 lights  -- to me it seemed that some Navy or something sealed the area of possible activity/landing. This activity seemed unusual to me.  The lights were active as we went to bed 2 hours later. I am college educated and well read.  This is a first UFO experience for both of us.  The next day, at 1645hrs, I called US coast guard in San Francisco to inquire about possible Navy activity, other reports, etc. -- there were none.  Nothing close to my description was logged by anyone.", "3 lights appeared, manuevering rapidly and at impossible flight angles, changing formation until winking out after little more than a minute.The objects were lights at a high altitude (est. 6,000 ft.)  They moved in formations which regularly changed, though they were clearly together.  They were first observed by this writer; I was 19 at the time, working full time while living at my parents&apos; home.  Observing the phenomena with me that night was my girlfriend, age 20, and a family friend, a man in his late 20&apos;s. I have reported this information by e-mail to your director&apos;s office.

The yard faces east and we are located on the Los Angeles/Orange County border just a few miles west of the 57 Freeway. I was looking up at the sky enjoying how clear it was and how many stars I could see... As I looked towards the Big Dipper, just below the last star of of &quot;handle&quot; and falling at a 45 degree angle towards the middle star of the handle, I saw what appeared to be a regular &quot;shooting star&quot; but rather than the whitish appearance I have usually seen, this was a brilliant blue/green color. It was also at least 2 to 3 times bigger and brighter than the brightest stars, yet it seemed pretty &quot;normal&quot; till that point. Then rather than burn out or fade out, it seemed to explode out and for a brief moment get even larger. My first thought was, &quot;It must have entered the atmosphere there.&quot; But what struck me as strange was that the center appeared &quot;darker&quot; than the sky at the moment of &quot;explosion&quot; and this darker area grew larger as the brilliance around it spread out. As the light around the dark hole began to fade, I thought that was the end of it. But then I saw the strangest streak of light, same color as the fireball, begin at appoximately the same place where the fireball first appeared and following the same path. What was strange was that the streak of light did not &quot;behave&quot; as others I have seen. First, it seemed to be separate and distinct from the fireball that preceeded it instead of the tail of the fireball. Second, rather than have the tail end begin to fade as the front end moves, this streak maintained its brilliance until the front end reached the &quot;dark hole&quot; that was still faintly visible. (If I hold my hand out and use my fingers to measure how long the streak appeared, it was two and a half to three inches long.) Then, even stranger, rather than fade away, it appeared to remain stationary for a moment before it ap! peared to accelerate and dissapear INTO this dark hole. Again, it did not dissapear as I have seen before, with the tail end fading first but rather the front end fading at the location of the &quot;hole&quot; and the rest of the streak following. I have never seen anything quite like this before, nor have I ever seen anything that out of the usual. I am 45 yrs old, married to the same man for almost 20 years, have 2 teenage sons. Although I am a full time mom, prior to my having children, I was trained as a professional proof-reader and worked for several years at this for Los Angeles County. So I am used to noticing what is &quot;wrong&quot; or out of the ordinary. This was certainly &quot;out of the ordinary&quot;.", "We saw approx. 12 comet-like objects moving from the SW to the NE. They were in a ununiformed formation, &amp; all had massive comet-like tails.On 12/16/98 2 friends and I were fishing on Long Key, Florida.  We were fishing from a bayside dock, and at approx. 11:30pm we witnessed a phenomenal event.  Out of the corner of my eye I saw the sky light up, when I turned my head I thought I was seeing things.  I immediately got my friends attention and we all stared in amazement.  There seemed to be approx. 12 objects moving from the southwest (Keywest area) towards the northeast.  Each one of the objects had a comet-like trail behind them, this trail made them all seem to blend together into one bright blob.  They were in a disorganized formation and they moved at a constant and straight forward path.  They looked to be a yellowish-white coloration similar to that of a bright star.  They took up a very large portion of the sky.  We watched them for approx. 30 seconds.  We first saw them half-way through the sky and watched them fade out over the horizon.  Each of the objects appeared to be round or comet like in shape.  From our vantage point they seemed to be much larger than stars, planes or even the Hailey&apos;s Comet. Considering that only a few hours earlier we started bombing Irag, our first thought was that it was a large group of missiles.  They moved much slower than a shooting star or meteor, however, they moved faster than a typical airplane or helicopter.  After witnessing the event the three of us starting driving home.  We saw a car stopped on the side of the road about a 1/4 of a mile from where we witnessed the event.  We stopped to ask if they needed help.  They said that they were fine, and asked us if we had seen the lights in the sky.  We were thrilled that someone else had seen the lights.  As we were talking about the lights, their road-side assistance pulled up.  The driver of the road-side assistance was estatic, he too saw the lights.  The driver told us he watched the lights for over a minute (from one side of the sky to the other).  As we were driving home we wondered how many others had seen this event tonight.", "On approach to downtown atlanta via automobile (traveling east on I-20) I noticed what I thought was a military helicopter or transport (twin engines) experiencing engine trouble (1:00 high).  An unusual large black cloud had been exahausted from engines (and twirled by the aircrafts prop wash) and continued as a trail of black smoke was following the copter (traveling south slightly east of hartsfield airport).  Thinking that the aircraft was in trouble I has some interest in watching it.  The sun was coming up and illuminated both the copter and exhaust trail.  I then noticed a small (egg) object at what appeared to be a very high altitude (1:00 very high). I thought it was probably a jet flying directly over Atlanta and catching the sun, but it was unusual because it did not have the usual contrail and was traveling south very fast (same direction as aircraft but at what appeared to be a much higher altitude). The object was reflecting the sun like a mirror.  The object disappeared for a second and then reappeared (or I saw a second similar object) traveling east (12:00 high) at a high rate of speed.  The object zoomed east and out of sight in less than a few seconds.Time is an estimate +- a few minutes.  Sunrise was just starting.  Objects appeared to be very very high.  Aircraft was thumbnail size and appeared to be very high for a cargo type helicopter. Egg shaped object was about one quarter of thumbnail size (very small).  *If* the object had not moved so fast and *if* the object had a contrail, I would have thought it was a military jet traveling at such altitude you could only see the sun reflecting of the aircraft.  BUT, this object was small and FAST.", "noticed a flash of light while driving looked up and saw nothing then a few seconds later a saw the a bright ball of light travelling at a high speedafter I saw the flash I didnt think much becaus I figured it could be a reflection off of my dash in my car or something I then traveled about 500 hundred feet up the road and spotted it to the left of the car traveling incredibly fast it way very yellow color.. I then watched it desend behind a large hill about 300 hundred yars away.. I contined to look for it when I got to the other side of the hill but it was not there... I have seen other things and I know many other must have seen this it way just off of highway 101.

It resembled a moon probe I once saw in a maganize many years ago. Having legs, at least two.  It was dark in the center and light arround its edges.Was rentesent about making these reports because their were so many others, including peter Davenport wiewing these.  It occured to me he and many others may have not seen this one.  Obbviously many of us saw the 9:30 pm site ing which was much clearer.  None the less consider that it two may be importent for study.", "((NUFORC:  Address indicated by author, 30FE99, is illogical.))Approximately 500ft. in the air, just below a low cloud line, I saw a small grey spherical object hovering.  It would be best described as looking like a soccerball with flat sides.On 2/30/99, at 6:00p.m. I was driving my car and coming up to a stop sign.  Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed something dark grey in the sky.  (It was an overcast sky with about a 500ft. ceiling.)  At first I thought it was a bird or an airplane but when I took a second look, I realized it was niether of those possibilities.  I live a stone&apos;s throw away from Wright-Patterson AFB so I thought it may have been a weather balloon or possibly a kite or kids helium baloon.  I don&apos;t think it was any of these because it was not moving or rotating.  I was close enough to it to see that it was approximately 3ft. in diameter, spherical, with flat sides (not shiny).  It looked like something you would see on Star Wars used as a probe.  I studied it for about 30 seconds before someone pulled up behind me waiting to turn.  I headed east to get a better look.  I could see it through the tree lines and was anxiously driving to a clear spot.  When I arrived at an open clearing, about 3 blocks away and 1 minute later, it was gone. The day was overcast with little wind.  It was also raining a bit and had been doing so for most of the day.  This would discount the possibility of it being a kite unless we have the second coming of Ben Franklin.  There was also no thunderstorm activity in the area.  Secondly, it was not a balloon because the slight breeze would have moved it.  The clouds were moving around it but it was dead still. I did not hear any noise either. I was also close enough (500ft.) to see that it had two cylindrical objects sticking out of the side, side by side (almost looking like a nose).  I would say they were about the size of pop cans.  I did chase up and down the streets loking for a kid or someone in the rain reeling in a kite but found noone.", "((This is the third of several of these experiences, all of which I now feel are connected. If visitors to this site have any questions I&apos;ll be glad to answer if I can. If anyone has any further information or explanation on them I&apos;d appreciate a reply. I&apos;ve copied these experiences from a past journal.))My husband and I took abother day trip out to the mountains just 10 minutes from the Canadian border...this time we&apos;d brought along a video camera, tho it was running low on juice. Leter that afternoon, we ended up crossing the beautiful and scenic Lake Sullivan to Pend Orielle motel,  ~ a two floor building with maybe 8 to 10 rooms per floor, possibly a couple more. It&apos;s a small place tho. He went and got a room for us and we went in to relax and chill out for the night. Our room had been on the upstairs end, facing the water. Other homes surrounded its banks around the left side. We ate, had showers, then relaxed zoning on tv. Somewhere around 10:30 (the news had just ended), I glanced outside thru the balcony doors and noticed a big bright light in the sky. I thought little of it and absently assumed it had been a jet heading our way and would soon fly over. I didn&apos;t consider Venus or anything because it was entirely too big and too low, and had definite cloud cover behind it. (After Moses Lake, that was something I learned to look for!) Awhile later, closer to midnight, I happened to glance out again and noticed the light was still there. It hadn&apos;t moved. Curious, I went outside onto the balcony to have a better look. It was low in the sky and hovered soundlessly over the water. It was a bright white light and round, did not move. It was too high to have been a shore light, which were all a yellowish color, and too big and low for a planet. It clearly wasn&apos;t a plane, jet, or chopper. It hadn&apos;t moved in several hours. Almost 6 in all that I&apos;d watched it. It came to me to videotape it so I grabbed the camera and was able to capture it on film for maybe 60-70 seconds before the battery died. I kept an eye on it until nearly 4am before I finally slept. I didn&apos;t see it the next morning when we left. Later that evening when we were home and I checked the tape, it zipped thru pretty fast and it was hard to make out what  it might have been. Fortunately I was able to capture the shoreline and lights for reference as I panned upward to the light in the sky. On the tape the light is white...dark skies, cloudy, and faint star points vague in the background. Because it zipped thru too quickly, I decided to run it on slow mo and was pretty stunned at the discovery. I&apos;m no expert on lights so can&apos;t say for certain if lights do this...however NONE of the house and shore lights did this at all; they remained steady. The light in the sky would completely disappear off the screen for several frames and return for several, disappear again...and return, for the duration of the segment. At regular speed it&apos;s steady and &quot;on&quot;, as are the shore and house lights. At slow mo speed, only the light in the sky disappears for several frames, &quot;off&quot;, and on again. Also, the stars vague in the background do not disappear either. I have no idea. I still have the tape. I&apos;ve wanted to have it analized for awhile but was afraid to make a copy in case it didn&apos;t do it on a copy, but was also unwilling to let go of the original because I might never see it again.

It crossed in front of Orion and I caught it in my binoculars. Moved in a sweeping arc from SW to NESame as above, I was alone with my binoculars checking out the Orion Nebula when something flashed in my vision. I looked up to see the object make a sweeping curve. It was a dull orange slightly glowing color. The best way I can describe it is if someone was flashing an image on some clouds, except it was a perfectly cloudless night. As it was going away I caught it in my binoculars and verified that it was not a plane or any other object that I knew of. It was shaped like the planet Saturn, except it was flattened, meaning that it bulged in the middle. Then it was gone. It made no sound.

A smaller object, which resembled an airplane, was &quot;following&quot; the triangular shaped object and was darting back and forth at the rear of the object (I think it was a military aircraft).  My father is an aircraft mechanic and FAA inspector.  I have grown up around airplanes and have a better than average knowledge of aircraft (both military and civilian) and have never seen anything like this object.  A few days after viewing this object, I had the opportunity to speak with the gentlemen who manned the radar station at Cambria/San Simeon.  I told him what I saw and asked if he had seen these objects on his radar screen that evening, but he said nothing at all had shown up on his radar screen that night.", "The craft was black with a stealth like figure.Me and my brother were in the backyard of our house when we saw a flock of geese fly by.

It appeared rounded on the bottom and distorted from the intense light around the top.  The object stopped at an altitude 1500-2000 feet, (I guess). As the object seem to hover the light began to stabilize and slowly decreased in intensity as it settle into what looked like a star.  At this point it moved off to the southwest. I lost sight of it as it moved behind the trees. I am not sure but after it moved away as a star in appearance it may have just vanished.  Not sure because I was looking through the trees at this point.Whitish ball blue tint.  Very intense but did not appear to cast any light on tree&apos;s. It did reflect off my glasses. That&apos;s what caught my attention to it. Two other hunter within 100 yards saw nothing. They had more obstructions around them. The bottom was rounded. This I could tell by the glow of the light. The top was hard to make out due to sparkling light and had no definite shape. The object dropped very fast. When it came to a stop it was very sudden, it was immediate. It hovered for about 4-5 seconds. The light was jumping outward like sheets waving in the wind. Then the light appeared to pull back into itself until it looked like a star.  A very small blue/white star which then slowly moved away and I am not sure but i think it just vanished. I felt like this object was very close.

Then it looked like the shots you see in the movies, of a craft or asteroid entering the atmosphere, there was a shield of light, fire or something in the front of this object and then it disappeared like it had burned up on entry.

It looked as broad as a thumb at arms length and left a bright fan-shaped tail. He said he also saw another bright object and when the first object went over the horizon, he turned the camera on the second.

It was early evening, and as I watched him turn a lap I noticed what I first thought to be a KC-135 heading to the north over the typical Mac Dill AFB runway path.

No noise.A friend of mine left my house at approx. 11:10 pm heading west on Herndon Ave.  It being a clear night, he looked out his windshield to see the stars. There weren&apos;t any. It was then that he noticed a large isosceles triangle shape directly above him. The object was about as big as a football field and had completely blocked out his view of the stars.  There were 3 white lights on the underside, one at each corner. The rest of it was dark.  It was flying (or floating) very close to the ground, approx. 100 ft. above him.  He said it seemed close enough to hit with a rock.  He pulled his car off to the right shoulder of the road and turned off the engine and radio.  He leaned out the window and looked up to watch the object.  There was no noise.  He couldn&apos;t see how thick the craft was. It hovered silently for a few seconds, slowly rotated to its right, then proceeded to slowly move towards the southwest.  Suddenly, it shot upwards and away at an angle with lightning speed going in the same direction.  He noticed a sulfer-like smell in the air after it left. There were no cars on that section of the  road at the time of his sighting.  He immediately drove back to my house and banged on my bedroom window.  Thinking he had forgotten his keys or had car trouble, I rushed to open the front door.  He looked me right in the eyes and said, &quot;I just saw a UFO!&quot;  He was visibly very shaken up.  I went out outside into my driveway with him and he explained what he&apos;d seen.  I looked in the direction of his sighting but could see nothing.  A few weeks later, we were watching an episode of &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot; that dealt with the UFOs sighted in Belgium.  They showed a picture of a large triangular craft with 3 lights on the underside, and he told me that was something like what he&apos;d seen, but without the red light in the center.  We decided not to report the sighting until now because he was too shaken up by it at that time. I&apos;ve known him for quite a long time and I have no reason not to believe him.", "Heard you on Art Bell Via Broadcast.Com Archives on Saturday morning 1-9-99 from the broadcast the night before. When I heard you playing the sighting description from the night before in Northern California I had an instant recall from the night before(FRI EVE). While not actually seeing anything, at about the time or earlier that the reportee was witnessing the event, I was made gradually aware of a very peculiar whirling/humming/vibrational sound. It came up on me slowly, was presant for about 20 seconds and gradually left. I was busy at my computer and opted not to get up and look. Now I regret that decision as perhaps I would have shared in a very interesting sight.", "I looked out the window and I saw this saucer shaped thing.

It had no running lights but a few dim lights along the leading edge. It was more delta shaped as opposed to a triangle. No noise, no running lights and fast for its size. It was real big. I first thought it was a commercial craft in trouble. But I heard nothing so far in local news.I was out smoking during the Dish feed of X files. I normally scan horizon for air craft since we are close to the air port. The cloud cover was broken and at medium height. There was a wind and sure was cold. It had snowed that morning. I looked to the east where normally lights from the mountain can be seen and aircraft turn for one of the approaches to Las Vegas. This craft was moving below cloud cover at this point and upon clearing the mountain made a immediate bank to the left which is south. This got my attention. It has big and I could not have missed it. There were lights on the leading edge but not running lights. These were dim like seeing interior house lights at a distance. The lights of the city reflected off the bottom of the craft. It was big and it was moving fast. I called to my wife who was in the kitchen to come out and see this. There are a few houses blocking the view in that direction so we waited for it to come out. It appeared to have gained altitude and was right below the clouds now and dimly the outline could be seen. The outline was white like a cloud moving fast or like a high speed aircraft which causes condensation when cutting through the air doing abrupt manuvers. The craft continued to the south and west then went out of sight.

There was broken cloudcover, and the lights would appear and disappear through the cloud cover.Initial observation was looking out over the ocean (east)from a hotel balcony which limited the overall field of vision. One light passed north to south in a straight line.  I assumed it was a meteor.  Then another light passed south to north within seconds and made a series of minor turns.  I don&apos;t believe that meteors follow curved paths.  My friend then came out and also observed a few of the lights many of which would disappear from our view overhead.  We went down to the beach and found the embers from a camp fire.  I assumed that we had seen flying embers though I didn&apos;t understand how they could have come from very different directions nor how they could seem to disappear through clouds implying some height.  We covered the fire with sand and saw 2 more of the lights. I am an engineer and the other observer an insurance professional.  We have both been amateur astronomers. My perception was that the objects were quite small.  There paths reminded my of wind born objects yet they traveled in very different directions; no two followed the same path.  There apparent origin points would also cover a wide expanse. The apparent brightness of the objects was minimal; no brighter than the stars in Orion&apos;s belt.

Took out my binoculars(10x50 - 341ft.at 1000 yds.) to look at the sunset and saw silouettes of aircraft coming into DFW Airport -- approximately 10 miles to the southwest. All aircraft have very identifiable fuselage and lights. Suddenly, I spotted a light at about 3 degrees above the horizon between two long cloud banks in the west. It remained stationary for about 5 minutes as silouettes of small craft an large airliners past in front of it. I could not see it with the naked eyes. It slowly began to drift to the north then rose at a 45 degree angle for another 5 minutes. It would drift through the clouds only slightly dimming. There were three distinct thin cloud bands with clear sky in between. It appeared to be a luminous soft light that would suddenly brighten and get larger with a shimmering effect. This would last about 2-3 seconds and then it would get smaller and at times disappear for a second. Most of the time it was smaller and white having a redish or bluish luminescence sweep over it. When it was brighter and larger the colors would be more obvious. It appeared as if it were floating -- wobbling a bit and shifting to the north then back to the south faster than when it rose. After about ten minutes, it had risen to about 4 degrees above horizon. I then spotted another one just like it above it and to the north at about 5 degrees above the horizon. This one appeared to be brighter or closer. I looked back for first light and it had disappeared. The second light was stationary and &quot;luminescing&quot; in the same manner getting brighter and dimmer for 5 minutes and then it began to descend very slowly at at 45 degree angle toward the south. I spotted the second one at about 18:32 and watched it descend to the horizon until 18:49. My guess is that it was probably 15+ miles away which would put it around Argyle or further west? I frequently watch the sunset out at the lake and have seen similar light before in November of 1998. They! are in no way similar to airliner headlights or helicopter lights. I noted both Venus and Jupiter as they appeared (after the lights appeared) and they were not twinkling or glowing with colors due to atmosphere - bright and white. The thin clouds were all to the west -- the rest of the sky was clear.", "Huge craft with lights moving slowly about 20-30 feet off the ground", "I was on my pourch talking to my neighbor latr at nite.I looked up in the sky across the power lines about 1000 feet up and i saw a small orange light. as i looked the light came closer at a speed of light and the object just grew instantly to a huge oval object. and sat there. my neighbor saw it and screamed. and ran inside.On the night of 6/21/98,at approximately 2330hrs.,I was sitting on my front pourch with my neighbor smoking a cigarette. I was looking in the sky off and on while we were talking and I noticed a bright orange square. It was very high in the sky but bright. As I watched it, all of a sudden it came forward at the speed of light and stopped. when it stopped,the lights shut off. The object was black. It was about 300 to 400 yards long and 5 to 10 stories tall.At this point I was very amazed at what i was looking at.I did not tell my neighbor about at first. everything that I have described so far I witnessed.As the object just sat there huvering in the sky above, it stayed dark for about 30 seconds,then solid bright orange lights turned on. on the side of the object. the were the size of a huge hollywood light. There were about 25 of them across the side of the object that was facing us.At this point i turned to my neighbor and said&quot;Oh my God&quot;, and she said, &quot;whats wrong&quot;, I said don&apos;t freak out but look up!As my neighbor looked up in the sky, she saw this huge oval shaped object with the orange lights on around it. then the lights started to blink in a rotating pattern, different lights at different times causing a strobe effect. my neighbor was scared at this point and ran in my house terrified.The object started to move slowly upward in the sky and then all of a sudden it just dashed away at the speed of light.

It changed locations several times, moving at the speed that would be expected of a helicopter, hovering over several different ridges.  After between 5 and 10 minutes, it suddenly shot away at an incredible speed, impossible for an airplane.  The next day, unknown to the other witnesses, several people came into the local country store and asked if others had seen the object, describing it in exactly the same manner. This has been going on intermittenly in this area for years, but no one likes to talk about it.  There have also been numerous cattle mutilations, the most recent reported one occurring about a year or so ago.  It was reported on the radio news as a crime, describing the bowels and eyes of the cattle appearing to be cut out surgically with a knife!!!  Locals say it was just coyotes.  This is a very rural, conservative area, and most people out here would never admit to a stranger that they might have seen a UFO. Witnesses are farmers, factory workers, and laborers.  The common explanation is that it must be secret government testing of aircraft. Over the years, the lights have appeared many times, usually hovering over ridges, sometimes appearing to land and then take off.  I am not aware of anyone saying they have witnessed any aliens or having been abducted, but I will admit here that I have had marks appear on my inner elbow that look just like where I have had a blood test (i.e., needle mark).  I have never used IV drugs and I hate needles.  Also, shortly after I moved out here to the country, I began having excrutiating joint pain, for which I was tested for lyme disease. All tests were negative, and no explanation was found.  After a couple of months of this, I had a feeling (please don&apos;t think I&apos;m crazy) that something was in the skin between by left thumb and index finger.  I got a needle and dug out an object that looked something like a poppy seed, but not exactly.  I studied it but couldn&apos;t figure out what it was, so I threw it away.  I have never had those type of joint pains since that day.  I never thought much about it until the last couple of weeks when I have been reading when I have been reading about alien abductions.  I have no counscious memory of anything like that, but I do have a just-beneath-the-surface memory of &quot;something&quot; terrible and frightening happening, and I think I know when and where it happened (1975, Murfreesboro, TN).  The almost-memories are brought back by certain chemical smells (like poison) or some types of music.  I don&apos;t know what to make of any of it.", "I saw 2 glowing balls move slowly across the sky at high altitude.In the morning around 8:30 AM of Jan 12, a Sunday, I saw a small glowing ball (gold? white?)move across the sky very high up in the air. Then another (popped on?)about 3 inches behind it. It was not an airplane because I did not see wings. It could have been a satellite though it was curious that there would be two satellites fairly close together. It could also have been balloons, but they seemed to move in a very straight line and I would think balloons would move more randomly.

Boulder City is in the east-west flight path for McCarran Airport in Las Vegas.  Many planes fly over every day and night.  I&apos;ve been out in the night before and never do these flights ever really stop.  This night, I was watching stars and planes through binoculars.  I put the binocs down as the news came on the radio.  I noticed there were no planes overhead at that moment.  Then, while looking straight up (at Casseiopia, slightly to the back of me) I saw what looked like a V-shaped constellation, but it was moving. It was absolutely silent (while every plane can be heard in the still night air), it seemed about as big as my fist held straight up, and was headed due south.  Lake Mead lies directly north of where I live.  By the time I got my binocs up to look closer, I just barely located the craft before it disappeared over the top of my house and I never did get a good close-up look at it.  Within just a few minutes, the regular flight traffic reappeared.  Could this have been a Stealth craft?", "5 points of light, quite distant, looked to be playing,having fun.Thought to be a cluster of five stars soon changed after about five seconds.

So fluenlty infact,,they&apos;re movement looked like they were acting as one, trying to create 3D looking shapes.

Thats what convinced me they were trying to make us see...shapes....simple 3D shapes...these lights had pilot&apos;s inside....they had supreme intellingence and total understanding of they&apos;re whereabouts in space, and they&apos;re positions apart from each other within the cluster. They were performing arial stunts..like birds mating...UNBELIEVABLE!! To describe how far away they were......If you look into a clear night sky...you can always see what looks to be sattelites whizing across the sky....they only go in one direction..either left to right or right to left...these lights were the same distance away from me...they were far away...but very close at the same time, almost too close....... I watched them as if I was watching kids play in a playground...It looked a a science fiction movie, or a java-applet..on your computer....I didn&apos;t want them to go..they did....they just moved on...peacefully. With-out a doubt..in my mind......I am 110 percent positive..this was nothing made from human technology. I&apos;m a smart person...I have perfect eye sight.....I would laugh in anybody&apos;s face, that told me I was seeing an illusion.

Sun behind high clouds, grey/yellow in color, and bright. Saw other bright area approx. 50 degrees to the south. not as bright as sun, but for moment I thought it was the sun.

On this date, (not sure of exact date) I was momentarily confused by the location of the sun.  I observed it as I came over a hill and began a slow curve to the west.  I believed it should have been more to the north, and as I came out of the curve I realized it was.  The other bright area was to the south of the sun. The sun was behind a high band of cloud, the sky otherwise clear pale blue in color as is normal here this time of year in afternoon. I looked from the sun to the other bright area.  I have never seen this before.  I appeared as if the sun were being reflected off something.  As I watched, the clouds appeared to part in a circular pattern which also seemed curious as I had not seen that before either...I do watch the skys. After about four minutes I noted a very bright object come below the clouds and travel slowly to the south. This appeared to be very far away.  The object was very bright as if the sun were reflecting off of it.  My first thought was aircraft, but it did not appear to have wings and was moving very slowly. At work, about two minutes later, I pointed the bright area out to a co-worker, but from our location the sun was below the trees and only the other bright area could be seen.  It was quickly fading as we watched.  The object was also gone.", "WITNESSED WHAT APPEARED TO A GREEN BALL OF LIGHT, FROM TRUCK.

Unfortunate because I understand a lady may have seen what I heard on the same night--tape played on Art Bell Sunday night.  She was one ridge to the west in Paradise.

Accompanying this round fireball, was a long white tail that was emitting sparks, like a fourth of July sparkler, and dropping dark unknown debris.  It was observed to be at a very low altitude.  I observed this object for approximately one and one half minutes, before it just disappeared before my eyes.  It left no trace of it&apos;s presence behind.  I am quite sure of the date, as my son&apos;s birthday was to be the next day, November 12th.  I am also sure of the time as I am scheduled to work at 8:oo P.M.

We were...well, making good time and I had looked at the clock on the dashboard and it read 10:22pm. My partner and I were discussing our trip when he said holy... you know... and I looked out the windshield. Above the cross over an over pass some distance back was a bright light with a light green outer ring. We figured it might have been an aircraft or a light on a tower, till it dropped straight down with out an arc, with increasing speed so fast that it looked like someone had taken a picture at night and moved the camera while the film was being exposed, giving it a solid line of light because it fell that fast. Then it did a 90 degree turn like it was a giant log ride and shot out at the horizon. Disappearing from sight. I looked at the clock on the dash after seeing it and it read 11:38 pm. I don&apos;t completely believe in this stuff, but after seeing that object fall and speed off, I can&apos;t think of anything it could&apos;ve been. Nothing, that I know of short of a TOW missle, can arc in a 90 degree turn at that rate of decent without tearing itself to pieces. A TOW missle would have had a fire trail, instead of a white light with green outer ring. Then there is the matter of losing our time. Abducted, I don&apos;t know and don&apos;t think such a thing can or normally occurs, but we lost almost 45 minutes of time. The driver had been checking the time to gauge the trip back throught the whole trip and to keep from getting tickets. So what was it?? And what happened to the 45 minutes??", "Heavy sound of helicopter(s) shaking house.  Went out back. Could not see source of noise.  Coming closer.

No flashing lights on craft or copter(s).  All lights were very dim.  V shape was difficult to make out but was very big.  The last light of the evening was visible on the northwest horizon.  Craft headed southeast.My age is 53.  I am sober (or thought I was after witnessing this thing).  One of my enjoyments is looking up at the sky day or night and watching aircraft going over.  This was NOT the usual.  I am still shaken by it.", "Tourquois-green fireball drop straight down from a cloud layer and hover a few seconds.  Next made a bee line to our car, then shot straight up. Awesome color as it shot skyward.I heard Peter Davenport on Art Bell mention that he would like people to report their UFO sightings, even if they are in the distant past.  My incident occurred in the summer of 1978, sometime in August.  My father was a pilot on many occassions flew the family to California to visit relatives.  We returned to the Pendleton airport and were on the way home when the indident occurred.  It happened approximately half way between Pendleton and Athena in the state of Oregon.  I was only eight at the time, and as a child could never sleep in the car.  The car we owned at the time was an Audi, which had a shelf-like dash behind the rear seat.  I often used the shelf as a rest as I looked out of the rear window to view what we had passed.  That night was no different, and I rested my elbows on the shelf and looked out the window.  The sky was overcast, as evident by the lights Pendleton reflecting off the low clouds, but the ceiling was relatively high due to the fact that the red warning light was visible on a tower located on Cabbage Hill.  The object in question was seen soon after turning around in the back seat to look rearward.  Before the object was actually seen, a pulsating glow was first observed through the clouds that appeared greenish in color.  A few seconds after noticing the change in cloud color a turquoise-green ball of light appeared as it dropped from the cloud ceiling.  It hovered exactly half the distance between the cloud ceiling and the ground, just to the left of the towers on Cabbage Hill.  The object emitted enough light to reveal the trees and grasses around it.  The object remained hovering for several more seconds, and the best way to describe its action was as if it was looking for something.  Our car was the only car on the road for as far as the eye can see, and it didn&apos;t take long for the object to pick something out.  In a flash the object was streaking directly toward us, and it took no more than two or three seconds to traverse the distance that seperated us from it.  I was unable issue a warning partly because I was frightened and partly due to the rapidity of the entire event. I thought that the object was going to hit us, when it shot straight up and disappeared into the clouds.  I feel that it is important to emphasize that the at no time that the object moved was there any type of arcing trajectory or slow graceful movements.  All movement and change in direction was rapid, quick, and at angles I know could not be made by conventional aircraft.  When the object shot straight up into the sky the entire interior of the car and the surrounding area turned a brilliant turquoise colored, no other color could be seen.  It was as if everything had faded to turquoise. Everyone else in the car was asleep, except for my father who was driving, and did not witness the incident.  My father only withnessed the aftermath of the object&apos;s departure as the world around us turned that brilliant color.  Events immediately after the sighting is fuzzy, and I am not sure if my father pulled over, or continued to drive, but I then told him what I saw.  sometime later he contacted one of his buddies in the Airforce that had some knowledge of certain aircraft and asked him if he knew of any experimental aircraft that looked like, and could move like the object I had described; he said no.  Rumor has it that the object harrassed a nearby airplane and then was seen near Mcnary dam on the Columbia river.  Although the event lasted no more than ten seconds, the memory and detail is embedded in my brain as if it happened yesterday. I know that this event happened quite a long time ago, but I figure that it is better late then never when reporting the incident.  I&apos;m sure your organization can use this information to establish a timeline regarding this type of object.  I didn&apos;t report this incident not because I was afraid of being branded a kook or a weirdo, but rather because it happened so long ago.  I am also aware that many of the sightings are associated with natural or man made aircraft.  This object was in no way, shape, or form a conventional aircraft.  I have also been told that what I had seen was St. Elmo&apos;s Fire or ball lightening.  I&apos;ve seen St. Elmo&apos;s Fire associated with the numerous types of aircraft I have flown in while in the army, and I have seen the beautifully graceful movements of ball lightening while in Panama, again while in the army.  There is no way that the actions and speed of the object that I saw could be described by either of these types of natural phenomenon.  I thank you for your time and appolagize for the age of this report.", "Saw a red dot in the sky, which then appeared to change shape and streak away.A friend and I were going out for the night.  We had just backed out of his driveway when we noticed what appeared to be a red circle in the eastern sky.  Just about a second or two after we spotted it, it streaked off to the south or southeast.  We aren&apos;t quit sure if it changed to an oval shape before it took off or if it just appeared that way to us because it was moving so fast.  It all happened so quick it&apos;s very hard to tell.", "Green round glowing fireball with short glowing tail, fell slowly from below cloud cover to very near ground level, viewed at distance.I am 40 years old, have been driving for a living most of my life.  Novice amateur astronomer.  Have seen few very strange things in the sky but always keep an eye out. Driving north on Indiana Highway 10 into Demotte, Indiana, stopped at a stopsign, I observed a glowing green teardrop-shaped &quot;meteor&quot; or &quot;fireball&quot; for approximately five seconds. Light snow had fallen a few hours earlier and the sky was still mostly cloudy. The glowing object appeared below the cloud layer a degree or two west of north and, falling at approximately 30-40 degrees from vertical towards the west, fell slowly for about 5 seconds and disappeared in place, not fully obscured at any time. There is a line of telephone poles 10&apos;-12&apos; to my left.  Three strands of tinsel are strung tightly between the poles with, perhaps, a 2&quot;-3&quot; sag at the center.  Three strands of tinsel approx 18&quot; apart from each other, the highest strand at about 13&apos; from the ground and horizontal.  The object fell below the level of the highest strand and disappeared before it&apos;s short tail was bisected lengthwise by the middle strand, from my perspective at about 4 feet off the level ground (in my car). The complete length of the object, from the perspective, was about a third the distance between the strands of tinsel. I expected the object to hit the ground;  it did not.  It did not change direction, velocity, intensity color, shape or size.  The core glowed more brightly than the glowing &quot;aura&quot; and tail.  There was no trail.

At first they were under a low cloud [3,000 feet] making them very easy to see, then they moved on a Westerly direction away from the cloud and we were able to follow them clearly even with the stars on the background. At this point we stopped the car, turned the lights off and got out to get a better view of this weird sight that last for about 5 minutes. What we noticed was a constant size with the increase of altitude, we lost the sight because the brightness and color went less and less. The location was the city of Lihue on the island of Kauai, Hawaii and the lights were SouthWest from us, moving on a Westerly direction.

No one questioned this as a hoax, because the circles were so large and precise, the earth so altered, and the farmer so unsophisticated and trusted by his neighbors.This event was covered by the Whitewood Herald and the Esterhazy newspaper.

While driving down a fairly busy street(now 4 lanes), a friend and I (both 17) noticed a very large black boomerang shaped object rapidly approaching. At first, we both thought it was a plane about to crash, but then it just stopped in mid air and hovered less than 100 ft. over a house, giving off a low humming sound. My friend was driving, and it scared us so badly she just stopped her car right in the middle of the street.  We were so scared that we could not speak or move, we just sat there staring at this huge object with approx. 8 lights around its bottom perimeter.  I just kept wondering why there was not anybody else on that street at that time, there was usually more traffic. It seemed like everything just stopped and stood still.  It then took off at an incredibly high speed until it disappeared in the Northern sky. Since we were only two blocks from my parent&apos;s house, we drove over there and ran inside crying because we were so scared. My mother called the local radio station to see if there were any other reports, but we were the only ones who reported it.

They serpentined in a slow path, that appeared about 100 feet overhead.  No noise, and when they were directly overhead, they turned 90 degrees straight up and were out of sight in about 5 seconds.This event was observed while in the Navy, stationed on Midway Island.  I was with a group of men getting ready to go on watch, when a group of seven lights, were observed coming from the airfield control tower, towards our group.  The lights were moving very slowly.  We were able to call the tower and ask if they observed the same.  The answer was yes.  We asked if any weather ballons had been released.  The answer-no.  We then watched the lights come closer, in a serpentine formation, one following the other.  The lights were a red and orange blend, similar in color and shape to a &quot;fat&quot; oval shaped chinese lattern.  There was no noise.  Our group of about 8 men were waiting to go on watch.

Object was two to three times the size of the aircraft and left no contrail.I am a truck driver for a large freight company. I drive mostly at night, But at times, get delayed and do not finish my route until late in the morning. On the morning of 1/29/99 while en-route to Santa Maria, Ca from Bakersfield, Ca. on Hwy. 166 just west of Maricopa approx. 3 to 4 miles. Hwy. 166 west of Maricopa turns into a long steep grade which drops the speed of loaded semi trucks down to a crawl. The reduced speed gives me a great opportunity to gaze at the beauty of the San Jaquin Valley below. It also gives me the chance to watch the commercial airlines fly into &amp; out of the Los Angeles area over the mountain range to the south of Hwy. 166. The temperature of the morning of 1/29/99 was down in the mid to low thirties. The aircraft that would fly north over the Grapevine would leave long, thick contrails as they entered the San Jaquin Valley. After listening to Art Bell&apos;s discussion a few nights earlier about aircraft leaving strange contrails is what drew my attention to these aircraft and there contrails. As I was watching one airplane and it&apos;s contrail I noticed an object just to the left rear of the contrail and the aircraft. It appeared to be about two to three times larger than the size of the commercial airliner. It also seemed to be at the same altitude. This object was unlike any thing I ever seen before. Being bit of a skeptic on UFO&apos;s I at first dismissed it as another plane. But then, This object in a matter of a few seconds darted over to a plane that was headed north and followed it for about a minute or two. This got my curiosity up, So at the first turn out I pulled over and got out my binoculars and started watching this object. It would follow one plane for two to three minutes. Then, In a matter of seconds, It would zoom across the sky and start following another airplane. It always stayed just to the rear and left of the plane and it&apos;s contrail. The odd thing about this object was that it appeared to be transparent at times, Then solid. The shape of this object would be like! if you put two coffee cup saucers together. One upside down from the other. On top this object had a small dome like shape, But with sharp angles. On the bottom, It had a smaller, More rounded dome shape that ran almost the length of the object. The object had a grey,silver color to it. No lights nor windows were visible any where on this object. Nor were there any type of numbers, letter&apos;s or any other identifying marks visible. The other odd thing about this object was the fact that every airplane that flew in the San Jaquin Valley area left a contrail.

We both saw the object while we were some distance, out of sight from each other. We could see a dark gray or black triangle, or wedge line moving in a southwest direction.  The rest of the craft was much harder to see.  It seemed that the object may have been reflecting the clouds above it.

Second object, same as first -- but moving due South. Elapsed time, 8 minutes.I am a 34 year old Technical Writer, employed by a defense contractor at Edwards Air Force Base, California.  I served one tour of duty in the U.S. Marine Corps as a field artillery, fire-direction controlman.  I have spent a total of 10 years on or around military bases. 03/04/1999, 1900: Sighting occurred while driving Westbound on Avenue J, in the vicinity of 5th Street East, Lancaster, California.  The sky was full dark, clear with no clouds.  This road is two-lane, mostly open desert with very little light.  As the sighting continued, I entered the outskirts of Lancaster &ndash; a more urban environment. If my direction of travel is thought of as &ldquo;12 o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; the object was at 11 o&rsquo;clock, approximately 50 &ndash;60 degrees above the horizon.  I do not know how long the object may have been there, as I just noticed it out of the corner of my eye.  Its speed was approximately that of jetliner &ndash; perhaps 500 mph.  Its direction of travel was from the Southwest to the Southeast.  The size of the object was the length and thickness of my thumb, held at arm&rsquo;s length &ndash; approximately two inches by &frac34; of an inch.  The object was &frac12; to &frac34; as bright as a full moon, if obscured by light cloud cover.  By this I mean it was bright -- white, but with something of a haze about it.  The edges were sharply defined and its overall shape was of a &ldquo;picture-perfect&rdquo; comet &ndash; with forked tail.  I will send a hand drawing by snail-mail if you would like. After 30 seconds (approx.) the forked end of the tail began to spread out until a leaf-shaped &ldquo;cloud&rdquo; had taken shape.  Note, the head and part of the tail remained sharply defined and attached to this &ldquo;cloud.&rdquo;  The &ldquo;cloud&rdquo; was thick (no stars shown through), white and somewhat luminous from either internal or reflected light.  Looking at the &ldquo;leaf shaped&rdquo; &ldquo;contrail&rdquo; with peripheral vision, I could make out a round mass within its center &ndash; seemingly of the same cloud-like material.  This center mass, though barely discernable, remained long after the object and &ldquo;cloud&rdquo; disappeared. The object continued on its southeasterly course for approximately four minutes before &ldquo;disappearing.&rdquo;  One minute it was there and the next &ndash; it was gone, leaving the cloud behind for another one to two minutes. 03/04/1999, 1906: The second sighting occurred as I continued to drive on Avenue J, now within the urban area of Lancaster, California.  This object appeared to be just like the first, but oriented due South, and without the leaf-shaped &ldquo;cloud.&rdquo;  The object was lower on the horizon &ndash;perhaps 45 degrees and with a pronounced nose-down angle.  This sighting lasted approximately two minutes, before I lost sight of the object. There were two aircraft in the area of the sightings:  one, heading South at a lower altitude to the first object during the last minute or two of the sighting.  The second aircraft was at a higher altitude heading North, and observed after the second object was no longer visible. If I can be of any further assistance, do not hesitate to contact me.

I am not sure of the year or month but I think it was either spring or fall in the mid 80s. Anyway  there was a small amount of snow on the ground and we were near Jefferson Colorado.  There is a road that runs from Jefferson past Tarryall reservoir and we were camping a few miles from the lake.  It was just before sundown and my wife saw a red ball down low to the north of our camp. It was to the north east at first and it was traveling east. It came across us to the north about 1&#x5C;4 to 1&#x5C;2 mile away. it took about 5 to 10 minutes to travel by and disappear behind a mountain that was to the north east of  us. It appeared to be pretty big (100 ft dia) but it was hard to tell because of the distance it was from us. I remember thinking that I wished it would come closer so we could see it. A little while later it came around the mountain it had disappeared behind. It was coming back towards the west on the south side of camp.  This time it was only about 75 yards away!!! It was 300 feet in dia (approx) and it stopped directly to the south of us and hovered with its bottom side only about 50 feet  off of the ground.  It was bright orange about the color of metal that is 1600 degrees or so.  I know what temperatures look like from working with tool steels and furnaces.  Anyway  I&rsquo;m not saying that it was hot but that is what it looked like. It hovered there still and totally silent for what seemed to be a few minutes and then it went away from us so fast that it traveled about 35 miles in a split second and was bouncing erratically over the mountains to the south west of us.  I looked at a map and the distance is a estimate from what I saw that night. Since then I have remembered a little more about that night and I think that it was more than a few minutes that it was hovering and that we  just didn&rsquo;t realize the time.  There were four of us and we all saw the same thing  through the whole experience.  Three of us had drank a few beers but one had not ever drank any alcohol in her life. we were all in our late twenties or early thirties.

I lay very still while witnessing the light move closer and what appeared in the doorway was a very bright, iluminated sphere. I can only characterize movement as being suspended, yet bobbing about in an almost fluid motion. It came close, then raced upward and directly shot out of the window. My husband witnessed this thing, but refuses to ever dicuss it. Even denies it took place.Went to bed after a normal workday and fell asleep. An hour or so later I awoke  and noticed a light coming from another room. I instantly was aware that it could not be a light inadvertantly left on as it had a distictive illuminating glow about it. For reasons unknown to myself, i instinctively had the impression that &quot;it was coming&quot;. I lay completely still as this light became brighter as it moved closer to the bedroom door. In the doorway appeared an extremely bright illuminated spere. This thing had the color of something so bright that it was almost bluish. It remained bobbing in the doorway a short while, then moved directly over me, moved from over  my head to my feet staying up near the ceiling as it did so. It then moved directly over my abdomin and descended slowly until it was inches, I mean inches, from my stomach. It then bobbed there for thirty or forty seconds, then slowly rose to about two or three feet above me. I then realized my husband was sound asleep during all of this and tried to awaken him. I was being subtle as I was afraid that too much motion would disturb this bobbing orb above me. He finally awoke and I thought he was going to have a seizure. At the point of his gasping, this thing rose quickly raced out of the window. At this point we both jumped to the window to see where this thing went, but it was nowhere to be seen. My husband was completely shaken by this event and over time has decided it didn&apos;t happen. I, myself, have been timid about mentioning it to anyone because i do not wish to be percieved as some kind person needing psychiatric attention. I do so now because I have always been perplexed by this, but have never heard of anyone experiencing something like this. I hope that at least by reporting it now, someone with similar experiences can be assured that they are not delusional.

The only sound, was a soft humming.  Suddenly, from somewhere on the craft, a beam of light shot out and directly onto my car.1972, June. I was working the second shift in the local hospital in Sharon Ct. My mother who lived in Sharon was babysitting for my 5 month old son.  I left the hospital around 11:30, stopping at my mothers to pick my son up and her (she was coming to my home to spend the night). We left her house around 11:40pm enroute to my home in Millerton N.Y.. The night sky was very clear, staars in abundance.  A beautiful summer night.  The flashing lights of what we thought was an airplane caught our eye.  It was at a very high altitude, almost appeared that it was another star except for the colored lights, (blue, red, green)..To our horror, it started to &quot;fall&quot; from the sky at a tremendous rate of speed...I stopped my car and with my hands over my ears ( didn&apos;t want to hear the noise when it impacted against the ground)..watched as it plummeted toward us.  Then, right before our eyes, it stopped, just over the trees not 50 feet from our car. We were terrified, with my hands shaking I watched in shear fright as it hovered above the trees.  It was a saucer shape, metallic gray in color, with a dome that had what appeared to be rows of windows.  It was so close that both my mother and I could see inside.  What we saw will forever remain in my our memories!  They were not human!  Four or five beings with a grayish skin tone, and huge black eyes looked out at us.  Suddenly from somewhere on the craft a beam of brilliant, blue-white light, struck our car...this beam of light was so bright that it &quot;hurt&quot; our eyes, for about 15 seconds this light remained on my car and then suddenly it imploded back into the craft. Slowly the craft began to move directly over the car.  The only sound it made was a very soft humming.  I was absolutley terrified, my only thought at that time was to get my infant son home where we would be safe ?  I took my foot from the brake and proceeded to drive.  The craft remained at the same altitude and drifted just  about 100 feet ahead of me.  The road that I was on was a secondary road that joined with a major rt.  I intersected rt. 22 and began my 10 min. drive from there to my home.  The craft remained ahead of me at the same distance and altitude until I turned off 22 onto MaGhee Hill Rd., where I lived.  When I arrived at my house my mother and I could still the hummi! ng from the craft as it continued going north, above rt. 22.  The next day on the 12:00 news there was a brief report of &quot; a UFO &quot; sighting  in the city of Albany N.Y. about 50 miles from Millerton.  This sighting had been reported by two N.Y. state troopers !  It was seen about two hours after I had seen it.  They described the craft exactly as I did, same lights, speed, color, and &quot;it made a humming&quot; noise.  To get to Albany from Millerton one would drive north, on rt. 22.  I have always believed that this craft seen in Albany was the same one that I had seen two hours earlier as I drove home. This was my first sighting of a UFO, but it has not been the only sighting I have had.  Since that time I have had six or seven additional sightings. They have been different shapes, triangle, cigar..saucers.  There is no doubt in my mind that we are not alone here on this planet and we have not been for many thousands of years.  The technology behind the crafts I have seen, was and still is far to advanced for our world.", "I spotted what I thought was a bright landing light of a larger than usual aircraft for our airport.The time was around 7:30 PM CDT. The sighting occured at the Farmington Airport, in Farmington MO. This airport was investigated in 1974 by Dr. Harley Rutledge of Southeast Missouri University, when lights that were not aircraft, were seen by the local Stick and Rudder Club headed at the time by Mr. Ralph Pingle. As I was coming off of Highway 67 on New Perrine St., I spotted what I thought was a bright landing light of a larger than usual aircraft for this airport. As I approached the airport, I could see that whatever it was, it was not going to land. The object headed from East to West. As I watched it, the back end behind the light slowly started to extend out into a dark blue cylinder. Not believing what I was seeing, I slowed down so I could see it better through the front window of my truck. As I went past the Jaycee Park, I noticed a second object the same as and slightly below the first. I pulled over to the side of the road, to get out and look at the objects, when they both had vanished.", "Me and my boyfriend were on our way to California on I-10.

(no car to be seen)  I looked around 360 degrees 2x.  The 2nd time I saw a shooting star and a big fire ball type of object simultanously.  It seemed to be steaming, and was pulsating.  I thought I was looking at a fire at first by the color but I realized it wasnt.  I became mesmerized while staring at it and then my adrenalin started flowing.  It/they  (what ever)  calmed me down with a internalized voice I thought at the time was my own.  &quot;Go back to sleep, your cold, tired, it&apos;s just a metiorite, it&apos;s nothing , look in the morning when it&apos;s not so cold&quot;  Then I layed down, next thing I knew I was sitting up in my sleeping bag again watching this &quot;thing&quot; fading away.  In the morning I wake up feeling exhausted and very depressed and I thought it was strange that I should feel that way...I had no recollection until two days later when I was driving and looking at the colors of the sunset and I saw a meteorite...then I remembered.  I think that I remember only part of the event, and I don&apos;t know for sure the exact time or duration.It was a calm wind night, the first night I had camped all season long (windsurf season, in the gorge), that we had frost on the car.  The object didn&apos;t have a definite shape that I could make out.  My first impression was &quot;It&apos;s a forest fire&quot;  but then  I realized that there were only about four trees surrounding it and they were not burning.  I also noticed that there was absolutely no sounds at all.  Dead silence.  There appeared to be steam arising from it and it&apos;s brilliant red orange glow kind of oscillated.  The steam was blowing towards the east as it was a prevailing west wind the whole weekend. (this happened very early sunday morning.)  As I sat watching, I couldn&apos;t take my eyes off it.  The steam or smoke dissapated and no more came from the object.  It continued to glow (pulsating) and I stared for I dont know how long.  pWhen I realized it wasn&apos;t a fire my mind tried  frantically to come up with an explaination of what I was observing.  I laughed to my self at the burning trees and thought &quot;....and moses only saw burning bushes&quot;.  When I thought of the possibilities, UFO did come to my mind but not until I exhasted the most rational things I could come up with first like meteorite, or fire or ? anything!  I got really frightened and went into the fight or flight mode, when I was suddenely so calm it was as if I were drugged.  I think I was aware at the time that something outside of myself was calming me down, and that scared me even more.  Like I said before I still don&apos;t remember the whole complete thing, because there was a time when I started to lay down because I couldn&apos;t fight it anymore. (I tried!!!) and the next thing I can remember I was sitting up watching the light and it slowly ,over the period of a few minutes just got smaller and dissapeared.  The height of the glow of the light was at least 60 feet.  It was just as long and the whole glow was circular as far as I could tell.  I wasa parked aproxamately 30 feet away.  There was no noise and no smell.  There were no little green! men either.  I didn&apos;t see any kind of beings at all.  I did feel like someone was inside my mind with me.  No, I&apos;m not crazy!  I was camped with 3 other vehicles.  I was in my subaru wagon, by myself.  My friend was in his ford utility truck, right belind me a blue old toyota and our friend in his voltswagon camper van.  I eventually asked all of them about that night and if they remembered anything.  I think I was the only one to either see or at least remember.

Appeared to be about 10,000-15,000 feet with absoulutely no sound.  It was a dull yellow color that was headed towards populated areas such as Youngstown and Cleveland.

I suppose it was a grand opening of some sort.  I turned around to look at them and noticed that there were several lights inside the beam. I thought to myself that they looked like bugs swarming around a flashlight beam.  It surprised me when the spotlight left them-they were still there! Only now we could tell that the objects were far away in the sky and were moving as if in a dog fight or something. They moved quickly in all directions.  After about 40 seconds they disappeared.", "Its was a crisp clear night during the summer of 1996 and my roommate and I were sitting on the beach behind some local clubs.We had gotten off work about an hour earlier and we decided to sit on the beach and relax. We were making small talk and I was checking out the stars because we both have a fascination with the universe. I was watching a satellite hover by across the sky when I noticed a bright light like a star(but brighter) hovering back and forth. I asked her if she could see it but she couldn&apos;t quite point out where I was looking cause there were so many stars out that night.I watched it for about 30 more seconds and the light took off in a zig zag formation. After that I freaked out cause I know that satellites and planes DO NOT DO THAT!! I will never forget the experience! THEY R OUT THERE!!", "Viewed from a large open field. Two fuzzy glowing orange lights, aligned horizontally, about 45 degrees from the horizon, grew gradually larger and brighter, and merged into a single enormous trapezoid shape, at least 15-20 times the size of a full moon. Not a distinct object: It remained a fuzzy-edged bright orange light. There was no sound. Scared, I went inside. My friend claimed that the light gradually shrank and disappeared. When I went out again, maybe 10-15 minutes later, there was just a faint glow in the sky. My friend, who&apos;d lived there several years, said he&apos;d never seen or heard of anything like this. I&apos;m a professional photographer, but was too scared to photograph this phenomenon (a big regret!). I was age 23.", "Green glowing ball with an orange streak, (like vapor). Then saw a bright white ball with a triangular white glow behind it.Neighbor alerted me to a strange glowing green ball in the south western sky; it had a long orange streak from center of ball extending to the west.  Ball appeared as a large full moon but,like vapor; the orange streak was four times the width of the ball.  I thought a test misile had been detonated.  The sky around this ball was hazy as if smoke were in the air from an explosion.  We watched it fade for several minutes. I walked behind the house and saw a BRIGHT white ball with a triangular glow heading due south toward Fresno County.  It appeared as a comet, but was not burning up.  The tail on this thing was fan shaped, but not rounded at the trailing edge; it was straight edged.  I called everyone out of the house and we watched it for a couple of minutes. Several fast moving aircraft with their marker lights came into the area from the Fresno area and turned as if following a trail.  Up in the area where the ball had been,  Periodic BRIGHT flashes occured as if something was popping of strobe units for photography.  There were no marker lights visible, so if there was a helicopter hovering there, they had no running lights on.  All this took place in a fifteen minute span. Note:  My father-in-law was ((name deleted)).  Worker on the first moon lander, and a top level employee at Wright Pat, (Yes he has been in Hanger 18 and we know what was really there). I do not get excited about UFO&apos;s, but this was quite wierd so I thought I would let you check into it."]
